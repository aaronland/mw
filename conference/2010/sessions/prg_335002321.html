<p>Variously described as &#34;wonders of the cosmos&#34; (Daily Mail) and &#34;the best space porn of the year&#34; (io9), Astronomy Photographer of the Year is an annual competition and exhibition organised by the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.
</p><p>This paper will outline how we used the Flickr platform to
</p><p>reach new visitors, build a community of practice, develop an innovative standard for identifying and locating astronomy photographs( &#39;astrotagging&#39;),
</p><p>shortlist and judge competition entries, develop an on-gallery interactive showcasing all contributed photographs, and repurpose user-generated content for exhibition labels.
</p><p>According to Flickr’s developers, &#34;the integration is so seamless... you might as well consider Flickr to be their &#39;backend&#39; server.&#34; </p>
