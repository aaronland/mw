        <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
        <p class="keywords">This paper provides an assessment of the success of SimPÄ� from two perspectives: the milestones and objectives required of formal reporting and a more holistic Te katoa approach (everything). The SimPÄ� project is a multiyear collaborative project that aimed to convey and strengthen MÄ�ori culture, tikaka and knowledge using digital technology. In short, the project aimed to provide a means of telling MÄ�ori stories in 3D game format. After five years, the project has achieved this through active engagement and participation, but the final outcomes are very different from those originally conceived. The representations of landscapes are examined in detail, from one perspective as providing the film sets for stories, and again as integral to the tribal context. </p>
        <p class="keywords">Keywords: MÄ�ori, narrative, culture, indigenous, game based learning, participatory.</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This paper is a review of the recently completed SimPÄ� project. </p>
        <p>SimPÄ�, first described by Mann and Russell <em>et al. </em>(2006), was a collaborative partnership between the Otago Polytechnic and KÄ� Papatipu RÅ«naka o te tai o Araiteuru. The project aimed to convey and strengthen research aspects in regard to MÄ�ori culture, tikaka and knowledge using innovative and cutting edge technology (notes on terms given at the end of the paper). </p>
        <p>The contribution of this paper is to provide an overview of the project from two perspectives â€“ that of the start and end of the project. The beginnings are summarised from project management documents and articles (Mann and Russell <em>et al. </em>2006). Visual representations are used to provide structure for this analysis. <strong></strong></p>
        <h2>Perspectives from the Beginning</h2>
        <p>SimPÄ� is a large scale initiative: MÄ�ori Game Design, or â€œMÄ�tauraka Ä� whenua, Ä� moana, Ä� tÄ�kata ki te rorohikoâ€�. The project aims to convey and strengthen MÄ�ori culture, tikaka and knowledge by initiating a process of participatory MÄ�ori digital media design using 3D game technology.  It is intended that the project will assist in the creation of 3D game-based MÄ�ori digital content so that distinctly MÄ�ori voices, stories and cultural content can be encouraged and promoted.</p>
        <p>This development will have benefits in terms of both technology and culture and the fusion of these two: Iwi digital content. The project will achieve this through active engagement and participation. It will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>develop a process of participatory game development for MÄ�ori cultural content </li>
          <li>develop a SimPÄ� toolkit to enable 1 (above)</li>
          <li>sevelop structures for use of resultant GamePÄ�</li>
          <li>develop a new subject area and capability: that of training digital storytellers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: SimPÄ� is shorthand for the whole project; GamePÄ� refers to the developed game for each individual rÅ«naka.</p>
        <p>There are three major justifications for this project. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The risk of MÄ�ori knowledge being lost due to the reduction of hapÅ« knowledge repositories</li>
          <li>The well-publicised negative statistics of educational outcomes for MÄ�ori</li>
          <li>Consequent to (2), the lack of skilled practitioners of MÄ�ori digital content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This dual need, of content and capability, is recognised by Iwi as both a limitation and an opportunity: â€œ…communication technology is providing new avenues for our people to be enriched and contribute to our Kai Tahutanga regardless of time and locationâ€� (p17 NgÄ�i Tahu Vision for 2025, and Vision for 2025). The importance of MÄ�ori digital content is also key to the Governmentâ€™s Digital Strategy: </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">MÄ�ori culture is a vital part of what distinguishes New Zealand from the rest of the world. ICT can be used to help create the conditions for the realisation of the diverse forms of MÄ�ori potential. It is crucial for the future of MÄ�ori and of New Zealand as a whole that distinctively MÄ�ori voices are encouraged and promoted. (p9)</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">It is important for New Zealanders from all walks of life to be able to create and use their own digital content in order to create value (social, cultural, and economic) for themselves, their communities, and our nation. (p12)</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">MÄ�ori are both creators and consumers of content and distinctively MÄ�ori content is particularly visible in the areas of: broadcasting; the arts and creative industries; as well as the education, health, and business sectors including tourism. MÄ�ori digital content is important not simply for its economic potential, but also as a vital means of expressing MÄ�ori culture in today&#39;s society and into the future, strengthening MÄ�ori society and identity, telling MÄ�ori stories to other MÄ�ori, and communicating with the wider world. Hence the importance of content being created and maintained in the MÄ�ori language. (p12)</p>
        <h3>2006 Model</h3>
        <p>This project brings together two components: the stories and the computing.  By uniquely combining these aspects, a combination of benefits is made available that could not be accomplished by other means: it will</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase recognition, value and access to history and narratives of local rÅ«naka </li>
          <li>Give local rÅ«naka a unique narrative tool (one that appeals particularly to younger generations)</li>
          <li>Provide a virtual meeting place for whÄ�nau spread nationally and internationally in which they can interact in their own landscape</li>
          <li>Involve generations of MÄ�ori in gathering information and stories, encourage the preservation and creation of local MÄ�ori stories, increase the attractiveness of history to younger audiences and make MÄ�ori culture, mita (dialect) and tikaka accessible throughout the world.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Figure 1 provides an overview of the SimPÄ� process. A key component of the project will be a series of marae-based wÄ�naka. Each wÄ�naka will be kaupapa MÄ�ori and participants will be immersed in tikaka MÄ�ori. Participants will learn about the traditions, environment, people and history of that place from local RÅ«naka elders who are experts in MÄ�ori oral history and local knowledge. Using the â€œSimPÄ� Toolkitâ€�, participants will work alongside the RÅ«naka members and supervisors to create a â€œGamePÄ�â€� (a virtual environment representing a place). Based on the knowledge of RÅ«naka members, participants will define the landscape, environment, and features of cultural significance, such as food gathering sites.</p>

        <p class="caption">Fig 1: WÄ�naka process of participatory game design.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective 1:</strong> Develop and test a participatory approach to game development (Figure 1, top middle).</p>
        <p>It brings together people from within the Papatipu RÅ«naka who will jointly learn about their own place and stories, and convert this knowledge to digital form. </p>
        <p><strong>Objective 2:</strong> Develop a software tool for creating specific MÄ�ori virtual environments: the â€œSimPÄ� toolkitâ€� ~ he kohinga o ngÄ� mea rauemi (Figure 1 top left).</p>
        <p><strong>Objective 3</strong>: Develop and test tools for the use of games in teaching MÄ�ori concepts. </p>
        <p>This encompasses specific research on the effectiveness of digital game-based learning in a MÄ�ori context â€“ use of the GamePÄ� (Figure 1 middle).</p>
        <p><strong>Objective 4</strong>: Develop techniques and practices for the further use of GamePÄ� (Figure 1, lower).</p>
        <p>The resulting games will provide an interactive learning environment for use within each Papatipu RÅ«naka. It is expected that this will enhance their mÄ�tauranga MÄ�ori, enabling individuals to connect and have respect for their landscape and historical stories. Each game will be the intellectual property of each Papatipu RÅ«naka and provide an indigenous tool for future development in education and MÄ�ori business. We believe that this integrated model - using a resource that is interactive, on-line and multiplayer - will provide measurable benefits for individuals, whanau, hapÅ« and Iwi.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective 5:</strong> Develop a new specialist area in education: MÄ�ori digital content. </p>
        <p>We are developing a programme aimed at capacity building within indigenous people. By combining cultural knowledge with skills required for developing digital game-based learning resources, we hope to initiate a pathway to encourage careers in this area. This will provide career opportunities in education, information technology and business (Figure 1 right).</p>
        <p><strong>Objective 6:</strong> Develop a process of adoption of this initiative beyond the collaborating partners.</p>
        <p>This collaboration is not just between a single group of stakeholders, but involves complex structures of knowledge ownership. An important part of this initiative is the development of processes maintaining the integrity of specialist knowledge and tikanga (Figure 1, lower).</p>
        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>The SimPÄ� project was funded in 2006 by the Digital Strategy through the Department of Internal Affairs.  The project was completed in May 2009 although, as we shall see, lives on in many forms.  </p>
        <p>Figure 2 provides an overview of the process from a 2009 perspective.  </p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="mann-fig2.jpg" width="500" height="707" alt="Figure 2"/></p>
        <p class="caption"><strong>Fig 2: SimP</strong>Ä� at completion</p>
        <p><strong>Objective 1:</strong> Develop a participatory approach to game development (Figure 2 top).</p>
        <p>The objective of bringing people from within the Papatipu RÅ«naka who will jointly learn about their own place and stories, and convert this knowledge to digital form has been achieved. All RÅ«naka engaged in the process of developing digital MÄ�ori content through a series of wÄ�naka.</p>
        <p>The linear flow of the SimPÄ� development represented in Figure 1 has been very much more organic in practice. </p>
        <p>The recreation of the landscapes (the first stage on the original process) had a fundamental impact on the RÅ«naka. Without exception, the engagement at that stage was sufficient that further development (of the game environment) was unnecessary. No groups developed characters with scripted behaviour, in all; the landscape is the foundation of the story. The RÅ«naka have had some extremely interesting debates about digital representation of images. For landscapes the debates are sometimes pragmatic â€“ how to represent an area one group insists was always grassland whereas other families remember playing in the forest that once stood there. For people and stories, we need to recognise that there is rarely an objective truth. As the stories grow  older, the representation of a single image in a digital setting becomes problematic â€“ just what did this ancestor look like?  In part this was avoided by not having direct characters, but also by recognising that this is â€œourâ€� version of the story; it is quite acceptable for you to tell another version.</p>
        <p>The software and equipment participants were educated in was Adobe Premier Pro, Adobe Photoshop, Torque engine gaming software, digital equipment handicams, still cameras and data management of such equipment. However, we found that for most people the prior skill level and time needed to master the Torque software was too great for the time we had to work with them. Also, participants wanted to see quick results, so we ended up having to hire a computer programmer to help RÅ«naka complete the work that required use of the Torque software.</p>
        <p> <strong>Objective 2:</strong> Develop a software tool for creating specific MÄ�ori virtual environments: the â€œSimPÄ� toolkitâ€� (Figure 2 left).</p>
        <p>The â€œSimPÄ� toolkitâ€� was created. This includes a suite of software packages and game templates. At the end of the project, however, the â€œtoolkitâ€� is more about a process of engagement. The SimPÄ� toolkit has been much more about process â€“ partnerships of ideas and capabilities â€“ than about the technology. The RÅ«naka all decided to work individually and nominated representatives to lead their respective projects. This aligned with the aim that the RÅ«naka members would define what information was important to them and how their resources would be produced. All RÅ«naka representatives communicated with their members to keep them informed on the project and had the ambition of producing resources that would be beneficial for all members.</p>
        <p>While the project was explicitly funded on the promise of game-based narratives, the team spent a very great deal of time engaged in wider knowledge â€“ and wider applications of digital technology. For example, one RÅ«naka has had a long-held special role as archivists for the Iwi. They saw the potential for SimPÄ� to help with this role. Before the team could sensibly talk game environments, they spent time helping the RÅ«naka with editing and sustaining existing media, and working with them to capture new stories in a variety of forms (image, video, oral history). </p>
        <p>Integral to the process was developing an Intellectual Policy that ensured the RÅ«naka owned the rights to all their knowledge and narratives, including the complete GamePÄ�.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective 3</strong>. Develop and test GamePÄ� in teaching MÄ�ori concepts (Figure 2 middle).</p>
        <p>The uniqueness and process of the project saw the RÅ«naka produce specifically tailored resources. In the original funding application, the GamePÄ� were described using deliberately ambiguous terms. This was to allow all RÅ«naka to tell their own stories. However, we did expect the project to focus on the original GamePÄ� and that these would be â€œgamesâ€�. We anticipated these GamePÄ� to be developed as robust products (along the lines of a packaged game). We also thought further benefits would come from the use of the GamePÄ� in marae-based teaching etc. None of the GamePÄ� would be considered â€œgamesâ€�, yet these benefits did occur, with most of the RÅ«naka actively using their GamePÄ� for â€œvirtual toursâ€�. What we did not expect was the <em>form </em>of the GamePÄ� to vary so much. Resources were produced, such as complex narratives that use the game environment as â€œfilm setsâ€� and virtual landscapes combining the game environment with other digital media â€“ primarily audio and video. While the stories are hosted in the game environment, this was used as a platform for further engagement such as the recording and production of documentary style interviews that share stories of the past and present.  None of the five RÅ«naka GamePÄ� could be considered â€œgamesâ€� although all have made extensive use of the 3D gaming environment. These resources give access to the matauraka that they convey as well as the knowledge used to create them. They also provide a means of access for members, regardless of their location in the world.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective 4</strong>: Develop techniques and practices for the use of GamePÄ�.</p>
        <p>In addition to surprise at the form of the GamePÄ�, we also did not expect the RÅ«naka to move so quickly to using the skills learned through the SimPÄ� developments to develop further applications (Figure 2 lower). </p>
        <p>The measures of success can be viewed not only by the physical outcomes and ongoing use and production of further resources, but also by the actual process of engagement and dialogical exchange itself. The best thing to come from the SimPÄ� project is the initiatives beyond the original GamePÄ�. This demonstrates a very successful community adoption of digital media. These initiatives have included both game environment form and video form of GamePÄ�, but put to quite unexpected uses.</p>
        <p>The subject matter has extended beyond the traditional stories to include contemporary narratives: the story of Puketerakiâ€™s new carvings, and Moerakiâ€™s expedition to Te Papa (New Zealandâ€™s national museum). </p>
        <p>The relationship between SimPÄ� and landscape was further explored by the ÅŒtÄ�kou rÅ«naka who used it in visioning wetland restoration to reform mahika kai.</p>
        <p>One of the final phases of the project is the â€˜handing over of both raw data and finished productsâ€™ before we evaluate and write conclusion papers. There has been surprise shown nationally and internationally (Russell and Mann 2007) that we were leaving the stories with the respective Papatipu RÅ«naka.  The assumption is that a project such as ours results in a contribution to a central archive.  We have taken a very different approach: we have helped the RÅ«naka retell their stories to themselves. In their new form they are still knowledge transmitted and retained within each RÅ«naka.  </p>
        <p><strong>Objective 5:</strong> Develop a new specialist area in education: MÄ�ori digital content </p>
        <p>We had intended developing a specialist programme of learning aimed at capacity building within indigenous people. A Iwi Digital Practice Diploma programme was developed and approved, but did not run. </p>
        <p>We believe, however, that a new subject area is emerging. This is apparent in the involvement of RÅ«naka members in wÄ�naka, and in the learnings of the SimPÄ� team itself (Figure 2 right).</p>
        <p>To ensure access to information specific to the creation and production of resources, a wÄ�naka was held for all RÅ«naka members. As expected (based on prior research), the attendees were teenagers, very enthusiastic about information technology. Parents and supporters viewed this wÄ�naka as an opportunity for the rakatahi to learn and develop skills that can ensure the continuation and further development of such resources. Some of the RÅ«naka are actively using SimPÄ� to connect with their youth. Other training and wÄ�naka that were held also provided opportunities for participants to develop their capability. </p>
        <p>The partnership has evolved significantly. The most important change was a realisation that to achieve the outcomes the SimPÄ� team had to be indistinguishably both Otago Polytechnic and Iwi. The most successful capacity building has been of this evolving team. We see this as a very positive outcome. The project has taken far more partnership negotiation than we ever imagined. This has been constant and evolving. We believe that this model of engagement could be the model for further partnership.  </p>
        <p><strong>Objective 6:</strong> Develop a process of adoption of this initiative beyond the collaborating partners.</p>
        <p>This collaboration is not just between a single group of stakeholders, but involves complex structures of knowledge ownership. An important part of this initiative is the development of processes maintaining the integrity of specialist knowledge and tikanga (Figure 2 lower right).</p>
        <p>Otago Polytechnic has also developed a proposal to use GamePÄ� to connect MÄ�ori living overseas back to their RÅ«naka: they are currently seeking funding to develop it further. This project will use virtual realities of people and places of tÅ«puna acting and interacting in these virtually created spaces. Kai Tahu people far from home can access these histories and te reo of their places; of ancestors and their deeds; of how to give this new knowledge to their children, many of whom have never set foot on these landscapes.</p>
        <p>RÅ«naka are currently in discussion with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and local RÅ«naka about using the GamePÄ� format to create an interpretative resource for Mahika Kai.</p>
        <p>Further collaboration between Otago Polytechnic and the eWÄ�nanga Centre for Creative Teaching and Learning Te Whare WÄ�nanga o AwanuiÄ�rangi is also in the pipeline.</p>
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p> â€œSimPÄ�â€� aims to integrate participatory digital interactive storytelling with MÄ�ori culture, tikaka and knowledge. The SimPÄ� project uses gaming software to create various â€˜GamePÄ�â€™, which are virtual environments based on actual places. These environments incorporate the knowledge of RÅ«naka members, recreating sites of cultural significance and historical environmental features that have since changed with the passing of time. The outcomes of this project were the completion of GamePÄ� and narrative films incorporating digital content with Te RÅ«naka o ÅŒtÄ�kou, Kati Huirapa ki Puketeraki, Te Runanga o Moeraki, Hokonui RÅ«naka and NgÄ�ti Awa. Topics included migration stories, the virtual recreation of a wetlands restoration project, and local oral histories. </p>
        <p>Our indigenous literature in times past was, and in many ways, continues to be, expressed through whakairo, (carving) and painted kowhaiwhai (specific Iwi patterns based on nature often presented in the abstract); through tÄ� moko (commonly called tattoo) and by way of tÄ�tai kÅ�rero (stories of connectedness)and lastly, by use of and engaging in kÅ�rero neherÄ� (ancient histories and prehistorical narratives). These stories if not these landscapes have been retained through endless generations of bodies of knowledge being lovingly held as precious by the keepers who have been charged with their kaitiaki . Thus they ensure as they commit to memory his and her stories of our land and seascapes, of our and TÅ«puna  a - whÄ�nau who formerly occupied the aforementioned that we in this time and place, continue to occupy, if not always own. Using contemporary technologies, we can retain these stories and design new means of imparting them to our Iwi wherever in the world they may be located. It is also about safeguarding and protecting our knowledge and knowledge systems whilst using new means of disseminating these. The stories that have been re-created are placed squarely within Iwi epistemologies, ontological understandings and mÄ�tauraka. The paper provides a model of connected cultures at times intruding into each other, but finally providing a collaboration and complementarity that enhances both. </p>
        <p>Looking back, SimPÄ� is quite different to how the team first conceived it. Despite these differences, or perhaps because of them, the project has met expectations. One of the main lessons learned from this project is the need to abandon a linear flow to accommodate a process that is very much more organic.</p>
        <p>At the start of the project the team proposed a process of participatory development for each RÅ«naka. For each group they saw a process of helping the community identify important stories and then convert these stories to a game-based environment. Of primary importance to the original project was the â€œSimPÄ� toolkitâ€�. However the SimPÄ� toolkit has ended up being much more about process â€“ partnerships of ideas and capabilities â€“ than about the technology. In addition, the development of each GamePÄ� has been quite different to what we expected. None of the five RÅ«naka GamePÄ� could be considered â€œgamesâ€�. All, though, have made extensive use of the 3D gaming environment.</p>
        <p>It was hoped that the resultant GamePÄ� would be used in engaging and educating the community. The original goal for â€œSustained interactivityâ€� was the use of these GamePÄ� with RÅ«nakaâ€™s work with schools, and possibly in tourism ventures, etc. The intended target for the project, â€œteenagers dis-engaged from both their culture and educationâ€�, proved hard to hit. However, the team had most success with people with young families (widely recognised as crucial for cultural development), the very young, and the more mature. Some of the RÅ«naka, though, are actively using SimPÄ� to connect with their youth. However, the use of SimPÄ� as a recruitment tool for students into computing did not occur. While the team believe there is still a role for the â€œMÄ�ori digital education specialistâ€�, it is difficult to see a predictable career path into this.</p>
        <p>The project has taken far more partnership negotiation than the team ever imagined. This has been constant and evolving and is a model of engagement for further partnerships. The most important change was a realisation that to achieve the outcomes, the SimPÄ� team had to be indistinguishably both Otago Polytechnic and Iwi.  The most successful capacity building has been of this evolving team. The team sees this as a very positive outcome.</p>
        <p>Because of the partnership approach, SimPÄ� has evolved dramatically since its conception. RÅ«naka determined that the landscapes should become a major focus: the participants were so excited by the process of re-imagining and re-building the landscapes that the notion of the game format became less important. What is happening now is that they are using these elaborate 3D environments as film sets, as a way to tell narrative stories. Each group has decided on a different approach using their GamePÄ� to record a range of traditional knowledge; e.g. telling migration histories; recording their oral histories; describing cultural, traditional and botanical education; describing kai MÄ�ori (traditional foods, especially seasonal delicacies)and karakia (Incantations)and tikaka and for memorial purposes. This has required the project team to be adaptable and resourceful to adapt the original idea to fit the needs of the communities. This has been essential for the projectâ€™s success. The team members have also needed to adapt their approach to work not just with RÅ«naka but also with different whanau groups within the RÅ«naka.</p>
        <p>The future usefulness and sustainability of the SimPÄ� process is assured through the new projects both the Polytechnic and RÅ«naka are currently pursuing.</p>
        <p>It is evident that there is a need to develop and offer different models of teaching and learning: models that vary in content, specifically iwi digital content, and structure with  a flexible structure and delivery that will benefit community users; eg, wÄ�naka, marae based teaching, flexible hours, units etc.</p>

        <p class="AcknowedgementsText">This collaborative project is developed as a result of the Memorandum of Understanding between Otago Polytechnic and these RÅ«naka. This MOU is instantiated in the position of the Kaitohutohu and the KÅ�mitiKÄ�wanata<u>k</u>a. The SimPÄ� team has immensely enjoyed working with the following individual RÅ«naka, and the committee of the combined RÅ«naka of Arai te Uru.</p>
