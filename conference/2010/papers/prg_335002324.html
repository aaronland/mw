<h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>

<p class="AbstractText">Museums are quickly adapting to Web 2.0, and engaging
with a new on-line audience. Social media projects are being developed and used
by museum staff, and curators are starting to explore this new space. When the
Powerhouse Museum&#39;s curatorial department created their first blog, they had no
idea what they were in for, or what challenges they would face. They also had
little idea of how curators as a whole are participating in social media
activities. This paper will use the Powerhouse Museum&#39;s &#39;Object of the Week&#39;
blog and a major international survey of curators to investigate how social
media activities are impacting on curatorial practice. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The rise in the number of people adopting Web 2.0 and social
media has encouraged museums to explore these spaces and engage with this new
audience. Efforts have centered on increasing on-line access to collections and
the people who manage them. Openness and user centricity are core components of
Web 2.0, and in response, museums are opening up their once strictly controlled
content and collections, allowing users to curate for themselves (Kelly, Ellis,
Gardler, 2008).</p>

<p>Museums are becoming more comfortable with an open culture,
exploring ideas such as crowd-curated and sourced exhibitions, which are
occurring more and more frequently. Museums have also begun sharing their
collections in the social media realm, coming to the understanding that users
want their content all in one place (Bernstein, 2008).</p>

<p>In the fast moving world of Internet technology, others are
already looking at how to bring social media back into the museum. Nina Simon
(2009) suggests that museums should now explore innovating backwards and bring
social media type platforms back into the physical museum. </p>

<p>Access through the Internet has increased opportunities for
communities to interact with museum objects while the trend to couple this
information with social media sites has presented curators, and the public,
with an array of new communication platforms. Curators in particular are now
faced with engaging in increased two-way communication, previously the domain
of staff working on public programs, outreach, or Web editing. Russo, Kelly and
Chan (2008) claimed that &#34;integrating social media into curatorial practice
opened up previously restricted collections and communications to privileged
participation by our on-line audience.&#34;</p>

<p>So where does this leave the museum curator? Are curators
integrating social media into curatorial practice? If so, how are they
interacting in these spaces, and what impact does all this have on a curator&#39;s
role and the collections they care for?</p>

<p>This paper will use the Powerhouse Museum&#39;s curatorial blog,
&#39;Object of the Week&#39; and an international survey of curators to explore these
questions.</p>

<h2>&#39;Object of the Week&#39;</h2>

<p>Technically the Sydney Observatory blog (<a href="http://www.sydneyobservatory.com.au/blog/">http://www.sydneyobservatory.com.au/blog/</a>),
run by curator Nick Lomb, is the Museum&#39;s first curator-led blog. In 2009,
&#39;Object of the Week&#39; (http://<a href="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/blog">www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/blog</a>)
was the first curator-led blog to be launched out of the main Museum building. The
goal was to engage with an on-line audience in conversations about the
collection and to expose some behind-the-scenes stories that curators
encounter. The blog provides a platform for content that previously had no
other outlet and contains rich collection- orientated material that appeals to
both casual readers and those interested in a deeper level of research. As Russo
et al (2008) suggest, we aimed to use curatorial knowledge to act as a hub
which an on-line community could connect to and build on. </p>

<p>The blog platform (WordPress) was built by the Museum&#39;s Web
Services department and handed over to the &#39;project lead&#39;, a curator, who would
become the project administrator. At the Powerhouse Museum, the Web Team is in
a different department from the IT Team. As Chan and Spadaccini (2007) suggest,
using blogging as a first foray into the curatorial team&#39;s use of social media
was cheap, technically simple and easy to set up. </p>

<p>We wanted to post frequently and build up a whole &#39;team&#39; of
curatorial bloggers, each with a unique voice (Chan &amp; Spadaccini, 2007). To
help reveal some of the personalities of the participating curators, each has a
&#39;profile&#39; post which includes a portrait photograph, short biography and
personal stories about favourite objects from the collection.</p>

<p>The initial goal was set at one post per week while
operational aspects of blogging were explored. It was also necessary to ensure
adequate resources were available to make the blog sustainable, as this has
proved a major concern for museum bloggers in the past (Chan &amp; Spadaccini,
2007). The curatorial team wanted the workflow to support a quick and
spontaneous blogging environment. Posts for &#39;Object of the Week&#39; are written by
curators, combined with images, and directly loaded on to the blog by the project
lead. This simple process allows the curatorial department to react quickly to
current events and retain a sense of authority.  This also provides a sense of
ownership over the blog and  responsibility for producing quality content.</p>

<p>Now in 2010, the Powerhouse Museum curatorial team posts to
&#39;Object of the Week&#39; a minimum of three times a week, always keeping a flexible
backlog of posts waiting to be published. </p>

<h2>Social Media Survey</h2>

<p>After establishing &#39;Object of the Week&#39; and wanting to investigate
where the Museum&#39;s curatorial knowledge of social media stood in the wider
industry, a major survey of curators was undertaken. Whilst much research has
been done on social media in museums, there was a lack of knowledge about how
curators are currently interacting with Web 2.0 in a professional capacity<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">.</b></p>

<p>In November 2009, 96 curators from Australia, UK, USA,
Norway and New Zealand were surveyed anonymously. Survey participants were employees
from a wide range of institutions, including science museums, natural history
museums, art museums, history museums, indigenous centres, aquariums,
university collections, regional museums and galleries and children&#39;s museums.</p>

<p>Participants agreed to share their responses for this paper.
Quotes from their answers are included throughout.</p>

<h2>A Curator&#39;s Role</h2>

<p>Traditionally museum curators have been viewed as
specialists in their fields, experts of knowledge and the one link between the
museum collections and the public. Their duties are vast and many, including
planning exhibitions, developing content, acquiring for the collection,
documenting objects, doing research, answering public enquiries, giving museum
tours, writing for publication, giving media interviews, advising external
associations and affiliates. Their roles have also been seen as objective and
factual. </p>

<p>When survey participants were asked to complete the
statement &#34;A curator is...&#34; the results indicate that curators may be changing
how they define their roles.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="dicker.Fig1.jpg" width="498" height="187" alt="Figure 1"/></p>

<p class="caption">Fig 1: A
visualisation of the frequency of words used to complete the phrase<br/>
&#34;A curator
is....&#34;</p>

<p>Only a minority of curators still see themselves as
&#39;specialists&#39;, &#39;experts&#39;, or &#39;the gatekeepers of knowledge&#39;. One participant
felt as though a curator is &#34;the meat in the sandwich between management and
stake holders...&#34; The majority of participants defined themselves using terms
such as &#39;researchers&#39;,  &#39;knowledge brokers&#39;, &#39;communicators&#39;, &#39;facilitators&#39;
and most commonly &#39;interpreters&#39;. </p>

<p>One clear message in the response to this question is that a
curator&#39;s role is still strongly connected to objects, collections and material
culture.</p>

<p>The &#39;Object of the Week&#39; blog reflects this connection: the
content is strongly linked to the Museum collection and the stories that
surround it.</p>

<h2>Understanding Social Media</h2>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">&#34;It&#39;s evolving fast, so who fully understands it?&#34;</p>

<p>Most curators surveyed believe they fully understand the
term &#39;social media&#39;, with less than 5% claiming to have no understanding of the
term. The spread of understanding was quite vast, with some curators left pondering
what social media is and others showing that they have had to work hard to
understand the term.</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">&#34;I have spent the best part of the last six months immersed
in trying to learn about social media and the opportunities it presents for
creating new engagement between our collection and the wider public.&#34;</p>

<p>Before establishing &#39;Object of the Week&#39;, Powerhouse Museum
curators had been  exposed to social media activities. Although not directly
involving the curatorial department as a whole, the Museum has photographic
collections on Flickr, along with a Facebook presence, and a host of blogs,
including an experimental exhibition development blog.</p>

<h2>Do Curators Use Social Media in Their Personal Lives?</h2>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">&#34;Email and instant messaging are what I use the most. Who
has time for the rest? You would never get any work done. It&#39;s hard enough
keeping up with email!&#34;</p>

<p class="caption"><a name="fig2" id="fig2"></a><img src="dicker.Fig2.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Figure 2"/></p>

<p class="caption">Fig 2: The
types of social media curators are using for personal use</p>

<p>The majority (80.5%) of all curators surveyed use social
media spaces for personal use. The most popular platforms include <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Facebook, YouTube, Flickr, MySpace</i> and
commenting on blogs. Other uses include <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">LinkedIn,</i>
and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">nings.</i></p>

<p>Largely the answers to this question paint a picture of curators
who have placed themselves in on-line social spaces for personal use and are
engaged with a networked world.</p>

<h2>Curators Who Do Not Use Social Media</h2>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">&#34;In an environment where the volume of work far surpasses
the time available to do it, social media looks like a luxury.&#34;</p>

<p class="caption"><a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a><a href="dicker-fig3.html"><img src="dicker.Fig3.jpg" width="500" height="275" alt="Figure 3"/></a></p>

<p class="caption">Fig 3: Responses
to why curators do not use social media for work</p>

<p>In their roles as a curators, 36.7% of all survey
participants do not use social media. When asked why, the overwhelming response
was that social media take up time that curators just don&#39;t have. One curator
stated, &#34;emails - 100s of them!&#34;, indicating that basic core business duties
are taxing enough on a curator&#39;s workload.</p>

<p>The survey indicates that of the curators who do not use
social media for work, 36% of them state that they do not have the outlet to do
so, while a smaller group have had social media spaces &#39;blocked&#39; by their
institutions.</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">&#34;I am prevented from using social media at work by IT
policies. The IT department do not use social media either.&#34;</p>

<p>Others had been outright restricted from using social media:
</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">&#34;I have been asked by my manager to divorce myself from the
museum in my personal Twitter account, which is quite frankly impossible, so I
hardly tweet anything interesting from there now.&#34; </p>

<p>Some participants stated they do not use social media
because there is as yet no resource to do so: &#34;smaller collecting
institutions.... are only just beginning to realise the potential of social
media and therefore the need to allocate staff time and resources (often
already stretched) into developing an on-line presence in the social media arena.&#34;
</p>

<p>Some respondents (16%) didn&#39;t feel comfortable in the social
media space stating things like:  &#34;Am concerned that my personal opinions may
be misinterpreted&#34;,</p>

<p> &#34;Blogs and twitter etc are time consuming, but are also
temporary&#34;,  and &#34;Don&#39;t feel comfortable in using &#34;work&#34; time for
something that overlaps into a &#34;social&#34; activity.&#34;</p>

<p>It was evident that within this group of curators who do not
use social media, some are from institutions that are only just beginning to
explore the this media realm. One telling statistic arising from this group of
curators is that 90% of them would like more social media training to be offered
in their workplace.</p>

<h2>Changing Attitudes</h2>

<p>Powerhouse Museum curators initially found it time consuming
to learn new software and a new way of writing and replying to reader&#39;s
comments for &#39;Object of the Week&#39;. Early skepticism about the project led to a
lack of support from the curatorial team, and the perception that blogging was
time consuming led to poor participation. This effect has been documented in
other museum blogs such as the Smithsonian American Art Museum&#39;s &#39;Eye Level&#39;
(Gates, 2007). This was an attitude that was slow to change. </p>

<p>The project lead became actively aware of the work
individual curators were undertaking, approaching selectively and encouraging
individuals to write blog posts. To make content creation less time consuming,
curators were encouraged to re-purpose existing content such as object
documentation, previously written articles, and research resulting from public
enquiries. Curators new to blogging were individually walked through the
process by the project lead, covering  content selection, writing style, and
how to reply to comments. The project lead endeavored to raise awareness of the
blog, creating a &#39;highlight&#39; column in the Museum&#39;s weekly newsletter, along
with scheduling &#39;Object of the Week&#39; for discussion at fortnightly curatorial
departmental meetings. This raised the profile of the project internally,
making participation more attractive. Individual curators became more
comfortable in participating and in turn their colleagues began asking how they
could start writing posts. Once it was shown that blogging didn&#39;t need to be hugely
time consuming and was not difficult, participation slowly increased.</p>

<p>The majority of Powerhouse Museum curators now participate
in &#39;Object of the Week&#39;; however, some are overwhelmed by their current
workload, and others still do not feel comfortable in doing so. Participation
in the project still remains voluntary, with no staff member pressured to take
part.</p>

<h2>How Are Curators Interacting with Social Media at Work?</h2>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">&#34;I co-ordinate the museum&#39;s blog, contribute to its twitter
feed, and generally evangelize for the museum and my collections on-line.&#34;</p>

<p>Of the 96 curators surveyed, 63.3% are now using social
media in their roles.</p>

<p>Whilst the word &#39;twitter&#39; has been declared the most popular
word of 2009 (American Dialect Society, 2009), it is not winning any votes from
curators. The overwhelming majority of curators using social media are spending
their time blogging rather than tweeting.</p>

<p>66.7% of the curators surveyed who are using social media in
their roles are contributing to a museum blog, and over half of these curators
know how to upload their own posts using backend software such as &#39;WordPress&#39;
or &#39;Blogger&#39;.  But some don&#39;t have access to these backend applications,
evidenced by comments such as: &#34;museum public output of this nature is
regulated through a dept other than mine!&#34;. </p>

<p>Although the overwhelming response was that curators are
blogging, they are also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using Youtube to upload video, lecture and, promote museum tours</li>
  <li>maintaining and adding to Flickr pages</li>
  <li>developing exhibition content and concepts via blogs </li>
  <li>contributing to Facebook pages and using them to market events</li>
  <li>administering wikis and nings</li>
  <li>contributing to Twitter feeds and twitter campaigns</li>
  <li>maintaining contact with international colleagues </li>
  <li>seeking information for research</li>
  <li>participating in on-line discussion forums</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the reasons &#39;Object of the Week&#39; runs successfully is
  that the front and backend tasks are performed by the project lead, who is also
  a curator. The Web Services department granted the curatorial team full
  administrable access to the blog and takes a back seat, providing support when
  needed. This allows a short path for curators between creating content and publishing
  on the blog. It also creates a feeling of ownership over the project that may
  not be otherwise felt if back-end duties are done by another department. </p>

<p>There is a continuing and ongoing effort to encourage other
curators to learn the skills necessary to upload their own content into the WordPress
platform. This not only aides in lessening demands on the projects lead&#39;s time,
but also ensures the blog can become a sustainable project. </p>

<h2>Are Curators Using Social Media Engaging with a New Audience?</h2>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">&#34;I keep getting acquisition inquiries via twitter and have
collected various items offered to me there. The fact that the museum is
actively collecting recent technology is unfortunately still not widely known
to the public and my presence on the web looking for these artefacts really
helps get out the word.&#34;</p>

<p>83.3% of the surveyed curators who use social media at work
felt they had engaged with an on-line audience through doing so. Most of this
interaction is coming through blog comments, but also through other means. One
curator, for example, commented that &#34;many potential donors post images on
Flickr for our review rather than sending them attached to an e-mail.&#34;</p>

<p>All curators surveyed still interact with a museum audience
in more traditional ways, such as tours, talks and written publications.
However, curators who use social media at work indicated they are significantly
more likely to give media interviews than their colleagues who do not use
social media. This form of media appears to have had a significant impact on the
&#39;findability&#39; and accessibility of museum curators. Curators are clearly
reaching and interacting with an audience via social media; this in turn is
boosting their individual profiles within the broader community and also
raising the profile of their museums.</p>

<p>The Powerhouse Museum curators have been discovering and
interacting with a new audience via &#39;Object of the week&#39;. We have experienced
debates with readers regarding factuality of content, we have had readers solve
&#34;mystery object&#34; posts, and we have also generally enjoyed the many comments
and interactions the blog has offered.</p>

<p>As suggested by the survey, Powerhouse Museum curators have
indeed become more easily findable through the blog. The &#39;Curator Profile&#39;
section of &#39;Object of the Week&#39; is the most &#39;clicked on&#39; category of the blog.
Throughout the project, participating curators have been found via their
writings and asked for newspaper comment, television interviews, or guest
appearances on specialty TV shows. </p>

<h2>How Much Time Are Curators Spending on Social Media?</h2>

<p class="caption"><a name="fig4" id="fig4"></a><a href="dicker-fig4.html"><img src="dicker.Fig4.jpg" width="499" height="306" alt="Figure 4"/></a></p>

<p class="caption">Fig 4: 
Number of hours per week curators are spending on social media for work <br/>
(STD= 8.1, Median=4, Mean=5.8)</p>

<p>The survey reports that the majority of curators spend one
hour per week using social media in their role, with the mean average being 5.8
hours per week.  Only 6 respondents used social media for more than 10 hours a
week for work purposes.</p>

<p>Digitisation of collections and placing them on the Web has,
without a doubt, significantly increased a curator&#39;s workload within the last
5-10 years. As more people can access a museum&#39;s collection, curators have
dealt with an exponential rise in the amount of correspondence they must
answer. Using museum collections in social media spaces, for example <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Flickr,</i>
has also increased a curator&#39;s workload, answering and dealing with public
enquiries that may not have arisen had the image stayed within the museum&#39;s
walls.</p>

<p> A careful eye has been kept on the staff time used to
create and publish blog posts for &#34;Object of the Week&#39;. As the blog is edited
within the curatorial department without passing through the editorial
department, the curator&#39;s workload and the time taken to produce a blog post is
reduced. This also ensures the curators stand behind their words. Participatory
museum experience expert Nina Simon (2010), suggests that to run a Web 2.0
venture such as a blog takes between 5-10 hours staff hours a week. At the
Powerhouse Museum, producing one blog post takes approximately 2.5 hours of
staff time. This includes writing, editing, image manipulation, uploading of the
post, and replying to any comments. Currently the blog is being updated three
times a week, using approximately 7.5 hours of staff time. </p>

<h2>Social Media&#39;s Impact on the Role of a Curator</h2>

<p class="caption"><img src="dicker.Fig5.jpg" width="500" height="232" alt="Figure 5"/></p>

<p class="caption">Fig 5: A visualisation
of the frequency of words used to answer the question,<br/>
&#34;What do you think is
the biggest impact of social media?&#34;</p>

<p>Overwhelming, curators surveyed thought that the biggest
impact of social media was its ability to connect information and collections
with a new and wide audience. Traditionally a curator&#39;s audience would be visitors
on the museum floor or readers of a published work. When museums share the
collection with a new audience, a curator&#39;s work is more accessible than ever
before. As one respondent stated, quite literally &#34;The world has opened up&#34; and
another said:</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I am excited by the possibilities of social media for
accessing other people&#39;s [the public and specialists] knowledge about objects,
events, stories etc. I think discovering how other people creatively interpret
our collections will be an eye-opener and it will assist me efficiently
communicate with others around the world in ways that could not have been done
so easily previously.</p>

<p>Only 11.5% of curators surveyed stated that the biggest
impact of social media on their role was the time it takes to perform duties in
this space. Some curators felt that working in a social media space allowed them
&#34;less time to actually engage with collections&#34;. There was also concern about
the &#39;potential&#39; of work that it may create:</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">&#34;there is some anxiety at my museum that it may generate a
lot of work that we may not be able to deal with.&#34;</p>

<p>However, some curators are still wary of social media and
the threat it poses of losing control of content: </p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I still hold traditional views, not elitist though, that
Museums should still be in control and that curators have expertise which
should not be &#39;drowned&#39; out by this drive for giving audiences more control and
ability to interpret our collections and determine what we do etc. Having said
that, however, social media is a great way to inspire audiences and create new
interests and get the word out there about the wonderful work Museums do.</p>

<p>Some curators were also concerned about losing their authoritative
voice:</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">&#34;it&#39;s a bit &#39;death of the author&#39; - I don&#39;t think as
curators we have grasped and dealt with the impact of the loss of a [possibly
antiquated] sense of the authority of expertise in which curators used to be
immersed/ grounded&#34;.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest impact of social media on the role of a
curator is that it may be largely responsible for changing it. Even curators
who do not use social media in their roles still largely view its impact on the
profession as a positive one. </p>

<p>We have found that &#39;Object of the Week&#39; provides the
Powerhouse Museum curators with a writing and publishing experience that would
otherwise would not be available. Although the process does take time,
interaction with a new audience is richly rewarding.</p>

<h2>The Changing Role of the Curator </h2>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">&#34;We have to know how to engage with our audience and the
audience is ever changing.&#34;</p>

<p>Overwhelmingly, surveyed curators believe that the role of a
curator is changing. </p>

<p>There are many comments that indicate, while the role is
changing, some things are vital to hold on to, one being the relationship
curators have with collections and the knowledge they can build and provide.</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">With more and more of our collections going on-line, we
need to ensure that Museums retain the value of providing high quality data.
You often see money being spent on making data accessible but rarely do you see
funds for data verification. That&#39;s what curators do.</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I think there will always be a need for very the contextual
knowledge curators provide. Expertise and authority have become democratized,
to everybody&#39;s benefit, but curators help put the work of amateur historians in
broader context based on scholarship and collections knowledge.</p>

<p>One curator feared for the existence of a curatorial role
stating:</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">&#34;If disciplinary knowledge and education are not valued
however then yes, curators as they currently exist are not relevant.&#34;</p>

<p>If the biggest impact of social media on a curator&#39;s role is
the way in which it provides access to a new audience, then it is imperative
that curators change to meet these needs. Social media dictates a myriad of
changes, big and small, which may occur in the way curators work. Minor changes,
such as in writing style, may need to be made to produce a more casual tone,
while larger changes may influence the way content is produced in the first
place.</p>

<p>At the Powerhouse Museum, curators have already begun
changing the way in which they produce content; for example, writing documentation
records in a structure that is easily read on-line and can be re-used in a
multitude of platforms. This adheres to an ethos of &#34;produce once, use many
times&#34;, and has proven to be especially beneficial in writing posts for &#39;Object
of the Week&#39;.</p>

<h2>Social Media Training</h2>

<p>71.2% of all survey participants would like more workplace
training in using social media. These numbers are hard to ignore. The message
is clear: if curators&#39; roles are to change, curators must be adequately
supplied with the skills to handle them.</p>

<p>The Institute of Museums and Library Services study
&#39;Museums, Libraries and 21<sup>st</sup> Century Skills&#39;  found one of the outcomes
to be that curators may no longer be required to be masters of just one field,
but masters of many. This is in addition to being proficient in using 21<sup>st</sup>
century skills such as digital technologies (computers,PDA&#39;s, media players,
GPS, etc), communication tools, networking tools and social networks, to
appropriately access, manage, integrate, evaluate and create information that successfully
functions in a knowledge economy. This study also suggests that it may be more
beneficial for these types of skills to be taught in a multidirectional
approach, from others on the same level, rather than from the top down (Institute
of Museums and Library Services, 2009). </p>

<p>This may be indicative of a divide between an institution&#39;s
Web Services, or IT department, and its curatorial department. As shown in the
survey, curators are deeply involved in the physical world, with their roles
rooted in a material culture and objects. Things that can be made to happen
instantly in the Web world don&#39;t always translate into the physical world of
curators. There is a physical process, with accompanying restrictions, when
working with objects. Handling them, photographing them, researching them and writing
about them can take a lot of time. Web service departments often do not
understand these boundaries when working with a collection.</p>

<p>During the process of running &#39;Object of the Week&#39; it was
found that curators were more inclined to be involved in writing blog posts and
participating if they had the confidence, knowledge and the skills to do so.
This was accomplished by skill training in the basics of blogging, both in
one-on-one and in workshop format, coming from the curator project lead. The
Web Team at the Powerhouse Museum used a &#39;train the trainer&#39; approach (project
lead to curators), which was found to be highly beneficial. Curators felt more
involved in the process, had more ownership, were more likely to ask questions,
and generally felt more comfortable in that environment.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">&#34;I hope there will always be a place for deep analytical
thinking, audience-directed creativity, and curators willing and able to take responsibility
for collections and for using objects to communicate important ideas.&#34;</p>

<p>As Russo et al (2008) state, &#34;Any successful use of social
media tools will need more effort than the download of free software and the
hope that someone technically minded in the organisation will implement and
sustain a participatory communication program.&#34; For curators, specifically,
there are numerous hurdles to overcome in integrating social media tools into
their professional roles. </p>

<p>As museums focus more and more on audience engagement,
curators must support the institution&#39;s goals for doing so; however, the
institution must in turn support the curator. Time demands are recurring issues
in relation to curators&#39; use of social media. Increasing workloads, lack of funding,
and staff reductions all impact on a curator&#39;s role, and perhaps social media
is still at the bottom of a list of priorities. As one surveyed curator stated:
</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">&#34;in my institution the social networking tools are used by
the marketing department to develop customer relationships. They are not yet
seen as an extension of the museum&#39;s content or experience.&#34;</p>

<p>It is hoped that as institutions adopt and develop social
media policies into their core business, time taken to complete duties in
social media spaces may become part of day-to-day duties, and considered just
another part of content production. </p>

<p>Access to social media tools is also another issue. In
Australia the Government 2.0 taskforce was formed to make recommendations on
the potential uses of public sector information and on-line engagement <u>(</u>Australian
Government, 2009<u>)</u>. The report recommends that institutions identify
barriers within their organisation that inhibit on-line engagement, and develop
plans to reduce them. As the Australian government and perhaps others develop
documents such as this, curators who have previously been blocked from
accessing social media may be better enabled to gain access. Engaging with the
tools and platforms of social networking should be accepted as an integral part
of a curator&#39;s professional development toolkit, and therefore should be freely
accessible. </p>

<p>Curators are also facing the challenge of learning new
skills to work in Web 2.0. As Shelley Bernstein (2008) suggests, including
curatorial presence whenever possible can greatly benefit a museum&#39;s Web 2.0
project. However, curators must have the skills to be able to participate.
Furthermore, if as Nina Simon (2008) suggests, museums are to bring social
media type platforms back onto the physical museum floor, which is the
traditional realm of the curator, then curators will have to understand and be
comfortable with how these platforms work, to be able to assist with their
integration into the physical space. Curatorial uptake of these types of
activities is dictating that 21<sup>st</sup>
century skills may become a base level to fulfill a curator&#39;s role. Curators
need to hone their information, media and technology skills, and must be
equipped to do so. Emphasis on continuing education and professional
development is essential to keep abreast of changes. If the skills needed to
perform a curator&#39;s job are changing, then it is also important that those
skills be written into job descriptions.</p>

<p>Russo et al (2008) suggested that the widespread viability
and sustainability of social media as a tool for the curator remains to be
determined. In many ways this has not changed, but perhaps curators are yet to
be presented with a well-fitting social media platform. Curator&#39;s roles are
still deeply connected to collections and physical objects; they do not always
mesh well on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr or even blogging.
Perhaps a social media platform that allows for retention of a curatorial
voice, deep analytical thinking, audience directed creativity, and the ability
to use content to communicate ideas has yet to be developed. </p>

<p>That said, curators who are already embracing social media
are enjoying the benefits: a high degree of visibility, extensive networks, and
the opportunity to have a subjective voice. With time, training and
encouragement, many of their colleagues will, no doubt, join them. </p>

  I used my personal Twitter account to tweet about the
  museum&#39;s transport festival, such as arrivals of locomotives, in the absence
  of anyone setting up a work one. I then helped the press officer to set one
  up for work. It has become mainly a &#34;what&#39;s on&#34; promotional tool
  rather than anything with specific curatorial focus. I occasionally ask for
  information about obscure items or for ideas on a topic. I have been asked by
  my manager to divorce myself from the museum in my personal Twitter account,
  which is quite frankly impossible, so I hardly tweet anything interesting
  from there now.

  set up. I still contribute: http://derbyperegrines.blogspot.com  The blog
  peaks at 10,000 readers a week in the peregrine breeding season, and our webcameras
  take about half a million hits a year.<br/>
  I use Flickr so that users can capture webcam pictures and share them with
  others: http://www.flickr.com/groups/derbyperegrines<br/>
  I use YouTube so i can share and embed into out blog intimate moments captured
  by our recording equipment: <br/>

  I also use Flickr to manage photos for a book on the plant sof our county
  that I&#39;m co-writing: http://www.flickr.com/groups/derbyshireflora    We embed
  those images into our council-run website, too: www.derby.gov.uk/flora<br/>
  I did start to use Twitter to share news that was too small to go on our
  blog, but as my authority is still in the throes of developing its social
  media strategy - and use of social media is still a sensitive area - I was
  asked to remove the account for the time being.

  The answer in this case is no, however this is only

  stretched) into developing an online presence in the social media arena.

  full-time only work part-time on this particular project. The blog has been a
  good way to keep people focussed on the project and update them of our

  the great sites/blogs we have found inspiring/useful.

  Set up a meeting with a freelancer who was looking for a
  museum with a particular set of collections to bring an educational group to.
  She already knew the museum a bit, but did not know what she could access via

  In the broader role of the curator/collection manager, I
  think there is great potential to participate more widely in social media
  activities. It is a fabulous way to interact with one constituent community.
  However, there is also a need for organisations to be comfortable and feel
  sufficiently in control of them, of the material it generates etc. I think
  the lack of exposure to social media is quite complex, particularly for
  government employees who&#39;s actions, contributions etc are subject to quite
  intense scrutiny and legal parameters.

  Operating in the social media environment seems to take

  Its impact on my job has generally been positive. Its

  negative in others. <br/>
  To be specific about this: The Powerhouse has for some years failed to create
  credible exhibition and publishing program due to management, financial and
  curatorial shortcomings. <br/>
  Social media, and digital media generally have often used as a way of
  excusing these failings, sometimes via absurd statements to the effect that
  exhibitions and publications are outdated media forms. <br/>
  Of course these different media are ideally complementary but unfortunately
  they are often presented as oppositions by those with agendas.

  providing me with a higher level of control over what I write about, and how
  it is presented for the public. My blog content is reviewed by my supervisor
  before going online, However, I am not limited by what the traditional media
  (including the museum&#39;s own magazine) may want, or the rules of academic
  writing etc. I can choose my own topics, writing style and images to match.

  While initially there was a steep learning curve and a
  huge amount of hours invested in using social media, I have come to treat it
  as a part of daily activities and see it more as an effective, productive
  part of my time. Having said that, there is still a fair bit of my time
  invested keeping up with social media interactions adding to the overall
  workload. Internally at the museum, I feel there needs to be more support and
  understanding from managers and colleagues about using social media in the
  museum context. We need further discussions about how social media  impacts
  out work, workloads and the way we do things. I feel social media is an
  important tool for engaging with our audiences but I don&#39;t think this idea is
  widely accepted within the Australian Museum staff.

  Personally, I guess I prefer developing professional

  convinced that the benefits of social media to our work justify the time spent
  in that domain, that the impressive hit statistics actually mean anything
  worthwhile.

  Social Media is here whether people like it or not.  Are
  museums equipped to handle the work created by social media mixing with collections.
   Collections will go on line, there&#39;s no doubt whether curators want it or
  not.  Money and acknowledgement of the powers who believe they have ownership
  will determine that not necessary the wellbeing of the collection.  There are
  so many issues to deal with in regards to Collections and social media, I&#39;m
  not sure if there is a museum around who is resourced to cope with this work
  load.

  I think its essential that smaller institutions quickly

  Social media can be a useful tool, but it&#39;s not something
  curators can necessarily do on top of their day-to-day jobs - it will have to
  be made an organisational priority to free up the time they need to do it. It
  is very demanding in terms of time. Conversely, if social media experts manage
  an organisation&#39;s media output, then there are potential problems with
  credibility and reputation. It is an issue yet to be solved.
