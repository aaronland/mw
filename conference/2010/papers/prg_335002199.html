    studies academic Henry Jenkins famously declared that in the digital realm,
    &#34;if it doesn&#39;t spread, it is dead&#34; (Jenkins, 2009). And as Clay

    &#34;public reuse produces a kind of value that doesn’t just come from
    publication. It comes from republication and reuse&#34; (Shirky, 2009).  Museums,

    of the on-line collection by all users, only Australian users, and only
    in-school use by NSW public school students. This research is timely as it

<h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Media studies academic Henry Jenkins famously declared that in
    the digital realm, &#34;if it doesn&#39;t spread, it is dead&#34; (Jenkins,
    2009). And as Clay Shirky, discussing the future of newspapers, asserted late in
    2009, &#34;public reuse produces a kind of value that doesn’t just come from
    publication. It comes from republication and reuse&#34; (Shirky, 2009). </p>
  <p>It
    also comes at a time when there is serious discussion about the role of museum
    collections on-line and the historical legacy of what Finnis (2009) terms
    ‘showcase sites’. In her definition showcase sites </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">target
    young people in exciting and innovative ways – sites that can go live with a
    big splash, a big marketing budget and an ambition to target an identified need
    in a focused way . . . Their focus on lively design, animation, games, sound
    and fun stuff is appealing, well understood and works. Lots of museums
    understand this point well as the process is similar to staging an exhibition .
    . . [but] rather like the museums’ own websites, it creates yet more islands
    and walled gardens that do not join up . . . and there is often a big problem with
    their sustainability.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Finnis, 2009, p86)</p>
  <p>Complicating
    this further, the Australian education sector has to pay for the right to copy
    material under the Statutory License part VB of the Australian Copyright Act
    1968, and unlike other jurisdictions, Web content is included in the definition
    of ‘material’. This has been shown to act as a significant deterrent to schools
    using Web content in classrooms unless they can be certain that it has been
    exempted from the license (Browne, 2009). License fees for the copying,
    printing or distributing of (freely available) on-line resources in educational
    institutions are collected by the Copyright Agency Limited (CAL), a non-profit
    collecting society. This was one driver for establishing The Learning
    Federation (TLF) as a repository of CAL-exempt educational materials. (The
    Learning Federation manages the national resource pool and infrastructure of
    digital curriculum resources. These resources are aligned with the curriculums
    of the Australian states and territories.)</p>
  <h2> The Study</h2>
  <p>In
    order to start to determine whether collection data is worthwhile being
    actively promoted as ‘spreadable,’ this paper explores the differences between
    collection ‘viewers’ and ‘re-users’ using data collected from the Powerhouse
    Museum over a 25-week period between July 2009 and January 2010.</p>
  <p>First,
    it examines the behaviour of general viewers of the on-line collection together
    with that of ‘cut and pasters’. Second, it looks at the subgroup of users of
    the collection from the NSW Department of Education - all Government primary
    and secondary schools in NSW. In so doing, it aims to reveal the different
    patterns of use and interest to provide a point from which to be able to better
    decide on future strategies.</p>
  <h2>Unintended Uses</h2>
  <p>Apart
    from the dominance of Google Search in delivering traffic to our Web sites,
    museums know that Google Image Search is a big driver of traffic as well. With
    access to reliable Web analytics, museums find that the top three referrers of
    traffic to their Web sites are Google Search, Google Images and Wikipedia - in
    that order. </p>
  <p>Likewise,
    there are unpredictable viral effects that occur, such as the re-use of 18th
    century French painter Joseph Ducreux’s self-portrait which became the secret
    ingredient of the &#39;archaic rap&#39; meme (see <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/joseph-ducreux-archaic-rap">http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/joseph-ducreux-archaic-rap</a>). Overlaid with re-written
    lyrics from commercial hip hop and rap, the meme has spawned thousands of
    variants. I do not expect that the Getty, which holds the original work from
    1783 that is used in the meme, is all that excited (if they even are aware),
    despite the wide re-use of the image. </p>
  <p>Jane
    Finnis, writing about the experience of UK cultural publishers and aggregator
    Culture 24, writes that what used to be almost always &#39;out of context image
    hijacking&#39; is starting to change with more &#39;in context use&#39; through a
    proportional increase in image embedding by cultural bloggers and on-line
    publishers (Finnis, 2008, 154-160). This may, however, simply be a result of
    a growing awareness of Culture 24 as a site full of relevant image content and
    a subsequent growth in intentional site visitors compared to casual visitors. </p>
  <p>Even
    in the Powerhouse Museum collection, there was some initial surprise at
    discovering that a dress worn by a pop star was suddenly the most popular
    object in the on-line collection for a while (Chan, 2007).</p>
  <p>None
    of this was intended. This is not to say that incidental or long-tail traffic
    is not important. It clearly provides opportunities to connect with new
    audiences - the success of the Commons on Flickr (Springer et al., 2008), and
    the traffic to multi-institutional repositories such as Europeana are all
    indicators of this &#39;latent demand&#39;.</p>
  <p>However,
    designing for these unknown audiences would be a very difficult task, and it
    would divert attention away from less exciting but more fundamentally critical
    users of museum content.</p>
  <h2>Tracking the Use We
     Design For</h2>
  <p>Public
    museums all desire to make their content available to the education sector. It
    is usually the cornerstone of their public mission; however, it has often had
    mixed success. Peacock, Tait and Timpson (2009) write:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">the
    failure to establish effective and well targeted digital distribution systems
    for museum content is particularly apparent and regrettable in the case of
    school-based users, or potential users, of museum digital content and services.
    It represents a major unfulfilled opportunity to develop new markets, products
    and services and to transform institutional practice for the digital age.</p>
  <p>In
    recent years, governments have rolled broadband Internet connectivity to
    schools, and some are now experimenting with providing laptops. All the while,
    museum content seems to still be worryingly underused by primary and secondary
    school students. </p>
  <p>On one
    hand, there has been a lot of effort developing &#39;educational&#39; games and
    microsites for content specifically authored for school visitors - Finnis’
    ‘showcase sites’; but on the other hand, little attention has been paid to how
    these same school visitors might use the increasing volume of &#39;collection data&#39;
    available on museum Web sites.</p>
  <p>On the
    museum side, there have been attempts such the UK&#39;s National Museums Online
    Learning Project (NMOLP) to repackage, re-author and provide access to a subset
    of museum collections (Royston, 2009) as well as the projects in Canada and
    Australia described by Peacock, Tait and Timpson (2009) .</p>
  <p>Falling
    between ‘showcase site’ and basic collection access, these inevitably have come
    at considerable additional resource cost to institutions and financial cost to
    the public. At the same time, each project has necessitated an additional layer
    of &#39;interpretation&#39; required to &#39;translate&#39; and &#39;contextualise&#39; collections for
    &#39;different audiences&#39;. Unfortunately, this has quickly become another burden to
    balance against the ongoing need for basic cataloguing and digitisation
    (Royston, 2009; Bain, 2009).</p>
  <p>The
    Powerhouse Museum took part in one of these projects in 2009. </p>
  <p>The
    Learning Federation&#39;s (TLF) pilot project - the Museum &amp; Education Digital
    Content Exchange - took 643 collection records from three museums and explored
    their use within primary and secondary schools in several Australian
    jurisdictions. Metadata was harvested from each institution and ingested into
    Scootle, a learning portal operated by the TLF. The harvested data then
    connected teachers and learners back to the museums&#39; own Web sites for object
    records. (After the in-school evaluations the collection records contributed by
    the three museums increased to over 2,000, and they remain accessible through
    Scootle).</p>
  <p>As
    collection documentation has historically been written primarily for internal
    and research use only, and not for ‘general’ education audiences, this was not
    without its own issues.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">The
    title, description and educational value statements – all provided by the
    museums – did occasionally include inaccurate or inappropriate expressions or
    information. The education context in particular, which was often sourced from
    the museum’s statement of significance, historical notes or equivalent,
    consistently required reworking by TLF educators. These educators completed
    fact checking; ensured a consistent language within and between digital
    resources; and edited descriptions and educational value statements to suit the
    audience. Teachers generally appeared to assume that the background material
    provided with the items would be accurate, given their source.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Although
    it was considered very valuable for the metadata to be drawn directly from the
    museums, and it was deemed the responsibility of the cultural organisation to
    ensure accuracy and relevance, it was also valuable to maintain TLF QA process
    as an ‘extra set of eyes’ focused on the specific needs of end users.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> (The Learning Federation, 2009, 74)</p>
  <p>The
    pilot revealed marginal use of collection resources: </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Of
    the 643 digital resources provided to schools as part of the new model of
    collaboration between TLF and the three museums, 55 digital resources were
    selected by schools to include in collaborative learning activities. Of this
    number, six resources were used more than once. </p>
  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> (The Learning Federation, 2009, 40)</p>
  <p>On the
    upside, the few things that the sampled teachers did use, they agreed were of
    sufficient quality and authority to be useful. (The Learning Federation, 2009,
    pp41-43) </p>
  <p>This
    shouldn&#39;t bring too much comfort - as despite their value, even the self-described
    technically savvy teachers targeted in the pilot were unaware of the existence
    of such resources. This indicates a failure of traditional offline marketing
    and promotion to teachers.</p>
  <h3> Segmenting
    educational users</h3>
  <p>As
    I&#39;ve argued previously, museums need to think deeply about measuring and
    learning from how visitors use their on-line content (Chan, 2008) - and basic Web
    analytics is a good place to start to look at the use of our collection. </p>
  <p>The
    period of analysis of the Powerhouse spreadable collection project was 25 weeks,
    from mid-July 2009 to mid-January 2010. This period encompasses two school
    holiday periods but also coincides with peak visitation periods for the
    Powerhouse Museum - the Sydney Design Festival and Ultimo Science Festival in
    August, and the summer holiday exhibition period of December and early January.</p>
  <p>Use
    data was gathered using Google Analytics with Javascript page tagging and
    excludes all internal traffic - including traffic from visitor devices connected
    to the Museum&#39;s network and collection kiosks in exhibition galleries. This has
    prevented any internal staff use of the collection database being reported in
    the data.</p>
  <p>Data
    has been further segmented to identify all traffic, all Australian traffic, and
    all traffic originating from NSW Department of Education (NSW DET) IP pools using
    the Network Location/Service Provider data from Google. State-based data has
    been aggregated using the Google Analytics Dimensionator addon.</p>

  <p class="caption"> Chart
    1: State breakdown of Australian Web traffic</p>
  <p>Australian
    traffic represented 41.85% of traffic to the Museum’s Web site. Unsurprisingly
    this Australian traffic is heavily skewed towards NSW (and with further
    drilldown, to Sydney). This reflects the geographic awareness of the Museum as
    well as the capacity of local Web site visitors to convert to through-the-door
    visitors. Traffic from states other than NSW (which is represented in
    proportion to population size) is collection oriented. </p>

  <p class="caption">Chart
    2: Weekly comparative collection traffic</p>
  <p>Examining
    the collection traffic in more detail shows that Australian use of the
    collection represents 31.30% of overall collection traffic. The USA represents
    26.21% and the UK, 13.95%. Seasonal trends - especially the lower volume of Internet
    traffic over the December holiday period - are clearly visible.</p>

  <p>NSW
    DET collection traffic shows an unsurprising bias towards clearly identified
    curriculum-oriented objects in the collection - gold mining, Australian history
    and space transport.</p>
  <p>Disappointingly,
    although the Museum has made considerable efforts to align itself with the
    Design &amp; Technology curriculum, the design collection is very
    under-represented. Instead, traffic for subjects in the Design &amp; Technology
    area tends to go to two bespoke resources (<i>Designers
      at Work</i> and <i>Australia Innovates</i>) on the Museum Web site. On one hand, this is positive – students who do use the Powerhouse Web site are using resources made
    specifically for them. On the other hand, it is problematic because the
    Powerhouse (as is the case for most other institutions) is not in the position
    to be able to customise all content for specific audiences in these ways.</p>

  <p class="caption">Chart
    4: Use of different on-line Powerhouse resources by NSW DET visitors</p>
  <h4>At-school use of
    search for site discovery</h4>
  <p>At
    school, visitors using the NSW DET proxy reach the Powerhouse Museum Web site
    in a number of different ways: 66.37% use <b>search,</b> 23.24% come directly from the URL or a local browser bookmark, and 9.50% come
    via referring sites. These referring sites are largely made up of the NSW DET
    Teacher and Learning Exchange portal (TALE) and school-based learning
    management systems (Moodle, etc.)</p>
  <p>In
    contrast, 91.75% of NSW DET visitors who use the collection on the same Web
    site enter via <b>search.</b> This subgroup
    of visitors (11.23% of the total NSW DET visitors) arrive on 1438 different
    landing pages, 1397 of which are within the collection database. </p>
  <p>A very
    long tail of 1,944 search terms are used, with around 6% containing 81 variants
    of &#39;powerhouse museum&#39; either on its own or with other keywords attached. This
    indicates that NSW DET visitors are using tightly constrained terms to
    intentionally reach the Powerhouse Museum, and a long tail of minor terms in a
    less focused way. They are highly collection oriented visitors, and different
    in behaviour from those from DET who visit other parts of the site (and visit
    very little else). They are coming for specific information - 133 search terms
    contain variants of &#39;gold&#39;,  likely as a result of being set particular tasks.</p>
  <h4>Out-of-school use</h4>
  <p>Currently,
    museum content is likely to be of most value to school students outside of
    school time - as a resource for homework exercises and research. Because this
    traffic comes in through private Internet service providers (ISPs), it cannot be
    easily segmented out.</p>
  <p>To attempt
    to determine what percentage of &#39;educational traffic&#39; to the museum Web site is
    &#39;out of school&#39; or from non-government schools in NSW, I have taken the two
    most popular educational resources - <i>Designers at
      Work</i> and <i>Australia Innovates</i> - and segmented their traffic to distinguish what percentage
    of their NSW traffic is from NSW Department of Education - the rest being
    either for private home use or from non-Government schools. Using the NSW DET
    schools segment, as we have seen earlier, these two sites represent nearly 60%
    of the traffic to the Powerhouse from within NSW government schools.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="chan-chart-5.png" width="500" height="354" alt="Chart 5"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Chart
    5: In-school and out-of-school use of Powerhouse Museum education microsites</p>
  <p>Here
    we see that 70.69% of traffic to these two very popular microsites combined
    occurs outside of Government schools. (The &#39;other&#39; category in the graph
    contains a long tail of 235 Internet service providers - from mobile and small
    ISPs, private companies, and marginal use by independent schools and
    universities.)</p>
  <h2>Introducing Content
    Tracking</h2>
  <p>Tynt (<a href="http://www.tynt.com/">www.tynt.com</a>) is one of several &#39;content
    tracking&#39; services. Developed initially to stop piracy, content tracking has
    now broadened its purpose as some commercial content publishers have realised
    the importance of spreadability to brand awareness and findability. Tynt
    operates in the same space as Attributor (<a href="http://www.attributor.com/">www.attributor.com</a>), Copyscape (<a href="http://www.copyscape.com/">www.copyscape.com</a>) and image tracker Tin Eye (<a href="http://www.tineye.com/">www.tineye.com</a>). Associated Press (AP) uses
    Attributor to track news content syndicated around the world. Attributor
    promotes its service on its Web site: </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Today’s
    Web is a cut and paste playground in which your articles move freely from site
    to site without regard for the original publisher. Unauthorized content reuse
    is growing over 15% a year and top newspaper and magazines are finding dozens
    of unauthorized copies for every article produced. These unauthorized copies
    siphon away your valuable audience and millions of dollars of licensing and
    advertising revenue per year.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> (Attributor,
    2010)</p>
  <p>Another
    notable tracking service which operates in the entertainment sector is Big
    Champagne <a href="http://www.bigchampagne.com/">(www.bigchampagne.com</a>). Big Champagne tracks
    consumer interactions with media content, both traditional and untraditional – such as flow of BitTorrent data across the Internet - and provides &#39;charts&#39; for
    subscribing companies. This model has been interesting for its non-enforcement
    role and the valuable intention data and ‘buzz measurement’ it gathers for
    content creators and distributors. This data, such as which particular single
    MP3s of an album is being most shared, or which movies are being spread using
    Torrents, is very valuable for content creators and publishers in understanding
    and tracking audience demand. Even if they do not intend to meet such demand,
    this behaviour tracking is valuable as market and consumer research.</p>
  <p>With
    the Big Champagne model rather than the punitive Attributor model in mind, in
    July 2009 the Powerhouse Museum started experimenting with Tynt.</p>
  <p>Tynt
    explains: </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Tynt
    Insight anonymously detects when content is copied from your site, and can help
    determine what they are doing with it. At Tynt we believe content copying can
    be beneficial to the site owner. We find that most people copy content
    innocently because they are your fans. They copy content to either preserve it
    for themselves or to share it. Half of copied content is still shared by email
    because it is still the easiest and most familiar way to share content. </p>
  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Tynt, 2010)</p>
  <p>A
    small Javascript tracking code was added to the footer of each object page.
    When modern browsers select and cut content from a tagged page to add to the
    operating system Clipboard, Javascript intercepts this browser activity and
    does two things. First, it logs the request with Tynt, and second, it appends a
    small piece of customisable text to the Clipboard copy which includes the
    source URL and an identifier code. When the content is then pasted from the
    Clipboard, it contains the customised code.</p>
  <p>For
    example, here is a piece of text copied with Tynt.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Jenny
    Bannister designed her first plastic dress in 1977 when she was invited to a

  <p class="BlockQuote">Under
    Creative Commons License: Attribution Non-Commercial</p>
  <p>The
    appended content clearly identifies the license under which the copied content
    is made available, and the &#39;Read more&#39; URL acts as a ‘welcome mat’ for readers
    to explore further. This URL allows the tracking of &#39;referrers&#39; sent by
    particular uses of the copied content if it is placed on another Web site. As
    Tynt does not collect IP data, it remains compliant with the Powerhouse’s
    privacy policy.</p>
  <p>For
    school students, it is expected that one common mode of interaction with the
    Museum&#39;s collection will be through cut &amp; paste of content into
    assignments. If this is the case, then cut &amp; paste data will be a useful
    measure of &#39;appropriateness&#39; as a piece of content that is frequently cut &amp;
    pasted would imply a direct usefulness that is harder to determine for material
    that is &#39;just read&#39; (page view). An analogy would be the contrasting of circulation
    data in an academic library (the equivalent of page views) compared with
    citation figures (usefulness).</p>
  <h3>The results</h3>
  <p>During
    a six-month period, 20,749 copies were made: 5% of these copies were images – predominantly thumbnails and, curiously, the Museum&#39;s corporate logo; 36%
    (7,601) were copies of 7 words or less in length. Tynt calls these &#39;search
    copies&#39; and implies that their likely use was for use in search. These search
    copies do not have licence and linkback text appended to them. The remaining
    58% (12,608) were copies of greater than 7 words and thus had license and
    linkback details added to them. These 12,608 copies contained nearly 3 million
    copied words (2,906,330 words).</p>
  <p>Comparing
    basic page view data between Tnyt and Google Analytics revealed only minor
    differences in figures. These fall within an acceptable margin of error and are
    likely to be attributable to two key differences in tracking methodologies.
    First, Tynt does not allow the exclusion of views internal to the Powerhouse.
    Second, the Tynt Javascript is likely to not be as cross-browser compatible as
    the Google tracker. </p>

  <p class="captionTable">Table
    4: Cut &amp; paste use of Powerhouse Museum collection objects</p>
  <p>In
    contrast to previous tables showing collection records ordered by the number of
    views, this table shows a different picture of objects ordered by the number of
    copies. It also shows the number of copies they have generated, as well as the
    percentage of views resulting in copying. </p>
  <p>Column
    six shows the percentage of traffic to that object record coming from Australia
    gathered via Google Analytics. Of the top ten ‘most copied’, only five have
    more than 50% Australian traffic, and only three have any significant traffic
    from within the NSW DET segment.</p>
  <p>Let&#39;s
    take a look at some objects in greater detail to see what is being copied, as
    well as where those copies are ending up.</p>
  <h3>Framed gold mining
    license, 1853</h3>
  <p>This
    is the most viewed object when measured both by Google and by Tynt. Using the
    Google data, we can see that 95.14% of the traffic visiting this object is
    Australian, 11.41% from NSW DET addresses. There is a strong case that the
    majority of traffic to this object is from Australian school students and
    drilling down into the Australian data in Google Analytics we can see that it
    is mainly NSW (58.76%) and Victorian (25.14%) traffic: </p>
  <p>78% of
    copies (233) were of text greater than 7 words in length, 15% of 7 words or
    less, and 7% images. Using Tynt&#39;s basic heatmapping tool, it is possible to see
    the popular sections of the document that were copied. In total, Tynt has
    counted 45,748 words copied from this object record in the time period – primarily from the 308-word-long Statement of Significance and 102 words from
    the object’s History Notes.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a><img src="chan-fig-1.png" width="500" height="1334" alt="Figure 1"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig1:
    Heat map of gold mining license collection record</p>
  <p>However,
    this object also appears in three other Web sites operated by the Powerhouse.
    Whilst these have not been tracked with Tynt, we can still look at the traffic
    that they collect for comparison. <i>D&#39;Hub</i> (formerly Design Hub) presents
    the same object record in full and received 33 views for the same period. <i>About NSW</i> shows only the Statement of Significance and received 30 views. The third, the <i>NSW Migration Heritage Centre</i> has taken the object record
    and image and broadened its context whilst retaining about 50% of the original
    record verbatim. This record was viewed 2,794 times, 9% of which was from the
    NSW DET segment. Both <i>About NSW</i> and <i>NSW Migration Heritage Centre</i> versions contain linkbacks to
    the original Powerhouse record. The extraordinary volume of views on the <i>Migration Heritage Centre</i> Web site proportional to its overall Web site traffic is a
    result of heavy packaging for education use and effective marketing of a small
    group of resources.</p>
  <h2>What Gets &#39;Cut and
    Pasted&#39;?</h2>
  <p>The
    heat maps for these popular objects generally show the value of a statement of
    significance for an object. The Collections Council of Australia updated the
    definition of &#39;significance&#39; in Significance 2.0:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">A
    statement of significance is a reasoned, readable summary of the values,
    meaning and importance of an item or collection. It is more than a description
    of what the item or collection looks like. A statement of significance
    summarises how and why the item or collection is important. It is supported by
    research and evidence assembled through the assessment process.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">The
    statement of significance incorporates all of the elements that contribute to
    the meaning of items and collections including appearance, fabric, design,
    context, environment, history, provenance, uses, function, social values and
    intangible associations.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Drawing
    all these values and attributes together into a statement of significance is an
    effective way of communicating and sharing knowledge about why an item or
    collection is important, and why it has a place in a public collection. (<i>Collections Council of Australia, 2009</i>)</p>
  <p>Where
    these statements exist, they are the most copied sections of text - confirming
    that they are useful and &#39;audience-focused&#39;. However, where these do not exist,
    the basic object &#39;description&#39; is popular. The three objects that share
    significant Australian and NSW DET audiences - the Gold Mining License, the
    Gold-washing Cradle and Margaret Dodd&#39;s Blue Holden - show much the same
    behaviour as other objects that have been cut &amp; pasted.</p>

  <h3>Where does &#39;cut and
    pasted&#39; content end up?</h3>
  <p>The
    vast majority of content that is cut &amp; pasted does not end up on the Web
    (or has its tracking codes stripped). This is not unexpected as most users will
    paste content into e-mails or, in the case of students and researchers, into
    static text documents. </p>
  <p>Tynt
    relies on click tracking (in contrast to other services such as Copyscape that
    use deep Web trawling) to discover the destination. It is not surprising that
    much of the copied content is not &#39;clicked through&#39; - if it doesn’t get cut and
    pasted into a Web site, then it can’t be tracked.</p>
  <p>However,
    that which has generated click throughs has ended up in some unexpected places.
    Quite a few separate eBay auctions and a Craigslist want-item used words (and
    retained the tracking code) from Museum object records - a chemist&#39;s sign
    (since removed by eBay), a vintage camera, some Grant Featherstone chairs, a
    meat safe from a farm, a teaspoon, a Sesame Street Muppet doll, a Japanese toy
    car, and some plastic brick toys akin to Lego. A seller on the Argentinian
    equivalent to eBay, MercadoLibre, used an entire collection record on their
    auction of a 1970s TV set. <a href="http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-60222451-televisor-jvc-videosphere-ano-70-japones-totalmente-redondo-_JM">(http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-60222451-televisor-jvc-videosphere-ano-70-japones-totalmente-redondo-_JM</a>). The use of the Museum’s
    descriptions in auctions is likely a means of ‘validating’ their significance
    to prospective buyers and thus, the seller hopes, increasing the sale price.</p>
  <p>Other
    tracked copies ended up in blogs and forums - including some like this clog
    enthusiast who has a go at the dry formal tone of the Museum&#39;s descriptions: </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">But
    that&#39;s &#34;museumspeak&#34; for you. All those clinical observations are
    well and good, but it doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to see that these shoes
    are FABULOUS! (<a href="http://everycloghasitsday.typepad.com/every-clog-has-its-day/2009/10/remembrance-of-clogs-past.html">http://everycloghasitsday.typepad.com/every-clog-has-its-day/2009/10/remembrance-of-clogs-past.html</a>). </p>
  <p>The
    Hall-Scott A-7-A Aero Engine (/?irn=76898) is a less popular object, but one
    that has generated a high views to linkbacks ratio (26.85%). This object has
    had 475 words of text cut &amp; pasted - some of them into Wikipedia into an
    article where the tracking link has stayed in place. This link has generated 78
    views back to the source record of 285 total views for the period, with 12.72%
    of the traffic being Australian (57.23% USA). This demonstrates both the value
    of content being used in Wikipedia as well as the value of tracking such
    content copying.</p>
  <h2>Mashups</h2>
  <p>During
    the research period, the Powerhouse also made the entirety of its collection
    metadata available for download. Approximately 10% of the 1,966 visitors to the
    collection download page (/collection/database/download.php) downloaded a
    version of the collection data.</p>
  <p>Largely
    driven by well promoted Australian mashup contests and developer events, these
    downloads have resulted in four known mashups being created using the dataset – all currently part of the Mashup Australia contest. The most-well-devloped of
    these was Flip Explorer (<a href="http://mashupaustralia.org/mashups/flip-explorer/">http://mashupaustralia.org/mashups/flip-explorer/</a>)
    which was highly commended in the contest. Flip Explorer is a kiosk-style
    collection browser. </p>
  <p>Further
    mashups may emerge through the NSW State Government’s Apps4NSW contest which
    closes in February 2010. The data was also made available on request to the
    Science Museum’s (London) Cosmic Collections project.</p>
  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  <p>The
    raw data in this study is not without significant limitations.</p>
  <p>Tynt
    data is unable to be easily date segmented at this stage. The current Tynt
    Public Beta package offers only a 7-day or 30-day rolling view of data or an
    &#39;all data&#39; view. Further, the inability to segment by geography prevents
    definitive correlation between user types - and certainly not to the level that
    Google Analytics allows. </p>
  <p>The
    re-use tracking that Tynt offers is limited in the context of museums because
    of the predominantly off-line value of museum content - the primary destination
    and use being in written essays and research papers. Museum collection content
    is unlikely to be replicated on-line manually via cut and paste - although for
    the Powerhouse there is obvious reuse occurring on auction sites and in casual
    contexts.</p>
  <p>Similarly,
    the Google Analytics data has a number of caveats. Not all browsers will have
    executed the tracking script, and some may have blocked the cookies that Google
    sets. Because the data used does not draw on measures of &#39;uniqueness&#39; (unique
    visits, unique page views), these issues have been minimized, but they need to
    be kept in mind if replicating this experiment.</p>
  <p>The
    service provider data that has allowed the segmentation of the NSW DET traffic
    from other traffic is based upon Google Analytics&#39; IP aggregation technologies.
    It may exclude some NSW DET computers, and it is unable to be determined
    whether this traffic includes the NSW DET Digital Education Revolution laptops.
    These Government-supplied free laptops are currently being distributed to
    senior high school students across the state and are currently blocked from
    accessing the Powerhouse Museum Web site. Fortunately, these have only just
    begun to roll out, and thus have only marginal impact on the use data thus far.
    As these free laptops continue to use a filtered Internet connection even in a
    home-use situation, the Powerhouse is working to have this arbitrary site
    blocking removed. A look inside the referring sites shows a significant number
    of individual school intranets, indicating that the service provider data from
    Google is effectively picking up internal school computers.</p>
  <h2>Recommendations and Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This
    study reaffirms the belief that collection data is valuable to a broad
    population of users. Yet without significant promotional efforts into the
    education sector, they will remain underused by this key user group. It is
    highly likely that the success of expensive ‘showcase sites’ that are the most
    common type of museum Web content made specifically for education users is due
    to their marketing budgets - something which collection databases rarely have. </p>
  <p>Traditionally,
    significant (and costly) awareness campaigns have been reserved for
    current or imminent exhibitions and programs. The on-line collection re-use data
    from the Powerhouse suggests that an increase in use and re-use by students of on-line
    collection information will only be achieved if the Museum runs a
    significant awareness campaign around topic areas in its collection
    database that are of particular relevance to the education sector.</p>
  <p>Moving
    now to the methodology, the study shows that the combined approach of standard Web
    site analytics with a content tracking service such as Tynt provides a new set
    of audience insights. Whilst this is still in an early stage, it is possible to
    see considerable differences in user behaviour across the Powerhouse
    collection, and it has identified some specific patterns of user interest which
    now need to be addressed and served. Like all quantitative research, this data
    needs to be accompanied by complementary qualitative studies.</p>
  <p>Already
    the study has revealed a small group of NSW schools which are active users of
    the Museum’s collection database, and now qualitative work can be undertaken to
    determine how this group of users mine the collection data, and whether they
    find it meets their teaching needs. The sheer volume of content manually cut
    &amp; pasted from the collection documentation over the research period is
    phenomenal. To a degree, this validates the Powerhouse’s
    move to making collection documentation usable by third parties by explicitly
    licensing the textual documentation under a liberal Creative Commons license – especially in the unique Australian statutory licensing environment where this
    cut &amp; paste usage would trigger statutory licensing liabilities in a
    school.</p>
  <p>It is
    too early to be able to explore the effectiveness of making collection data
    available to the general public using programmatic means (APIs). Whilst APIs
    clearly serve a valuable purpose in connecting up collections within the
    library, archive and museum (LAM) sector, the value of this outside of the
    sector is still uncertain. Again, it would seem that very traditional
    promotional strategies need to be employed to interest non-LAM developers in
    cultural data and excite them about the potential opportunities.</p>
  <p>For
    all in the cultural sector, the pressure to achieve more with
    less intensifies. Staff are expected to do all they have done in the
    past as well as stay abreast of technological and museological
    changes and potential, and actively participate in the ever-changing
    social media space. For most of us, it is not possible to work harder - so
    we need to work smarter. Similarly, the funding we have to work
    with seems ever-diminishing.</p>
  <p>In the
    event that resources are not diverted to developing or promoting on-line
    collections, then at least we now have tools to begin to measure the use
    and re-use of the records we have - so that we can direct the resources we
    have to what is useful for schools.</p>
  <p>Those
    considering diverting resources from expensive and short-term ‘showcase sites’
    towards improving their raw collection data for the education sector need to
    consider the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Does
      opening up raw collection content make it more attractive and useful to
      education audiences?</li>
    <li>Are
      educational users sophisticated enough to make use of this raw content
      effectively?</li>
    <li>If
      they are not, then how can museums help increase the digital literacy of the
      education sector to make the most of this content?</li>
  </ul>
