        Abstract
        </h3>
        <p class="AbstractText">Europeana, Europe&#39;s multimedia on-line library, museum
          and archive, currently grants access to the cultural holdings of Europe&#39;s
          twenty-seven member states. It includes more than 5.5 million books, maps,
          recordings, photographs, archival documents, paintings, and films from national
          libraries and cultural institutions. Europeana’s goal is to open up new ways of
          exploring Europe&#39;s heritage through free access to the collections and
          treasures via a single Web portal that is available in all the official EU
          languages
        (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/doc/factsheets/071-europeana-en.pdf" target="_blank">http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/ doc/factsheets /071-europeana-en.pdf</a>). </p>
        <p class="AbstractText">          Europeana is currently in prototype; the full service will launch later in
          2010. The operational Europeana portal will provide improved search functionality
          and access to over 10 million objects. A follow-up release in 2011 will
          showcase multilingual and semantic Web features.          ATHENA&#39;s role is to harvest holdings from Europe&#39;s museums and similar
          collections across the cultural sector, and to facilitate their integration
        into Europeana. </p>
        <p class="AbstractText">This paper will discuss this ambitious project from the point
          of view of the organizational strategies required to coordinate the
          pan-European, ATHENA Network, as well as the thesauri and multilingual developments
          that the partners are currently dealing with towards the integration of digital
          content. </p>

<h3>What are ATHENA and Europeana?</h3>
<p>Europeana.eu is the gateway to the distributed European
  cultural heritage resources, facilitating access to related textual, image,
  video and sound objects from museums, libraries, archives and audiovisual
  collections across Europe. </p>
<p>Clearly the European museum landscape is rich in a great
    variety of standards, necessitating a coherent policy and interoperability of
    standards. A survey has been carried out by Work Group 3 of ATHENA and the
    results have already been released; (<a href="http://www.athenaeurope.org/index.php?en/149/athena-deliverables-and-documents">http://www.athenaeurope.org/index.php?en/149/athena-deliverables-and-documents</a>)
    a comprehensive publication that is one of the project&#39;s milestone
    deliverables. This survey describes the analysis and comparison of
    existing dictionaries, terminologies, thesauri, classifications, taxonomies
    etc. used by museums in a cross-domain perspective. It will then be compared
    with those adopted by the other sectors of cultural heritage, in order to
    facilitate the synchronization and integration of cultural holdings across the
    different sectors as they are ingested into Europeana.</p>
<p>  This work is currently being carried out in the different Work Groups in the
  ATHENA network, led by Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage. These
  responsibilities include a complex mapping of distributed objects across Europe
  and the development of technical solutions such as the ingestion tools that
  facilitate the seamless integration of holdings into Europeana.</p>
<p>The ATHENA Network is represented by the national contact
    points who have been appointed to provide guidance and to help potential museum
    providers as well as at coordinating efforts at a national level.
    Representatives from Europe&#39;s museum community come from Azerbaijan, Belgium,
    Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
    Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland,
    Romania, Russia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The
    call is still open, and museums interested in joining the network are invited
    to contact their National Contact Point.<br/>
  (<a href="http://www.athenaeurope.org/index.php?en/132/national-contact-points">http://www.athenaeurope.org/index.php?en/132/national-contact-points</a>).</p>
<p>Since its inception, the European Commission has given significant
    political and financial support to the project. Europeana v1.0 is a project that
    is currently putting the organisational, technical and business structures for
    the operational Europeana service in place. The European Commission has also co-funded
    a number of European projects –that help the different heritage sectors tackle
    issues such as, metadata standardization, aggregating content and IPR. The goal
    is to improve on-line access to the cultural and scientific heritage, and
  integrate it for delivery through Europeana.</p>
<p>ATHENA is one such project. It mainly targets museums and
    is concerned to support museums in contributing their content to Europeana in
    several ways: by distributing and supporting current data standards relevant
    for museums, by providing tools to allow data mapping and to upload data into
  the ATHENA repository from where it will be uploaded to Europeana. </p>
<p>The ATHENA Network continues, and extends the best
    practice-driven scenarios developed by the MINERVA network; both coordinated by
  the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage under the eContentPlus Programme (<a href="http://www.athenaeurope.org/">http://www.athenaeurope.org</a>)</p>

<p>Europeana, Europe’s digital library, museum and archive, grants
    access to the cultural holdings of Europe&#39;s twenty seven member states,
    including books, maps, recordings, photographs, archival documents, paintings
    and films from national libraries, museums and galleries, archives, libraries,
    audiovisual collections, and cultural institutions (See as well the Europeana
  Fact sheet: <a href="http://group.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=6773c7f5-613c-4d9f-ab6d-95ed10c323bc&amp;groupId=10128">http://group.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=6773c7f5-613c-4d9f-ab6d-95ed10c323bc&amp;groupId=10128</a>).</p>
<p>As a prestigious portal with a recognisable brand,
    Europeana showcases cultural content in a European context to an international audience.
    It adds value to the content by juxtaposing related images, texts, videos and
    audio items, ‘repatriating’ content that is geographically dispersed into a
    single, coherent and contextual virtual space. The multilingual interface makes
    it possible for users to search in their native language and retrieve objects
    that are otherwise inaccessible to them. Furthermore, deep Web content will be
    exposed to search engine crawlers through Europeana. Additionally, as Europeana
    partners active in the different professional networks across the cultural
    sector, they share knowledge, best practice and technological innovation
    developed by the network. The critical issues that digital libraries are
    currently facing include: interoperability, IPR, and the semantic Web. For
    Europeana, multilingualism is an additional challenge that the partners are
    committed to resolve where the goal of Europeana is to open up new ways of
    exploring Europe’s heritage through free access to the diversity of Europe&#39;s cultural
    and scientific heritage integrated in a Web portal available in all official EU
  languages. </p>
<p>A typical search will produce query results organised into
    four type categories; texts, images, videos and audio files. Faceted browsing
    of results also extends to browsing by language, country, content provider or
  date. </p>
<p>Achieving cross-domain interoperability has been
    Europeana’s first challenge, and this has been met with the adoption of a
    low-barrier data model. This is currently ESE, the Europeana Semantic Elements
    specifications - v3.2.1 (<a href="http://group.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=c56f82a4-8191-42fa-9379-4d5ff8c4ff75&amp;groupId=10602">http://group.europeana.eu/c/document_library/ get_file?uuid=c56f82a4-8191-42fa-9379-4d5ff8c4ff75&amp;groupId=10602</a>),
    a data model based on Dublin Core with additional Europeana qualifiers that
    enable portal-specific functionalities. Normalisation of the data is also a
  necessary step to achieve homogenous access to the content. </p>
<p><span class="BodyTextChar">IPR restrictions are proving to be
    some of the more challenging issues with regards to providing on-line access to
    content. At present Europeana tackles IPR by harvesting and indexing only the
    descriptive metadata associated with the digital objects as well</span> <span class="BodyTextChar">as thumbnails of the objects, but not the digital object
    itself. The user is directed to the content provider’s Web site in order to
    view the object in detail under the terms of use agreed between the provider
  and the rights holder. </span></p>
<p>With the aim of providing multilingual access to Europe’s
    diverse cultural heritage, Europeana currently makes all the main pages, i.e.
    navigation, search, retrieval and display interfaces, available in all 23
    official EU languages: Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian,
    Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian,
    Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, and Swedish,
    plus Catalan and Icelandic. However, the searches will currently only retrieve
    results that match exactly the search keywords – translation on the fly will be
    developed as part of the next phase of the project. However, dates – 1848 - or names
    - Mozart, da Vinci – will deliver results in every language. Other
    functionalities currently include the possibility to save and revisit previous
    searches, share a result with a friend, and add tags to the object for personal
  use in &#39;My Europeana&#39;. </p>
<p><span class="BodyTextChar">There are other issues, mainly in regard
    to the composition of the content which is still geographically and
    thematically restricted. At the launch of the prototype, nearly 50% of the
    content was located in French institutions, with 77% of the content as images,
    and only 2.5% was video while 0.5% was audio. The current focus for content ingestion
    aims to introduce material from European countries represented with less than
    1% in Europeana, and in particular video and audio materials. This is outlined
  in the Europeana content strategy - see:</span> (<a href="https://version1.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=b7b24d45-116e-442f-8b85-fbf931ebee72&amp;groupId=10602">https://version1.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=b7b24d45-116e-442f-8b85-fbf931ebee72&amp;groupId=10602</a>). </p>
<p>Despite these issues, users’ response to the portal was
    overwhelming from the first day of its launch ,and their testimonials were very
    appreciative: “Sirs<i><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">, Europeana.eu is a discovery of a new
    world of culture and the Arts. Europeana is the universalization of the Arts
    that until now was the privilege of few Europeans. </span>Congratulations</i>.”
    The first on-line user survey was run between May 6 and 26, 2009; overall
    satisfaction was reported as very high. Out of the 3,204 respondents, 60%<span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> rated features and functions as “good” or “excellent”. </span>Europeana
    aspires to be a useful resource for all types of users, irrespective of where
    they come from or their motivation for visiting the portal. The current
    prototype is the result of an extensive iterative process of design, user
    feedback and user testing. Logfile analysis, focus groups, media lab testing,
    and a dedicated user testing panel are instruments Europeana uses to inform the
  development of the features and functionalities of the portal. </p>
<p>The Europeana prototype was launched by the European Commission
    President Manuel Barroso in November 2008 during a session of the Council of
    Ministers of Culture. The soft launch of the first operational portal – the
    Rhine Release - is planned for summer 2010, for testing over a number of weeks
    before the formal launch in the autumn. The operational service will have
    improved search and browsing functionalities and give access to 10m digital
    objects. An important addition will be the development of a Europeana API
    infrastructure for embedding Europeana functionality into third party
  applications. </p>
<p>The next phase of Europeana will be the Danube release in
    2011. Its goals include providing semantic enhancement of the metadata,
    multilingual search in more than one language, and greater personalization. One
    of the developments underway already is a richer data model than ESE, one that
    will be able to accommodate domain-specific knowledge and use the richer
    information to provide enhanced usability of the digital objects. Furthermore,
    in this release, User-Generated Content (annotations, tags, etc.) will be added,
    as well a suite of new tools and services such as multimedia annotation tools,
    e-books on demand, search and location of objects using spatio-temporal
    elements, etc. A large network of European and overseas academics, researchers
    and experts are collaborating in these developments. Europeana is firmly
    committed to Open Source software to enable re-use of code and innovative
    application development, thus putting publicly funded research results into a
  broader context. </p>
<p>In order to meet the ambitious goals of Europeana, cross-domain
    and cross-European collaboration is necessary. The European cultural heritage
    sector is widely represented in the EDL Foundation, the organisation
    responsible for Europeana’s governance and strategy. The leading international
    and European cultural heritage professional associations participate in the
    Foundation’s Management Board (IASA, ICOM-Europe, European Museum Forum,
    FIAT/IFTA, CENL, ACE, etc.) and reflect the commitment of the cultural heritage
    domains to Europeana’s aims and objectives. The extensive networks of content
    providers are brought together in the Council for Content Providers and
  Aggregators, which elects members to the Board.</p>
<p>Europeana is particularly dependent on the latter for the
    harvesting, integration and harmonization of large amounts of metadata coming
    from hundreds of individual museums, libraries, archives and audiovisual
    collections across Europe. Europeana is not resourced to take on the process
    centrally, and it does not have the specialist sectoral expertise. It is more
    effective to work with a small number of existing or new national aggregators (e.g.
    culture.fr, culturaitalia) or cross-border domain aggregators (e.g. The
    European Library). The projects funded by the European Commission are
    responsible for the harvesting of content and the harmonisation of metadata, and
    for mapping them to ESE and making them available to Europeana. Thematic content
    providers include ATHENA, the network primarily established to represent museum
    content; Europeana Local, to harvest content from regional collections; the
    European Film Gateway, to represent cinema content and filmographic data;
    EUscreen to handle  TV archives; Archives Portal Europea [APENET] to draw in
    content from national archives; BHL- Europe to represent biodiversity heritage
    content; Europeana Judaica ,a network harvesting thematic content to document
    the Jewish influence in European urban history; and the MIMO Network to represent
    the musical instruments sector. These projects create their own portals, or in
    cases such as ATHENA and Europeana Local, build ‘dark’ portals; that is, they harvest,
  and store the content solely in order to make it available through Europeana. </p>
<p>Collaboration with content providers and aggregators in
    Europeana is not confined to the collection of the data. Importantly, Europeana
    coordinates activities across projects and European aggregators in order to
    leverage resources and propose scalable solutions to the major issues involved
    with making European content accessible on-line. Shared across all of the
    networks are the issues of multilingual access, IPR, interoperability, users’
    needs, and the underlying business models that will make digitised content accessible
  in a sustainable way. </p>

<h2>ATHENA and the Museum Sector </h2>
<p>Of particular interest to the museum community is ATHENA
    (Access to cultural heritage networks across Europe), an eContentPlus-funded
    Best Practice Network targeting mainly the museums’ sector and aiming at
    establishing conditions for lowering the barrier for museums to introduce their
    content into Europeana. Led by the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage, this
    is the network that supports museums and keeps them up to date on current data
    and harvesting standards, and provides a tool to map their data with LIDO, a
    metadata standard for museums based on CDWAlite, museumdat and SPECTRUM. Athena
    aggregates museum data and facilitates their integration into Europeana. Therefore
    ATHENA&#39;s responsibilities (in tandem with other Europeana networks) included
    first and foremost a complex mapping of distributed objects across Europe, as
    well as the development of technical solutions; such as an ingestion tool that
  facilitates the seamless integration of holdings into Europeana. </p>

<p><span class="BodyTextChar">ATHENA&#39;s undertaking has been
    broken down into a series of tasks; each task is managed by members from one of
  the seven work packages responsible for the different facets of the project</span>.</p>
<h3>WP1 - Project management, monitoring and evaluation </h3>
<p>This work package develops and maintains ATHENA&#39;s
    administrative and organizational activities and policies. Coordinated by the
    Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali (MiBAC), Italy, this group
    coordinates with the European Commission to ensure dissemination of information
    among the partners, implements the ATHENA quality and assessment plan, and
  develops strategies to recruit museums across Europe. </p>

<h3>WP2 - Awareness and dissemination: extending the network and promoting the
  service</h3>
<p>This work package introduces ATHENA to European museums
    and other cultural institutions; alerting them as to how they may benefit from
    the network services; such as sharing best practice, and providing training on how
    they can publish their own collections in Europeana. Coordinated by the
    Institut für Museumsforschung der Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin Preußischer
    Kulturbesitz (SPK), Germany, and Stowarzyszenie Miedzynarodowe Centrum
    Zarzadzania Informacja (ICIMSS), Poland, this Work Group develops publications
    - both print and electronic – that describe ATHENA&#39;s actions, including &#39;how
    to&#39; scenarios for museums to follow in order to coordinate their own activities
  with the ATHENA network. </p>
<p>Together with WP1, WP3 and WP7 (described below), this
    working package organized during the winter of 2010 a series of training
    workshops for partners to learn how to prepare their collections for induction
    into the Europenana platform. These workshops were held in Rome - streamed live
    - and Berlin, and Webcasts were made available on the ATHENA portal so that
    partners and future partners could follow the steps required in preparing their
  data and metadata. </p>
<p>In addition, this group promotes the project both in
    Europe and beyond – including presenting ATHENA at this conference: the Museums
  and Web conference in Denver, 2010. </p>

<h3>WP3 - Identifying standards and developing recommendations </h3>
<p>One of the more formidable tasks was undertaken by this
    work package; to review the different standards in use by museums, to facilitate
    their mapping to a common metadata standard, and to assess the requirements for
    the persistent identification of digital objects and collections. Work Package
    3 was also responsible for producing the tools needed to support the conversion
    of museums data into an appropriate common harvesting format for Europeana. The
    standards group was coordinated by the Royal Museums of Arts and History
  (RMAH), Belgium, together with the Collections Trust, United Kingdom.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3>WP4 - Integration of existing data structure into the EDL </h3>
<p>Coordinated by Michael-Culture (Aisbl), International
    Association under Belgian Law, Work Package 4 is concerned with the different
    terminologies used in museums. As there are many institutional vocabularies,
    only a few common terminologies, and even fewer multi-lingual vocabularies
    available, the first task of this work package was to conduct a survey on
    available terminology resources. The next step was to broaden and develop
    recommendations for future developments for the integration of the various terminology
    resources used by museums. The members of the group focused on thesauri and
    multilingual issues and are currently working on possible alignments of
    terminologies in use by museums. To support their use, the vocabularies are
    being deployed into SKOS-driven architecture. (See discussion below on
    standards). Work Package 4 also continues to work on the integration of
    terminologies and thesauri and continues to develop existing multilingual
  tools. </p>

<h3>WP5 - Coordination of contents </h3>
<p>This work package, coordinated by the Ministero per i Beni
    e le Attività Culturali (MiBAC), Italy<br/>
  Institute of Communication and Computer Systems-National Technical University
  of Athens, ICCS-NTUA, Greece, manages the digital content contributed by the
  participating cultural institutions, supporting their different kinds of content
  and preparing them for their seamless induction into Europeana. ATHENA&#39;s policy
  was to select one or two national organizations per country to manage and support
  the participation of other content providers in their country. One of the main
  objectives of this work package was the responsibility for identifying national
  content, developing a common work flow and ensuring incorporation into the
  common standard to be used for European museums. </p>

<h3>WP6 - Analysis of IPR issues and definition of possible solutions </h3>
<p>Coordinated by Packed, Belgium, and Panepistemion Patron,

    took on the unenviable responsibility of identifying legal constraints in the
    national legislations of EU Member States that could prevent European museums from
    publishing their content in Europeana. Currently there are intense policy
    discussions taking place across the ATHENA network, and it falls to this group
    to propose working solutions. In practical terms,</span> <span class="BodyTextChar">and to avoid duplicating efforts and resources, its
    activities include coordinating efforts with the other Europeana projects
    working in on IPR issues (with a special focus on &#34;Europeana: the European

    these models to European museums. The group also investigates emerging
    standards, collective licensing models, and open access environments. The group
    is also looking at state-of-the-art technologies for DRM systems, for IPR
  protection and management by museums and other cultural organizations.</span></p>

<h3>WP7 - Development of tools to map data from different data structures to a
  joint data-model and to ingest data </h3>
<p>Coordinated by the Institute of Communication and Computer
    Systems - National Technical University of Athens), ICCS-NTUA, Greece, and the Ministrstvo
    za Kulturo Republike Slovenije (MKRS), Slovenia, this is the technical Work
    Group whose work is based on the metadata standard which has been agreed on by
    WP 3 and the terminologies proposed to be used by WP 4. WP 7 develops practical
    tools which allow the mapping of data to the metadata standard agreed (LIIDO)
    and the uploading of data to the ATHENA repository, from where it can be
    uploaded to Europeana to apply terminologies to the metadata delivered by the
  institutions.</p>

<h2>Standards and Tools Which Have Been Developed in ATHENA </h2>
<p>Besides the intense discussion currently taking place
    amongst the ATHENA partners on IPR issues, a major development in Europeana is
    the support of development to reach consensus on common standards in the museum
    sector. ATHENA has taken on the responsibility to support the development of a
    common harvesting standard for museums. Athena&#39;s activities are based on the
    work which has been done in the US by developing <span class="BodyTextChar">CDWAlite</span>,
  the German museumdat, and the SPECTRUM standard from the UK.</p>
<p>Clearly the European museum landscape is rich in a great
    variety of standards, necessitating a coherent policy and interoperability of common
    standards. The survey carried out by Work Package 3 showed that these are the
    most relevant standards for aggregating metadata into a joined portal, starting
  with the following standards:</p>
<h3><span class="BodyTextChar">CDWAlite</span></h3>
<p>CDWA Lite is an XML schema to describe core records for
    works of art and material culture based on the Categories for the Description
    of Works of Art (CDWA) and Cataloguing Cultural Objects: A Guide to Describing
  Cultural Works and Their Images (CCO) (<a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/standards/cdwa/cdwalite.html">http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/standards/cdwa/cdwalite.html</a>).</p>
<h3>museumdat</h3>
<p>museumdat is a harvesting format optimized for retrieval
    and publication, meant to deliver automatically core data to museum portals. It
    builds largely upon the data format CDWA Lite developed in the US by the Getty,
    the Visual Resources Association and others, with a specific focus on arts.
    museumdat now applies for all kinds of object classes, e.g. cultural,
    technology or natural history, and is compatible with the reference model of
    the international documentation committee CIDOC-CRM (ISO 21127). museumdat  is
    an outcome of the work of Fachgruppe Dokumentation des Deutschen Museumsbundes
  (DMB) (<a href="http://www.museumdat.org/">http://www.museumdat.org</a>).</p>
<h3> spectrum</h3>
<p> (<a href="http://www.collectionstrust.org.uk/spectrum">http://www.collectionstrust.org.uk/spectrum</a>).</p>
<p>Within the ATHENA project and in close cooperation with a
    trans-Atlantic Work Group aiming at integrating <span class="BodyTextChar">CDWAlite </span>and museumdat into one standard and the 2009 newly established CIDOC Work
    Group “Data exchange and data harvesting” with the UK SPECTRUM, the new
  standard LIDO is being developed. </p>
<h3>LIDO </h3>
<p>  (Lightweight information describing objects -
  currently v0.8) is now in use by ATHENA - to be launched in the spring of 2011.</p>
<h3>LIDO, Lightweight Information Describing Objects </h3>
<p>(<a href="http://museums.wikia.com/wiki/Berliner_Herbsttreffen_zur_Museumsdokumentation_2009">http://museums.wikia.com/wiki/Berliner_Herbsttreffen_zur_Museumsdokumentation_2009</a>)</p>
<p>LIDO is poised to become one of the central solutions recommended
    by the ATHENA Work Groups. Within the hundreds of dispersed museums across
    Europe, and the different kinds of museum, each institution has its own rules
    on how and which data is recorded about objects. In order to share data with
    other institutions, the one thing we agree on is that there is a need to agree
    on a common standard. In order to express, deliver, exchange, and harvest
    information in machine-readable form and to be able to upload data
    automatically to Europeana, the decision was taken to use the LIDO-format. The
    LIDO standard is able to express a wide variety of information that identifies
  unique objects and understands why a particular object is held in any specific museum. </p>
<p><span class="BodyTextChar">LIDO stands for “Lightweight
    Information Describing Objects”: and is a metadata format that publishes core
    data from museum objects in portals. It is based on CDWAlite – see:</span> (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/standards/cdwa/cdwalite.html">http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/standards/cdwa/cdwalite.html</a></span><a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/standards/cdwa/cdwalite.html"></a>) <span class="BodyTextChar">and museumdat</span> - see (<a href="http://www.museumdat.org/">http://www.museumdat.org</a>) <span class="BodyTextChar">and has been discussed and enriched with relevant information
  from the UK SPECTRUM-XML by the ATNENA Work Group 3. </span></p>
<p>ATHENA partners may map directly to ESE or to LIDO. Like
    all other content providers and aggregators delivering content to Europeana,
    ATHENA will make museum metadata mapped to the ESE specifications available at
    the first stage. Data mapped to LIDO will be made available to Europeana when
  the new Europeana Data Model is implemented. </p>
<p>By applying the LIDO standard, developed in the museum
    community, ATHENA will be able to provide museum-quality data that will be
    richer, and consequently more easily queried in Europeana. Until the Europeana
    platform is able to accommodate museum data, partner institutions will be
    instructed to upload their content into Athena, and museum content will be maintained
    there; with a copy to be transformed into the ESE format for uploading into
    Europeana. As soon as the new EUROPEANA data format has been finalized, ATHENA
    will be able to deliver the data in the prescribed format without the partners
    having to re-send their data - as long as they were mapped to LIDO in the first
  place.</p>
<p>One of ATHENA&#39;s main focuses at
    the time of writing (January 2010) is the development of the harvesting
    protocols that will enable museums to seamlessly upload their content into Europeana
    via ATHENA. A centralized infrastructure has been built by the Technical University
    of Athens to allow for the harvesting of the metadata, their normalization and
    harmonization and mapping to LIDO and ESE, and their export to the ESE format
    via an OAI-PMH repository that handles XML files. The service is Web based, as is
    the administration interface. Content providers upload their metadata directly
    into the platform, where they are responsible for the mapping and where they
    can also visualise how their content will look on Europeana using a simulator
    tool; the Europeana content checker is also embedded in the central ATHENA
  infrastructure via an API. </p>
<p>Representatives from Athena&#39;s national contact points in
    each country were invited to join training sessions and will consequently be
    able to offer support for the uploading process to their own content providers.
    A Help Desk has been set up for this purpose. Potential content providers are welcome
    to get in touch with their national contact point where they will receive login
  information to register for the ATHENA tool. </p>
<p>The next stage is to map the specific museum data set from
    its current data fields to the LIDO schema according to Athena recommendations.
    A comprehensive mapping between the two schemas is not necessary; only those
    data fields from which content will be uploaded need to be mapped. As the content
    providers are able to see what has been uploaded, they will consequently be
    able to correct the mapping if it does not display in the way it was intended.
    The mapping will be maintained in the platform, and if more data is uploaded in
    the future (and the database has not changed), the mapping process will not
  have to be repeated.</p>
<p>ATHENA has streamlined the process and will continue to do
    so by providing full documentation on its portal describing the harvesting tool
    that explains what can be done with it with it, and how to use it. For regional
    or national portals, or large institutions, the network recommends first
    creating a &#34;Parent Organization&#34;, which could be a large institution
    with several museums, or another type of aggregator. This &#34;Parent Organization&#34;
  can then create several “Child Organizations”. After completing the <span class="BodyTextChar">mapping, content providers will then go to “import”: to
    upload via http or OAI, where through FTP files data can be uploaded either as
    a valid XML-file, or a zip-file. Once material is uploaded as an XML-file, the
    system needs to be informed about how many items have been uploaded. The
    overview displays how current files have been successfully parsed, and then shows
    that the upload has been completed (the system reports: status moved to).
    Mapping only needs to be done once, and once completed and the content
    successfully staged, the next time data is uploaded, the mapping is automatic.
    ATHENA sees this as an on-going process, and while the process has been
    automated, mapping can be modified at any time. ATHENA will provide pre-defined
    mappings from ESE to LIDO, and, once there is a xslt from Museumdat to LIDO,
  this will be made available as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="BodyTextChar">To enable all these processes, ATHENA
    has created a series of National Contact Points, each taking on a leadership
    role in their own country. Currently included are most of the European member
    states: Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France,
    Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,
    Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In
    addition, Azerbaijan, Israel, and Russia, as associate members, are harvesting
  their collections into Europeana via ATHENA. </span> </p>
<h2><span class="Heading1Char">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>To summarize: ATHENA is an ambitious project tackling IPR
  restrictions, language diversity and data interoperability in the complicated
  and inconsistent European landscape of museum standards and practices. By coordinating
  efforts with the relevant European projects and networks and developing
  solutions together, ATHENA will make a considerable contribution to the success
  of Europeana. </p>
<p>Even at this early stage Europeana has already won the
    Erasmus EuroMedia Award for Networking Europe. Quoting the Erasmus announcement
    – “The Website Europeana.eu is a surprising innovative interactive educational
    virtual exhibition in the field of the European cultural inheritance in the
    broadest sense of this container term” – see the Erasmus EuroMedia Award for
    Networking Europe (<a href="http://www.univie.ac.at/esec/php/wordpress/?page_id=5">http://www.univie.ac.at/esec/php/wordpress/ ?page_id=5</a>). With this kind of recognition, Europeana clearly has a head start in harvesting
    and promoting Europe&#39;s rich cultural heritage. With all the teams behind the
    scenes - each making its own contribution - Europeana also seems to have a very
  promising future.</p>
<p>The call is still open. Museums interested in joining the network
  are invited to contact their National Contact Point (<a href="http://www.athenaeurope.org/index.php?en/132/national-contact-points">http://www.athenaeurope.org/index.php?en/132/national-contact-points</a>).</p>
