<h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
<p class="AbstractText">Building on the concept of a virtuous circle, as
  presented at the 2006 Museums and the Web proceedings, the Natural History
  Museum has continued to explore ways in which it can extend its relationship
  with visitors, to gain greater insight into visitor interests and to enrich and
  personalise the visitor experience across both the virtual and physical
  spheres. With the opening of the new Darwin Centre at the Natural History
  Museum in September 2009, the Museum created NaturePlus, a personalised visitor
  experience that drew on its expertise in developing integrated virtual and
  physical offers, and that used the latest social media platforms for delivery.
  This paper will look at how this project was developed from initial evaluation
  to implementation - the objectives, benefits, lessons learned - and look at how
  the system is being used and what has been achieved in the five months since
  launch.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The 21st century Museum is defined as much by its digital
    content and use of digital media to engage its visitors as by its physical
    collections and content. User-generated content, social networking and global
    access to our collections affect how we operate as a museum across all our
    functions, from research and curation to exhibitions, learning and commercial
  businesses. </p>
<p>In the past the physical and virtual museum were often seen
    as two separate offers. Today it is more likely that they are seen as one rich
    offer with opportunities to distribute content over multiple channels and with
    the potential to fundamentally change the relationship with the visitor from
  passive to active.</p>
<p>In order to maximise the potential of this offer, museums
    have to develop a holistic view of the audience journey across both the
    physical and virtual spheres. Digital media enable visitors to expand their
    experience beyond the walls of a museum and create a ‘virtuous circle’between the virtual and physical space. On-line visitors
    are inspired to visit the museum, while within the museum visitors can extend
    their journey by book-marking, voting and sending links of relevant information
  home via a variety of media outlets (interactive kiosks, mobiles, PDAs). </p>
<p>The museum experience can therefore be explored by visitors in their own time and
    personalised to suit their interests. On-line visitors can engage with
    specialists, scientists, curators, and visitors with similar interests,
    exchanging information and participating in a variety of activities: joining
    groups, forums and communities. For museums such personalisation gives greater
    insight into visitors’ interests and enables the museum to build a more engaged
    community. Understanding visitors’ preferences and interests enables the museum
    to offer a range of targeted services and content and creates the opportunity
    to develop a ladder of engagement that can lead from participation and engaged
  learning to membership and donations. </p>
<p>But it is not only visitors who can take advantage of social
    media and personalisation. Museum staff, including researchers and curators,
    benefit by being able to collaborate with colleagues across the globe,
    accessing the same information in real time - even in the most remote of
  locations.</p>
<h2>NaturePlus Model</h2>
<p>The opening of the new Darwin Centre in September 2009,
    highlighting Natural History Museum science and science processes, gave the
    Museum the opportunity to create an extensive personalised visitor experience
  that would be a cornerstone of the Museum’s future digital strategy. </p>
<p>Building on its past experience of developing a ‘virtuous
    circle’ between its virtual and physical offers in temporary exhibitions
    through using barcoding and mobiles (Barry, 2006), the Museum has developed a
    personalised visitor experience called NaturePlus that spans both the Darwin
  Centre and its on-line site. </p>
<p>Within the Darwin Centre, visitors can bookmark and collect
    information from eight interactive exhibits using a card with a unique barcode
  and ID number which they scan on exhibits that are of interest. </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="barry.fig1.jpg" width="500" height="299" alt="Figure 1"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 1: A visitor scans a NaturePlus card in the Darwin
  Centre</p>
<p>Mindful of the requirement to make the bookmarking memorable
    and ensuring that visitors retained the cards, the Museum designed four sets of
    cards. Each card featured a specific exhibition object which visitors were
    encouraged to find. The intention was that, within a group, the cards visitors
  received would most likely be particular to them. </p>
<p>On-line visitors register their unique IDs to access a
    personalised Web site where the information they have bookmarked is saved. Their
    personalised area also has their particular card specimen with additional
    information. Alongside their saved content, visitors also receive links to additional
    related content; e.g. articles, videos, forums and events from both the Museum
    and external providers. In this way the registered visitors are presented with
    a rich content offer tailored to their interests. The bookmarking therefore
    serves as an entry point to that variety of content. These links are updated
  dynamically so that topicality is maintained. </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="barry.fig2.jpg" width="500" height="442" alt="Figure 2"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 2: Homepage of personalised NaturePlus site</p>
<p>Once registered with NaturePlus, visitors can join a range
    of Museum forums, add user-generated content, vote, and comment. This increased
    focus on participation enables visitors to engage with the Museum on a deeper
  level and encourages communities and dialogue. </p>
<p>NaturePlus is not just confined to visitors to the Darwin
    Centre. All on-line visitors can register for NaturePlus, whether or not they
    have visited the Darwin Centre and received a unique card. Additionally, a single-sign-on
    mechanism links together all areas of the Museum Web site that require
    registration. Therefore whether registering specifically for NaturePlus forums
    or for Membership or Donations, through a single registration process the on-line
    visitors automatically have access to NaturePlus features and their own
    personalised pages where they can bookmark areas of interest within the Museum
  site. </p>
<p>In future, visitors will also be able to optionally register their preferences (due to come
    on stream in April 2010); e.g. interest in subject areas such as dinosaurs, or
    notification of activities such as events and talks. Once preferences are
    registered, visitors will be served content to support their interests through
    promotions, links and targeted e-news. Visitors’ profiles will be
    held in a centralised CRM which will enable a managed approach to customer
    relations across the Museum, mindful of the permissions that visitors have
  granted. </p>
<p>As well as general visitors, specific groups expressed
    interest in using the personalisation and social media features of NaturePlus. The
    Learning department expressed interest in developing a password protected
    extranet to enable schools to form groups and allow collaboration and access to
  personalised Key Stage materials linked to the collections.</p>
<p>NaturePlus therefore created a seamless user journey between
    the physical Museum and on-line – a journey which becomes a virtuous circle,
    extending the visitors’ relationship from the physical space to the virtual
  world and back again. </p>
<h2>NaturePlus Objectives and Benefits</h2>
<p>NaturePlus was seen to be instrumental in delivering a
  number of benefits that support the Museum’s digital future. </p>
<p>The implementation of a personalisation strategy aligned to
    our current CRM was key in creating a better understanding of our visitors,
    allowing the Museum to deliver relevant content to visitors at the appropriate
    stage in their on-line journey and enabling greater contributions from both the
    public and peers. It was also a strategic development in managing our
  communications, marketing and retail offer. </p>
<p>The development of an underlying robust, collaborative and
    scalable technical infrastructure to support personalisation was seen as vital
  in supporting the Museum’s long-term digital delivery. </p>
<p>A series of consultations with stakeholders from across
    Museum departments helped capture requirements and maximise the potential of
    the service. From these, additional benefits were identified around the
    implementation of personalisation and social media. Specifically, a password
    protected area across the site had specific value internally for Museum
  departments, including Marketing, Science and Development.</p>
<p>Examples of such benefits were:</p>
<ul>
<li>A password protected area for Development campaigns </li>
<li>Password-protected areas required to host press releases and
  B-roll video </li>
<li>Group functionality for sponsors and media partners to enable
  their audiences and staff to have access to premium content. </li>
<li>Development of groups and extranet areas for scientists and
  curators to share documents</li>
<li>Alignment with our CRM to deliver targeted offers to shoppers,
    members and those interested in Museum eNews, helping the Museum to learn more
  about its visitors’ preferences and interests. </li>
  </ul>
<p>As a result, the Museum identified specific objectives that
  it wished to realise by developing NaturePlus, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a continuous user journey by tying together the virtual
  and physical content offer </li>
<li>Through more targeted access to content, increasing repeat
    visitors to the site by 3-5 % above the current average of 26% for repeat
  visitors.</li>
<li>Based on previous analysis of the Museum’s temporary exhibitions,
    the Museum was looking at having an average of 7.5% of Darwin Centre visitors
  register for NaturePlus.</li>
<li>Capturing visitors’ interests and profiles, with  their
  preferences, through the registration process </li>
<li>Delivering a coherent approach to data management across
  marketing, membership and commerce </li>
<li>Developing a range of social media linked to our content that
  would encourage visitor participation and engagement </li>
<li>Making niche content more accessible to interested audiences</li>
<li>Delivering a password-protected area and extranet functionality
  for science</li>
<li>Pilot an extranet for schools to support the learning department.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>A number of formative evaluations were carried out prior to finalising
  and implementing the concept.</p>
<p>The first formative
    evaluation carried out in October 2008 interviewed twenty adults in one-to-one
  and paired interviews. </p>
<p>Additionally, school sessions at three different schools
    were undertaken. These consisted of group discussions split between students
  and teachers in key stages: KS3 and KS4/5.</p>
<p>These sessions examined privacy concerns around e-mail and
  levels of interest in the broader concept of the personalisation offer. </p>
<p>The key findings were that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very little resistance was encountered in any group to signing up
    with an e-mail address – the NHM was considered a trusted party, although a
  privacy statement when signing up would be welcomed. </li>
<li>Adults were most interested in news information about areas of
    interests, updates on events of interest, field videos and articles by Museum
    scientists. Some suggested a recommendation system on the basis of their
    selections, similar to those on retail sites, to direct them to content or
  events they might be interested in.</li>
<li>Although some respondents initially found it difficult to
    envisage how they might comment and share content with their friends, once
    presented with a list of possible collectables and on-line activities they
    became more enthusiastic about how they would use the space. For adults the
  ability to blog was of the least interest.</li>
<li>Students were more interested in all types of content suggested.
    Younger students were interested in games and mp3 tours, while KS5 students
    felt that events and news stories would be useful as they are encouraged to
  broaden their interest beyond what they cover in classroom.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second evaluation in October 2008 used the same
  methodology and tested the specifics of the NaturePlus usability and the name.</p>
<p>Specifically, it tested:</p>
<ol>
<li>General response to the NaturePlus concept and name</li>
<li>Usability of early card scanning / touchscreen interaction
  prototypes</li>
<li>Clarity of communications, instructions and keywords</li>
<li>Interest in different types of content proposed for collection</li>
<li>Interest in different possible on-line activities</li>
<li>(School groups only) Discussion of a possible educational
  scenario using NaturePlus</li>
  </ol>
<p>The Key findings were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the concept was understood, there was a high level of
    interest. All respondents (adults, students and teachers) said they would pick
    up and use a NaturePlus card during their visit.  School groups were
    particularly engaged; all students could see the value it would add to their
    school work, and were excited about a new way of looking at the exhibits. Even
    the more hesitant adults who demonstrated less understanding said they would
  pick up and try out the card.</li>
<li>The name ‘Natureplus’ summarised for many what the concept was
    and suggested they were getting something ‘in addition’ to their visit.  Some
    likened the name to services such as ‘Sky’ or ‘Freeview Plus’, where something
  additional to the standard service package was anticipated. </li>
<li>Most respondents grasped relatively quickly the idea of
    Natureplus and how they might use the card.  There was some indication that the
    ease with which they picked up the idea was dependent on age. Younger adults
    and students across all three key stages were generally quicker to pick up on
  the idea, even when they received limited instructions.</li>
<li>From a series of different prototypes, there was a very clear
    preference for prototypes that allowed visitors to select a variety of items to
    bookmark and then save with a single card insertion [scan] to collect these
  items. </li>
<li>Although the majority of respondents were able to quickly work
    out the concept, a number struggled to do so. It is was therefore recommended
    that a range of communication materials be developed to cover different
    learning styles (e.g. a video, a poster and clear instructions on both the
    terminals and the back of the cards); the importance of training front of house
    staff was clear. This was felt to be particularly important at the initial
    interactive display where visitors will be using their cards for the first time
  and are most likely to need help. </li>
</ul>
<p>All respondents liked the idea of being able to keep their
    personalised pages for an indefinite period, and all were very positive about
    accessing content at home, with no instances of respondents having no interest
  at all. Specifically, visitors wanted to:</p>
<ul>
<li>access and link to information they were interested in </li>
<li>receive exclusive offers </li>
<li>re-watch videos they had enjoyed from the exhibition </li>
<li>collect beautiful pictures of the collections or the natural
  world </li>
<li>receive links to projects they could get involved in</li>
<li>find learning materials specific to schools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students and teachers were very positive about the
    possibility of a personalised experience. Students liked the fact that the
    activity was open ended and gave them freedom to choose which things to
    collect. Some felt this would make them more motivated to carry out the
    activity as they would have a greater sense of ownership. They also felt they
    would be more likely to remember what they had discovered. One of the
    advantages of the NaturePlus approach identified by the students was that all
    the information they needed to complete future activities would be available in
  one place. </p>
<p>Overall, there was less interest from respondents in
    collecting comments they had made within the exhibition. This reflected the
    fact that respondents were reluctant to offer their own views and opinions on
  issues raised within the exhibition.</p>
<h2> Technical Infrastructure</h2>
<p>To implement NaturePlus, a technical infrastructure or ‘technical
    spine’ was required to support personalisation both for the Museum exhibits and
    on its social media Web site. This technical spine had to be flexible enough to
    provide a cornerstone for future development of personalised content within the
    Museum. </p>
<p>One of the core services developed was the Single sign-on
  (SSO) system that allows users to log-on a single time to access content across
  the site without being prompted to log in again at different registration
  points. This also allows for the update of any internal site to authenticate
  against this new service and remove the need for multiple user-ids and
  passwords within the Natural History Museum site. This service is based on the
  CAS product (http://www.jasig.org/cas).</p>
<p>To provide this flexibility, a Web service library (WSL) was
    created to provide the software architecture to deliver the fundamental
    services required for personalisation. This approach allowed the Museum to make
    future changes if necessary behind the Web service layer without affecting the
    client side; e.g. attaching additional legacy systems if required. The core
  functionality of the WSL is to: </p>
<ul>
<li>provide an interface to existing NHM systems such as CRM and CMS</li>
<li>manage user profiles</li>
<li>manage user generated content;  e.g. game scores and images
  created on interactive exhibits</li>
<li>register user e-mails from exhibits</li>
<li>associate visitor-selected materials with a barcode and present
  this on-line.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Web service library was developed internally using the
    Java platform and contains all the business logic required to manage the assets
    on an interactive (e.g. an image and associated links), the selecting and
    attaching of interactive assets to barcodes, the storing of custom assets such
  as the postcard, and the retrieval  of assets attached against a barcode ID.</p>
<h3>Selecting and Saving Content in the Museum (Bookmarking)</h3>
<p>The Darwin Centre gives visitors the option of bookmarking
    items of interest on interactives and uploading user generated content, such as
    photos of themselves, and exploring these in more detail on their personalised NaturePlus
    section of the Museum site. All these items are recoded against a barcode
  number on the cards that visitors are encouraged to pick up during their tour.</p>
<p>In the case of bookmarking items of interest, once the item
    is selected and the barcode swiped under the interactive’s barcode reader, the
    interactive only has to talk to the Web service library and send it the id of
    the bookmark and the barcode number. The Web service will then interface with
  NHM systems to attach the bookmark to the barcode number.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="barry.fig3.jpg" width="500" height="70" alt="Figure 3"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 3: Diagram showing bookmark process across the
  personalisation services architecture</p>
<p>All items bookmarked against a barcode are then available to
    the visitors on their personal pages in NaturePlus once they have registered
    and entered their card numbers. The list of bookmarks on a home page is unique
    to each visitor and provides a starting point for  exploration of the subjects
  selected during the tour.</p>
<p>NaturePlus was developed using the collaboration and social
    networking software Jive SBS.  This gave the museum an out-of-the-box feature-rich
    platform to build on and adapt, and its open API approach allowed it to
    interface with the Web service library to return visitor bookmarks and their
    supporting links and images. Its security model was also modified so that it
    authenticates against the SSO service making it fully interfaced to the
    technical spine and able to serve personalised content from existing and future
  personalisation services.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="barry.fig4.jpg" width="500" height="208" alt="Figure 4"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 4: Diagram showing the personalisation services
  architecture</p>
<h2>On-line Content and Resources</h2>
<p>The content developed around NaturePlus focused on the
    Museum’s overall brand shift to create greater awareness of the science of
    nature and the Museum’s research. As a result the initial focus in developing
    content or creating areas of interest has been centered on the topics covered
    in the Darwin Centre exhibits,  including science blogs, identification forums,
  communities and topical polls. </p>
<p>This content also is strategically linked to the Museum’s
    citizen science initiatives and its commitment to support the International
    Year of Biodiversity.  Topicality is seen to be key in the success of
    NaturePlus, and the operational plan is to refresh links and content regularly.
    It was recognised that for NaturePlus to flourish commitment was required from
    across Museum departments, particularly Science, in creating interesting
  content and updates on a regular basis. </p>
<p>NaturePlus is managed by IM editorial staff with experience
    in the management of communities. The site is managed daily during working
    hours and occasionally at weekends. Because of the newness of the service and the
    wide age range of constituents, the site launched with all postings being moderated
    and pre-read. All new posts are uploaded within 24 hours, 72 hours maximum at
    weekends. The intention is to change to post-moderation for most elements as
  the community develops. </p>
<p>Feedback to queries about the service from the public is
  offered through an email forum which is managed by the Interactive Media team. </p>
<p>Currently the NaturePlus area has seven blogs which include
    a number written by scientists outlining their work and projects, one relating to
    Nature Live events, and one which covers a general ‘what’s new’ at the Museum.
  These are updated between 1-2 times a week. </p>
<p>There are various discussions, some of which have been
    initiated by Museum staff and others initiated by the public, including a
  popular thread on what people most enjoyed during their Darwin Centre visit. </p>
<p>For teachers and students there is a specific area which is
    available to learning groups who have visited the Darwin Centre. We will be
    testing, with teacher panels, how this can be rolled out further to offer
  groups for shared learning. </p>
<p>Additionally, the Museum launched a number of pilots for internal
    stakeholders, including groups to support science collaboration internally,
  nationally and internationally. </p>
<h2>Marketing the Message </h2>
<p>From past Museum learning, the implementation of any new
    technology was dependent on front of house training and the marketing of the
  concept through videos, signage and external communication.</p>
<p>Training sessions were organised with front of house staff,
    and digital signage developed. Additionally, instructions were clearly given on
  the NaturePlus cards and pick–up points through the exhibition. </p>
<p>In addition, the initiative offered a number of marketing
    opportunities. The Museum had considerable press coverage of the opening and
    optimized the coverage of the card. There was also the opportunity to
    distribute 80,000 NaturePlus cards in a magazine, <i>TimeOut,</i> as well as to distribute 4,000 pre-loaded cards through the
  Museum’s in-house membership magazine in January 2010.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The development of such a broad-reaching strategy required a
    cross-museum approach with an integrated team that included Interactive media,
    Interpretation, Marketing, Science, Special Effects and IT. Additionally, the
    integration of NaturePlus within the exhibits meant that the project was tied
  into external software design suppliers as well as external social media suppliers. </p>
<p>One of the highest risks to the project was that the
    implementation of the NaturePlus interface on the exhibits and the content that
    was being bookmarked was necessarily quite far down-stream in the development
    of the overall exhibition offer. The NaturePlus content could not be finalised
    until exhibit content was completed, and the interface could not be tested <i>in situ</i> until the exhibition kiosks were
  installed. </p>
<p>Although there was rapid proto-typing of the kiosk material
    with limited user evaluation, it became apparent that this really gave an
    inadequate view of how the experience was used in context, and the reality that
    visitors would rush towards the seductive flashing red lights of the barcode
    reader and scan their cards without selecting material or reading any
  instructions was not considered by the designers. </p>
<p>Nor was the fact that the cards proved to be so popular that
    visitors were collecting the set of four designs from dispensers and that
    within three months the yearly allowance was in danger of rapidly being used
  up.</p>
<p>With a project of such magnitude, almost inevitably there
    was slippage. As a result, the complete experience could not be tested until
    just before launch. Valuable lessons in understanding how visitors would react
    and use the exhibits therefore could only be captured and remedied after
  launch. </p>
<p>Although stakeholders had been consulted extensively, the
    newness of the concept meant that for many individuals it was difficult to
    understand and there was a reluctance to contribute content and ideas, and the
  launch offer partially reflected this.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NaturePlus definitely offers a new way of engaging with our
    visitors and peers -  encouraging an ongoing relationship, dialogue, and the
  opportunity for participation. </p>
<p>It has the potential to enable the Museum to broaden and
    deepen its interactions with its audiences through the provision of highly
  relevant personalised experiences that continue post visit.</p>
<p>To date there has been mixed success in achieving this.
    Although the Museum had projected that 7.5% of visitors to the Darwin Centre
    Cocoon would register for NaturePlus, there has been a registration of 7000 in
    the first four months of opening, or 4.5%. However, take-up of scanning and
  bookmarking is high, with 65% of visitors bar-coding content. </p>
<p>There are a number of factors that may be contributing to
    this. Aside from the initial marketing, there has been little internal or
    external marketing of the concept or of the communication of a personalised
    NaturePlus on-line area. The drop off from an initially higher uptake suggests
    that this could be a contributing factor. Additionally, in order to allay
    concerns around the security requirements of single sign-on, the registration process
    is fairly robust and requires e-mail notification and an alpha numeric password.
  This may deter visitors from joining even though they have scanned their cards. </p>
<p>Currently there are also few incentives, aside from viewing
    saved content, to join NaturePlus. This is reflected in that fact that 78% of NaturePlus
    visitors have been to the Darwin Centre and have saved content to view in their
    personalised areas, and only 22% have joined from the site without visiting the
  Darwin Centre. </p>
<p>However, in terms of retention, NaturePlus has been
    extremely successful; 53% of visitors are return visitors as compared to 30%
    across the rest of the site, and 20% of visitors return over 6 times. This
    indicates a deep engagement of visitors and keen interest in the content. When
    preferences come on stream in early 2010 and are fully tied into the CRM system,
  we hope to see an increase in acquisition and retention. </p>
<p>One of the key benefits of NaturePlus is to enable the
    Museum to support secondary science. To date 296 schools have registered a bar
    code, although personalised learning materials are currently limited.
    Expectations are that when pre and post-visit material comes on stream there will
  be an increase in uptake.</p>
<p>As it is an experimental programme under development, the
    Museum recognises the need to be nimble in responding to opportunities and to
    constantly monitor usage in order to build on success and to change areas that
    are not delivering. We therefore expect the roll-out to be fairly fluid for the
    first 9 months as we beta test with groups across the Museum and deliver new
  areas of content. </p>
<p>To develop the user base we will be promoting NaturePlus
    through social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter and will develop
    content plans to drive acquisition and activation, increase engagement, and
  develop retention. </p>
<p>The Museum is currently looking at a wider rollout of
  NaturePlus within its permanent and temporary exhibition development.</p>
<p>It is also interested in pursuing how NaturePlus also offers
  greater collaboration with colleagues both inside and outside of the Museum. </p>
<p>For the future, it is foreseen that NaturePlus will serve as
    a lynchpin in our relationship with visitors, allowing us to understand and
  meet their needs and enabling the visitors to drive its development. </p>
