<p>Modern technology provides new opportunities for museums to enhance museum visit experience. Multimedia is one aspect of modern technology that can enhance museum visit experience. However, the use of multimedia poses new challenges for presentation preparation — how to enrich the visit while not replacing the real objects in the museum that must remain in the focus of the visit, how to allow rich information space suitable for a great variety of visitors, how to encourage interaction among visitors and more. These challenges need to be addressed during planning and preparation of information presentations for mobile, personalized, multimedia museum visitors&#39; guides. In addition to the conceptual aspects, there are technical aspects such as text and images selection and integration, applying various cinematographic techniques and using the right language for the spoken text. This work presents lessons learned at the PEACH and PIL projects in preparation of multimedia presentations for mobile, personalized museum visitors&#39; guide. Presentations designers needed to reason about the exhibitions, their objects and information that may be interesting for the visitors. They had to do that while planning the presentations preparation and then, in light of the generic goals, elicit relevant text and images and combine those using cinematographic techniques into multimedia presentations. All the above resulted in a &#34;presentation generation road map&#34; — a nine-step multimedia presentations preparation framework that is described and presented in this paper. </p>
