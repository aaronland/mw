<p>The Story of Glass has now been running in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Corning Museum of Glass in New York since 1993. It continues to add visitor value to these collections. We describe how The Story of Glass came into existence, what the nature of its production was, how it has succeeded, and where it could be improved. We illustrate some of its significant design features, including the use of innovative ideas like crumb trail and video icons, as well as its overall content architecture. We consider the quality of the production values used, and we draw out the lessons learned into a series of recommendations. </p>
