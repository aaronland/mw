<p>In April 2005, the University of British Columbia Botanical Garden launched its fourth weblog, Botany Photo of the Day. This photograph-driven weblog (&#34;photoblog&#34;) is used to promote and interpret the garden&#39;s collections; educate and advocate on issues of biodiversity, conservation and science literacy; and blend two traditionally disparate concepts: beauty and science. Botany Photo of the Day can be credited with contributing much of the over 100% increase in monthly unique site visitors to the garden&#39;s Web site in a year to year comparison. A number of improvements were made in this iteration of UBC Botanical Garden&#39;s experimentation with weblogs, and these techniques and strategies serve as an example that can be used in other institutional weblogs. </p>
