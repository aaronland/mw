			<h2><a target="_blank" href="../papers/garzotto/garzotto.html">MEDINA Three Years Later: Towards &#34;Enterprise Frameworks&#34; for cultural tourism Web applications</a></h2>
<p><a href="../bios/au_3833.html">Franca Garzotto</a>, Politecnico di Milano, Italy</p> 
<p>The MEDINA project aims to promote cultural tourism in the Mediterranean basin by means of a transnational multimedia Web portal that addresses Mediterranean culture as a whole and is integrated with a federation of national Web sites, each one dealing with the local heritage of a specific Mediterranean country. A cost-effective development of the overall &#39;system&#39; is made possible by a suite of tools that constitute an enterprise framework for cultural tourism. They offer a semi-complete application skeleton that can be easily adapted to produce customized Web sites in this domain. The MEDINA framework implements a &#39;model-based&#39;, &#39;end-user development&#39; approach: built for and with domain experts (cultural tourism specialists), MEDINA provides a set of user-friendly functionalities that hide the implementation complexity and can be used by users with no technical know-how to design a Web site by remodelling, to set up a (customized) design schema with the proper multimedia contents, and to dynamically generate applications on-the-fly, as the development process proceeds. </p>
