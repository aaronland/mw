<p><a href="../bios/au_3151.html">Kevin Sumption</a>, Powerhouse Museum, Australia</p> 
<p>When switched-on, the ubiquitous museum of the future should, as Foucault intended, be able to function as a comprehensive archive of material culture with the capability of operating in all places at all times.  In the last few years we have borne witness to the gradual realisation of this vision, as a new hybrid museum form striving to re-connect the physical and virtual museum domains has evolved.  Since the first Museums and the Web conference in Los Angeles in 1997, numerous papers, presentations and discussions have hinted at the opportunities, as well as significant challenges, that the creation of this new ubiquitous hybrid, will undoubtedly entail.</p>
