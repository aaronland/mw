			<h2><a target="_blank" href="../papers/hecht/hecht.html">Viewing the Viewer: Remote usability testing</a></h2>

<p>Last year the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, undertook a five-month research project to evaluate its Web site. Working with a user-experience firm based in San Francisco, we gained a better understanding of who visits the National Gallery&#39;s Web site, why they come, and their expectations once they are on the site.  </p> 
<p>Several different kinds of investigations were undertaken to achieve the project&#39;s goals:
</p>
<ul><li>interviews with core stakeholders inside the Gallery
</li>
  <li>an on-line user survey, to understand who the users are and what they expect  </li>
  <li>a &#34;freelisting&#34; exercise, to provide a picture of all the activities that users wanted to perform on the site</li>
  <li>remote usability testing, to discover how well users were able to interact
    with the current site and find what they needed</li>
</ul>
<p> This paper reviews the first three methods and discusses a summary of results of the entire project, but  concentrates on the final phase of the research, which involved &#34;remote usability testing.&#34; This research involved a Web-based method of testing, rather than a usability lab, and it allowed us to recruit participants from widespread locations to observe their screen movements &#34;live&#34; as they attempted to accomplish tasks on the site.  </p><p> The site evaluation yielded a wealth of data that will be used to make improvements in the design of the Gallery&#39;s Web site as well as to make the site more responsive to our users&#39; needs and expectations. </p>
