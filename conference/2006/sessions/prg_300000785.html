<p>In the summer of 2005, The Museum of Modern Art launched a redesign of <a target="blank" href="http://momastore.org/">MoMAstore.org</a>. Among the goals for the redesign was the creation of stronger visual ties between the Museum&#39;s main site, MoMA.org, and the on-line store. This paper will explore the development of the two sites, starting with a brief history and then looking at the current implementations. Topics to be covered include the relationship between the identity of the on-line retail environment and the Museum&#39;s overall identity, links and crossover between the two sites, and the impact one site has on the other. We will also discuss common functions, such as e-news, search, and traffic reporting. </p>
