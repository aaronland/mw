         <p class="AbstractText">This paper presents the approaches, strategies and 
          challenges addressed during the development and deployment of the Quilt 
          Index, an on-line preservation and presentation project currently containing 
          more than 1,000 quilts documented in four separate archives.  The Quilt 
          Index spans eras and collections to provide first-of-its-kind access 
          to information and images of quilts, an original American art form.  
          From a Civil War-era family graveyard quilt, to countless variations 
          on a hexagon theme, to an original contemporary design of Elvis, the 
          Quilt Index offers preservation and access in a central, searchable 
          database managed through an on-line, distributed ingestion system — 
          the MATRIX Digital Repository (Repos).  This Repository is built on 
          open source database software and designed to facilitate remote records 
          management by each participating archive through partner-specific Web 
          browser interfaces. This paper reviews Quilt Index development and deployment, 
          including standardization of controlled vocabulary for quilt description 
          metadata, distributed database development, coordination with multiple 
          partners and their varying requirements for catalogue description, digitization 
          planning, pilot collection ingestion and modification, searching and 
          display development from the database, records maintenance and future 
          planning.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This paper presents the development of the Quilt 
          Index, a comprehensive, trans-institutional on-line collection tool 
          built upon an open source digital repository.  The Quilt Index intends 
          to provide access for both research and public presentation of the extensive 
          documentation on American quilts and quilt making that now exists in 
          a variety of locations and media - in museums and archives, in public 
          and private collections, on paper survey forms and in varied electronic 
          formats. Utilizing the benefits of a distributed repository system and 
          a comprehensive controlled vocabulary for descriptive metadata, the 
          Quilt Index is addressing the need to balance centralized information 
          access with preservation of local variation.          </p>
        <p>The Quilt Index mission is to be a central resource 
          that provides access to contextual documentation and images of quilts 
          from a wide variety of sources, including</p>
      <ol class="listwithbullets">
        <li> 
          images of and documentary information about quilts 
            in public museum and library collections; </li>
        <li> 
          aggregate information about privately held quilts 
            compiled during the past 17 years by 56 state and regional quilt documentation 
            projects in the United States; </li>
        <li> 
          bibliographies of secondary materials relevant 
            to quilt study; and </li>
        <li> 
          finding aids developed to assist researchers 
            with locating hard-to-find quilt-related primary and secondary materials 
            in public collections.              </li>
      </ol>
       
        <p>The Quilt Index was conceived and developed by The 
          Alliance for American Quilts and implemented in partnership with Michigan 
          State University&#39;s MATRIX: The Center for Humane Arts, Letters, 
          and Social Sciences On-line and the Michigan State University Museum. 
          The planning and pilot phases of the Quilt Index, funded through grants 
          from the National Endowment for the Humanities, supported collaboration 
          with four partner institutions that held significant quilt data -- the 
          Library of Congress&#39; American Folklife Center, the Illinois State 
          Museum, the Tennessee State Library and Archives (with Quilts of Tennessee, 
          Inc., documentation project archives), and the University of Louisville 
          Archives and Records Center (with Kentucky Quilt Project archives).</p>
        <h1>Project Significance and Background  </h1>
        <p>Quilting has become the quintessential American art, 
          its form and history coming to represent the very formation of American 
          identity.  Originally produced at home by women using patchwork piecing 
          which arose from thrift and necessity, quilting has become a multi-billion 
          dollar industry occupying more than 21 million people producing quilts 
          that in many cases challenge the traditional high forms of art collected 
          in museums throughout the US and the world. (NFO Research 2003; Kimmelman 
          2002) Scholars increasingly focus on quilts to gain evidence and information 
          that can increase understanding of many historical and contemporary 
          aspects of American life; and the tremendous public draw of quilt exhibits 
          has boosted museum attendance across the country. (Barnes 2002)</p>
        <p>Over the course of the 20th century, investigations 
          into the history and meaning of American quilts have evolved from stereotypical 
          antiquarian and romanticized efforts prevalent at the turn of the century 
          to extremely sophisticated studies meeting high academic standards.  
          New attention to the historical, cultural, and sociological role of 
          quilts in American society spans a wide range of disciplines. Quilts 
          have formed the foundation of literary studies (analyses of quilt imagery 
          in fiction, as for instance in the work of Alice Walker), cultural geography 
          (the dispersion and distribution of quilt patterns, quilting techniques 
          and other quilting traditions, as in the work of Henry Glassie), women&#39;s 
          studies, art history and criticism, material culture studies, textile 
          history, industrial history, political history, religious history, migration 
          and immigration studies, racial and ethnic studies (as in studies of 
          African-American, Native Hawaiian, and Mexican-American quilting), American 
          social history, and, state, regional, national and international studies.  
          Scholars have also examined quilts and quilt-related materials in order 
          to understand better such diverse topics as social activist movements 
          and protest causes (as in temperance quilts, &#34;green&#34; quilts, 
          the Boise Peace Quilt Groups, the NAMES Project quilt, etc.) or indigenous 
          ceremonies (such as the Sioux honoring and Hopi baby naming ceremonies) 
          (Kornbluh et.al. 2000).</p>
        <p>This rise in activity has precipitated enormous demand 
          for access to information on new as well as historical materials, styles, 
          and techniques.  The vast majority of quilts, however, remain in private 
          hands and homes, being passed through families and kept on beds or hung 
          from walls or stored in trunks and closets.  The impetus for this project 
          is an effort to document this crucial and largely private body of art, 
          and present it for public appreciation, use and research.</p>
        <p>Scores of grassroots quilt documentation projects 
          conducted in every state in the US have documented quilts in personal 
          and community contexts, described their physical appearance, and captured 
          the history of their production, ownership, and use.   This movement 
          began in Kentucky in 1981 with the founding of the Kentucky Quilt Project 
          and the first statewide quilt survey.  Citizens from around the state 
          participated in Quilt Days, bringing quilts from their closets, beds, 
          and trunks to be photographed and entered into a public record. Researchers 
          photographed quilts, took oral histories and filled out detailed forms 
          delineating the quilt&#39;s history, fabric, style, and more.  The movement 
          spread to encompass fifty-six state and regional quilt projects, more 
          than 1,000 Quilt Days, and more than 165,000 quilts documented around 
          the country (MacDowell et al 2003, Zegart 2003).</p>
        <p>Although this increase in documentation fostered 
          many examinations of the production, type, use, marketing, distribution, 
          and meaning of quilts, the actual records remain largely inaccessible 
          to both scholars and the general public. The state survey movement by 
          itself created a compendium of research materials documenting quilting 
          that could provide information for many kinds of studies as well as 
          a comprehensive national profile of quilting traditions in the 19th 
          and 20th centuries (MacDowell et.al. 2003, Zegart 2003). State survey 
          documentation is housed, however, in a variety of museums, archives, 
          historical societies, project offices, and private hands; and only a 
          portion of the information is indexed or computerized in a variety of 
          incompatible formats.  </p>
        <p>No comprehensive and accessible resource currently 
          exists anywhere in this country to unify access to quilts and quilt 
          materials for scholars, teachers, students, and the general public. 
          The Alliance for American Quilts, a national non-profit organization 
          dedicated to the preservation and perpetuation of the art of quilting, 
          is the catalyst for the Quilt Index.  Alliance board members made initial 
          decisions about what information would be included in a national Quilt 
          Index and canvassed key individuals in the field of quilt scholarship, 
          women&#39;s studies, and textile history.  The highest priority materials 
          identified were these records from the various state and regional quilt 
          documentation projects. While these records constituted the largest 
          existing body of data on quilts in the world, they were almost entirely 
          inaccessible for scholarly use.</p>
        <p>The Alliance partnered with MATRIX and the MSU Museum 
          to deploy the project.  Both of these agencies brought complementary 
          and specialized experience, critical to the formation of the project. 
          MSU serves as the administrative home of the Index, providing additional 
          technical expertise, financial accountability, project management, and 
          substantial cost share.</p>
        <p>MATRIX is devoted to the application of new technologies 
          in humanities and social science teaching and research. MATRIX creates 
          and maintains on-line resources, provides training in computing and 
          new teaching technologies, and creates forums for the exchange of ideas 
          and expertise in new teaching and research technologies in addition 
          to serving as the computing home for H-Net: Humanities and Social Sciences 
          On-line. MATRIX leads collaborative endeavors to digitize and provide 
          on-line access to archival materials, journals, artwork, artifacts, 
          oral histories, and music for use by scholars as well as the general 
          public. These projects include the &#34;National Gallery of the Spoken 
          Word&#34; (NGSW), and the African On-line Digital Library (AODL), funded 
          under the National Science Foundation&#39;s Digital Libraries Initiative 
          Phase II, and The Spoken Word Project, a joint NSF-JISC funded project 
          to assess teaching and learning with on-line audio resources. Other 
          collaborative endeavors include a range of efforts to develop new publishing 
          and distribution models to increase access to scholarly publications 
          and oral histories for humanists in Western and Southern Africa.</p>
        <p>The MSU Museum, one of the oldest museums in the 
          Midwest, is a public steward for over a million objects or specimens 
          of cultural and natural history from around the world with particular 
          collection strengths in Great Lakes area archaeology, agricultural heritage, 
          and folk life.  These collections include the nationally known Michigan 
          Traditional Arts Program, the Michigan Traditional Arts Research Collection 
          of objects, taped interviews, field notes, and photographs relating 
          to folk life providing the only major state resource on this subject, 
          and the Great Lakes Quilt Center.  The museum&#39;s quilt collection numbers 
          over 500 and includes historical and contemporary examples from around 
          the world, with special emphasis on African American quilts, Native 
          American quilts, and quilts with special ties to Michigan. The Michigan 
          Quilt Project (MQP), begun in 1985 and based at the MSU Museum, has 
          documented 5,500 quilts from across the state, including the 500 quilts 
          owned by the museum. Like many museum institutions, MSUM has an internal 
          cataloging system based in Argue.  In addition, the information from 
          the 5,500 documentation files had been partially entered into a relational 
          Filemaker Pro database, but the quilt images had not been digitized 
          at the outset of the Quilt Index project.  MSU Museum served as the 
          core pilot collection, providing expertise in quilt scholarship, quilt 
          descriptive metadata development, workflow development, and initial 
          system testing.  </p>
        <p>The planning and pilot phases of the Quilt Index, 
          funded through grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, 
          supported collaboration with four partner institutions that held significant 
          quilt data -- the Library of Congress&#39; American Folklife Center, 
          the Illinois State Museum, the Tennessee State Library and Archives 
          (with Quilts of Tennessee, Inc., documentation project archives), and 
          the University of Louisville Archives and Records Center (with Kentucky 
          Quilt Project, Inc.&#39;s archives).  This combination of institutional 
          partner collections provides not only a solid representation of the 
          types and range of existing collections but also a fair sample of the 
          unique problems and opportunities that are associated with different 
          kinds of quilt data collections. Furthermore, the institutions have 
          each demonstrated that they have: </p>
      <ol class="listwithnumbers">
        <li> 
          a base-level of institutional commitment by having 
            participated in various ways to date in the planning process, </li>
        <li> 
          the basic internal infrastructure (staffing, 
            technology, space) to participate effectively in the project, and</li>
        <li> 
          the commitment to allocate or seek matching funds 
            or in-kind support. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Chosen for both the strength and range of their collections, 
          each of these institutions has developed a distinct project to put quilt 
        documentation on line through the Index.</p>
      <h1>Project Development</h1>
      <p>The goal of the Index is to become a comprehensive 
          source of quilt information and documentation that is widely available 
          and accessible to people with quilt interests and to bring the resource 
          into other realms as well.  Clearly the benefits of a virtual repository 
          provide the only realistic solution to meeting the need for national 
          information coordination that complements and strengthens many diverse 
        local efforts. </p>
      <h2>Metadata Challenges -- The Quilt Index Comprehensive Fields</h2>
      <p>The initial task of the project was development of 
          comprehensive descriptive metadata for quilts, as unique three-dimensional 
          objects. Staff of the MSU Museum and MATRIX developed this comprehensive 
          set of descriptive fields, utilizing the survey forms from documentation 
          projects throughout the country and soliciting user feedback from quilt 
          researchers and documentation experts. Project staff culled quilt documentation 
          forms from nearly every state to find regional variations and cross-referenced 
          twenty significant reference sources on art and textiles including the 
          Art and Architecture Thesaurus of the Getty Vocabulary Program (1999) 
          and Barbara Brackman&#39;s Encyclopedia of Pieced Quilt Patterns (1979).   
        Many quilt-related terms are not included in the Getty AAT, so the Index 
        staff is researching concept and term contribution.  </p>
      <p>The resulting Quilt Index Comprehensive Fields, focusing 
          mainly on descriptive metadata for the quilt object, is a standardized 
          metadata schema -- a master list of metadata fields designed to accommodate 
          all of the information requested on state documentation forms developed 
          to date. This schema is divided into 27 Groups addressing a range of 
          technical, administrative and descriptive metadata.  Each metadata field 
          includes the group name and number, field name (actual database field 
          name), sequence (order in which field appears within its group), description 
          (further definition of field for data entry and management), caption 
          (for on-line management view), field type, note (for any additional 
          information), and character limit.  The descriptions of the fields clarify 
          the type and meaning of data entered into each field.  These descriptions 
          currently serve as both a glossary and as directions for data entry.  
        Because this Quilt Index Comprehensive Fields is a master list of descriptive 
        terms for quilts, no single documentation project or pilot site uses 
        the entire list.   </p>
      <h2>Technological Challenges</h2>
      <p>The Quilt Index presented a number of challenges 
          and research questions that influenced the design and architecture of 
          the MATRIX digital repository.  The Quilt Index required that each contributing 
          organization have their own repository with individual ingestion and 
          administration tools to manage their collections.  Yet, these separate 
          collections would have to work in tandem as a single resource for the 
          user.  Users would be able to search across any or all the repositories 
          and the on-line galleries featured on the site would create dynamic 
          content pulled from all the repositories.  Even though these projects 
          would utilize a standardized metadata scheme to describe the quilts, 
          each organization wanted the ability to also use custom metadata for 
          their collection that would further describe and help manage the digital 
          objects internally.  This created a tension in the design of the project 
        — create a system that would allow for federated searching and 
          delivery, yet is flexible enough to accommodate the individual cataloguing 
        needs of each organization.</p>
      <p>Even though the organizations involved in the project 
          agreed on a standard scheme to describe the quilts, the metadata scheme 
          itself presented challenges.  The Quilt Index Comprehensive Scheme was 
          created so that the organizations would have a standardized way of describing 
          the quilts across the project.  While this scheme was a necessity for 
          the application of federated searches and content generation, its shear 
          magnitude made ingestion, storage, and delivery problematic.  At over 
          100 separate fields for describing the appearance and composition of 
          a quilt, the Quilt Index Comprehensive Scheme did not readily map to 
          any existing metadata standards nor did it easily translate into the 
          metadata scheme currently employed by the majority of projects in the 
          MATRIX digital repository.  The architecture for ingesting, administering, 
          and delivering these collections would have to be flexible enough to 
          accommodate the scheme and staff would have to create additional tools 
          for managing the ongoing development of the project, to accommodate, 
          for example, additions and revisions to the metadata scheme as well 
        as the addition of new organizations into the Quilt Index.</p>
      <h1>The MATRIX Digital (Repos)itory</h1>
      <p>The Quilt Index exemplified many of the key research 
          questions and goals in the construction of the MATRIX digital (Repos)itory 
        — REPOS, as it has come to be known.  Previous MATRIX storage 
          and delivery projects had great success using relational databases to 
          create on-line content.  However, the creation and maintenance of each 
          project was an isolated, stand-alone endeavor.  A centralized repository 
          was conceived to integrate many different kinds of metadata from different 
          projects into a unified architecture.  This begged the question - how 
          do you build a database structure to accommodate different kinds of 
          metadata as new projects deposit their materials into the repository?  
        Up to this point we had either modified existing tables or added tables/databases 
        as we encountered metadata that fell outside of the original table structure 
        and metadata scheme.  Because of the number of objects and variations 
          of metadata projected for this project, such a route would either require 
          hours of update and development whenever a new project came on-line 
          or would lead to the unruly proliferation of loosely related tables/databases 
        in the repository.</p>
      <p>While researching these questions, MATRIX become 
          involved in the development of METS (Metadata Encoding and Transmission 
          Standard) - a metadata standard specifically created for describing 
          all facets of a digital object.  Maintained by the Library of Congress, 
          METS is a standard way for institutions to integrate multiple kinds 
          of metadata within a single document.  Because the METS schema provides 
          a standardized way to integrate multiple kinds of metadata, it has proven 
          to be an excellent medium for institutions to share and exchange metadata.  
        Even though METS was designed as an XML schema, its &#34;bucket&#34; 
        approach to metadata provided an interesting solution for a database 
        driven digital repository.  METS creates a container for each separate 
          bit of metadata and labels that &#34;bucket&#34; of metadata with 
          information for interpreting and using that metadata in applications 
          and exchange.  MATRIX adopted this approach and designed a &#34;schematized&#34; 
        database design.  Instead of statically defining the columns in a table 
          to reflect the metadata being stored for a project, REPOS uses two tables 
          to store the metadata: one table describes the metadata elements for 
          a scheme and the other table stores the metadata for those elements.  
        For example, in traditional database architecture we would create a 
        column called &#34;title&#34; and each row would have the title 
          of a digital object.  In REPOS, all the columns have generic definitions.  
        One table in REPOS holds information about the metadata ingested.  It 
          defines each element, for example:  this element is called &#34;title&#34;, 
          it is composed of text, it is ingested through a text box, it is a required 
          field, et cetera.  The second table holds the actual metadata for title 
          and a pointer to the description of the element housed in the first 
        table.</p>
      <p>This table structure offers many benefits for a central 
          repository. Because metadata formats are being described in a record 
          rather than a table column, any kind of metadata can be integrated into 
          the repository without altering the over-all structure of the database. 
          This allows multiple projects with vastly different collections and 
          metadata to use the same architecture to create their digital library. 
          Because the repository stores metadata in a stable, unchanging structure, 
          MATRIX has been able to construct on-line applications that can be utilized 
          by all the participating projects regardless of their metadata scheme.  
        Projects can create and modify their metadata schemes through an easy 
        to use on-line utility. Because the repository stores information about 
        the kind of metadata being used by each project, ingestion forms can 
        be created dynamically. Once metadata is entered for an object, the 
        object can be uploaded directly to storage servers in the repository 
        where it is dynamically renamed and placed in the appropriate place.  
        The object is renamed using a file naming specification developed by 
        MATRIX composed of an identifier specifying the owning archive (prefix), 
        a unique digital object identifier (base), and a derivative object subidentifier 
        (deriv).  The resulting filename from this specification would be for 
          example, chs-a0a0a1-a (a file extension will also be added based on 
          the mimetype of the file).  Even though files ingested into REPOS are 
          renamed, the original filename is automatically stored to facilitate 
        management and migration of the file.</p>
      <p>The stable table structure also facilitated cross 
          project development of dissemination applications.  MATRIX has developed 
          REPOS Tools, a suite of applications for building browse utilities, 
          search applications, and content-based galleries with the definition 
          of just a few project-specific variables.  Applications built for specific 
          projects can also be utilized across REPOS.  Dynamic thumbnail creation, 
          caching technologies, and dynamic SMIL based presentations created for 
          single projects have been easily reused for other projects in the repository.  
        The net effect of these utilities has been a vast reduction in development 
        time and project cost. </p>
      <h1>REPOS and the Quilt Index</h1>
      <p>REPOS offered the Quilt Index many tangible advantages.  
        Because REPOS stores extensive information about the nature of each 
        metadata element in a project&#39;s scheme, any scheme can be shared 
          across any number of projects.  MATRTIX for instance created the MATRIX 
          metadata scheme - a comprehensive set of metadata covering descriptive 
          (DUBLIN CORE), administrative, and technical metadata for a digital 
          object.  REPOS allows projects to instantly import this scheme and use 
          it as a starting point for their own repository.  This functionality 
          was instrumental in the quilt project because the metadata scheme for 
          describing their objects was so large. The Quilt Index Comprehensive 
          Scheme could be entered once into REPOS and then be automatically imported 
          by each of the organizations.  Projects could then add or subtract from 
          the scheme so the metadata would meet the needs of their particular 
        collection. </p>
      <p>REPOS also facilitates the reuse of metadata across 
          multiple digital objects.  The first record ingested for any object 
          in the repository describes the original manifestation of the digital 
          object — the first digital copy.  Any objects created from that 
          digital copy (thumbnails, delivery copies, etc.) would be ingested as 
          a derivative of the first object (or the object it was created from).  
        When creating a derivative, REPOS automatically takes the metadata created 
        for the master record and populates the record of the derivative.  Because 
          80% of the metadata remains the same for both objects (descriptive, 
          source, and rights info usually remain the same), much of the labor 
          is reduced in cataloging the derivative objects.   As mentioned earlier, 
          a digital object&#39;s derivative status is recorded in its filename 
          when a record is created.  MATRIX developed specialized technology for 
          the Quilt Index that uses a file&#39;s derivative status and file 
          function to automatically retrieve any additional views of the quilt 
        in the repository. </p>
      <p>Metadata workflow is also greatly reduced through 
          the use of  &#34;presets&#34; - sets of metadata that can automatically 
          be added when a record is created.  This is extremely helpful with metadata 
          that remains the same across a whole collection, particularly rights, 
          source, and other administrative metadata. In the case of quilt data, 
          all quilts made by a particular quilter will have similar or identical 
          provenance information.  Thus data entry time is reduced considerably 
        by utilizing preset options.</p>
      <p>Development and training time was also greatly reduced 
          for the project.  Even though each organization had separate holdings 
          in what seemed a separate repository, each organization used the exact 
          same on-line site to administer their collections.  This made training 
          and the development of best practices universal for all the projects.  
        Because the architecture for ingesting and administering the metadata 
        and objects was already in place, the organizations participating in 
        the project could simply concentrate on cataloging and building intellectual 
        and contextual content around their holdings.  Because REPOS is an on-line 
          utility, organizations could develop their collections in a distributed 
        fashion.</p>
      <h1>Digitization Practices and Workflow </h1>
      <p>While the project has been researching and analyzing 
          current best practices for imaging quilts as unique three dimensional 
          objects, the pilot project sites have already photographed their quilts 
          during the documentation phase of the project.  Thus, for this phase 
          of the project, standard practices for digitizing photographs and slides 
          have been used.  Since the material being contributed is essentially 
          archival photographic material, the original imaging practices offer 
          some severe limitations to the amount of manipulation that can be done.  
        Quilt images exist on slides, photographic prints, and even instant 
        Polaroid images in a few instances.  Color is a continuing challenge.  
        Color distortion was sometimes introduced from the original photography, 
        where lighting or mixture of daylight and tungsten affect the color 
        tones of the original.  Likewise, depending on storage conditions, fading 
          was an occasional problem.  There was initial intention to use very 
          high-resolution scans to facilitate close-up details of sections of 
          quilts (important for viewing quilts), however the level of detail in 
          the original slide quickly limited these attempts.  The original slide 
          medium, however clear in focus, did not retain clarity and detail on 
          a close zoom.  The most successful cases were when the documentation 
          project, such as Quilts of Tennessee, included a photographic close 
          up of each quilt as well as a full quilt shot.  These detail images 
        proved to offer the best representation of the original quilts. </p>
      <p>The Quilt Index has developed digitization and workflow 
          best practices and detailed specifications.  Each site worked with MATRIX 
          staff to develop their specific workflow, depending on their equipment 
        set up and institutional requirements.</p>
      <p><b><i>Processing:</i></b>  Images from the sites 
          are being scanned at a preservation quality high resolution.  The Index 
          best practices recommend that all sites digitize slides using Adobe 
          PhotoShop software with Nikon CoolScan hardware, both set to factory 
          standard settings.  Sites scan slides and make minimal adjustments restricted 
          to image rotation, cropping down to quilt image only, and applying minimal 
          color adjustment if necessary using PhotoShop&#39;s auto-adjust setting.  
        Although this setting adjusts each slide differently, it utilizes the 
        preset algorithms for color adjustment on each original.  This adjusted 
          image is saved as a TIFF file and preservation copies are either burned 
          to Mitsui Gold Archival CDs for local storage and access or preserved 
          on the institutional server system.  Access versions in JPEG are created 
          at the sites from the TIFF files and uploaded via Web entry forms into 
          the Quilt Index Repository at MATRIX.   MATRIX delivery tools produce 
          thumbnails and viewing copies of various sizes for the public on-line 
        pages.</p>
      <p><b><i>Preservation Images</i></b><i>:</i><b>  </b>The 
          Index recommends that pilot sites scan original images for digital preservation 
          at the highest resolution possible on their equipment set up and workflow 
          (ideally, 48-bit color and 1200 - 1600 ppi, at minimum 24-bit depth 
          color and 600 ppi).  These images are to be minimally manipulated (rotation, 
          cropping, color adjustment only if necessary), saved as TIFF and burned 
          onto Mitsui Gold Archival CDs, and for those images requiring frequent 
          access, they are stored on hard drives.  Each site may upload and store 
          a copy of their preservation TIFF in the Index Repository as well.  
        This is optional for each site depending on their needs.</p>
      <p><b><i>Index Repository Images (Access):</i>  </b>The 
          Index Repository requires a highest quality Web-ready access image in 
          JPEG format. These files are uploaded to the repository by the site 
          staff.  To strike a balance between uploading speed and file size, we 
          used the first batch from each site to assess the uploading speed and 
          workflow for each site and the Index as a whole. Final parameters for 
          required access JPEGs are 450 to 550 pixels wide (length can adjust), 
        high quality JPEG, set for progressive scan.</p>
      <p><b><i>Index On-line Reference Images</i></b><i>:</i><b>  
        </b>Upon submission, there is an automatic verification that the image 
          is in the correct format.  The repository tools assign control fields 
          and rename the uploaded digital file with its unique identification 
          number (e.g. tennessee-a0a0a0-a.jpg) that corresponds to the metadata 
          record.  Other tools automatically create the resized access and thumbnail 
          images needed for on-line reference and presentation in the Quilt Index 
        and deposit them in the Quilt Index cache.  </p>
      <h1>Quilt Index Comprehensive Fields Iteration  </h1>
      <p>As anticipated, the process of ingesting information 
          from a large quantity of individual hand-written forms has led to additions 
          and modifications of the descriptive fields in the Quilt Index Comprehensive 
          Fields metadata schema.  As a result, we have added terms, modified 
          input forms, and reformatted information requirements to accommodate 
          the needs of the varied, distributed analog information available at 
          the multiple sites.  For example, there is a series of fields for quilt 
          inscriptions.  Dates, in particular, offer very specific data for dating 
          and identifying quilts and for searching and sorting in the Quilt Index 
          database.  However, dates are written many ways.  A gifted quilt may 
          have a date written as February 14, 1969 or Valentine&#39;s Day 1969, 
          or 2-14-69.  The exact inscription is important for study and meaning, 
          while consistent date format is necessary for accurate and automated 
          searching.  To accommodate such discrepancies and also allow for searching 
          and identifying quilts, we created two entries for such metadata.  The 
          first is a free text box for inputting the inscription exactly as it 
          appears on the quilt. The second is a controlled date field for translating 
          the date into standard numeric form.  Such a format does introduce additional 
          possibility for error, so it requires skilled and meticulous data entry, 
          which is also time consuming.  However, such detail allows for more 
          robust description of the contents of the quilts, a major goal of the 
        Quilt Index user base.</p>
      <h1>Launch</h1>
      <p>The user-tested Quilt Index launched on October 6, 
          2003 with over 1,000 quilts, a large set of cross-project search and 
          sorting tools and on-line galleries.  The Quilt Index information request 
          emails come in daily from people with a wide variety of interests.  
        The most common queries are from people who had their quilt documented 
        by a state or regional project and want to know if and when their state 
        will be added.  The pilot partners continue using the on-line management 
          tools to enter and edit quilt records in the Index digital repository, 
        as follows:</p>
      <p>The MSUMuseum/Michigan Quilt Project, the beta site 
          for the project, continues to enter quilts and a test of our automated 
          ingestion is planned in March 2004 with the MSU Museum&#39;s Filemaker 
          Pro database. MSUM/MQP Quilt Index collaboration is led by Marsha MacDowell 
        with Beth Donaldson, Pearl Wong, and Rebecca Clark.</p>
      <p>University of Louisville/Kentucky Quilt Project completed 
          digitization and ingestion of all quilt images and records with permissions 
          in the KQP files.  U of L staff members have made some modifications 
          to records for quilts now owned by the IQSC (see below).  The University 
          Library and Archives is exploring ways to publicize the project and 
          increase its holdings of Kentucky quilt records. U of L/KQP Quilt Index 
          collaboration is led by Shelly Zegart, Kathie Johnson, Carrie Daniels, 
        and Sheryl Yoder.</p>
      <p>Tennessee State Library and Archives/Quilts of Tennessee<b> 
        </b>has achieved its goal of digitizing 900 quilts (full images and 
          details of each quilt) and is almost halfway towards completing the 
          data entry on those quilts. Quilts of Tennessee participants have raised 
          additional local funding to complete the slide scanning (approximately 
          1100 more quilts) so as to take advantage of the staff, expertise, and 
          momentum of the project. TSLA/QTenn Quilt Index collaboration is led 
        by Merikay Waldvogel, Becky Harriss, Wayne Moore, and Kristi Mosley.</p>
      <p>Illinois State Museum/Illinois Quilt Research Project 
          has begun entering quilts and should complete the 400 IQRP quilts owned 
          by the Illinois State Museum.  Staff have been in discussions with the 
          separate IQRP group, who is under new leadership and appears now interested 
          in working with the Index to place their materials on-line.  They have 
          an Access database that they have worked very hard on, but have only 
          about 100 quilts actually entered.  ISM/IQRP Quilt Index collaboration 
        is led by Jan Wass. (MacDowell &amp; Richardson 2004)</p>
      <p>International Quilt Study Center/University of Nebraska, 
          directed by Pat Crews, is an Index partner for the next phase of Index 
          development.  Due to a recent gift, IQSC now owns a number of the quilts 
          that had been photographed for educational purposes by the Kentucky 
          Quilt Project through various &#34;Louisville Celebrates the Quilt&#34; 
        exhibitions and entered into the Index by the University of Louisville.  
      </p>
      <p>This challenge highlighted the structure of the Quilt 
          Index as an object-based repository, meaning that the primary item being 
          managed and presented is the digital image and record of the quilt itself 
          (not the state documentation projects or collection group).  While the 
          Comprehensive Fields account for full reporting of the provenance and 
          history of every quilt record, the public viewing interface is organized 
          in part by contributing group thus requires identification with a group.  
        This presented a problem when a quilt was documented by one organization 
        and then was moved or donated to another.  Thus the Index needed to 
          develop a specific policy for multiple categorizations and to modify 
          searching and sorting mechanisms to account for such multiplicities. 
          The Index is modifying the Quilt Index site to include IQSC as a partner 
          organization and categorize those quilts under both sets of partners 
        with their respective roles in the quilts&#39; history. </p>
      <h1>Next Steps</h1>
      <p>The Index is committed to working inclusively with 
          organized quilt documentation and collection groups to expand the on-line 
          repository.  The Task Force reviews the collection and documentation 
          standards of the submitting group or collector and serves as an editorial 
          board to ensure the consistency of quilt records within that group.  
        This permits difference between groups without compromising the integrity 
        of the Index.  </p>
      <p>Through input from the site coordinators and Task 
        Force, the next phase priority issues were identified as: </p>
        <ol class="listwithbullets">
        <li>
          expanding the 
            data in the Index by soliciting data from new partners representing 
            a wide range of diverse factors (type, size, geographic location, 
            private/public, university, museum, etc.); </li>
        <li>
          creating mechanisms 
            to facilitate ingestion of existing databases through the development 
            of specially-tailored &#34;middleware&#34; to execute the migration 
            of data used by various museums or documentation projects to the Index; 
        </li>
        <li>
          completing 
            the data entry from the Phase Two sites; and </li>
        <li>
          developing options 
            for interactive use of the Index data with special on-line curatorial 
            and teaching tools. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>In response to a major call for partners for a funding 
          proposal for The Quilt Index, Phase III:  National Expansion and Data 
          Integration, many state documentation projects, private collections, 
          and museums came forward with interest in partnership.  The Index managed 
          to maintain its mission of inclusiveness and encompass within the budget 
          all documentation projects that responded and submitted their materials 
          by the proposal deadline.  After much negotiation and discussions, fifteen 
          new partners were included.  Many more remain interested in partnering 
        with the Index in the future. </p>
      <p>Phase III of the Quilt Index will research and implement 
          long term protocols and expand the database to include collections from 
          fifteen new partners.  This combination of new quilt documentation partners 
          spans the country — ranging from the northeastern states of Massachusetts, 
          Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Jersey; to the Midwestern research 
          done in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and Nebraska; to the southern coast 
          of Louisiana; to Wyoming in the west; to the unique efforts to inventory 
          traditional Hawaiian quilting.  In addition to state documentation projects, 
          the Index expansion will include three private quilt collections and 
          one museum collection as test collections for such expansion.  In this 
          phase, four pre-existing project partners (Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee 
          and Illinois) will complete the digitization of their collections and 
          serve as consultants to the new groups; this diverse set of new partners 
          will add their collections to the system; Index repository programming 
          will be designed to integrate new collections with pre-existing databases; 
          on-line tools will be designed and implemented to create gathering, 
          sorting and saving options for researchers, teachers and curators; and 
          the partners will collaborate to develop on-line exhibits and educational 
        materials.  </p>
      <p>Long term expansion possibilities for the Index include 
          important collections of quilt &#34;ephemera&#34; — materials 
          related to quilting such as pattern books, diaries, and fabric scrap 
          collections for research and development of methods for individual documentation 
          of personal or family quilts using on-line forms and standardized Quilt 
        Index methodology.</p>
