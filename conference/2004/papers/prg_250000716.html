      <p class="PaperTitle">Virtual Vs. Physical: Creating On-Line Educational 
        Experiences Through Design</p>
      <p class="Author">Anne Kaye and Paola Poletto, Design Exchange, Canada</p>
      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
       <p class="AbstractText">This paper examines two Design Exchange programs 
          to explore how we create and present content in the virtual form. The 
          Design Traveller project details the journey from virtual display to 
          physical display while the Electronic Cities project develops a virtual 
          exhibit strategy to compliment an annual festival of digital media design 
          and creativity. Equally important to this study is the developmental 
          journey from virtual to physical exhibition and vice-versa. With the 
          recent completion of two on-line educational products, we explore the 
          nature of the production team and how content and design both contribute 
        to and enhance the learning experiences of the visitor.</p>

      <h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
      <p>For centuries museums and exhibitions were synonymous 
          with physical spaces in which artifacts were displayed at a safe distance. 
          This paper explores the idea of the new museum: virtual exhibitions, 
          and how we create and present content in this relatively new form. Equally 
          important to this study is the developmental journey from virtual to 
          physical exhibition and vice-versa. With the recent completion of two 
          educational products we explore the nature of the production team and 
          how content and design both contribute to and enhance the learning experiences 
        of the visitor.</p>
        <p>Since its inception in 1994, the Design Exchange 
          (DX) has been Canada&#39;s design museum and center for design research 
          and education. It is an internationally recognized non-profit organization 
          committed to promoting greater awareness of design, and as well plays 
          an indispensable role in fostering cultural vitality and economic growth. 
          DX is located in the historic former Toronto Stock Exchange building 
          at the heart of the city&#39;s financial district. As a medium-sized 
          museum, the building houses 4500 square feet of exhibit space, hosting 
          curated and touring exhibitions based on six design disciplines: industrial, 
          fashion, graphic/new media, interior design, architecture and landscape 
          architecture. The Resource Centre is an additional space for the display 
          of the DX permanent collection of Canadian design, doubling as a study 
          and research library. DX employs a program staff of five people dedicated 
          to the development and implementation of research, exhibition and education 
        activities.</p>
      <p>DX has recently created two distinct on-line educational products: 
        <i>Design Traveller (</i><i><a href="http://www.dx.org/designtraveller" target="_blank">http://www.dx.org/designtraveller</a>)</i> 
        and <i>Electronic Cities (</i><i><a href="http://www.electroniccities.com/" target="_blank">http://www.electroniccities.com</a>)</i>. 
          The products share many common elements. Using different approaches, 
          both demonstrate experiences with educational content about design, 
        delivered in a virtual and physical environment.</p>
      <p>The two projects illustrate the challenges of developing virtual and 
          physical exhibitions that aim to provide creative educational experiences 
          in design. Experience with these two projects has revealed that the 
          educational expression of design engages students more successfully 
          when the development team is able to bridge the gap between technology 
          and content. In the creation of these two projects, our strategy was 
          to employ the active participation of artists with an interest in popular 
        culture in order to create relevant experiences for the target audience.</p>
      <h1>Design Exchange and Education</h1>
      <p>Design theory directly applies to and greatly enriches 
          many facets of the school curriculum, including science, technology, 
          history, social sciences and visual arts. Over the past few years, 
          the DX education department has identified the need for innovative educational 
          materials about design for teachers at the primary, secondary and college/university 
        levels. DX has responded to this need in many ways:</p>
          <ul>
        <li>
          
            Students of all ages visit DX to tour exhibitions, take part in workshops 
            and learn first-hand from professionals and educators about applied 
            creativity. </li>
        <li>
          
            For many years, DX coordinated a project entitled &#39;ReDesign&#39;, 
            a Web journal about design topics created by high school students 
            for other students. During the four years of the program&#39;s life 
            span, we became familiar with youth audiences and discovered their 
            interests and capabilities. </li>
        <li>
          
            Designers in the Classroom is a current DX program that matches professional 
            designers with elementary and secondary school classrooms throughout 
            Toronto. The teams work on design projects that implement current 
            curriculum requirements while producing original content for exhibitions 
            at DX.</li>
        <li>
          
            The Canadian High School Design Competition, recently transferred 
            to DX from Ottawa&#39;s Carleton University, is an opportunity for 
            students to explore their interests in design and create portfolio 
            work for admission to college/university design programs. Students 
            respond to one of five design briefs that require them to explore 
            the design process on their way to solving a specific problem. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Over the years, DX has had a terrific response to 
          these programs and has continued to search for effective ways of bringing 
          these activities to a national and international audience.</p>
        <h1>Project 1: Design Traveller</h1>
        <p>The first large-scale educational product created by the Design Exchange 
          was Design Traveller. This project was proposed to Canadian Heritage&#39;s 
          Virtual Museum of Canada Investment Program as a way to disseminate 
          Canadian design stories and images to a national audience. The project 
          was approved in June 2002 and an interactive Web site was produced by 
          September 2003. At the time of the on-line launch, DX created a physical 
          exhibition that would transform the Design Traveller environment into 
          a tangible display. </p>
        <p>Design Traveller is a bilingual educational Web site highlighting remarkable 
          Canadian-designed objects through a series of historical journeys, interactive 
          activities, and educational resources for students ages 10 – 16 
          and their teachers. The Web site is a &#39;fun environment&#39;, 
          encouraging students to learn about Canada&#39;s history - navigating 
          through text, and artifacts - while engaging in activities and resources 
          that go beyond the Web and into the classroom. </p>
        <p>The project&#39;s aim is to provide the on-line visitor with engaging, 
          unique and informative activities that position homegrown design as 
          a major influence and presence in the lives of all Canadians. The geographically 
          accessible nature of on-line projects allows the Web site to be used 
          as a current resource and reference guide for libraries, schools and 
          homes across the country.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="kaye.fig1.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: Design Traveller" width="400" height="277"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 1: home page of Design 
          Traveller</p>
        <p>Design Traveller is divided into three parts: Game, Gallery and Resources.</p>
        <p>For the game and gallery, thirty-five objects from the DX permanent 
          collection were chosen to represent Canadian design from the second 
          half of the twentieth century. The DX collection is the only collection 
          of modern industrial Canadian design in the country, and includes pieces 
          ranging from lamps and chairs to radios and Bar-B-Qs. </p>
        <p>The game component of the site explores the artifacts by decade, from 
          the 1950s to the year 2000. The player is motivated by the challenge 
          of solving a murder mystery that includes a reading-comprehension trivia 
          game (fig.2).</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="kaye.fig2.jpg" alt="Screen Shott: Design Traveller artefact page" width="400" height="302"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 2: trivia game</p>
        <p>An introduction to each section identifies the mood, styles and historical 
          facts of the decade (fig.3).</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="kaye.fig3.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: Explore the 1950s" width="400" height="303"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 3: The decades</p>
        <p>Once the visitor has become familiar with the time period, he/she 
          enters a room designed according to one of the five featured decades 
          (fig.4).</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="kaye.fig4.jpg" alt="View of a mystery room" width="400" height="147"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 4: A mystery room</p>
        <p>By situating the objects of the DX collection in the decade in which 
          they were designed, visitors are provided with an enhanced perspective 
          on the sociological, political and cultural influences of the time. 
        </p>
        <p>Visitors to the site are also offered a variety of unique educational 
          resources that allow them to explore design and the design process on-line 
          and in class. Resources include downloadable lesson plans and word games 
          for in-class use in elementary and secondary schools.</p>
        <p>The exhibition that followed the completion of the Website took the 
          virtual environments into the physical realm by transplanting the colour-coded 
          organization of information into staged rooms (fig.5).</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="kaye.fig5.jpg" alt="Photo: Room in a gallery" width="400" height="244"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 5: a staged room</p>
        <p>These &#39;stages&#39; featured the actual artifacts from the 
          DX collection and inspired a life-like vision of virtual space. The 
          artist/designer that produced the interface of the Web site was invited 
          to work with the exhibit production team to create an easy flow from 
          the look and feel of the on-line experience to the museum&#39;s 3D 
          space.</p>
        <p>Bringing the historic artifacts into an on-line experience was our 
          first challenge. The second hurdle was transforming the virtual representations 
          of space, style, imagery and navigation into the physical realm. This 
          was achieved by including the presence of the Web site in the exhibit. 
          Computer stations were set up at each stage, and visitors could interact 
          with the virtual rooms while making connections to the actual artifacts 
          in front of them. The bulk of the didactic information was provided 
          on these monitors, while the objects were on display in re-creations 
          of the virtual environment.</p>
        <h1>Project 2: Electronic Cities</h1>
        <p>Electronic Cities is an educational Web site based on the content produced 
          for Digifest 2003. Digifest is the Design Exchange&#39;s international 
          festival dedicated to interactive art and design. The theme for 2003&#39;s 
          four-day festival was <i>Electronic Cities, </i>an exploration of developments 
          in digital media design in reference to the past, present and future 
          of our built environments. The festival featured an international agenda 
          of programmers, designers, architects and artists, who brought their 
          innovative concepts and products to the DX stage.</p>
        <p>Before the festival&#39;s launch, the Digifest program team put together 
          a strategy to digitize the event&#39;s unique content so that it could 
          reach a wider audience. With the support of the Telus New Media E-Learning 
          Fund and Canadian Heritage, DX created an educational Web site targeting 
          high school, college/university students, and life learners.</p>
        <p>Both the festival and Web site served as opportunities to reflect on 
          the era of the wired megalopolis in which global communities form and 
          disperse in both real and virtual urban spaces. The content of the festival 
          presentations focused on many &#39;hot&#39; topics such as<i> augmented 
          realities, emotive architecture, prosthetic aesthetics </i>and<i> warchalking</i>. 
          Audiences discovered how game developers approach virtual urban design 
          and why innovative international architects are designing buildings 
          that think and react. </p>

        <p>The Electronic Cities Web site (fig. 6) offers an enriched and expanded 
          experience of the geographically specific festival showcase. It benefits 
          our own organizational goals, the exposure and understanding of the 
          work of our featured content producers, and the appetite of untapped 
          design enthusiasts across the country and abroad. </p>
        <p>Electronic Cities on-line was launched ten months following the festival. 
          One section of the Web site includes a series of lesson plans that guide 
          teachers and students in the development of new media content on the 
          theme of <i>Electronic Cities.</i><b> </b>The lesson plans are publicly 
          accessible, offering content by many of the festival presenters in the 
          form of case studies. The other section of the Web site is comprised 
          of a restricted area intended for classroom use. In this environment, 
          classroom assignments are provided for each topic or theme. Assignments 
          range from writing research or reflective papers to creating graphic 
          and animated visualizations. Teachers control their on-line classroom 
          and are able to grade the assignments that their students upload to 
          the site. Once the work is complete, the work can be posted to an on-line 
          community gallery. </p>
        <p>The Electronic Cities Web site provides current and unique resources, 
          including video presentations, texts, and documented visual art works. 
          These kinds of materials are rare and difficult to deliver in a form 
          that is accessible to educators and students. For this reason, every 
          attempt was made to take sophisticated ideas and interpret them in a 
          format that is easy to read and understand. </p>
        <p>The combination of the Electronic Cities festival and Web site was 
          conceived as a programming model for the delivery and translation of 
          high quality content to every Canadian classroom. Above all, it strives 
          to encourage and inspire our young designers of the future.</p>
        <h2>Physical vs. Virtual</h2>
        <p>DX projects are often bound by the physical and spatial qualities of 
          design itself, whether expressed as place through architecture, landscape 
          architecture or interior design; or as products produced by industrial, 
          fashion or graphic designers. The use of new media tools in these design 
          disciplines has altered not only production and delivery methods in 
          all fields, but also the face of design entirely. The impact of new 
          digital tools on design, for instance, becomes apparent in the new generation 
          of designers who premiered their work at Digifest. Their methodologies 
          and their content are as innovative as the tools they use. The new design 
          landscape has become one that blurs the lines between physical and virtual 
          representation.</p>
        <p>The possibilities and realities presented at Digifest represent variations 
          of augmented reality, where physical spaces are literally augmented 
          by real-time virtual realities. The DX has responded to this exciting 
          new landscape by focusing on the relationships and strengths of designing 
          physical and virtual programs as a complete programming package.</p>
        <p>Both Design Traveller and Electronic Cities employed a design vision 
          that would attract and sustain a very targeted audience. Design played 
          a key role in the development of these projects and an even bigger part 
          in the development of their transformations from physical to virtual 
          and vice-versa.</p>
        <p>The Electronic Cities Web site served several purposes. The main goal 
          was to document the proceedings of the festival for a wider audience 
          and create a product that was organized in a format resembling an on-line 
          exhibition and educational resource. The process of documentation led 
          to the development of a product that would offer some interaction with 
          the transcribed material. Going beyond the simple question-answer period 
          at the end of festival presentations, the visitor explores the material, 
          digests it, and is then challenged (by working on the assignments) to 
          become a critic of information or a digital media creator. Both the 
          Web site and the festival offer a basis for different visitor experiences. 
          Each medium has its own identity while being built around the same core 
          content. The resulting package makes for a richer and more integrated 
          experience that satisfies a range of visitor interests. </p>
        <p>The transition from festival to Web site was facilitated by having 
          two of the Digifest presenters involved with the design: Marc Ngui, 
          cartoon artist/architect, and Duro3, graffiti artist/Web/graphic designer. 
          Ngui and Duro3 are both close to the pulse of popular street culture 
          and were immediately identified as partners on the Web site&#39;s 
          development. Having had first hand experience of the voice and feel 
          of the festival, these artists/designers were able to help tackle the 
          transformation of the physical experience into a virtual one. It was 
          essential that Electronic Cities&#39; on-line incarnation be attractive 
          to its target audience of 16 to 25 year olds. By creating a mix of hip 
          design and playful iconography, the site caters to the aesthetic sensibilities 
          of the target audience. </p>
        <p>The Design Traveller Web site and exhibition was a similar journey 
          of physical/virtual transformation, albeit traveling in the opposite 
          direction. The transformation can even be described in two stages: from 
          physical to virtual and virtual to physical. The content from DX archives 
          and the artifacts from the permanent collection were modeled in digital 
          3D for the Web site, marking the first journey from physical to virtual. 
          Once the virtual environment was complete, the content and design were 
          interpreted for the physical exhibition. </p>
        <p>Close to the beginning of the Design Traveller project, it was necessary 
          to identify a designer who could create a virtual space that targeted 
          the adolescent visitor without presenting a juvenile image. The design 
          was headed by Duro3 just as he was beginning his relationship with Digifest. 
          As a celebrated graffiti artist, Duro3 was able to infuse the Web interface 
          with an energy not usually associated with the didactic nature of museum 
          exhibitions. Unexpected shapes and lively colours cater to an audience 
          that is familiar with playing video games.</p>
        <p>The exhibition was aimed at a similar audience, but an effort was made 
          to avoid alienating the other visitor groups. A multi-media approach 
          was developed to utilize the strengths of both the virtual and physical 
          media. Elements of the virtual were brought into the exhibit to promote 
          the Web site and notify the visitor of a value added experience online. 
          Duro3 was brought in to recreate his shards of colour on the floors 
          and walls of the exhibit space. The 3D models of the virtual rooms were 
          made into slides that were projected on the walls. These projections 
          set the stage for the actual collection objects that were placed in 
          front of their modeled counterparts in the projections. The result was 
          a dramatic use of light and shadow that bridged the gap between physical 
          and virtual representation. </p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="kaye.fig7.jpg" alt="Photograph: Computer station in the design exchange" width="400" height="543"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 7: the virtual and the physical</p>
        <p>Computer stations (fig.7) next to each stage contributed to the sense 
          of a virtual exhibit within the physical one. For the most part, the 
          exhibition appealed to student visitors. Reviews from adults proved 
          more complex as some welcomed the interactive computer stations and 
          slide projections, while others were uncomfortable with artifacts sharing 
          space with computer stations. </p>
        <p>The experience of working on the Design Traveller and Electronic Cities 
          projects was a turning point for the DX programming team. The opportunity 
          to create on-line educational experiences increased the value of DX 
          museum and education programs. For a medium sized museum with limited 
          physical space, the virtual world provided the &#39;square footage&#39; 
          needed to deliver this type of complete-package programming.</p>
        <h2 class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><b>Aura vs. Information</b></h2>
        <p>Many of the speakers at Digifest were exploring the idea of the physical 
          and the virtual within their own work. Sabine Himmelsbach of the ZKM 
          Museum in Germany delivered the festival&#39;s keynote address. In an essay 
          prepared for the festival program entitled <i>Virtualization of the 
          Metropolis</i>, she describes a world that is divided into information 
          &#39;haves&#39; and &#39;have-nots&#39;. Himmelsbach, along with forty featured presenters, 
          ranging from game designers, architects, hackers, graphic designers 
          and design managers, illustrated in a range of ways how the economic 
          and social capital of on-line information is still integrally - albeit 
          interchangeably -connected to the design, delivery, adoption and consumption 
          of physical spaces. The networks between the physical and the virtual 
          seem more common and natural today. This is especially the case for 
          the target audiences of our on-line projects.</p>
        <p>Information &#39;haves&#39; and &#39;have-nots&#39; offer an intriguing relationship 
          to the ideas that were put forward by Reesa Greenberg in her recent 
          paper, <i>Editing the Image: Museums and the Web</i>, presented at the 
          University of Toronto&#39;s Editing (Out?) The Image Conference (Fall 2003). 
          Referring to an exhibition of the works of Frida Kahlo, produced by 
          The Jewish Museum in New York, Greenberg illustrated how the on-line 
          exhibition served the primary purpose of delivering information about 
          the artworks, while the physical exhibition focused on the creation 
          and the support of an aura about the artist and her work. Greenberg 
          suggests a correlation between virtual exhibition and physical exhibition, 
          and information and aura. Within a physical exhibition, a painting&#39;s 
          aura is established by providing ample, unhindered space around the 
          artwork, while in an on-line display, a painting&#39;s significance 
          is established using abundant textual information. </p>
        <p>In the Design Traveller project, we begin to see a breakdown in the 
          assumption that aura is solely connected to physical representation. 
          While it is true that the basis for establishing a collection of Canadian 
          industrial design objects is to support and celebrate the essence of 
          national design, each object in the collection is thus circumscribed 
          with its own distinct aura by virtue of being collected and housed at 
          DX. However, in the Design Traveller physical exhibition, a virtual 
          tableau is created not only to support, but to potentially undermine 
          the object&#39;s value. The actual objects of the collection appear 
          within a veiled shadow of colour - an image projection of the virtual 
          room veils every object so that it becomes an integral part of the virtual 
          tableau (the 3D environment is projected to human scale). (See figure 
          2). The aura of the object is underwritten by the tableau itself, which 
          is standing in as a virtual representation of the on-line virtual representation. 
          This effect is further augmented by the contributions of Duro3, a graffiti 
          artist and graphic illustrator for both the Design Traveller and Electronic 
          Cities Web sites. Duro3 recreates the Design Traveller&#39;s graphic 
          elements for the physical exhibition. What the viewers experience is 
          a simulation of the on-line virtual environment. The response is mixed. 
          Viewers expect aura from a physical exhibition. They do not expect to 
          see objects stripped of their aura to be delivered as pure information, 
          risking redundancy. They do not want shadowed silhouettes, even if they 
          are created by colourful projection screens. </p>
        <p>From a different perspective, student visitors, an audience typically 
          less interested in static exhibitions, were fascinated with an exhibit 
          that played with perception and involved complex visual information 
          for the shortest of attention spans. Students were eager to jump from 
          computer to computer either before or after exploring the artifacts 
          on &#39;stage&#39;. The effect of using interactive elements within 
          the exhibit space served this particular audience by catering to more 
          contemporary ways of learning.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, in the Design Traveller Web site, the 3D game environment 
          creates an aura - not around any one object - but rather around a series 
          of lost decades. It is tied to nostalgia. The information about the 
          objects is supported by trivia about our past. It responds to a fascination 
          with retro-culture. Here, the strategic use of secondary information 
          and 3D technology within an immersive game environment creates a support 
          for the objects and an attempt to reestablish aura within a virtual 
          set.</p>
        <p>Within the context of our Electronic Cities project, keynote speaker 
          Sabine Himmelsbach&#39;s picture of the telepolis and Greenberg&#39;s understanding 
          of the complex nature of the real and the virtual exhibition space are 
          poignant and potentially interchangeable ideas. For example, Himmelsbach&#39;s 
          insights about the city as a metaphor for our virtual spaces resonate 
          with the museum experience or exhibition described by Greenberg. Himmelsbach 
          states:</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Today, cities are partially defined by their virtual 
          urban spaces, which radically alter the image of the city itself. The 
          telepolis as metropolis of the future can never replace the real, experiential 
          world, but it can offer its inhabitants enriched and expanded potentials.</p>
        <p>When we think of targeting museums to larger audiences, we have grown 
          accustomed to migrating the physical exhibition experience to an on-line 
          experience. We have still larger leaps to make when we begin to bring 
          our virtual urban spaces into our museums. We could apply Himmelsbach&#39;s 
          statement about virtual and physical cities to museums: </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Today, <i>exhibitions</i> are partially defined by 
          their virtual urban spaces, which radically alter the image of the <i>exhibition</i> 
          itself. The <i>virtual exhibition</i> as <i>physical exhibition</i> 
          of the future can never replace the real, experiential world, but it 
          can offer its inhabitants enriched and expanded potentials.</p>
        <p>The Electronic Cities and Design Traveller Web sites offer something 
          more by providing tools that are unique to the medium, thus escaping 
          direct comparisons to physical exhibitions. Both provide interactive 
          involvement with content that targets the evolving nature of audiences.</p>
        <h2>Art Direction and Design - Team Perspectives</h2>
        <p>Art direction and design played a large role in the development of 
          the Design Traveller and Electronic Cities projects, in terms of both 
          content and layout/exhibit design. Here we ask the content developer 
          of Electronic Cities and the designer on both projects to reflect on 
          their experiences throughout production.</p>
        <h3><b>John Sobol</b></h3>
        <p>As co-director of Digifest, and co-producer of the Electronic Cities 
          Web site, John Sobol developed and wrote twenty case studies for Electronic 
          Cities. John responds to three questions regarding the artistic vision 
          and creative experiences throughout production. Questions are in italics.</p>
        <p><i>What was your experience working with both a graffiti artist and 
          a comic artist in the development of the Electronic Cities Web site? 
          How would this differ from working with a graphic designer? Do you think 
          this choice impacts user response?</i></p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">The experience was different than working with most 
          designers because the two artists tackled the design problem with a 
          more pronounced expectation of finding a solution that was based on 
          a personal and idiosyncratic style. Their work affects user response 
          because there is more to grab onto - more of a raw personality and less 
          slick faddish design.</p>
        <p><i>Can you describe your experience of putting content presented by 
          designers and artists at the festival into an on-line educational context 
          that is aimed at an audience demographically younger (secondary and 
          post-secondary school level) than the festival-goers (25 years +).</i></p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">This was a very satisfying experience for me as I 
          very much enjoy creating educational content. I find it very satisfying 
          and empowering to present challenging and provocative ideas and work 
          to young minds in a constructive context.</p>
        <p><i>Can you briefly describe the aim of Electronic Cities and the challenges 
          of producing and distributing an e-learning Web site.</i></p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">The aim of the Web site is to create a catalytic and 
          inspiring context in which students can produce experiential learning 
          projects. They can use case studies that document technological innovations 
          as jumping off points for developing meaningful local narratives about 
          life in the electronic city.</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">The main challenge in distribution is that the dominant 
          educational infrastructure does not reflect the cultural landscape and 
          educational imperatives of teenage life today. Consequently, a useful 
          and well-designed learning resource is incompatible with the teaching 
          methodologies used in most classrooms and by most teachers. Moreover, 
          the e-learning industry in Canada suffers from a disastrous disengagement 
          on the part of both the public sector (i.e. School boards) and private 
          sector (especially ISPs, cablecos and telcos).</p>
        <p>Sobol&#39;s main challenge was to transform content for a younger and less 
          experienced audience. It was essential to ensure that wording, sentence 
          structure and presentation were accessible to the visitor. It was also 
          important to investigate curriculum guidelines in order to create a 
          product that could be easily used and marketed to a school audience. 
          Much of the content included complex ideas and new terminology that 
          had to be translated into more simplified language.</p>
        <p>Sobol discusses the struggles that are faced by educational Web site 
          producers when their product is ready for school use. Marketing opportunities 
          are slowed down due to the relative unfamiliarity with the medium (Internet) 
          as a source for educational resources that go beyond simple reference. 
          Teachers do not yet seem to have confidence in the value of on-line 
          material as they would with textbooks. By providing these materials 
          from a recognized institution, both Design Traveller and Electronic 
          Cities have a better chance at reassuring teachers of the reliability 
          and value of the information being presented. As more educational virtual 
          projects are produced (many are supported by Canadian Heritage&#39;s 
          Virtual Museum of Canada Investment Program, <a href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca</a>), 
          teachers may become more comfortable utilizing these rich sources of 
          Canadian and international educational content.</p>
        <h3>Duro3</h3>
        <p>Duro3, a.k.a. Arturo Parada, is a Canadian graffiti muralist whose 
          innovative 3D style has influenced aerosol artists around the world. 
          His organic and fluid graffiti style has profoundly influenced his idiosyncratic 
          and widely respected Web design style. Duro3 premiered his new creation 
          <i>Pod</i> at Digifest 2003 and designed the visual identity of both 
          the Design Traveller and Electronic Cities Web sites. He extended his 
          involvement with the Design Traveller project by participating in the 
          production design of the exhibition.</p>
        <p>An interview with Duro3, conducted in the middle of the installation 
          of the Design Traveller exhibition, reveals his enthusiasm for crossing 
          over from virtual to physical and vice-versa, while using both as a 
          forum for unbridled creativity.</p>
        <p><i>How did you come about being involved with the Design Traveller 
          project?</i></p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">I met the co-curator of Digifest at a graffiti symposium 
          and that led to my presentation and collaborative work for Digifest. 
          The next project that came about was Design Traveller. I was brought 
          in to do a remix of the initial design of the Web site. I didn&#39;t 
          know that the Web site would be turned into a big installation in the 
          museum. I was brought in to create some elements in the exhibit - on 
          the floor and the walls - and make it look like the Web site. The style 
          was based on a fractal design, abstract elements, different shapes and 
          patterns that create movement around the space.</p>
        <i>I know when you work, you&#39;re always surrounded 
          by your entourage - what do you call them?</i>
        <p class="BlockQuote">My crew?</p>
        <p><i>Can you talk about how that works? What are the dynamics of “the 
          crew”?</i></p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Well, I was taught graffiti by my cousin and it&#39;s 
          something that&#39;s been going on throughout the ages - that teacher-student 
          relationship. So I started teaching some other people including my friend 
          Water - he ended up doing great work on the project for Digifest - I 
          think it&#39;s very important to be surrounded by other creative minds. 
          You teach someone something and they come back and teach you something. 
        </p>
        <p><i>Would you bring your friends here?</i></p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Oh, for sure, I would tell everyone that I was working 
          here and they would be impressed. </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">I think that people of my generation don&#39;t go 
          to museums that much. I hoped that we could change that with this project.</p>
        <p><i>Would they look at the work that you&#39;ve done on the Web site? 
          Is that something that is more accessible than a museum?</i></p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">I think nowadays the internet has enabled so much. 
          People don&#39;t have to go to the museum at all. It&#39;s actually 
          good and maybe a bit bad. Maybe now they won&#39;t leave their houses 
          anymore! They can just sit at home and visit the artifacts. </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">But by being here in the exhibit, I discovered that 
          I had no idea how much Canadians have contributed to design. I&#39;ve 
          seen a lot of these things before, but I didn&#39;t realize that they 
          were designed by Canadians. I definitely learned something by the end 
          of this project. That was a really cool experience to take a lot of 
          new information from the content.</p>
        <p><i>Do you like working with projects that will actually be used in 
          the classroom?</i></p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Ya, that&#39;s amazing. I feel like I&#39;m helping 
          out kids that are not necessarily interested in studying. I helped create 
          an artistic environment for the historic information. </p>
        <p><i>How do you identify yourself? As an artist, a designer, or a programmer? 
          </i></p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Right now I think people would consider me a Web designer, 
          muralist, a graphic designer, but me personally I just want to be like 
          Leonardo Da Vinci in the end – on a constant journey of creativity.</p>
        <p>Duro3 discusses how he has benefited from working on the projects. 
          As a designer, he found that he was learning as he worked with the team. 
          The collaborative nature of these projects is in tune with his own working 
          philosophy. Duro3 works with many young designers at the beginning of 
          their careers and is able to keep abreast of what engages youth. He 
          is aware of their interests and acknowledges their apparent lack of 
          interest in visiting museums. He believes that they are the ideal audience 
          to benefit from on-line exhibitions and that these Web sites could drive 
          attendance to the museums themselves.</p>
        <h1><b>Conclusion</b></h1>
        <p>DX has a small but dynamic staff who continuously seek to program relevant 
          projects that will increase the museum&#39;s ability to showcase and 
          celebrate Canadian design locally, nationally, and internationally. 
          As a small team, we seek new ways of balancing relevancy and celebration 
          with resourcefulness and audience impact. </p>
        <p>Our on-line exhibition projects have permitted us to explore ways of 
          broadening our local audiences. We have explored how a virtual exhibition 
          space may contribute to our more traditional programming activities. 
          We have learned that displaying greater amounts of information about 
          artifacts through the use of digital media tools within an exhibit space 
          can be advantageous in reaching a wider, younger audience. We have also 
          gained valuable research information in regards to the relationship 
          between aura and physical or virtual representation of artifacts and 
          ideas. The presence of aura within an on-line exhibition points to the 
          potential of reaching museum enthusiasts on-line. </p>
        <p>The Design Traveller and Electronic Cities projects have demonstrated 
          that our collaborations with artists and designers not only bring unique 
          stylistic elements to our museum programs, but also often attract younger 
          audiences who share a kindred knowledge of sophisticated digital media 
          skills. </p>
        <p>DX initiatives aim to apply current design and museum practices. Our 
          physical and virtual spaces are inevitably linked and when they are 
          explored together, they provide rich, multi-layered museum experiences. 
          The blurring of virtual and physical offers us an exciting opportunity 
          to critically discover new models for museum representation.</p>
