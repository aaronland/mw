      <p class="PaperTitle">Rich Experiences for All Participants</p>
      <p class="Author">Liddy Nevile, La Trobe University; Sophie Lissonnet, James Cook University; Vera Roberts, and Jutta Treviranus, University of Toronto, Canada</p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
       <p class="AbstractText">Museums are developing devices, portable and wearable 
          that can, in many cases, be used to enrich cultural participants&#39; experiences. 
          These standard user access points may be made accessible to everyone 
          equally through work by Assistive Technology Research Centre (ATRC) 
          (<a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc/" target="_blank">http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc/</a>) and now 
          others to develop a user profile known in its IMS instantiation as the 
          ACCLIP (<a href="http://www.imsproject.org/accessibility/" target="_blank">http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility</a>/). 
          This paper aims to encourage museums to enable their information devices 
          and systems to accommodate user needs as expressed in accessibility 
          metadata profiles. In this way, these museum devices will be truly inclusive. 
          There is also consideration of some extensions to the accessibility 
          architecture that may have specific value in the museum context. Starting 
          with achievements to date, we provide examples of how the accessForAll 
          element and matching resource descriptions might be used and extended 
        for museum purposes. </p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Powerful technologies often have the capacity to create new barriers 
          as other barriers are removed. As a result, technologists always need 
          to be alert to the social implications of their work. In particular, 
          the growth of the Web has drawn attention to the need for the development 
          of techniques that support accessibility in the context of a highly 
          graphical, often multi-media interactive digital space. It is important 
          that as the Web is increasingly used to deliver information related 
          to cultural identity and events, the information be accessible to all 
        participants in that culture. </p>
      <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been outstanding in its early 
          recognition that Web technologies were not supportive of people with 
          special needs and therefore unusually discriminatory among computer 
          technologies. To remedy this situation, W3C directed efforts to ensure 
          that all ongoing Web technologies are accessible. W3C develops specifications 
          for general use, including specifications for content, and both Web 
          access and authoring devices. W3C has not so far worked specifically 
          on the needs of individual users (user profiles) although it has several 
          working groups that aim to increase device independence and other important 
        aspects of accessibility that support the use of user profiles. </p>
      <p>W3C has been developing a language for expressing user preferences 
          and profiles to make it easy to exchange user profile information between 
          compliant devices such as a Web server and a telephone, or a server 
          and desktop browser. This language is known as Composite Capabilities/Preferences 
        Profile (CC/PP) and is published at <a href="http://www.w3.org/Mobile/CCPP/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/Mobile/CCPP/</a>.</p>
      <p>The AccessForAll profile (<a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility/index.cfm#version1pd" target="_blank">http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility/index.cfm#version1pd</a>) 
          was originally developed at the University of Toronto but was publicly 
          released as a user profile specification (Accessibility for LIP or ACCLIP) 
          after further work by the IMS Global Learning Consortium, Inc. (<a href="http://www.imsproject.org/" target="_blank">http://www.imsglobal.org</a>). IMS has developed 
          the profile for integration with its broader Learner Information Package 
          (LIP) that carries a range of information about students so their specific 
        learning and assessment needs are met. </p>
      <p>The accessForAll specification provides a simple way of recording a 
          user&#39;s control, display and content needs or preferences in order to 
          accommodate them. A given profile will be used to match a user with 
          suitable resources or services, so the services or resources need appropriate 
          descriptive metadata. The specifications for resource profiles are currently 
          being developed as the AccessMetadata Specification, due to be completed 
        and released in mid-2004. </p>
      <p>Many resources and services are already being described according to 
          already well-established specifications: the IMS LIP, the W3C Web Semantic 
          Web Activity, the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES), and more. 
          It is important that the AccessMetadata information model be one that 
          can be implemented easily within these established specifications, and 
          thus be interoperable. To ensure interoperability, a collaborative approach 
          to development of AccessMetadata has been taken by IMS who is hosting 
          the development rather than working just within the IMS Consortium. 
          The decision to work on the profiles for users and resources in an open 
          and inclusive way has led to opportunities for communities beyond the 
          educational one in which the work originated to think about how they 
        too might take advantage of the specifications.</p>
      <p>The Quinkan Matchbox Project (<a href="http://www.jcu.edu.au/rockart/Matchbox/" target="_blank">http://www.jcu.edu.au/rockart/Matchbox/</a>) 
          is concerned with developing a repository and cataloguing applications 
          that will be of use to a small, remote, Indigenous Australian community 
          as it manages its cultural heritage. Now in its development phase, the 
          Quinkan Matchbox Project team has already identified a number of additional 
          features or extensions of the AccessMetadata that could be useful in 
        the virtual museum context and the proposed local visitors&#39; centre.</p>
      <h1>The AccessForAll Profile</h1>
      <p>The accessForAll element of the LIP was designed with a wide audience 
          in mind and is suitable for independent use for specifying user needs 
          and preferences, including those which are essential for people with 
          disabilities. In this context, the term <i>accessibility</i> is quickly 
          identified with accessibility of the type required in the USA by section 
          508 ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), or the W3C WAI&#39;s Web Content 
          Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/</a>). Accessibility 
          of this type is of interest as a guarantee that no citizens will be 
          discriminated against as a result of needing assistive technologies 
        or special settings in order to access information as others do.</p>
      <p> The developers of the specifications, including those from W3C, IMS, 
          the University of Toronto and elsewhere, consider, however, that their 
          work is not only relevant to people with disabilities but also helpful 
          to audiences in general. Accessibility metadata enables levels of flexibility 
          and responsiveness in Web content that may benefit a variety of individuals 
          accessing content in a variety of contexts. For example, a viewer may 
          create a profile that indicates alternatives to audio to enable situation-specific 
          access such as from a quiet area in a library. AccessForAll records 
          the needs and preferences of users with respect to display, control 
          and the content. Examples of needing different displays include cases 
          when a blind individual attempts to access a train timetable with screen 
          reader software that does not translate tables well, or a deaf person 
          watches a video and requires captions of the audio track. Alternative 
          control refers to non-mouse control of an interface such as keyboard 
          control. For example, a blind individual cannot see where the cursor 
          is, or a spastic individual may not be able to use a mouse to move about 
          a screen. In these cases, keyboard commands such as TAB may be used 
          to move through Web content; furthermore, the keyboard may be an onscreen 
          keyboard that is manipulated through switch technology. Examples of 
          the need to change content itself occur where a primary resource, such 
          as a digital version of a film, is to be &#39;viewed&#39; by individuals who 
          are deaf or blind. In such a case, there will be a need for closed captions 
        of audio elements or descriptions of the visual elements.</p>
      <p>There are working examples of the AccessForAll profile in action, especially 
          in a project known as Web-4-All (<a href="http://web-4-all.ca/w4asite/english/home_e.htm" target="_blank">http://web-4-all.ca/w4asite/english/home_e.htm</a>) 
          developed for the Web Accessibility Office of Industry Canada. As the 
        Web-4-All home page says:</p> <p class="BlockQuote">Web-4-All combines hardware and software to quickly 
          configure a public access computer to accommodate the special needs 
          of a user and then back to a standard setting for the next user. In 
          spring and summer 2001, Web-4-All was tested at several public Internet 
          access locations in Ontario and New Brunswick.  The pilot projects were 
          made possible by donations of smart cards for use in storing user preferences, 
        from Bell Canada and Royal Bank. </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> (<a href="http://web-4-all.ca/w4asite/english/home_e.htm" target="_blank">http://web-4-all.ca/w4asite/english/home_e.htm</a> 
        2004-01-28)</p>
      <p>The University of Toronto is currently working on development of a 
          resource repository using resource and service profiles to match users&#39; 
          ACCLIP. The target audience for The Inclusive Learning Exchange (TILE) 
          (<a href="http://barrierfree.ca/tile/" target="_blank">http://barrierfree.ca/tile/</a>) 
          development is described broadly by the following comments from the 
        Web site:</p>
      <p>The developments in this project are critical to any learner or learning 
          context that does not fit the model of the typical student and the typical 
          learning environment. This includes learners with disabilities, with 
          unique learning styles, using atypical client devices, learning in unusual 
          environments and learners approaching the topic from different perspectives 
          or knowledge backgrounds. (<a href="http://barrierfree.ca/tile/" target="_blank">http://barrierfree.ca/tile/</a>        </p>
      <p>The combination of the AccessForAll Specifications and the AccessMetadata 
          Specifications should allow applications to tailor resources and their 
          display and control so that users get exactly what they need. Within 
          education this responsiveness is an endorsed high priority because many 
          legal systems now require that education be accessible to all, and as 
          the teaching and learning become more digitally-based, technologies 
        that make equal access possible are in increasing demand.</p>
      <h1>An Educational Use Case</h1>
      <p>It is often handy, when trying to understand or define the proposed 
          use of a new technology, to present a scenario that exemplifies its 
          proposed use. A typical use case for AccessMetadata within education 
        is offered by the following:</p> <p class="BlockQuote">Maria has a motor-coordination disability and requires 
          a keyboard that accommodates her need for time to locate and press the 
          keys she wants. She uses what are called &#39;sticky keys&#39; so that inadvertent 
          touching of keys does not destroy her work. In addition, she needs to 
          be sure that when she uses the automated teller machine, for example, 
          the machine does not time-out while she is still trying to enter her 
          data. Maria learned English only after migrating to the US and often 
          has difficulty with technical English. She thinks about math and science 
        in Spanish. Like many clever students, she is dyslexic.</p> <p class="BlockQuote">Maria is a good student and has already successfully 
          studied several subjects at the university. She wants to study physics 
          now and has heard of an on-line course which combines on-line students 
          with those present on campus so they can undertake laboratory experiments. 
          Maria does not want other students to know of her challenges and likes 
          the idea of not having to be physically present for the laboratory exercises. 
          On the other hand, she is worried about the final examinations in the 
          subject. She knows that these are conducted on-line and fears she will 
        be too slow to get a fair result in the true/false sections.</p> <p class="BlockQuote">Maria finds out that the university has instituted 
          a new system that allows her to log in to the university from any learning 
          environment and automatically have the settings adjusted to meet her 
          unique needs. Her profile indicates that time-dependent responses will 
          be over-ridden to allow her appropriate response time. She will need 
          this accommodation, especially during the final examinations. Satisfied 
        all will be well, Maria enrolls in the course. </p> <p class="BlockQuote">Maria is delighted when the on-line enrolment form 
          prompts a note that advises her about what she will need to do in order 
          to boost her rather weak mathematics background if she is to do well 
          at physics. Maria&#39;s learning information package also indicates 
          that worked examples are preferred to written explanations so these 
          are replaced by suitable alternatives for her. In further response to 
          her ACCLIP, an on-line, English-Spanish mathematical glossary is available 
        for her at all times.</p>
      <p>In our example, Maria gets the benefit of working with a system that 
          &#39;knows&#39; her and adapts instantly to her needs and preferences. The experiences 
          she has on-line equate most favourably with those of other students, 
          despite her special needs. Worked examples of mathematical problems 
          help her come to terms with the way in which students in the US are 
          taught to do their math work. Other students do not need these scaffolds 
          or know that Maria uses them. Also, Maria&#39;s teachers do not have 
          to worry about providing alternative content on an individual basis 
        either because the system already makes this available.</p>
      <p>In preparing materials for courses such as the one for which Maria 
          has enrolled, content developers need to think of the different modalities 
          in which the material may need to be accessed, particularly if the content 
          is not just transformable text (e.g. may be made larger or condensed 
          to headings). Material such as video, audio and images will require 
          equivalent material in alternative formats. The original content and 
          its related alternative formats should then either be bundled together, 
          if they are all located in a suitable place, or virtually bundled together, 
          so applications can find them for those who need them. In the use case 
          context, the university would relate the different presentation formats 
          using metadata to describe the components and their alternative formats 
          so they can be matched to her user profile. The compiled content will 
          contain the formats Maria prefers whenever possible, and the presentation 
          of the material will also follow criteria selected by Maria and stored 
        in her LIP. </p>
      <h1>The AccessForAll Profile</h1>
      <p>The following images show the structure of the AccessForAll element 
        and how the details are included:</p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="nevileFig1.html"><img src="nevile-fig-1-t.jpg" width="400" height="743" border="0"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1"></a>Figure 1: AccessForAll control needs and preferences</p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="nevileFig2.html"><img src="nevile-fig-2-t.jpg" width="400" height="602" border="0"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2"></a>Figure 2: AccessForAll display needs and preferences</p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="nevileFig3.html"><img src="nevile-fig-3-t.jpg" width="400" height="174" border="0"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig3"></a>Figure 3: AccessForAll content needs and preferences</p>
      <p>Descriptions of the use and values for the elements are all detailed 
          in section 3.1 of the ACCLIP v.1.0 Specification (IMS 2003). What is 
          of special interest is that all the challenges of access that are critical 
          for people with disabilities, such as issues around video, audio and 
          dense content, should be implemented immediately. Also, challenges of 
          access that affect a wider audience such as low bandwidth, lack of hardware 
          or PDA access should be addressed secondly. It is in the area of providing 
          equivalent content where there are opportunities for clarification and 
          development. How equivalent access for museum community can be implemented 
        is of particular interest.</p>
      <h1>A Museum Use Case </h1>
      <p>A simple museum use case might help:</p> <p class="BlockQuote">Maria is visiting the Wonderful Museum at Magic City. 
          She has a wireless enabled device on which she has her AccessForAll 
          profile. She collects a display gadget at the museum&#39;s front desk and 
          downloads her profile. Maria likes sharp contrast; immediately the display 
          switches to light yellow text on a blue background. Also, the output 
          is in Spanish, instead of the original English. In addition, Maria has 
          a problem with text that is full of culturally specific metaphors, so 
          she is offered the use of the Spanish version of the glossary of US 
          idioms used at the museum. When Mary returns home, she has access to 
          virtual Spanish texts that describe in greater detail what she has seen 
          at the museum. These texts are displayed in suitable formats on her 
          desktop computer, enabling her to relive her experience and cut-and-paste 
        useful pieces of the text for use in her travel journal.</p>
      <p>As part of meeting the needs of visitors such as Maria, the Museum 
          will have to catalogue the relevant information about its holdings and 
          explanatory material. Furthermore, care must be taken to ensure this 
          content is in appropriate formats. For example, changing the font and 
          background colours means that text content must be in a format that 
          can be transformed. Also, if Maria were in fact unable to read text 
          at all, it might need to be read aloud to her by a screen reader or 
          similar assistive technology. Text that is contained in most image formats, 
          for instance, cannot be transformed in a suitable way or accessed by 
          screen reader software. Thus text must be sufficiently flexible in its 
        &#39;display format&#39; to enable on-demand changes to suit a range of users.</p>
      <p>Text is often an advantageous format for equivalent access: because 
          of its ability to cross modalities and to transform Text, it may be 
          used in aural and visual formats as well as in tactile formats through 
          Braille displays. Also, text displays may be adapted to show more or 
          less text to accommodate individuals with different reading or learning 
          styles. In some cases, text may not be optimal. For example, a deaf 
          individual may be fluent in sign language but not in the text form of 
          spoken language; a blind individual may not have text-to-speech software 
          available. In these cases, alternative format equivalent content, such 
          as sign video (or in countries that use it, written sign) or video descriptions, 
        may be suitable alternatives. </p>
      <p>In recognition of the complexity of providing equivalent access to 
          cultural objects, the ATRC and many other partners have established 
          the Canadian Network for Inclusive Cultural Exchange (CNICE). This network 
          is working together to explore methods for providing alternative and 
          equivalent access to cultural objects while maintaining sensitivity 
          to the cultural context of an object or to the artist&#39;s intent. 
          The result of this exploration is a series of discussion documents that 
          will be completed in April 2004. The discussion documents provide guidance 
          that is particularly appropriate to the museum and virtual museum contexts. 
          Indeed, the project includes an accessible virtual museum exhibit on 
          the disability rights movement in Canada as well as a virtual gallery 
          featuring works by artists who have disabilities. Thus, there is a not 
          only a model for the cataloguing of alternative formats, but also guidance 
          on the construction of these alternative formats relevant to the museum 
        context. </p>
      <h1>Extending the Utility of AccessForAll</h1>
      <p>Nevile and colleagues are working on an issues paper not only considering 
          accessibility as defined above, but also including multi-cultural and 
          multi-lingual considerations. The idea is that there is effectively 
          little difference between the needs and preferences of people with disabilities 
          (the so-called &#39;accessibility&#39; problem), and those of people who are 
          unable to access content because it is in a language foreign to them, 
          or because it has culturally-specific references that are not suitable 
          for them. The proposed system may need to identify and affect a change 
          of modality, control mechanism, or even language or style of language. 
          Also, where appropriate, the system may need to provide a scaffold such 
          as a dictionary or calculator. These provisions should not require the 
          user to manually make an explicit request for each of these modifications. 
          A definition of inclusive access should account for cultural and language 
        differences. </p>
      <p>It is a short step from the CNICE and AccessForAll work already described 
          to the sort of application of this technology that the authors consider 
          might be possible within the museum world. We propose an extension of 
          this metadata (the user and the resource profiles) to include information 
          that is germane to the domain in which it is to operate. We envisage 
          extensions to user profiles that allow for the intellectual interests 
          and aptitudes of users and transform the corresponding resources, including 
          both static content and services. Integration of current accessibility 
          standards and models is critical to public institutions; however, museums 
          must take advantage of the opportunity to help shape new specifications 
        such as accessForAll to meet the needs of the museum context. </p>
      <h1>Profiles of Museum Visitors and Workers</h1>
      <p>Museum users vary significantly, not only in the following ways:</p>
        <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li>
          Linguistically - many visitors are from other countries</li>
        <li>
          Literacy - visitors vary in comprehension levels of spoken and written 
          languages</li>
        <li>
          Culturally - visitors have different ways of understanding, e.g.: 
          metaphors such as the term &#39;crown&#39; land for individuals from countries 
          that do not have a monarchy and metonyms such as &#39;a beetle&#39; meaning 
          a VW car</li>
        <li>
          Disciplinary differences - visitors have different interests and reasons 
          for visiting the museum. When an artefact such as an urn is displayed, 
          one visitor might be interested in the technique of production while 
          another might want to understand the purpose.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>The Quinkan Matchbox Project</h1>
      <p>The Quinkan Matchbox project is an example of the coming together of 
          the multicultural, multilingual, and accessibility work. It is staffed 
          by a team of people of various cultural backgrounds, working on behalf 
          of a small community of Indigenous people. While the ancestors of the 
          Quinkan people lived in Australia for tens of thousands of years, the 
          project team has only a basic grounding in Indigenous culture and little 
          knowledge about Quinkan country. The project is concerned with a culture 
          where the main mode of transmission is oral and ‘in the doing&#39;. 
          It is also a rich material culture, with extensive pictorial and symbolic 
          information to be found in rock art paintings and engravings. The Aboriginal 
          Elders speak a number of languages, with English sometimes being their 
          fourth or fifth language. Aboriginal languages were not written languages 
          until the invaders decided to write them down or make audio-visual recordings 
        of language elicitations. </p>
      <p>The community has expressed interest in consigning some of its knowledge 
          to a digital repository, with the dual ambition of preservation and 
          informing the general community. Accessibility of the materials held 
          in the repository is an important consideration, in a context where 
          there has been little opportunity to date for the Traditional Owners 
          to express their concerns, views and understandings of their culture. 
          In part, this expression has been difficult because many of the Elders 
          have suffered poor eyesight and other problems as a result of widespread 
          health problems, especially diabetes, or educational problems associated 
          with their disrupted life-style. There is an additional challenge because 
          many of the metaphors used by researchers who have visited or worked 
          in the Quinkan region are inappropriate for Elders with a different 
          set of cultural understandings and, for example, relationship with land. 
          These differences highlight the need for cultural sensitivity when describing 
        objects belonging to a specific group. </p>
      <p>Curators, visitors, and others may have different relationships with 
          objects. In the Matchbox Project, it has become apparent that it is 
          not possible to define absolute rights of ownership or access to objects. 
          Australian Aboriginal people like to make decisions about whether they 
          want to be exposed to certain types of objects, and it is customary 
          for them to receive warnings of what is about to be shown so they can 
          make that choice. This is a different process from projects where decisions 
          are made in advance based on consultation with people in authority, 
          and thereafter material is shown to authorised classes of people and 
        not to others.</p>
      <p>The &#39;interpretation&#39; of cultural objects in the Quinkan Region depends 
          upon customary laws. Foreign anthropologists, archaeologists and others 
          make assertions about certain objects without regard for local traditional 
          speaking rights. In contrast, within the Indigenous community, traditional 
          laws demand that only those with authority offer interpretations. In 
          addition, these are often offered from different perspectives: one man 
          may be speaking of objects within his country while another man may 
          be speaking of the same object but doing so from his perspective which 
          includes a certain remoteness. These different perspectives may be catalogued 
          through the access metadata in much the same way that explanations for 
          different disciplines might be catalogued. Within the access metadata 
          description, an element that enables cultural cataloguing would enable 
          viewers to access those perspectives that are most appropriate to them 
        given their background or interests.</p>
      <p>A further benefit of an access metadata model is the ability to create 
          multiple <b>pathways</b> for exploring artifacts. The pathway may be 
          determined by information specified in a user profile that might for 
          example differentiate between a student on a class trip and an anthropologist 
          conducting research. Given that the Quinkan Reserves cover about 100 
          square miles in which there are thousands of Rock art paintings, it 
          may be that the indigenous people would like to create a series of&#39;pathways 
          for visitors to their country. Through metadata models, such exhibition 
        paths may be put together on demand in a digital context.</p>
      <p>In the context of the proposed Quinkan catalogue/web site/virtual institution, 
          personal profiles may also be used to enhance and enrich participants&#39; 
          experiences. There is much in the proposed metadata model and extensions 
          that would be useful in many other museum contexts. The next step in 
          this area of work is to narrow the focus from classes of participants 
        to individual participants.</p>
      <p>The work of the AccessMetadata group is open to representatives of 
          many contexts and communities. This openness is motivated by the imperative 
          to maintain interoperability at the top of the agenda and to ensure 
          that compliance to the models of user and resource profiling being proposed 
          is not adversely affected by the diversity of metadata standards and 
          specifications. Active participants do not yet include representatives 
        from the museum community, but it is hoped this will change soon.</p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>This paper presents the AccessForAll framework: progress on the collaborative 
          design and implementation of matching resource profiles, and their integration 
          into the various community specifications and the TILE prototype. This 
          paper supports the idea that work started by the education community 
          to support the integration of special needs&#39; student is by extension 
          relevant to the museum community and its particular attention to multi-lingual 
          and multi-cultural concerns. The possibilities for the incorporation 
          of the required metadata into museum specifications are recommended. 
          The AccessForAll framework should ultimately yield benefits for a wider 
          range of users and accommodate the variety of their individual needs 
        and preferences.</p>
