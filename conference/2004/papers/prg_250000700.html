        <p class="AbstractText">This paper describes a collaborative partnership 
          between the University of Central England and Birmingham Museums and 
          Art Gallery. The project evolved out of the University&#39;s mission 
          to serve local and regional communities and the needs of Birmingham 
          Museums Service to improve its provision in line with local and national 
          directives on social inclusion, audience development and lifelong learning. 
          This paper describes the evolution of the relationship from a series 
          of collaborative MA design projects to user-centered design research 
          and the creation of a jointly supervised full time PhD studentship looking 
          at the role and future development of on-line collections.</p>

        <h1>Early Partnerships</h1>
        <p>There has been a symbiotic relationship between the Birmingham Institute 
          of Art and Design (BIAD) and Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery (BM&amp;AG) 
          since the early part of the last century.  In the early days staff from 
          the School of Art contributed to the Museum, particularly in the crafts. 
          The relationship broke down for a period in the 2<sup>nd</sup> World 
          War.  The relationship was re-formed in the 1970s when exhibitions were 
          held in the museum and the School of Art Education delivered a course 
          of study in ethnographic resources for art education in partnership 
          with the department of archaeology and ethnography.  In the late nineties 
          the partnership was renewed once again by the Director of Research at 
          BIAD, Professor Nick Stanley, in conjunction with Jane Arthur, Director 
          of Collections at the Museum, through a series of collaborative Masters 
          studentships. </p>
        <p>The University&#39;s key objective is to enhance the employability 
          of its graduates, with a commitment to the application of knowledge 
          through professional practice, to near-market and applied research and 
          consultancy.  This gives UCE a closeness to its social and economic 
          communities and makes it a major contributor to the development of the 
          region. The University plays an active part in providing services to 
          its neighbouring communities and encourages direct professional practice 
          in the form of consultancy to address the needs of the regional economy. 
          Most research at UCE is near-market and applied, much of it in partnership 
          with public sector bodies &#34;to develop the social infrastructure 
          and improve quality of life in the region (University of Central 
          England Mission Statement). The University is thus committed to develop 
          and maintain such partnerships as part of its mission.</p>
        <p>For BM&amp;AG there were also a number of benefits to be derived from 
          a renewed partnership. Birmingham Museums Service had identified a need 
          to improve its provision and this was reinforced by a number of local 
          and national directives. The late nineties saw the publication of a 
          number of government reviews and white papers addressing issues such 
          as the provision of informal and lifelong learning, the development 
          of new audiences, overcoming barriers to museum visiting and the potential 
          use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). David Anderson&#39;s 
          report to the Department of National Heritage (Anderson 1997), &#39; 
          A Common Wealth, Museums and Learning in the UK&#39; highlighted the 
          need to promote museums as educational institutions with a commitment 
          to lifelong learning for all.  The report emphasised the need to improve 
          access to resources and called for the breaking down of cultural, intellectual 
          and physical barriers to using museums. There was a strong sense at 
          the time that the application of information and communication technologies 
          (ICT) and the World Wide Web would provide solutions to some of the 
          issues identified. </p>
        <p>The Museums and Museum Design project was thus set up to provide mutual 
          benefits for the two institutions. A number of MA studentships were 
          created to encourage exploration of the issues and to develop design 
          concepts to inform museum strategy. The studentships were open to Masters 
          students from across the faculty. Students would gain experience of 
          professional practice and the realities of researching and designing 
          an authentic project.  The museum would benefit from the research and 
          design concepts that the students generated. The University would derive 
          research outcomes.</p>
        <p>The project was multidisciplinary, with students drawn from industrial 
          design, visual communications and interior design. The project coordinator, 
          Roderick Davies, was a museologist and was able to provide the students 
          with a theoretical background in the issues faced by museums. The students 
          were also supported by a research and development team, now known as 
          Digital Design Lab (DDL).  DDL is a small team based in the research 
          department at BIAD, providing digital media design and development support 
          to a number of research projects.</p>
        <p>A set of project proposals were drawn up through a process of negotiation 
          between the project coordinator and the directors and curators of the 
          museum.  Each project brief would need to address issues pertinent to 
          Birmingham Museum Service, utilise BM&amp;AG&#39;s resources and curators&#39; 
          expertise and operate within the requirements of the Master&#39;s 
          courses. Programmes for Masters courses vary but are all characterised 
          by a period of research followed by either a dissertation or a design 
          prototype.  Students were therefore able to dedicate a period of time 
          to the research and generation of a design hypothesis and methodology 
          through close collaboration with a museum curator before embarking on 
          their dissertation or design prototype.</p>
        <p>The project ran over 3 years and involved 12 students. Their projects 
          fell into three categories: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           Physical design initiatives</li>
        <li> 
           The development of policies for display 
            design and interpretation</li>
        <li> 
           The development of ICT and Web site prototypes. 
        </li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>Physical design initiatives included innovative display cabinets; a 
          multi-functional space and stackable furniture for school parties; gallery 
          and exhibition design; a self-contained traveling exhibition; and a 
          hand held device for interpretation of objects in the gallery.  Some 
          of these also included ICT elements. About half of the projects focused 
          on the use of ICT, including the development of Web sites, gallery-based 
          interactives and multimedia installations.</p>
        <p>Bitgood (1996) suggested that visitors tend to have a more satisfying 
          experience and gain more knowledge if they are given information about 
          &#34;what to expect, how long it might take to visit, where to find 
          rooms etc and &#34;pre-knowledge about the themes and content 
          of the exhibit.  One of the first students attempted to address 
          these issues and explore the role of museums as educational institutions. 
          Being an Interior Design student, he was particularly interested in 
          the use of a virtual forum as an interface to an actual environment. 
          The final design prototype was a Web site providing pre- and post visit 
          orientation (Sawkins 1999).  In early discussions, the student established 
          that BM&amp;AG saw marketing as the primary value of an on-line presence, 
          and that a site should provide information about collections and enable 
          people to decide what to go and see.  Practical issues to do with the 
          development of the Museum&#39;s corporate identity meant that the 
          student was unable to focus directly on marketing aspects, and, it became 
          apparent through the research phase that the marketing value of the 
          site would lie in its ability to stimulate interest in the collections. 
          The student decided therefore to focus on the educational aspects and 
          the provision of contextual and interpretive information.</p>
        <p>The student&#39;s final prototype demonstrated the concept through 
          a vertical slice of a Web site.  The site provided visitor information, 
          such as opening times, the location of the museum and its collections 
          and provided a deeper level of information about specific exhibitions 
          and exhibits.  The prototype focused on one painting in particular and 
          used animated overlays to illustrate and interpret aspects of the painting 
          such as composition and brush strokes, thus providing information not 
          normally available to the gallery visitor. This contextual and interpretive 
          information could be used pre-visit, with the aim of stimulating the 
          desire to see the actual painting, and post visit to enable further 
          exploration. It also equipped the viewer with ways of looking that could 
          be generalised and therefore would enhance their future visits to the 
          gallery.</p>
        <p>The following year, a Visual Communication student attempted to create 
          a virtual experience synonymous with visiting a gallery (Ferreria, 2000). 
          Anderson (1997) pointed out that much of the existing ICT at this time 
          was driven by data and thus provided the user with large quantities 
          of textual information and static images that had very little in common 
          with the museum experience.  The student used images of the paintings 
          in a gallery space as the interface metaphor. He felt that it was important 
          to recreate the visual and immersive qualities of gallery visiting. 
          In the final prototype, the user was able to access further information 
          about a painting by direct manipulation of the image.  Borrowing from 
          the previous project, he also used animated overlays to illustrate interpretative 
          aspects of the painting.</p>
        <p>Another Visual Communication student designed a signage, orientation 
          and navigation system that would work in the museum, on interactive 
          kiosks in the galleries and on a Web site (Jianfeng, 2000).  The Web 
          site provided orientation and navigation to the departments and their 
          collections through the use of animation, symbols and interactive floor 
          plans.  The animated sequences were designed to act as an &#39;appetite-whetter&#39; 
          to inform visitors about the content and highlights of a collection.  
          Further information was also provided about selected exhibits.  The 
          emphasis was on &#39;selling&#39; the collections as a whole, informing 
          the public about what is there.  The student was using visual communication 
          techniques to engage users and to draw them into collections.</p>
        <p>Symbols were designed to represent each department in the museum.  
          Symbol design was based on Chinese calligraphy and Western typography.  
          Links to the floor plan provided a physical as well as virtual navigation.  
          The site enabled visitors to browse through the entire museum, getting 
          a flavour of what is there without having to jump through details and 
          information they don&#39;t want. A collection could be explored in 
          more detail by accessing contextual information, or finding out where 
          it was physically located in the museum.  Physical and virtual visits 
          were tied together visually, through the signage, orientation and navigation 
          system, without attempting to recreate the physical characteristics 
          of the building on the Web site.  An engaging and inspiring experience 
          was achieved without trying to mimic the experience of seeing the objects 
          themselves (see Davies, 2001 for a fuller description of the project).</p>
        <p>Due to the limited time available on the MA courses the student projects 
          rarely got beyond the prototype stage and did not reach the stage of 
          evaluation. This was frustrating for the students, who did not get to 
          see their projects realized, and for the museum staff, who had invested 
          time in student research and were left with exciting design prototypes 
          without the resources to evaluate or implement them.  </p>
        <h1>User-Lab</h1>
        <p>In 2000, BIAD launched User-Lab, a user-centered design and usability 
          laboratory. BIAD had become increasingly aware of the need to evaluate 
          its growing digital media provision and to ensure it was meeting the 
          needs of staff and students. User-Lab was set up, with a grant from 
          the Higher Education Funding Council of England, to carry out academic 
          and commercial research into the digital experience.  User-Lab is staffed 
          by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in digital media design, 
          human-computer interaction, psychology and software engineering. The 
          lab consists of three purpose-built testing and design labs that are 
          equipped with behavioural, physiological and psychological research 
          tools.  In the three years since its inception the lab has been involved 
          in a number of collaborative projects with the public and private sector, 
          including regional development agencies, education bodies, charities, 
          museums, archives and libraries. The lab&#39;s research agenda focuses 
          on understanding the user experience in terms of accessibility, usability 
          and engagability. </p>
        <p>By 2001 BM&amp;AG had developed an extensive Web site and had been 
          able to digitize a significant number of artifacts through the Designation 
          Challenge Fund (a UK Government initiative to promote excellence and 
          raise standards in the care, management and presentation of collections 
          identified as being of outstanding importance). BM&amp;AG&#39;s database 
          of digitized artifacts was made available on-line through a Web interface.  
          The museum was aware of the need to meet the needs of their current 
          and potential virtual visitors and to evaluate their Web provision.  
          There were renewed local and regional reports calling for social inclusion 
          and emphasizing the role of museums and galleries in addressing social 
          exclusion (E.g.<i>, </i>The Group for Larger Local Authority Museums 
          Report, October 2000; Report of the Birmingham Stephen Lawrence Inquiry 
          Commission, Birmingham City Council, March 2001). It was widely accepted 
          that &#34;Museum professionals need to learn about their new audiences 
          coming through the electronic doors just as they attempt to learn and 
          meet the needs of those who walk through the physical doors of the museum 
          (Chadwick, 1999).</p>
        <p>BIAD was keen to build on its relationship with the Museum and so a 
          contract was negotiated with BM&amp;AG to provide user-centered design 
          consultancy over a period of 2 years. This has provided the museum with 
          a means of ensuring its electronic provision meets user requirements 
          and provides meaningful visitor experiences. One of the first projects 
          undertaken by User-Lab involved a summative evaluation the Web interface 
          to the museums digitized collection. This focused on human-factors issues 
          of the search facility, by eliciting and analysing users&#39; behaviour 
          in carrying out tasks on the Website.  </p>
        <p>The Website features three search mechanisms: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           a simple keyword search consisting of a 
            free text entry field; </li>
        <li> 
           an A-Z object name search comprising of 
            dropdown menus for each letter; </li>
        <li> 
           an advanced search, utilising form filling 
            in free text fields and dropdown menus. </li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>User testing with a sample of users resulted in an analysis of experiences 
          on a scale of positive to negative and certainty to uncertainty (&#39;MINISIS 
          Web Interface: User-test Report&#39;, Knight, 2003: unpublished report). 
        </p>
        <p>The project found that search features were inadequate in supporting 
          users&#39; tasks in a number of ways: response times were slow; results 
          were poorly organised with many unexpected and ambiguous results; there 
          was limited support for choosing search strategies; and users&#39; 
          domain knowledge was not represented in terms of terminology used, search 
          strategies available, feedback and appropriate levels of information 
          presented. These results were in stark contrast to other areas of the 
          Web site that score very highly in the tests in both usability and engagability.  
        </p>
        <p>The poor performance of on-line databases is not unique to BM&amp;AG.  
          Donovan (1997) suggests that most of the information held on publicly 
          accessible museum databases is &#34;of little interest to the broader 
          public and &#34;difficult to locate without a firm understanding 
          of the information in the database. He argues that for the non-specialist 
          faced with what he describes as &#34;the frightful blank search field 
          method of providing access to data their first reaction is likely 
          to be &#34;Search for What? He points out that </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Search engines are powerful in the hands of those 
          already armed with sufficient information to make them work ... but 
          if you do not know George Bellows from Saul Bellows, or chiaroscuro 
          from caricature, a search engine is of little use.</p>
		  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Donovan, 1997)</p>
        <p>Cameron (2001) identifies two approaches of delivering collections 
          on-line: a thematic approach and a searching interface.  She also points 
          out that the search approach is of little or no use to the non-specialist 
          user who has no knowledge of the information available, how the data 
          is modeled, or the specialist terminology used (p309). Indeed, Kravchyna 
          and Hastings (2002), in their survey of museum Web users, found a need 
          for &#34;contextual information, vivid descriptive narratives and 
          theory drawn from narratives in on-line collections.</p>
        <p>Donovan (1997) argues that &#34;Museums need to wrap layers of interpretation 
          around the bare fact of an object before the public can begin to grasp 
          its significance and Cameron (2002: p311) calls for the &#34;reconceptualisation 
          of databases, the types of information held and the fields included, 
          in the light of user research.</p>
        <p>Zorich (1997) argues that while collections databases are invaluable 
          to staff, they &#34;do not convey information in a format that satisfies 
          general audiences.  She claims that museums &#34;need to know 
          what questions people ask …, how they search for information, 
          and how they wish to see the results presented. (p187)  She warns, 
          &#34;if museums don&#39;t learn what users&#39; needs are, primary 
          audiences will conclude that museum information is not useful and won&#39;t 
          visit museum sites.</p>
        <h1>Research Collaboration</h1>
        <p>Keen to build on the lessons learnt through the Masters studentships 
          it was felt that a longer-term research project would be beneficial 
          to both institutions.  A full time research studentship was therefore 
          created, to be jointly supervised by BM&amp;AG and BIAD.  The successful 
          applicant is now working in conjunction with User-Lab to look at usability 
          issues in accessing museums&#39; digitised collections with a view 
          to improving the design of BM&amp;AG&#39;s own site to meet the needs 
          of virtual visitors.  </p>
        <p>The aim of the research studentship therefore, is to carry out user 
          research into the ways in which on-line collections are accessed and 
          to identify ways in which they can be improved.</p>
        <p>The project is asking a number of questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Why do users 
            visit museums&#39; on-line collections?</li>
        <li>
          What implicit 
            and explicit informational or learning goals do they have and how 
            does this match the aims of the museums?</li>
        <li>
          What search 
            strategies do they use and how does this vary with type of user? </li>
        <li>
          Are they 
            satisfied with the results of their on-line search and does the experience 
            meet their implicit and explicit needs? </li>
        <li>
          How can 
            we understand the user&#39;s affective and cognitive experience?</li>
        <li>
          How can 
            this experience be improved?</li>
      </ol>
      
        <p>A number of studies have applied usability testing and guidelines to 
          museum Web sites (eg Dyson &amp; Moran, 2000; Cunliffe, Kritou &amp; 
          Tudhope, 2001). Jordan (1999) points out that although usability is 
          clearly a necessary feature of a Web site, it is by no means sufficient. 
          Bonapace (2002) uses Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs to create a hierarchal 
          model for product design with safety and well-being, at ground level, 
          moving up to functionality and then usability, leading up to the apex 
          of pleasure. This study proposes to take a broad perspective by looking 
          at the user experience as a whole and applying a case study approach 
          to a number of on-line collections. The study will ask questions such 
          as &#39;What is the philosophy behind the design of the interface?&#39; 
          &#39;What does it encourage the user to do?&#39; &#39;Where does 
          it take the user intellectually and emotionally?&#39; &#39;Does 
          it provide for meaningful and significant experiences?  </p>
        <p> Knight and Jefsioutine (2003) have developed an Experience Design 
          Framework for designing and researching the user experience as a holistic 
          concept.</p>
        <p class="caption"><a href="jefsioutineFig1.html"><img src="jefsioutine.fit1-t.jpg" alt="Diagram: Experience Design Framework" width="400" height="202" border="0"/></a></p>
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1"></a>Fig 1: The Experience Design Framework, Knight and 
          Jefsioutine (2003)</p>
        <p>The framework advocates the process of &#39;designing for usability&#39; 
          developed by Gould and Lewis (1985), including early and regular user 
          involvement, empirical testing, integrated teams and iterative design.  
          It also draws on a number of more recent issues for designing the user 
          experience. Evaluating attributes of a system includes usability, accessibility 
          and engagability and utilises evaluation criteria developed for educational 
          technology recommended by Jones et al (1994). The framework also emphasizes 
          the need to focus research on activities, objects, places and people, 
          developed from Rothstein&#39;s (2002) elements of the user experience. 
          The framework draws on Kälviäinen&#39;s (2002) topology of methods 
          for understanding consumer taste and based on User-Lab&#39;s own research.  
          Elements identify the different levels at which a product can be experienced, 
          including the content, the form, its function and the interactions between 
          agents: user and product, user and user, and user and designer.  The 
          Experience Design Framework will thus be used to develop a methodology 
          for the study. </p>
        <p>The research studentship will apply empirical methods to a case study 
          approach. A set of museum and library Web sites, which approach the 
          provision of access to an on-line collection in very different ways, 
          have been selected for investigation. A case study approach has been 
          adopted since it is particularly suitable for exploration and representation 
          of a complex situation, its special value being both its particularistic 
          and holistic nature. By focusing on specific aspects of usability within 
          the wider case context, the study hopes to gain insights into the relationship 
          between organizational strategy, implementation and the end user experience.  
          It will look at the aims behind the collections, the target users and 
          expectations of use. Hence it will be important for the researcher to 
          work with the Web site developers to learn how they perceive their users&#39; 
          needs and wants and how that has influenced the structure and organization 
          of the material.  It will also investigate the methods of design and 
          development, whether sites have been evaluated or tested, and plans 
          for future development. </p>
        <p>The study will then explore each of the case studies in terms of the 
          user experience. Each case study will therefore involve a naturalistic 
          observation of a sample of users.  Analysis of users&#39; interactions 
          with on-line collections will be recorded using User-Lab&#39;s observation 
          equipment. This will identify the route and personal preferences made 
          by each user and how easily they were able to navigate both the interface 
          and the collection.  Usability problems will be used to identify mismatches 
          between user expectations and the actuality of the system. Interviews 
          and questionnaires will be used to ascertain the extent to which users 
          goals were met by their interaction.</p>
        <p>In order to carry out these observations it will be necessary to select 
          a sample of users that represent visitors to museum sites. Kravchyna 
          and Hastings (2002) identified 5 categories of users: scholars, teachers, 
          students, visitors and museum staff.  They found that 63% of users wished 
          to search a collection and this was equally spread across the different 
          types of user.  However, different user groups used the sites for different 
          reasons.  Visitors were more likely to be looking for information on 
          past exhibitions, whereas teachers and museum staff were more likely 
          than others to be looking for information for their research. Bowen 
          et al (2001) identify 3 types of user that typically access on-line 
          collections, school children and teachers, general public, and expert 
          researchers. There are several factors that may affect the way in which 
          a collection is used including the purpose of use (eg educational, leisure 
          or research) and the expertise, or pre-knowledge, of the user (eg specialist 
          or non-specialist). A further factor that may influence use is familiarity 
          with searching on-line generally and it will be important to ensure 
          that the different categories have an equal spread of internet searching 
          literacy.</p>
        <p>The study thus proposes to focus on specialist and non-specialist users. 
          Specialists include people from the museum, who have knowledge about 
          the terms used within the realm of collections management and archiving, 
          and degree students who are familiar with art and artists. Non-specialists 
          include general museum visitors or students who have no knowledge of 
          the collections. It will also be important to design task scenarios 
          that represent a range of naturalistic searching activities.  Tasks 
          will be established through a combination of focus groups with users 
          and analysis of surveys of use. Tasks are likely to include activities 
          based on learning, leisure, and specific information seeking since these 
          are likely to generate very different types of searching behaviour.</p>
        <p>Analysis of users&#39; behaviour will be done with reference to a 
          number of models of information seeking. As Cunliffe <i>et al</i> (2001) 
          point out: </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote"> There is … a need to understand the dynamics 
          of the search process, only part of which is on-line, and which may 
          include a series of search activities mixed with browsing activities. 
          The ability to support imprecise queries with poorly defined information 
          needs and new forms of query – such as query by similarity, querying 
          across non-text media, and the provision of browsing interfaces…</p>
        <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Cunliffe at al, 2001: p249).</p>
        <p>It is observed that users&#39; mental models for searching are a 
          blend of their technical understanding and their experience with performing 
          searches and their search goals (McDaniel &amp; McDaniel, 2002). Choo 
          <i>et al</i> (2000) propose a behavioural framework for understanding 
          users&#39; motivations and activities when seeking information on 
          the Internet. They identified a number of modes of information seeking 
          on the Web and found that each mode was distinguished by the nature 
          of information needs, information seeking tactics, and the purpose of 
          information use.</p>
        <p>Marchionini (1995) proposed that information-seeking, is composed of 
          eight parallel processes: (1) recognize and accept an information problem, 
          (2) define and understand the problem, (3) choose a search system, (4) 
          formulate a query, (5) execute search, (6) examine results, (7) extract 
          information, and (8) reflect/iterate/stop (Marchionini, 1995: 49-60).  
        </p>
        <p>Finally the study will attempt to identify ways in which access to 
          on-line collections can be improved.  Simply improving the sophistication 
          of the search engines may not make a great deal of difference.  Enabling 
          a visitor to search by colour or composition for example, may be, in 
          the words of Donovan, &#34;just a better way to get to the wrong place. 
          Without accompanying narrative the results may be useful for an interior 
          or graphic designer, but few others.</p>
        <p>Cameron (2002) argues that &#34;contextualising objects according 
          to ideas rather than physical and functional taxonomies … represents 
          a significant paradigm shift. Donovan (1997) advocates an approach 
          in which databases become content management systems with &#34;deep 
          reservoirs of rich content.  These can then be used to create 
          richer experiences based on a storytelling metaphor rather than list 
          making.  &#34;Instead of leading with the object, lead with the story 
          of the culture, historical context, important people and places, and 
          their importance. Tell engaging stories with objects woven through them 
          … and encourage curiosity, exploration and serendipity.</p>
        <p>MacDonald and Alsford (1997), call for the creation of meta-museums 
          in which artifacts can be contextualised &#34;on a grand scale.  
          Cameron posits that the Web offers the possibility of &#34;freeing 
          objects from traditional narrative and navigational structures 
          (p310).  She also suggests that it allows the &#34;establishment of 
          new relationships between users and collections while allowing greater 
          interpretive autonomy. (p310)  Such opportunities will evolve 
          from an understanding of on-line collections as enabling holistic and 
          fulfilling experiences for users. </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The early student projects served to illustrate to museum staff the 
          potential for ICT in the museum.  Many of the ideas and principles were 
          used to inform the design and development of the museum&#39;s Web 
          site and ICT provision.  By focusing on issues of access to collections 
          there has been a recognition by both institutions that the key to success 
          is to understand more fully the needs of users. User-Lab now has a number 
          of museum-based clients, which means that it is able to build up expertise 
          in the issues of usability pertinent to museum audiences.  By creating 
          a three year research studentship and with the ongoing partnership with 
          User-Lab, the museum aims to identify issues that are appropriate for 
          different types of users and the implications for the design of on-line 
          collections.   The partnership has thus moved from a focus on creating 
          design solutions to one of user research and understanding their changing 
          needs. </p>
