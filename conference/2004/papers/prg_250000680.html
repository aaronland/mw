   <p class="AbstractText">This paper presents a semantic portal, MuseumFinland, 
      for publishing heterogeneous museum collections on the Semantic Web <a href="http://museosuomi.cs.helsinki.fi/" target="_blank">http://museosuomi.cs.helsinki.fi</a>. The application 
      is presented from the viewpoints of the end-user and the museums providing 
      the contents. By semantic Web techniques, it is possible to make collections 
      semantically interoperable and provide museum visitors with intelligent content-based 
      search and browsing services to the global collection base. By using the MuseumFinland 
      approach, the museums with their semantically rich and interrelated collection 
      content can create consolidated semantic collection portals together on the 
      Web.</p>
   <p class="AbstractText">Keywords: Semantic Web, MuseumFinland, XML, RDF, Interoperability</p>
  <h1>Why Museums on the Semantic Web?</h1>
  <p>A special characteristic of cultural collection contents 
      is semantic richness. Collection items have a history and are related in many 
      ways to our environment, to society, and to other collection items. For example, 
      a chair is made of oak and leather, built in a certain style, designed by 
      a famous designer,  manufactured by a certain company during a specific time 
      period, used in a certain castle together with other pieces of furniture, 
      and so on. Other collection items, locations, time periods, designers, companies 
      etc. can be related to the chair through their properties, and implicitly 
      constitute a complicated semantic network of associations. This semantic network 
      is not limited to a single collection, but spans other related collections 
      in other museums.</p>
  <p>The Semantic Web (Berners-Lee, 2001; Fensel, 2002) is the 
      next generation of the Web where the contents are meant not only for human 
      readers to digest, but also for the machines to interpret. The key idea is 
      to represent the contents of the Web by explicit metadata structures that 
      conform to mutually agreed vocabularies, ontologies (Sowa, 2000). Semantic 
      Web technology (<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/SW/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/2001/SW/</a>) enables new possibilities when 
      publishing museum collections on the Web (Hyvönen, 2002):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Intelligent applications.</b> First, intelligent applications 
          based on the semantics of the collections can be created.</li>
    <li><b>Collection interoperability in content.</b> Secondly, Web 
          languages, standards, and ontologies make it possible to make heterogeneous 
          museum collections of different kinds mutually interoperable. This enables, 
          for instance, the creation of large inter-museum exhibitions. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>To realize these ideas in practice, we have developed a 
      semantic Web portal called &#34;MuseumFinland—Finnish Museums on the Semantic 
      Web.&#34; This system contains an inter-museum exhibition of cultural artifacts, 
      such as textiles, pieces of furniture, tools etc. The contents for the pilot 
      version come from the collections of the National Museum (<a href="http://www.nba.fi/" target="_blank">http://www.nba.fi</a>),      Espoo City Museum (<a href="http://www.espoo.fi/museo/" target="_blank">http://www.espoo.fi/museo/</a>), and Lahti City Museum (<a href="http://www.lahti.fi/museot/" target="_blank">http://www.lahti.fi/museot/</a>). 
      These museums are situated in different cities, and use three different relational 
      database schemas, data base systems, and collection management systems (called 
      Musketti, Escoll, and Antikvaria, respectively).</p>
  <p>In the following we first describe the knowledge-based 
      services of the portal from the end-user’s viewpoint. The collections form 
      for the end-user a seamless repository of Web pages to search and browse with 
      an ordinary Web browser. After this, we show how the heterogeneous distributed 
      collections of the museums that participate in the system can be merged in 
      an interoperable way. For a participating museum, the portal provides a channel 
      to publish content easily and independently from the museum’s collection database 
      system. In the conclusion, main results of the work are summarized, lessons 
      learned discussed, and directions for further research outlined.</p>
  <h1>A Semantic Search Engine</h1>
  <p>MuseumFinland provides the end-user with two major services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <b>semantic view-based search engine</b> that is based on 
          underlying concepts and ontologies instead of simple keywords.</li>
    <li>A <b>semantic recommendation system</b> by which the user can 
          find explicit and implicit semantic associations within the global collection 
          data, and use the associations for browsing the collections.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The metadata of collection objects in a museum database 
      is described by using named properties, such as the 15 properties of the Dublin 
      Core standard (<a href="http://dublincore.org/" target="_blank">http://dublincore.org/</a>). The 
      value of a property can be, for example, an integer representing the year 
      of publication of a document or a free text description about the history 
      of an artifact. When possible, it is beneficial to describe subject content 
      by using <i>keywords</i> selected from controlled vocabularies or thesauri 
      (Foskett, 1980). This keeps metadata descriptions coherent and in this way 
      significantly eases information retrieval later.</p>
  <p>The search engine of MuseumFinland, called Ontogator, is 
      based on the multi-facet search paradigm (Pollitt, 1998; Hearst et al., 2002). 
      Here the keywords or concepts used for indexing are called <i>categories</i> 
      and are organized systematically into a set of hierarchical, orthogonal taxonomies. 
      For example, artifact types, such as furniture, clothes, weapons etc. can 
      be put into a taxonomy. The taxonomies are called subject <i>facets</i> or 
      <i>views</i>. A search query in view-based search is formulated by selecting 
      categories of interest from the different facets. For example, by selecting 
      the category Clothing from an Artifact facet, category Cotton from a Material 
      facet, and category 1800-1900 from a Time facet, the user can express the 
      query for retrieving all trousers, skirts, and other clothing made of cotton 
      in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century. Intuitively, the query is a conjunctive constraint 
      over the facets with disjunctive constraints over the sub-categories in each 
      facet.</p>

      and time of the creation. The Usage Views indicate the user of the object, 
      place of use, and situations in which the object is used. Finally, the Collection 
      View classifies the museums and collections participating in the portal.</p>

      2. The <i>Artifacts</i> ontology is a taxonomy of the tangible collection 
      objects such as pottery, clothes, weapons, etc. All exhibits in the system 
      belong to some class in this ontology. The <i>Materials</i> ontology is a 
      taxonomy of the artifact materials, such as steel, silk, tree, etc. The <i>Actors</i> 
      ontology defines classes of agents, such as persons, companies etc., and individuals 
      as instances of these classes. The <i>Events </i>ontology include intangible 
      happenings, situations, events, and processes that take place in the society, 
      such as farming, feasts, sports, war, etc. <i>Locations</i> is an ontology 
      representing areas and places on the Earth and in Finland in particular. The 
      <i>Times</i> ontology is a taxonomy of various predefined historical periods, 
      and the <i>Collections</i> ontology classifies the museums and collections 
      in the portal. The Artifacts, Materials, and Events ontologies are subsets 
      of a larger cultural ontology called MAO (6768 classes) that we created based 
      on the Finnish cultural thesaurus MASA (Leskinen, 1997). MASA is widely used 
      in Finnish museums for describing and classifying collection objects. It was 
      a natural choice for the basis of a general cultural semantic Web ontology 
      and vocabulary. The ontology and vocabulary work underlying MuseumFinland 
      is described in more detail in Hyvönen et al., 2004.</p>

      with its nine facets.</p>
  <h1>The Search Interface</h1>
  <p>Figure 1 shows the initial search interface of MuseumFinland. 
        The nine facet hierarchies of Table 1 are shown (in Finnish), such as Artifact 
        (&#34;Esinetyyppi&#34;) and Material (&#34;Materiaali&#34;). For each facet hierarchy, the 
        next level of sub-categories is shown as links. A query is formulated by selecting 
        a sub-category by clicking on its name. When the user selects a category <i>c</i> in a facet <i>f</i>, the system constrains the search by leaving in the result 
        set only such objects as are annotated in facet <i>f</i> with some sub-category 
        of <i>c</i>. For example, figure 2 depicts the situation after selecting the 
        sub-category Tools (&#34;työvälineet&#34;) from the Artifact facet (&#34;Esinetyyppi&#34;). 
        The result set is shown on the right grouped by the sub-categories of Tools, 
        such as Textile making tools (&#34;tekstiilityövälineet&#34;) and Tools of folk medicine 
        (&#34;kansanlääkinnän työvälineet&#34;). Hits in the different  categories are separated 
        by horizontal bars and can be scrolled independently in each category. In 
        this case, all categories do not fit in the screenshot. </p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="hyvonenFig2.html"><img src="Hyvonen.figure2-t.jpg" alt="The Search Interface" width="400" height="293" border="0"/></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2"></a>Figure 2. The search interface of MuseumFinland after selecting 
      link Tools  (&#34;työvälineet&#34;) in figure 1.</p>
  <h1 class="normal">The Search Interface: Facets </h1>
  <p>The facets are shown on the left. When answering the query, 
        the result set for each direct sub-category in the facets seen on the screen 
        is recomputed, and a number (<i>n</i>) is shown to the user after the category 
        name. It tells that if the sub-category is selected next, then there will 
        be <i>n</i> hits in the result set. For example, in figure 2, the number 643 
        in the Collection facet on the bottom (&#34;Kokoelma&#34;) tells that there are 643 
        tools in the collections of the National Museum (&#34;Kansallismuseon kokoelmat&#34;).</p>
  <p>A selection leading to an empty result set (n=0) is removed 
      from its facet (or alternatively disabled and shown in gray color, depending 
      on the user’s preference). In this way, the user can be hindered from making 
      a selection leading to an empty result set, and is guided toward selections 
      that are likely to constrain the search appropriately. The query can be relaxed 
      by making a new selection on a higher level of the facets or by dismissing 
      the facet totally from the query.</p>
  <p>In the above, the category selection was made among the 
      direct sub-categories listed in the facets. An alternative way is to click 
      on the link Whole facet (<i>koko luokittelu</i>) on a facet. The system then 
      shows all possible selections in the facet with hit counts. For example, in 
      figure 3 the user selected in the situation of figure 2 the link Whole facet 
      of the facet Time of creation (<i>Valmistusaik</i>&#34;). The system shows how 
      the tools in the current result set are classified according to the Times 
      facet. The facet is represented by a link hierarchy from which the search 
      can be either constrained further or relaxed by clicking on a category link. 
      For example, selecting the category 1840-1849 brings up the tools manufactured 
      during that decade.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="hyvonenFig3.html"><img src="Hyvonen.figure3-t.jpg" alt="Time Facet" width="400" height="231" border="0"/></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig3"></a>Figure 3. The Time facet hierarchy classifying the result 
      set of tools in figure 2.</p>
  <p>In this way, the user </p>
  <ul>
    <li>can easily formulate the query using the right categories exposed  as links, and</li>
    <li>can get easily overviews of the database contents along different 
          classifications in different situations.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>User studies (Lee et al., 2003; English et al., 2003) have 
      recently been carried out to show that if the user does not know precisely 
      what objects s/he is looking for, then the multi-facet search method with 
      its browsing the shelves sensation is clearly preferred over keyword search 
      or using only a single facet. The latter approach is commonly used for finding 
      resources on the Web, e.g., in Yahoo and in the Open Directory Project (<a href="http://dmoz.org/" target="_blank">http://dmoz.org</a>).</p>
  <p>However, if the user is capable of expressing an information 
      need straightforwardly in terms of keywords, then a Google-like keyword search 
      interface is usually faster and preferable. To support a word-based search, 
      too, an additional search engine was implemented in MuseumFinland. This engine 
      is used for two purposes at the same time:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For searching categories to be used in multi-facet search</li>
    <li>For searching collection objects with matching metadata values 
          in the conventional way</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The problem of finding relevant categories in the facets 
      is a search problem of its own when dealing with thousands of categories. 
      The user may then type in keywords in the search text field labeled <i>Haku</i> 
      in the left upper corner of figure 1. In response, all categories whose names 
      match with the input keywords (substring match) are selected and shown to 
      the user as links in the form:</p>
  <p><i>FacetName </i>&gt; <i>category</i></p>
  <p>For example, a search with the string &#34;ase&#34; gives the link 
      set shown in figure 4.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="hyvonenFig4.html"><img src="Hyvonen.figure4-t.jpg" alt="Word search" width="400" height="162" border="0"/></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig4"></a>Figure 4. Using the word search for finding categories.</p>
  <p>Here the query matched the categories <i>guns</i> <i>(aseet</i> 
      in Finnish) and <i>guns and shooting equipment</i> <i>(aseet ja ampumatarvikkeet</i>) 
      in the facet Artifact (<i>Esinetyyppi</i>), and the category <i>acetate</i> 
      (<i>asetaatti</i>) in the Material facet (<i>Materiaali</i>). By selecting 
      a link, the multi-facet search can be executed. For example, by clicking on 
      <i>aseet</i> in figure 4, the 23 guns in the RDF repository are retrieved.</p>
  <p>When executing a word-based search, the search engine also 
      performs a combined keyword and multi-facet search in the following way. The 
      <i>union</i> of the found categories (cf. figure 4) is used as a query in 
      the multi-facet search, resulting in a result set R1. In addition, a conventional 
      keyword match search is performed for (some) property values of the objects, 
      resulting in another result set R2. The search result shown to the user is 
      R1 ≡ R2. In our example, guns and shooting equipment 
      together with objects made of acetate are retrieved.</p>
  <p>By default, the categories shown in the search are grouped 
      by the last selection, but the system also supports grouping based on arbitrary 
      categories and keywords. For example, in figure 5, the results of the search 
      of figure 2 are shown grouped by museum collection. This provides the user 
      with a quick and intuitive view of what kind of tools there are in each collection 
      of the participating museums.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="hyvonenFig5.html"><img src="Hyvonen.figure5-t.jpg" alt="Search REsults grouped by &#34;ryhmittele kohteet" width="400" height="294" border="0"/></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig5"></a>Figure 5. Search results from figure 2 after selecting the 
      link group by (ryhmittele kohteet) from the Museum Collection facet (Kokoelma).</p>
  <h1>A Semantic Recommendation System</h1>
  <p>At any point during a multi-facet search the user can select 
      any hit found by clicking on its image. The corresponding collection object 
      is then shown as a Web page, such as the one in figure 5. It depicts a special 
      part, distaff, (<i>rukinlapa</i> in Finnish), used in a spinning wheel. The 
      page contains the following information and links:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The 
          image(s) of the object is (are) depicted on the left.</li>
    <li>The 
          metadata of the object shown are in the middle on top.</li>
    <li>All 
          facet categories of the object are listed in the middle bottom as hierarchical 
          link paths. A new search can be started by selecting any link from there.</li>
    <li> A set 
          of semantic links on the right is provided by a semantic recommendation system. </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="caption"><a href="hyvonenFig6.html"><img src="Hyvonen.figure6-t.jpg" alt="collection object" width="400" height="241" border="0"/></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig6"></a>Figure 6. Web page depicting a collection object, its metadata, 
      facet categories, and semantic recommendation links to other collection object 
      pages.</p>
  <p>Semantic recommendations reveal to the end-user a most 
      interesting aspect of the collection items: the implicit semantic relationships 
      that relate collection data with their context and with each other. The recommendation 
      links provide a <i>semantic browsing</i> facility to the end-user. For example, 
      in figure 6 there are links to objects used at the same location (categorized 
      according to the name of the common location); to objects related to similar 
      events (e.g., objects used in spinning, and decorative objects, because distaffs 
      are usually beautifully decorated); to objects manufactured at the same time; 
      and so on. Since a decoratively carved distaff used to be a typical wedding 
      gift in Finland, it is also possible to recommend links to other objects used 
      as wedding gifts, such as wedding rings. In MuseumFinland, such associations 
      can be exposed to the end-user as link groups whose titles and link names 
      explain to the user the reason for the recommendation. The possibilities for 
      creating such associations are intriguing. Of course, only links that can 
      be inferred based on the metadata and ontologies available can be created.</p>
  <p>Recommendations are defined in terms of flexible logical 
      predicate rules using the methods described in Hyvönen et al., 2003, 2004. 
      The links can be <i>explicit</i> or <i>implicit</i>. Explicit links correspond 
      to the RDF statements (triples) in the underlying knowledge base and are directly 
      based on the collection domain ontologies (classes and their properties) and 
      the actual collection data (instance data). For example, an instance of a 
      painting may have the RDF property &#34;creator&#34; linking the art work to an individual 
      artist. Implicit links can be defined in terms of explicit ones but are not 
      present in the RDF graph. For example, if there are explicit links linking 
      children with their mothers and fathers, then implicit links such as &#34;grandfather&#34; 
      or &#34;cousin&#34; can be defined.</p>
  <p>The semantic recommendation system of MuseumFinland is 
      implemented as a logic server called <i>Ontodella</i>. This system is based 
      on the HTTP server version of SWI-Prolog (<a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/" target="_blank">http://www.swi-prolog.org</a>) (Wielemaker 
      et al., 2003). The MuseumFinland system itself is a Cocoon-based server (<a href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_blank">http://cocoon.apache.org</a>) that queries with 
      the Ontogator search engine server and Ontodella server with XML/RDF messages. 
      It is possible to do this over HTTP.</p>
  <p>There is also a prototype implementation of MuseumFinland 
      that can be used with WAP 2.0 compatible mobile telephones. The current prototype 
      recreates all functionality of the Web interface in a layout more suitable 
      to the limited screen space of mobile devices, as seen in figure 7. When the 
      user makes a selection for the multi-facet search, impossible category choices 
      leading to empty results can be pruned out. This is a very useful feature 
      for devices that have a small screen to display choices. Future work will 
      add further mobile-specific features, most notably support for mapping the 
      geographical location of the phone to the Location facet. This provides quick access to objects that were created, were used, or reside near the current 
      location of the mobile user.</p>

  <h1>Making Museum Collections Interoperable on the Web</h1>
  <p>Museums and their collection databases are usually situated 
      at different locations. This creates an obstacle to information retrieval 
      for both the public and researchers. To address the problem, the Web can be 
      used for creating a single interface and access point through which a search 
      query can be sent to distributed local databases and the results combined 
      into a global hit list. This <i>multi-search</i> approach, as depicted in 
      figure 8, has been widely applied, and there are many cultural collection 
      systems on the Web based on it, such as the portals Australian Museums On-line 
      (<a href="http://amol.org.au/collection/collections_index.asp" target="_blank">http://amol.org.au/collection/collections_index.asp</a>) and Artefacts 
      Canada (<a href="http://www.chin.gc.ca/" target="_blank">http://www.chin.gc.ca/</a>). </p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="hyvonenFig8.html"><img src="Hyvonen.figure8-t.jpg" alt="Search architecture" width="400" height="330" border="0"/></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig8"></a>Figure 8. Multi-search architecture. The global query is 
      answered independently at each local database.</p>
  <p>A problem of multi-search is that by processing the query 
      independently at each <i>local</i> database, the <i>global</i> dependencies, 
      associations between objects in different collections, are difficult to find. 
      Exposing such global semantic associations between collection items is one 
      of the main goals of MuseumFinland. The system cannot therefore be based on 
      the traditional multi-search paradigm. Instead, local collections are first 
      consolidated into a global repository, and queries are answered based on it, 
      as illustrated in figure 9.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="hyvonenFig9.html"><img src="Hyvonen.figure9-t.jpg" alt="Information retrieval" width="400" height="317" border="0"/></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig9"></a>Figure 9. Information retrieval in MuseumFinland. Local 
      database contents are first merged and the query is evaluated with respect 
      to global interrelated data. </p>
  <p>Museums join the system by producing collection metadata 
      in RDF format from their databases. Figure 10 depicts the process. The database 
      contents are first transformed into XML form. Next, the XML is transformed 
      into the final RDF metadata form used by the portal. Below, we explain and 
      describe these transformations briefly; a more detailed description can be 
      found in Hyvönen et al., 2004.</p>

  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig10"></a>Figure 10. Transforming databases into RDF format.</p>
  <h2>Database to XML Transformation</h2>
  <p>The idea of the database to XML transformation (Raatikka 
      and Hyvönen, 2002) is to re-represent selected database content in XML format 
      defined by an XML Schema. It tells what (meta)data must be provided for describing 
      collection items. The reason for using an explicit XML level here is to provide 
      a simple, open language by which the participating museums can agree upon 
      the syntax for representing collection data. Based on the schema, each collection 
      item has an XML description of its own called the <i>XML card</i>. For example, 
      the XML card representing a calendar is presented below. (The example is translated 
      and slightly simplified from the original version in Finnish.)</p>
  <p class="code">&lt;artifactCard created=&#34;2003-7-29 10:43:16&#34;&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">  &lt;artifactId&gt; ECM:22461:1 &lt;/artifactId&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">  &lt;artifactType&gt; Christmas calendar, </p>
  <p class="code">         Finland&#39;s Scouters Assoc. &lt;/artifactType&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">  &lt;museum&gt; Espoo City Museum &lt;/museum&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">  &lt;material&gt; cardboard &lt;/material&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">  &lt;keywords&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">    &lt;keyword&gt; Christmas &lt;/keyword&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">    &lt;keyword&gt; calendar &lt;/keyword&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">    &lt;keyword&gt; scouts &lt;/keyword&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">  &lt;/keywords&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">  &lt;placeOfUsage&gt; Tapiola, Espoo &lt;/placeOfUsage&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">  &lt;creator&gt; Ulla Vaajakoski &lt;/creator&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">  ...</p>
  <p class="code">  &lt;photo&gt; photos/image3451.jpg &lt;/photo&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">&lt;/artifactCard&gt;</p>
  <p>An XML card presents the main <i>features</i> of a collection 
      object by sub-elements. The values of the features, such as the string Espoo 
      City Museum in the sub-element &lt;museum&gt;, are read from the underlying 
      database tables.</p>
  <h2>XML to RDF Transformation</h2>
  <p>Each XML card with its string-valued feature values is 
      transformed into an <i>RDF card</i> with similar RDF properties, but the string 
      values are transformed into the Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) of the 
      corresponding classes and individuals in the ontologies. For example, the 
      XML card above in RDF form is:</p>
  <p class="code">&lt;rdf:RDF
  </p><p class="code">  xmlns:rdf=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&#34;</p>
  <p class="code">  xmlns:card=&#34;http://www.fms.fi/RDFCard#&#34;&gt;</p>
  <p class="code"> &lt;card:RDFCard </p>
  <p class="code">   rdf:about=&#34;http://www.fms.fi/rdfCard#card11023&#34;&gt; 
    </p>
  <p class="code">   card:artifactId=&#34;16851&#34;</p>
  <p class="code">   card:artifactType-www=&#34;calendar&#34;</p>
  <p class="code">   card:artifactType=&#34;http://www.fms.fi/artifacts#calendar&#34;    
    </p>
  <p class="code">   card:museum-www=&#34;Espoo City Museum&#34;</p>
  <p class="code">   card:museum=&#34;http://www.fms.fi/agents#EspooCityMuseum&#34;</p>
  <p class="code">   card:material-www=&#34;cardboard&#34;</p>
  <p class="code">   card:material=&#34;http://www.fms.fi/materials#cardboard&#34;</p>
  <p class="code">   ...</p>
  <p class="code"> &lt;/card:RDFCard&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">...</p>
  <p class="code">&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</p>
  <p>The features of collection items fall into two categories: 
      <i>literal </i>features and <i>ontological</i> features. The value <i>x</i> 
      of each feature <i>p</i> in the XML card (e.g., material value <i>cardboard</i>) 
      is represented by the corresponding literal property <i>p</i>-www=<i>x</i> 
      in the RDF card (e.g., material-www=&#34;cardboard&#34;). Literal property values 
      will be shown to the user in the user interface (cf. the metadata values in 
      the middle on top in figure 6). In addition, each ontological feature in the 
      XML card will be represented by an additional <i>ontological property</i> 
      with same name in the RDF card. Its value is a URI that relates the card to 
      the ontological RDF resource(s) in the underlying knowledge base. The classes 
      and individuals referred to in the RDF card are defined by the set of RDFS 
      ontologies of Table 2.</p>
  <p>For example, the feature artifactId 
      is literal and is not connected with the ontology resources in the above RDF 
      card. In contrast, the ontological feature material 
      is represented by a literal property www-material 
      and the ontological property material 
      that has an RDF resource (URI) as its value. This URI connects the card resource 
      with the material ontology and through it with other resources.</p>
  <p>Two tools have been implemented for facilitating the XML 
      to RDF transformation: Terminator and Annomobile. Terminator is used for creating 
      <i>term cards</i>, that essentially define a mapping between words and expressions 
      used at the XML level and the corresponding ontological concepts (URIs). Term 
      cards make MuseumFinland flexible with respect to variance in terminologies 
      used at different museums and by different catalogers. The museums can keep 
      their local terminological conventions as long as they tell the meaning (URI) 
      of their own terms by term cards.</p>
  <p>Given a set of term cards and ontologies, Annomobile performs 
      XML to RDF transformation. This cannot be done fully automatically due to 
      unknown terms and complicated descriptions encountered in the databases, and 
      to homonymous terms. Annomobile can, however, identify such situations and 
      point them out to a human editor who has to make the right decisions and corrections 
      by hand. In our work, we have used the Protégé-2000 ontology editor (http://protege.stanford.edu) for editing the ontologies, 
      term cards and RDF cards. Its user interface is simple enough to be used by 
      museum personnel who usually do not have programming skills.</p>
  <p>An important side effect of the XML to RDF transformation 
      is <i>semantic enrichment</i> where new meaning is automatically added to 
      the collection data in three ways. </p>
  <p><b>First,</b> semantic associations between related collection 
      item instances emerge automatically through shared resources (URIs). For example, 
      a particular bench from  Museum A may have the same manufacturer as a footstool 
      in Museum B: this may be an important piece of information to the user. </p>
  <p><b>Secondly</b>, generic ontological relations defined 
      for the classes are automatically inherited by instance data. For example, 
      the class <strong>Ylioppilaslakit</strong> (a special student’s white cap used in Finland) 
      has a property that relates the concept to the class <strong>Ylioppilasjuhlat</strong> (a graduation 
      ceremony event). This means that all individuals of the class <strong>Ylioppilaslakit</strong>      will have this property as well. As a result, for each student cap, recommendation 
      links to other objects related to graduation ceremonies can be created. The 
      museum cataloguer does not have to provide this information as a piece of 
      metadata for each individual cap. </p>
  <p><b>Thirdly</b>, the knowledge base can be enriched semantically 
      by logical rules defining expert domain knowledge concerning the exhibition. 
      In our case, such rules have been used as a basis for the semantic recommendations.</p>
  <h1>Discussion</h1>
  <h2>Contributions</h2>
  <p>This paper presents an overview of MuseumFinland from the 
      end-user’s and museum’s viewpoints. In our work, the use of ontologies and 
      semantic Web technologies turns out to be useful in many ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Exact definitions.</b> By using ontologies, museums can define 
          the concepts used in cataloguing in a precise, machine-understandable way.</li>
    <li><b>Terminological interoperability.</b> The terms used in different 
          institutions can be made mutually interoperable by mapping them onto common 
          shared ontologies.</li>
    <li> 
          <b>Ontology sharing.</b> Ontologies provide means for making 
          exact references to the external world. For example, the Locations ontology 
          (villages, cities, countries, etc.) and the Actors ontology (persons, companies, 
          etc.) is shared by the museums in order to make correct and interoperable 
          references.</li>
    <li> 
          <b>Automatic content enrichment.</b> Ontological class definitions, 
          rules, and consolidated metadata enrich collection data semantically.</li>
    <li><b>Intelligent services.</b> Ontologies can be used as a basis 
          for intelligent services to the end-user, in our case for the semantic search 
          engine and the recommendation system.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The first pilot version of MuseumFinland shows that underlying 
      ideas presented in this paper are feasible and that the technology scales 
      up to at least 10,000 cards and view categories. The response times for search 
      queries have typically been under 2 seconds on an ordinary PC server.</p>
  <h2>Related Work</h2>
  <p>The idea of the view-based multi-facet search has been 
      developed before ( e.g., in Pollitt, 1998; Hearst et al., 2003). The novelty 
      of MuseumFinland lies in its capability of using RDF(S) ontologies and inference 
      rules as the basis of search. The idea is to combine virtues of the view-based 
      and ontology-based search paradigms (Hyvönen et al., 2003). The multi-facet 
      search algorithm of Ontogator itself is independent from the underlying ontologies 
      and their semantics. The <i>semantic</i> flavor of the system is based on 
      the Ontodella Prolog-server and its knowledge base in two ways. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><b>First,</b> the facet hierarchies for Ontogator are created by a set of logical 
      rules that depend on the ontologies used. For example, a facet can be based 
      on a subclass-of or a part-of property. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><b>Secondly</b>, the museum objects are associated with the facet categories by using 
      the underlying ontological relations and inference rules.</p>
  <p>This idea of linking collection items with semantic associations 
      is related to Topic Maps (Pepper, 2000). However, in our case the links are 
      not given by a topic map but are determined by logical inference using the 
      underlying RDFS ontology and RDF metadata.</p>
  <p> Another application of this idea of generating semantically 
      linked static HTML sites from RDF(S) repositories is presented in Hyvönen 
      et al., 2003b. In the HyperMuseum (Stuer et al., 2001), collection items are 
      also semantically linked with each other. Here linking is based on shared 
      words in the metadata and their linguistic relationships, such as synonymy 
      and antonymy. In contrast, our system is not based on words but on ontological 
      references in the underlying RDF(S) knowledge base. As a result, the links 
      can be defined freely in terms of logical rules. The idea of annotating cultural 
      artifacts in terms of multiple ontologies has been explored, e.g., in Hollink 
      et al., 2003. Other ontology-related approaches used for indexing cultural 
      content include ICONCLASS (<a href="http://ww.iconclass.nl/" target="_blank">http://ww.iconclass.nl</a>) 
      (van den Berg, 1995) and Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) (<a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/aat/" target="_blank">http://www.getty.edu/research/ conducting_research/vocabularies/aat/</a>) 
      (Peterson, 1994), and CIDOC CRM (<a href="http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/" target="_blank">http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/</a>) (Doerr, 
      2003).</p>
  <h2>Further work</h2>
  <p>Several practical problems were encountered in transforming 
      the database contents into RDF. Even if the XML card is syntactically well-formed, 
      several semantic interpretation problems have to be addressed during the XML 
      to RDF transformation. The values of the features in XML cards may be complicated 
      expressions and come from various data field in the database. For example, 
      value <i>assoc Christmas calendar, Finland&#39;s Scouters</i>. is not a term but 
      a complex phrase. The same concept may be referred to with different syntactic 
      expressions (e.g., <i>Scouters&#39; Christmas calendar</i>) depending on the cataloguer 
      and notational conventions used. Using standard terminology in cataloguing 
      would help in solving this problem, but in practice this is impossible, and 
      there will be variations in descriptions.</p>
  <p>The XML to RDF transformation cannot be fully automated 
      due to problems of homonymy and emergence of new terms and concepts with new 
      collection items. To solve the problem, cataloging systems should be enhanced 
      with ontology support. Ways of collaboration between museum content providers 
      and portal maintenance people need to be developed in order to lift MuseumFinland 
      from an application into a continuous publication process for the participating 
      museums. For example, protocols for adding, modifying, and retracting RDF 
      cards and ontology resources according to the wishes of the museums need to 
      be developed.</p>
  <p>More content analysis work is needed to develop a set of 
      recommendation predicates that would be of most interest to the users. It 
      is possible that their implementation would require changes in the ontologies 
      and better annotated content.</p>
  <p>In the near future we plan to extend the collections of 
      the system with paintings and graphics from the Finnish National Gallery. 
      We also plan to incorporate in the system a database from the National Museum 
      describing the most valuable cultural sites in Finland. Our goal is to show 
      that RDF can be used as the basis for making very different kind of contents 
      semantically interoperable.</p>
