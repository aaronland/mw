        Distance Learning Using the Web</p>

       <p class="AbstractText">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum technology 
          staff built a Web interface for distance learning programs using Macromedia 
          Flash. Using this technology, staff in the Museum could connect with 
          groups such as teachers and students in a classroom and bring programs 
          outside the Museum&#39;s walls. This technology is capable of synchronous 
          (live) and asynchronous video and audio; for the asynchronous element, 
          there is a component built in that allows PowerPoint presentations, 
          film clips, Web sites, and photos to be shown to the group which the 
        Museum staff member is addressing. </p>
       <p class="AbstractText">As a member of the Education division staff at the 
          Museum, I was asked to manage and coordinate the testing of this technology 
          with teachers and students, and other groups as appropriate. This paper 
          describes our process of testing and some of the programs that we held 
          - those that worked and those that did not.  It also discusses some 
          of the challenges we faced, such as getting staff to buy-in on the technology 
          and the quality of the programs, and what changes we would like to make 
          for the coming year. We are still testing this technology and will be 
          doing more programming over the coming year. We hope to add to our menu 
          of technology options this year, and to improve the Web interface that 
        we designed. </p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My job in the Education division has been to manage 
          technology projects, including Web sites, and to be the liaison between 
          the Education division and the Technology division. Our decision to 
          venture into distance education was prompted by the requests and questions 
          that we were getting from our audience, although I think that we would 
        have tried it anyway at some point.</p>
      <p>For several years Museum staff had been receiving 
          emails that would say something like, &#34;Are you offering videoconferencing 
          tours of the Museum? I can&#39;t find any information about it. We 
          would like to sign up.&#34; Up until a year and a half ago, our standard 
          response was, &#34;No, we are not doing anything like this at this 
          time.&#34; And that would be the end of the contact with that particular 
          person. I like to think of our technology staff as pretty much cutting 
          edge, and that is when both they and I started to realize that in this 
          particular area, we were not ahead of the rest; we would have to run 
          to catch up.  Since many other Museums, organizations, and schools were 
        using the electronic medium for education; we decided to try it too.</p>
      <p>About a year and a half ago, the Museum started to 
          experiment with distance education technology and programs. Several 
          of us had been very interested in this field and started to do some 
          research on the subject. The technology staff decided to try something 
          different. They built a distance education interface using the Internet 
          and Macromedia Flash to connect to people outside of the Museum&#39;s 
          walls. The Director of the technology group approached me and asked 
          if the Education division would be interested in testing this technology 
          with programs aimed at school groups, teachers, and AHO&#39;s (Association 
          of Holocaust Organizations). I said yes - and that began our program 
        of distance education.</p>

      <h1>Goals and Research</h1>
      <p>Before I could even make some basic decisions about 
          distance education, I needed to see how it worked. The Museum&#39;s 
          first program using the new technology was a lecture by Dr. Christopher 
          Browning, author of the book <i>Ordinary Men</i>, to a university class 
          at George Mason University. Dr. Browning was seated in one of our offices, 
          behind the desk, and we used a camera and a laptop computer. The technology 
          worked beautifully, and the students, thrilled to be talking to a famous 
        author in the field of Holocaust research, asked many questions. </p>
      <p>The first thing I needed to do for this project, 
          as for any project I manage, was to define the project itself and what 
        needed to be done. </p>
      <p>Here is a definition of distance education that I 
        particularly like: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Distance Education is instructional delivery that 
          does not constrain the student to be physically present in the same 
          location as the instructor. Historically, Distance Education meant correspondence 
          study. Today, audio, video, and computer technologies are more common 
          delivery modes. The term Distance Learning is often interchanged 
          with Distance Education. However, this is inaccurate since institutions/instructors 
          control educational delivery while the student is responsible for learning. 
          In other words, Distance Learning is the result of Distance Education. 
        (Steiner, 1995)</p>
      <p>Now that I had figured out what it was that I going 
        to do, I needed to set some goals, and define some procedures.</p>
      <p>I started out with very simple goals: </p>
        <ol class="listwithnumbers">
        <li> 
           to figure out what distance education was </li>
        <li> 
           to decide if the current proposed technology 
            worked </li>
        <li> 
           to research other forms of delivery for distance 
            education </li>
        <li> 
           to convince others in the Museum that it made 
            sense for our Museum to use distance education as an educational tool.</li>
      </ol>
       
        <p>I spent a lot of time doing research about distance 
          education: what it was, and what other organizations were doing.  I 
          made an interesting discovery. There are a huge number of resources 
          out there for higher education and distance education. There are Web 
          sites, organizations, listservs, and conferences galore. There is nothing 
          comparable for museums. Or if there is, I cannot find it, even after 
          a year and a half of research. Therefore, much of my research and information 
          comes from the higher education folks, who are doing a great job of 
          it. The downside of using this material is that museums and higher education 
          are not the same. Therefore, whatever I find out through this research 
          has to be adapted for what we are trying to do.</p>
        <p>I began to talk to other Museums and organizations 
          to see what they were doing. Additionally, this research was prompted 
          by possible partnership opportunities with two organizations: the Education 
          Enterprise Zone, discussed below, and Ball State University. I spoke 
          to Lee Livney, Manager of Federal Grants and Distance Education at the 
          Bronx Zoo of the Wildlife Conservation Society; Gene Carlucci, Museum 
          Educator at the Intrepid Sea*Air*Space Museum; April Kim Tonin, Coordinator 
          of Distance Learning and the Teacher Information Center at the Museum 
          of Modern Art; Susan Swarthout, Education Manager at the Museum of Television 
          and Radio, LA; Jeff Arnett at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and 
          Museum; and Dottie Klugel at the Smithsonian Environmental Research 
          Center. </p>
        <p>I share my questions for the Education Enterprise 
          Zone partners here, as some of these may help those of you  doing similar 
          research. After I started asking these questions and having conversations 
          with these people, I noticed that some of my questions overlapped, or 
          ended up not being relevant to the conversation.</p>

       For the Ball State University partnership, my questions 
        were very similar:<ol class="listwithnumbers">
        <li> 
          How did you determine what programs to offer?</li>
        <li> 
          Who created the programs? How much did Ball 
            State help— either with money or people?</li>
        <li> 
          How do you judge the success of your programs?</li>

          How does distance learning or distance education 
            fit into your organization&#39;s structure and mission? </li>
        <li> 
          How do you staff these programs?</li>

      </ol>
       
        <p>          Not only did doing this research help answer questions about these partnerships, 
          but also they gave me more information about the distance education 
          process, and allowed me to make some valuable contacts in the field. 
          I also began to learn more about the field of education, and some basic 
      principles that I wanted to incorporate into my programs.</p>
        <p>          The figure below shows a model of learner-centered principles and practices 
      that, I believe, apply to museums as well as higher education.</p>

          </span> </p>
        <p>Now that I had begun my research and made some contacts, 
          I began to satisfy my first goal: what is distance education? I began 
          to work on the next two goals: does our technology work, and what other 
          delivery methods for distance learning exist? In order to answer these 
          questions, I needed to actually start doing programs.</p>
        <h1>Distance Education Programs</h1>
        <p>The first step was to recruit teachers interested 
          in trying our programs and technology. I started by asking that any 
          e-mails about videoconferencing or electronic programs be sent to me. 
          I then started answering those e-mails with the information that we 
          had Internet-based technology for distance education programs, and that 
          we were willing to try to provide programs for people who would help 
          with our testing process. </p>
        <p>The response was overwhelming. I had more people 
          interested than I could provide programs for. As I sorted through the 
          responses, there was a natural drop-off of those for whom we could actually 
          attempt programming. Some could not do Internet-based distance education, 
          like the whole state of New Jersey, for example. Sometimes I would make 
          contact with a teacher and we would start the technology testing, but 
          no matter what we tried, still not be able to make a connection.</p>
        <p>This figure shows the types of Internet connections 
          that are possible. We always provide the users, a group of either teachers, 
          or secondary school students, a video connection and audio. The schools 
          always have audio capability, but many do not have any sort of Web camera. 
          So, while they can see us, we cannot see them.</p>

          Florida, Tampa, Florida, Dr. Ann E. Barron, Executive Director <a href="http://fcit.coedu.usf.edu/DISTANCE/" target="_blank">http://fcit.coedu.usf.edu/DISTANCE/</a></p>
        <p>The first program we did was in December 2002. To 
          say that the work involved making this happen was arduous is an understatement. 
          We were learning every thing and every detail as we did them. We were 
          making up procedures and processes as we needed them. (true of any new 
          project, though.) </p>
        <p>The Education division&#39;s historian prepared 
          a general Holocaust session for a group of high school students from 
          Ohio. The teacher had told me that they did not have extensive Holocaust 
          knowledge and they wanted to ask a lot of questions. Our historian prepared 
          a simple PowerPoint lecture, and we loaded it into the interface. The 
          technology testing went very well, and we were ready for the program. 
          It ended up being about 45 minutes long, and it worked very well. The 
          students were able to ask lots of questions, and our historian turned 
          out to be very dynamic over the Web - he is an excellent speaker in 
          person, but you cannot assume that this will carry over to the electronic 
          environment. A week after the program, the teacher contacted me and 
          said that he was bringing his class to the Museum; could they meet Dr. 
          Meinecke in person? He agreed, and they met in the Museum and took many 
          photos.</p>
        <h1>Method</h1>
        <p>This is how we make the distance education programs 
          work. I work with one person in the technology group, Greg Jacobson, 
          the designer of the Flash interface, for each program. We agreed early 
          on that we must have a successful technical test before the actual event. 
          This has helped enormously, although sometimes we do spend a large amount 
          of time making the connections work. Once we have a teacher willing 
          to try a program, Greg and I go through the technology hoops to make 
          sure that the class can connect. This means sending a document explaining 
          how to access our ports for the pre-test, and once that works, setting 
          up a time to connect face-to-face (or computer-to-computer) to check 
          the connection.</p>
        <p>If the technical test is successful, then we set 
          a date for the actual event. Meanwhile, I work with the teacher on the 
          content of the program. I need to know the grade level and the number 
          of students, plus what the focus of the lesson is to be and what the 
          teacher desires as outcomes.  For example, a teacher may want a very 
          general Holocaust lecture from an historian, and may want the students 
          to come away from the experience knowing more about Holocaust history 
          in general, including dispelling many myths. </p>
        <p>Once I have the information from the teacher, I look 
          among the staff at the Museum and contact them, trying to find the perfect 
          match. The speaker has to be willing to not only speak to the group, 
          but also commit the time to develop interesting Web content for a program. 
          Once I have the speaker lined up and content set, we are ready to hold 
          the program.</p>
        <p> But just because the technical test worked once, 
          does not mean that it will work again - so we have to be prepared to 
          work on the technology again for the actual program itself. What kinds 
          of problems did we have over the year? The audio tended to be the most 
          problematic, and this can be due to many different factors, like: 1) 
          user error on either or both ends; 2) bandwidth issues; 3) time of day 
          and Internet traffic; or 4) faulty equipment. </p>
        <h2>The Interface</h2>
        <p>Here is a look at what our Distance Education interface 
          looks like:</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="vitto.fig4th.jpg" alt="Images and text in the interface" width="400" height="231"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 4: U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum FlashComm Server 
          Distance Education interface</p>
        <p>We ask that the class connect using one computer 
          and use a projection screen so that the rest of the class can see. This 
          is to reduce the load placed on the bandwidth. The class can have a 
          camera, so that we can have two-way visuals, or just use the audio. 
          We first try to get the class to use a microphone through the computer, 
          but a connection through the telephone is a back-up plan, and in fact 
          we have conducted one two-day program for which we used the telephone 
          for the audio. </p>
        <p>From the trial and error and experience over the 
          last year, I began to develop some documents that have helped me plan 
          and execute distance education programs. First, I developed a list of 
          steps and procedures to follow for each distance education program.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="vitto.fig5th.jpg" alt="a list of things to do before Distance Learning Events" width="400" height="319"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 5: Distance Education Procedures</p>
        <p>I ended up developing a distance education checklist 
          - one sheet of paper with a lot of checkboxes that led me through the 
          process - from the original procedures document. I have found that this 
          document is invaluable because of all of the details that need to be 
          taken care of for each program. It also helps with the data entry for 
          reporting purposes.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="vitto.fig6th.gif" alt="Things teachers should do ... " width="400" height="358"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 6: Distance Education Checklist</p>
        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <p>I then developed an evaluation that I ask each teacher 
          to fill out after each program. This has proved very useful in helping 
          us make productive changes in our programs and technology.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="vitto.fig7ath.gif" alt="Evaluation questions for distance education events" width="400" height="252"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 7a: Distance Education Evaluation</p>

        <p class="caption">Figure 7b: Distance Education Evaluation</p>
        <p>Even though we were not presenting programs designed 
          for the electronic format, the responses to what we were doing were 
          and are extremely positive. Here is a model of how assessment and evaluation 
          can be done. I believe that evaluation should be a part of every program 
          and that we should always be looking for ways to improve.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="vitto.fig8.gif" alt="diagram: conduct ongoing evaluation" width="308" height="272"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 8: Model of On-going Evaluation from &#34;A 
          Teacher&#39;s Guide to Distance Learning&#34; Florida Center for

          Florida, Tampa, Florida, Dr. Ann E. Barron, Executive Director  <br/>
          <a href="http://fcit.coedu.usf.edu/DISTANCE/" target="_blank">http://fcit.coedu.usf.edu/DISTANCE/</a></p>
        <p>Right now we are in the process of placing our evaluation 
          questions on a Web site, which will then download the responses into 
          a database. Currently, we use an internal database called the Events 
          Calendar to track the details of the programs and the technical tests.</p>
        <h2>What Didn&#39;t Work</h2>
        <p>One of our programs that did not work was with a 
          middle school class in the Ft. Worth area of Texas. We held two separate 
          technical tests, and neither one was as good as we hoped. The problem 
          was in the audio - either there was some sort of interference, or the 
          delay and echo was interfering with the delivery of the program. We 
          decided to attempt to hold the program, although we told the teacher 
          that it could be stopped if the problems were too big. Unfortunately 
          for us, we had the Head of the Museum&#39;s Council and the Museum&#39;s 
          Director interested because the Council Head was from Texas. They planned 
          to be sitting in the Director&#39;s Office watching on her computer. 
          The day of the program came, and we tried to get it going. Everyone 
          was watching, but after about 20 minutes, we knew that we could not 
          deliver a quality program, so we stopped. At the time, we believed that 
          the school&#39;s connection - 389k - was not good enough. Now, we 
          think the problem might have been somewhere in our system, with the 
          ports. We have since fixed this problem.</p>
        <h2>Does the Technology Work?</h2>
        <p>At this point I can answer the next question in the 
          goals: does this technology work? Yes, it works. Does it work all of 
          the time? No, it does not. But when it fails, we research why and try 
          to make improvements. One significant improvement for this year is the 
          fact that the FlashComm interface was moved to a brand new server. This 
          means that we are not competing with other resources on the server. 
          Plus, the server is newer and better. Also, our Technical Services division 
          has started to get involved in the technology for the programs. They 
          are interested in how the programs happen and what their staff can do 
          to make them more successful, from a technology viewpoint. </p>
        <h2>Other Forms of Delivery for Distance Education</h2>
        <p>The next question in my goals is: what other forms 
          of delivery exist for distance education programs? To begin to answer 
          this, I began working with the Education Enterprise Zone.</p>
        <h2>Education Enterprise Zone (EEZ)</h2>
        <p>About the same time we began testing the technology, 
          I received a phone call from Dr. Stan Silverman from the Education Enterprise 
          Zone (EEZ) based out of the New York Institute of Technology. Their 
          member institutions use videoconferencing technology to do their distance 
          education programs. </p>
        <p>Dr. Silverman had called the Museum several years 
          ago to ask about doing some distance learning with us, but we were not 
          ready. This time, I thought we were ready. He and I talked quite a bit 
          about his program, and the possibility of the Museum becoming a member 
          of their organization. That began a long process of research and meetings 
          with staff from the Museum to make this happen.</p>
        <p>First I prepared a set of question for Dr. Silverman, 
          and then interviewed him for about an hour. If we were to join his partnership, 
          he promised to provide the Museum with some videoconferencing technology 
          for us to use in addition to our Internet-based Flash product. First, 
          I brought the findings back to the Director of Education and the Director 
          of Technology. Then I presented this information to the technology committee 
          of the Museum. They asked for more information, so I went to Dr. Silverman 
          again and asked him for the names of some of their current partners. 
          I interviewed five of them and wrote up the results with the recommendation 
          that we join. Within days the committee agreed and I called New York 
          with the good news.</p>
        <p>Our next step is to have EEZ staff meet in February 
          with Museum staff, and to receive the new videoconferencing equipment. 
          Once we have that in place, we can start training the tech staff on 
          how to use the new equipment, and we can then start testing programs 
          with the new technology.</p>
        <h2>Other Types of Distance Education Technology</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the other types of distance education 
          technology I uncovered in my research.</p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li> 
           POTS: Plain Old Telephone System. Can be 
            used by itself, or in combination with a Web-based program or other 
            program. We used the telephone for audio for a program in Florida, 
            using the Flash technology for the video connection. It worked very 
            well. It can get expensive though, depending on phone rates.</li>
        <li> 
           Blogging/Message boards: Blogging (Web blog) 
            is a tool used for asynchronous communication. Users can log into 
            their Web site and create journals, or read anyone else&#39;s. Teachers 
            can use them to post information for classes. The newest thing is 
            audio blogging— which is really fantastic. Content can be recorded 
            and downloaded. Message boards can be like a live chat if members 
            are posting at the same time, or can be a space to read and receive 
            information.</li>
        <li> 
           Web-based Technology: this is using an Internet 
            connection to transmit programming: one-way or two-way.</li>
        <li> 
           Instant Messenger - A way to speak instantly 
            over the Internet without phone charges. You type your text messages 
            into a screen. I have actually used Yahoo Instant Messenger, coupled 
            with my Web camera at home, to speak to a friend in Sydney, Australia, 
            and it didn&#39;t cost us anything extra.</li>
        <li> 
           Macromedia Flash: Right now we are piloting 
            the Flash technology for the Web. Depends on bandwidth— low 
            to good quality. Equipment needed: Computer, Internet connection faster 
            than dial-up, speakers, microphone, video camera. Software needed: 
            Flash 6.0 and Internet 6.0</li>
        <li> 
           Internet 2 - a non-profit consortium of 
            universities, government and corporations, dedicated to improving 
            technology and access to it. It won&#39;t replace the Internet, 
            but rather bring more development of new applications and technologies 
            to users of the Internet  <a href="http://www.internet2.edu/about/aboutinternet2.html" target="_blank">http://www.internet2.edu/about/aboutinternet2.html</a></li>
        <li> 
           Videoconferencing technology: can be ISDN, 
            Web-based (IP), or software. The ISDN and some IP versions use equipment 
            to transmit data.</li>
        <li> 
          ISDN— stands for Integrated Services 
            Digital Network, is a system of digital phone connections that has 
            been available for over a decade. This system allows data to be transmitted 
            simultaneously across the world using end-to-end digital connectivity. 
            <em>Equipment needed</em>: microphone, camera, codec (Coder/Decoder— the device encodes, for transmission, and decodes, upon receipt, 
            digital video and analog audio signals so those signals occupy less 
            bandwidth during transmission), monitor, speaker</li>
        <li> 
           Satellite Technology: not reliant on computers: 
            both sides need sending and receiving equipment: need an uplink to 
            send the images and a downlink to receive them. More mobile - good 
            to high quality <em>Equipment needed:</em> access to satellite dish 
            and uplink and downlink Television: - uses a studio, less mobile, 
            but expensive and high quality <em>Equipment needed</em>: television 
            studio equipment</li>
      </ul>
       
        <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <p>The last of my first year goals is to convince others 
          in the Museum that distance education makes sense. In many ways, this 
          is the hardest thing to do. Fulfilling this goal relates directly to 
          the challenges we have faced over the past year and a half.</p>
        <p>The most obvious challenge to a program like this 
          is lack of resources. Unfortunately, we have always had this problem 
          with any project we take on. Believe it or not, the demand for our information, 
          staff time and resources is incredible, even though we have been around 
          for ten years now. The distance education programs are competing with 
          all of the other programs, such as teacher workshops and conferences, 
          presentations by staff, and educational programs held at the Museum. 
          Also, the technology staff and I have taken on this program without 
          giving up any of our regular duties.</p>
        <p>While we started pursuing distance education programs, 
          the Museum began its tenth anniversary year. This began a whole series 
          of programs, activities, and events added on top of our regularly scheduled 
          tasks. Therefore, distance education programs are put last on the list 
          of priorities.</p>
        <p>Getting staff to buy-in to the concept of distance 
          education is a very tricky problem to solve. Some wholly embrace the 
          idea: I do not have to do more than ask, and they participate. Others 
          are very wary of the idea and are not even sure what it means. I have 
          had to hold meetings, write papers, and otherwise try to educate the 
          Education staff in what distance education is and how it can benefit 
          our Museum. Time is on my side, because as more people learn about distance 
          education, and/or see it in action, they either become excited about 
          the idea, or it becomes more of an accepted part of doing our work.</p>
        <p>I do know that the senior management of the Museum 
          is very excited about these new programs, and the new technology. They 
          are beginning to put more support and resources our way as we develop 
          new programs. It is my job now to present information in committees 
          and work with others in the Museum who are doing similar work. </p>
        <p>I do not see that this last goal is going to be met, 
          but rather turn into an on-going process.</p>
        <h1>What Have We Learned?</h1>
        <p>We have learned a lot over the last year. In fact, 
          I have four new programs so far, as of writing this paper, which will 
          take place this spring. </p>
        <p>Working with the teachers and scheduling the programs 
          has become easier in some ways. For example, I do not have to figure 
          out what the next step is in the process. That has already been figured 
          out. What is now harder is to try not to keep creating new things over 
          and over, and to figure out if we can build some programs that can be 
          model programs for new classes.</p>
        <p>The technology has become more familiar to me, and 
          technical testing that used to take an hour now takes only ten minutes 
          on average. Also, we understand that we need to maintain flexibility 
          in the programming and technology options, and remain prepared for any 
          situations that can occur.</p>
        <p>As well, I know that we need to work harder to create 
          programs specifically for the electronic environment. We are ready to 
          move to the next step with these programs, and I believe that in this 
          next year we will get there.</p>
        <p>I believe that our success has shown us that the 
          need for electronic programs is great, and that this Museum can play 
          a leadership and educational role. I have also learned that it is important 
          to consider the Museum&#39;s strategic plan and mission, and to make 
          sure that distance education and the methods of delivery fit into these.</p>
        <h1>New Goals for the New Year</h1>
        <p>After working on the process and procedures over 
          the past years, I decided that this year, I needed to refine what we 
          were doing. Here are my goals for this year:</p>
      <ol class="listwithnumbers">
        <li> 
          Create educational goals for the division&#39;s 
            distance education program, soliciting input from staff in Education 
            and other relevant areas. Incorporate research on states coverage.</li>
        <li> Manage the design process for core programs for middle and high school 
          classrooms, based on sound pedagogical and distance education principles.</li>
        <li> 
          Test programs and evaluate them; make improvements 
            based on feedback.</li>
        <li> 
          Track data related to the distance education 
            program pilot and other distance education programs.</li>
        <li> 
          Incorporate staff and programs from other divisions 
            in designing and assessing programs.</li>
        <li>
          Conduct research on distance education and possible 
            partnerships for the Museum to pursue. Share results with supervisor 
            and other staff.
        </li>
      </ol>
      
            As of writing this paper, we have three <i>core</i> programs, and 
            will be developing a fourth this spring. The first is a general Holocaust 
            history lesson given by the Education division&#39;s historian. 
            The second is a presentation about the Committee on Conscience given 
            by one of their staff. The third is an artifact-based lesson developed 
            by one of our museum educators. We expect to be refining these as 
            we give them, and incorporating new ideas and suggestions as needed. 
         
        <p>The fourth program will be based on a collection of slides taken by 
          a Nazi accountant in the Lodz ghetto. This is a unique collection of 
          about 400 slides, in color. I will be working with staff in the Photo 
          Archives, Collections division, as well as the Education division&#39;s 
          museum educators and historian.</p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>We began using the Internet as a way to connect to 
          our audience because we are familiar with that format. During our research 
          we realized that there are many different ways to connect to people, 
          and that sometimes the Internet will not work. We need to be flexible 
          and open to using combinations of technologies and learn about new technology 
          so that we can continue to further our mission to educate the public 
          about the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>Upon reflection, I do think that our FlashComm Server 
          technology is successful, and will remain one of the tools that we use 
          for distance education. Our first year of testing was extremely helpful 
          in identifying what we need to do, even when a program did not succeed. 
          I am anticipating having a menu of technology options for programming, 
          as well as a menu of core programs that we will use to educate the public 
          about the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>As we continue testing and developing our programs, 
          I am confident that we will develop better and better educational programming, 
          and learn more about the field of distance education so that we can 
          become a leader in that field.</p>
