      <p class="PaperTitle">One Wright Way: From Collections to Classrooms</p>
      <p class="Author">Karen Elinich, The Franklin Institute Science Museum, USA </p>
      <p class="URL"><a href="http://www.fi.edu/" target="_new">http://www.fi.edu</a></p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
       <p class="AbstractText">What are the right ways for museum educators to connect 
      modern learning environments with historical collections? &#34;One Wright 
      Way: From Collections to Classrooms&#34; suggests practical strategies and 
      methodologies by which museum staff can develop innovative on-line presentations 
      and programs that connect K-12 classrooms with the museum. As a particular 
      case for consideration, The Franklin Institute&#39;s Wright Aeronautical Engineering 
      Collection will be featured. </p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p class="BlockQuote">By studying the choices and decisions of the past, students 
      can confront today&#39;s problems and choices with a deeper awareness of the alternatives 
      before them and the likely consequences of each. </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(National Standards for History, 1996) </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">In learning science, students need to understand that science 
      reflects its history and is an ongoing, changing enterprise. The standards 
      for the history and nature of science recommend the use of history in school 
      science programs to clarify different aspects of scientific inquiry, the human 
      aspects of science, and the role that science has played in the development 
      of various cultures. </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(National Science Education Standards, 1996) </p>
      <p>The national call for standards-based education in both history and science 
      has presented an exciting opportunity for museums to develop models that approach 
      the history of science through the examination of primary sources and the 
      use of on-line<b> </b>technology. The history of science exists at the crossroads 
      of human curiosity, the physical world, the natural environment, and social 
      interaction. All great scientific achievements reflect the limitless capacity 
      of human imagination in the context of the contemporary conditions of national 
      life. Students need to recognize science as a vital human pursuit that flows 
      naturally from their innate curiosity and imagination. Through the Web, Museums 
      can provide K-12 classroom teachers with access to resources they need to 
      introduce students to the primary sources that document the history of science. 
      In the process, students will discover their capacity to build upon the diverse 
      heritage and traditions of science as a human pursuit. </p>
      <p>Educational research has long supported the value of student access to and 
      use of primary source documents for the study of history. &#34;The Nation&#39;s Report 
      Card: U.S. History 2001&#34; (U.S. Department of Education, 2002) underscores<b> 
      </b>the value of primary sources in history education. At all grade levels, 
      teachers indicated the nature of their instructional activities, including 
      the use of primary sources. Students whose teachers reported using primary 
      historical documents once or twice per week had higher scores than those students 
      whose teachers did not. </p>
      <p>At the same time, the Internet provides unprecedented access to primary sources 
      for student exploration. The same report indicates that 74% of fourth-graders, 
      64% of eighth-graders, and 42% of twelfth-graders said that they never or 
      hardly ever used a computer in school to study history. However, when students 
      did indicate that they had used computers for the purpose of historical research 
      or instructional activities, they scored higher than their counterparts. While 
      the report is careful to note that the &#34;relationship between computer use 
      and average U.S. history scores cannot…be interpreted causally,&#34; further investigation 
      may find that creative computer use does support student learning in history. 
      Museums can and should use on-line technology as a worldwide gateway for educational 
      access to and exploration of rare primary historical documents. </p>
      <p>According 
      to the &#34;The Internet and Education,&#34; (Pew Internet and American Life Project, 
      2001), 95% of parents say it is important for children to learn about the 
      Internet in order to be a success later in life. Teachers agree: 96% of teachers 
      say that knowledge and use of the Internet is an essential aspect of communication 
      today. Yet a need exists for standards-driven contextual frameworks in which 
      on-line technology can have the greatest educational impact: &#34;Educators need 
      insight into how to maximize the positive impact of their technology.&#34; (Kelley, 
      Ringstaff, 2002) The Franklin Institute has been addressing this need by developing 
      new on-line educational materials that teachers and students can use to make 
      the Internet an essential feature of their education. </p>
      <p>In his foreword to &#34;Technology 
      in Industrial America,&#34; (McMahon, 1977), Bruce Sinclair of the University 
      of Toronto&#39;s Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology 
      writes that </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">A belief in Yankee ingenuity is so much a part of the national 
      self-image that it would be difficult to say when it first appeared. And yet, 
      while ‘know-how&#39; has often been described in generic terms, the fact is that 
      Americans have devoted a great deal of effort to stimulate and foster technical 
      ability. Indeed, one of the best examples of their inventiveness is the variety 
      of institutions devised over the years. </p>
      <p>The Franklin Institute is one 
      of the first of these institutions. Since 1824, when it was founded as &#34;The 
      Franklin Institute of the State of Pennsylvania for the Promotion of the Mechanic 
      Arts,&#34; the Institute has celebrated and collected the real evidence of American 
      ingenuity and inventiveness.</p>
      <p>The Internet has enabled The Franklin Institute to connect its historical 
          collections with classrooms in imaginative new ways. For example, an 
          on-line gallery of K-12 classroom resources suggests ways to use three-dimensional 
          historical artifacts from the Institute&#39;s collections to spark 
          student science inquiry. The gallery, known as &#34;Pieces of Science,&#34; 
        was developed with support from in-service teachers who provided invaluable 
        perspective. Since its publication in 2001, &#34;Pieces of Science&#34; 
        (<a href="http://www.fi.edu/pieces" target="_blank">http://www.fi.edu/pieces</a>) 
          has received worldwide notice and interest. The benefits of this technology-enabled 
          distribution of primary objects are still being realized. Certainly, 
          the teachers who participated in the development were prime beneficiaries; 
          their experience was an exciting professional development opportunity 
          that generated a new perspective on primary sources and a new interest 
        in using them in their classrooms. </p>
      <h1>Case Study: One Wright Way</h1>
      <p>On December 17, 1903, at 10:35AM EST, Orville and Wilbur Wright became the 
      first human beings to achieve sustained, controlled, powered flight. As the 
      Centennial of that event approached and worldwide interest in original Wright 
      artifacts grew, The Franklin Institute recognized a unique opportunity to 
      use the Wright Aeronautical Engineering Collection as a catalyst for new educational 
      technology programs and partnerships. </p>
      <p>The Franklin Institute acquired the Wright Aeronautical Engineering Collection 
      in the late 1940s. Orville, who died in 1948, instructed that, upon his death, 
      The Franklin Institute should receive his collection of airfoils and engineering 
      devices because The Franklin Institute was the first scientific organization 
      in the world to give the Wright Brothers credit and rank for their accomplishment. 
      The collection, as described below, includes two- and three-dimensional artifacts.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Dr. Orville Wright deeded to The Franklin Institute in his 
      will and through the Executors of his Estate all of his and his brother&#39;s, 
      Wilbur Wright&#39;s, original wind tunnel apparatus, model airfoils, test data 
      and drawings of their early airplanes. The collection also includes airfoil 
      models tested at McCook Field during 1910, 1920, and 1921 as well as some 
      of Orville Wright&#39;s experimental aviation devices with which he worked during 
      his lifetime. These include a shaper and cutters to prepare wax airfoil models, 
      a special scale, smoke apparatus for wind tunnel use, a bank indicator, an 
      incidence indicator, automatic control devices for wind tunnel and airplane 
      control, an automatic landing device and a cipher machine. </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Among the original drawings the collection includes those 
      of the first successful airplane—the 1903 biplane, and the 1904, 1905, 1907, 
      and 1910 biplanes. Engine drawings include the 1910 motor and prints of the 
      1903 motor. </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">In addition to the intrinsic and irreplaceable value of 
      the many items in the collection there exists within them a record of the 
      logical, step-by-step program of engineering research and development by which 
      the Wright Brothers enabled themselves to achieve success in flying their 
      first powered airplane. Therein lies a record of their systematic wind tunnel 
      tests conducted to give them reliable lift, drag, and L/D values to enable 
      them to engineer the design of the first successful airplane. Test results 
      were collaborated by building and test-flying gliders to determine the scale 
      effects from wind tunnel data to full scale wings. It is no little wonder 
      that by such scientific methods two men, then known better for their printing, 
      publishing, and bicycle activities, were first to conquer the art of flight 
      with a heavier than air machine<i>. Journal of The Franklin Institute, August, 
      1951.</i></p>
      <p>The Wright Collection seemed to have the perfect formula for educational 
      technology success. Within the collection are primary source materials that 
      tell an inspirational, standards-aligned story of human accomplishment. And 
      national interest in the Centennial of Flight meant that the idea might attract 
      grant funding. In fact, grant funding did materialize. The National Business 
      Aviation Association supported the &#34;Wright Again&#34; program, and the U.S. Centennial 
      of Flight Commission, through the Federal Aviation Administration, supported 
      the &#34;2003 Flight Forecast&#34; program.</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig. 1: The Home Page of &#34;Wright Again.&#34; <a href="http://www.wrightagain.com/" target="_blank">http://www.wrightagain.com</a></p>
      <p>The &#34;Wright Again&#34; project enabled engineers from Cislunar Aerospace, an 
      aerodynamic engineering firm located in San Francisco, to work with the Institute&#39;s 
      educational technologists to develop an on-line educational resource (<a href="http://www.wrightagain.com/">http://www.wrightagain.com</a>) 
      inspired by the Wright Aeronautical Engineering Collection. By illustrating 
      how the Wrights&#39; well-known scientific achievements developed over time, &#34;Wright 
      Again&#34; provides teachers with resources to help students increase their knowledge, 
      understanding, and capacity to reflect on the history of scientific achievement 
      as a human pursuit. Students need to understand that the Wright Brothers did 
      not wake up one day with a vision for the design of the 1903 Flyer. Their 
      process began years earlier and included several unsuccessful designs. The 
      project extrapolated an engineering timeline from the Wrights&#39; personal journals. 
      The journal entries, as authentic primary sources, offer an unrivaled accounting 
      of the real process of scientific investigation that lifted humanity to its 
      20<sup>th</sup> Century heights. </p>
      <p>The first documented evidence of Wilbur Wright&#39;s aviation intentions is from 
      1899. &#34;Wright Again&#34; began in 1999 so the project could follow a timeline 
      that mirrored the Wright documentation to the date. For example, on October 
      8, 1902, Wilbur and Orville were in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, testing their 
      gliders. On October 8, 2002, students were challenged to construct their own 
      model glider and to test its performance to see if they could replicate the 
      Wrights&#39; data. All of the activities are considered in the context of the 
      National Science Education Standards so that teachers can readily identify 
      the pathways from the Collection to the classroom. There are over two hundred 
      timeline entries drawn from the Wright journals. </p>

      <p>Throughout the &#34;Wright Again&#34; Web site, artifacts from the Collection are 
      presented in concert with classroom activities that present the same physical 
      concepts. Fundamentally, the artifacts from the Wright Collection represent 
      a portrait of the engineering process, like keys that unlocked the physical 
      science of powered flight.</p>
      <h1>2003 Flight Forecast</h1>

      <p class="caption">Fig. 3: The Home Page of &#34;2003 
        Flight Forecast.&#34; <a href="http://www.centennialofflight.gov/2003FF/" target="_blank">http://www.centennialofflight.gov/2003FF/</a></p>
      <p>On December 17, 1903, conditions were right for flight on Kill Devil Hills. 
      As December 17, 2003, approached and plans were underway for a celebratory 
      re-creation, would the weather and atmospheric conditions be favorable? This 
      question sparked the development of the &#34;2003 Flight Forecast&#34; educational 
      program Web site and national competition. </p>
      <p>The Franklin Institute developed the Web site that included student activities, 
      a program registration application, and the forecast submission system. The 
      educational activities were presented in the historical context of the Wright 
      Aeronautical Engineering Collection and the narrative timeline of the Wright 
      Flyer development. The Web site&#39;s resources were informal learning resources, 
      but were presented in the context of the National Science Education Standards. 
      The entire program was organized around three grade groupings: K–5, 6-8, and 
      9-12. </p>
      <p>The educational activities provided the background information that students 
      needed to make their own forecasts. As a celebratory feature, the Web site 
      included a national competition to determine the most accurate student forecast 
      for the weather on December 17, 2003, at the Memorial site in Kill Devil Hills, 
      North Carolina. The complexity of the forecast varied according to the grade 
      level grouping. Winners were determined within each grade level grouping. 
      </p>
      <p>The &#34;2003 Flight Forecast&#34; Web site activities were developed around an exploration 
      of the Wright Collection and historical weather data from the Outer Banks, 
      North Carolina area. Multiple data sources exist, each offering different 
      glimpses of the weather over the years. Students were encouraged to study 
      the trends over the past ten years as the primary basis for formulating their 
      predictions. </p>
      <p>Teacher participation in the program was invited via The Franklin Institute 
      On-line and the Centennial of Flight Commission Web sites, encouraging the 
      registration of teachers who wanted to participate in the forecasting competition. 
      All resources were available freely for use by any interested learners. Registration 
      was required only as a mechanism for managing the forecasting competition. 
      If teachers preferred not to include the competitive element, they could still 
      make good educational use of the content and activities. Registration was 
      limited to the United States. In total, 460 teachers registered, representing 
      25,000 students in grades K-12. Their schools were located in forty-seven 
      states, plus the District of Columbia. Three teachers in the US Department 
      of Defense Agency&#39;s school system also participated from their schools on 
      military bases in England, Germany, and Japan. </p>
      <p>To encourage repeat visitation, a new &#34;Daily Detail&#34; was placed on the site 
      on every school day. The &#34;Daily Details&#34; were a mix of brief information nuggets 
      related either to the Wright Brothers or to meteorology. </p>
      <p>The competitive forecast submission process took place between November 3 
      and November 17. Today&#39;s professional weather forecasting services are routinely 
      publishing twenty-one day extended weather forecasts which are available freely 
      on-line. In order to maintain the integrity of the competition, and to make 
      sure the forecasts were amateur, the forecast submission phase needed to close 
      on November 17. </p>
      <p>Between November 18 and December 17, staff selected a sampling of the variety 
      of submitted forecasts, showcasing them daily. This activity encouraged students 
      to return to the site every day to see if their forecast had been showcased 
      and to compare predictions. </p>
      <p>On December 17, the most accurate forecasts were determined by comparing 
      the predictions to the actual recorded conditions. The winning student forecasts 
      were remarkably precise. Within each grade grouping, one forecast was selected 
      as the &#34;grand prize.&#34; The next three most accurate were selected as &#34;first 
      prize&#34; winners. The next seven forecasts received &#34;second prize&#34; status, for 
      a total of the top eleven forecasts in each grade grouping receiving recognition. 
      </p>
      <p>Amazingly, the geographic distribution of schools with winning students ranged 
      from Germany to Hawaii, with fourteen states in between. The Franklin Institute&#39;s 
      capacity to manage a national, competitive, educational program like &#34;2003 
      Flight Forecast&#34; exists only because of its on-line presence.</p>
      <p>After December 17, the Web site resources were packaged so that the ideas 
      and activities continue to have value for classroom use. The Web pages were 
      adjusted to reflect that the competition happened in the past, but the resources 
      are timeless, and teachers can continue to engage students with the practice 
      of weather forecasting, particularly for December 17th each year. </p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>The on-line resources created around the Wright Aeronautical Engineering 
      Collection have a lasting value that extends beyond the interest in the Centennial 
      of Flight. The connections between the collection, the classroom, and the 
      national standards make these resources evergreen. Perhaps more important, 
      the programmatic models developed around the Wright Collection can now be 
      used to inform future efforts. For example, January 17, 2006, marks the 300th 
      anniversary of the birth of Benjamin Franklin. In anticipation of that event, 
      efforts are already underway to begin bringing Franklin-related artifacts 
      to the Web for use in classrooms around the world and to seek grant funding 
      from interested sources. The Wright program models are proving to be quite 
      useful to the effort. As Benjamin Franklin 
      might say, a program model saved is a program model earned. </p>
