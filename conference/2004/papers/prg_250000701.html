        <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
         <p class="AbstractText">Tate Online is Tate&#39;s 5<sup>th</sup> gallery. 
          The aim of Tate Online, as with the organisation as a whole, is to increase 
          public awareness, understanding and appreciation of art. Tate Online 
          currently attracts in excess of 2 million visitors a year, and independent 
          analysis confirms it is the most popular UK art Web site. Visitors to 
          the site are diverse (comprising artists, students, academics, members, 
          patrons, tourists, job applicants, journalists and government officials) 
          and have distinct information needs. Almost every department across 
          Tate now contributes content to Tate Online, targeting different audiences 
          in different ways. Planning is fundamental to the successful development 
          of the site, and is taken forward by the centrally located Digital Programmes 
          department. As part of this planning, we have identified and communicated 
          the key areas for focus over the next 3-5 years, and are beginning to 
          profile and target better the different audience groups the organisation 
          is endeavouring to attract.  This paper will suggest some of the methods 
          we are employing to balance the demands, in an effort to ensure that 
          both visitor numbers and visitor satisfaction increase in line with 
          Tate&#39;s overall objectives.</p>

        <h1>Introduction to Tate</h1>
        <p>Tate has a dual role as the national Collection of 
          British art and as the national Collection of International modern art 
          and is one of the great public museums of the United Kingdom. It is 
          made up of six sites, established in the following order: Tate Britain 
          (London, 1897), Tate Liverpool (1988), Tate St Ives (1993), Tate Store 
          (1994), Tate Online (<a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/">www.tate.org.uk</a>  1988) 
          (See fig. 1), and Tate Modern (London, 2000). Tate&#39;s central 
          aim is to create public awareness, understanding and appreciation of 
          British art from the sixteenth century to the present day, and of international 
          modern and contemporary art. The organisation cares for over 5,800 unique 
          paintings and sculptures, as well as more works on paper, and the Turner 
          Bequest - a total of over 60,000 artworks. Tate not only preserves and 
          displays this internationally significant Collection, but also provides 
          a range of educational and interpretation resources and activities for 
          visitors of all ages, backgrounds and abilities. Its activities span 
          across the areas of education, conservation, research, publication, 
          exhibition and acquisition projects. </p>

        <h1>History of Tate Online</h1>
        <p>Tate.org.uk has always been the primary on-line destination 
          for all information about the organisation. From its launch, the site 
          offered an on-line catalogue of the Tate Collection (with several thousand 
          illustrated works), full information about each offline gallery, and 
          details about the imminent expansion of Tate Britain and the development 
          of Tate Modern. The original Web site provided information on displays 
          and special exhibitions, tours, talks, films, conferences and courses, 
          sponsorship opportunities and membership, mail order from the Tate shop, 
          and an &#39;Art Forum&#39; and &#39;Visitors Book&#39;. A sole 
          Web editor working three days a week and located in the Communications 
          department maintained this information. At this time Tate also embarked 
          on a massive digitisation programme. This programme, called Insight, 
          was supported by lottery funding (http://www.hlf.org.uk, http://www.nof.org.uk) 
          and would result in virtual access to the entire Collection within five 
          years.</p>
        <p>A substantial redesign of the Tate&#39;s Web site 
          was undertaken in March 2000, by Nykris. This overhaul coincided with 
          the opening of Tate Modern, the extension of Tate Britain, as well as 
          the launch of the new Tate brand developed by Wolff Olins (http://www.wolff-olins.com). 
          It was accompanied by the launch of the webcasting programme, initially 
          centered on Tate Modern&#39;s adult public programmes. The year 2000 
          also saw the development of an e-business joint venture with the MoMA 
          (http://www.moma.org) called Muse, intended according to the press release 
          to create an independent for-profit e-business that <i>would</i> 
          establish the premier destination on the internet for individuals to 
          access, understand, and purchase the best in modern art, design, and 
          culture&#39;.  It was an undeniably ambitious initiative, determined 
          to draw on &#39;the museums&#39; unrivalled collections and intellectual 
          capital to expand the global audience for modern art, design, and culture&#39;.  
          Although a Muse site never actually materialized, the project focused 
          Tate&#39;s attention on the viable opportunities internet technologies 
          offer the organisation to fulfill its central remit.</p>
        <p>2001 saw the first sponsorship of the Web site by BT and its public 
          branding as Tate Online.  The organisations&#39; ambitions for Tate 
          Online were explicitly stated in the business plan from this year, which 
          stated that the Web site should &#39;function as a sixth site for 
          Tate, featuring a distinct and identifiable programme, appropriate to 
          the medium&#39;. BT&#39;s sponsorship of Tate Online facilitated 
          the establishment of a dedicated central team to lead the development 
          of the site. This new team was called Digital Programmes and reported 
          to the Director of International and National Programmes. It assumed 
          responsibility for setting high-level strategy and coordinating the 
          delivery of Tate&#39;s public-facing digital content. One of its key 
          roles is to ensure that the sum of cross-Tate initiatives in this area 
          is maximized. Another is to ensure that Tate&#39;s Web site is developed 
          as a destination in its own right. In April, 2003, BT renewed its sponsorship 
          of Tate Online, providing a further £2,000,000 worth of support over 
          the next three years.</p>
        <p>Tate&#39;s attention over the past two years has 
          moved beyond the digitisation of the core Collection to providing additional 
          contextual information for virtual visitors. Richer, more immersive 
          resources have been created to support the broader education, exhibition 
          and display programmes, and a series of net art projects has been commissioned 
          exclusively for viewing online.  A further interesting development is 
          the attempt to facilitate discourse both with and among visitors (for 
          instance, with the Turner Prize forums), and to solicit visitor help 
          in the creation and delivery of content (for instance, in the request 
          for stories and opinions to populate the microsite that accompanies 
          Olafur Eliasson&#39;s <i>Weather Project</i>).</p>
        <h2>Tate Online Now</h2>
        <p>The number of visitors to Tate.org.uk has more than 
          trebled in just over two years.  Over 333,000 unique visitors were logged 
          in October 2003 (compared with 109,000 in September 2001), and the site 
          witnessed an 85% increase year on year in December 2003.  Assuming this 
          pace of growth is sustained, Tate Online should expect to receive over 
          1 million unique visitors in October 2006 alone. </p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="rellie.fig2.JPG" alt="rising numbers of unique visitors over the last two years" width="400" height="193"/></p>
        <p class="MsoCaption"><span class="caption">Figure 2: Unique vi</span>sitors 
          to Tate Online since hosted at BT]</p>
        <p>According to independent analysts Hitwise, Tate Online 
          is consistently the top UK art site, relinquishing its number one spot 
          for the few weeks in the year when BBC i-arts hosts <i>The Big Read 
          </i>- the national poll to identify the UK&#39;s favourite books. 
          This impressive record has only been possible because Tate has for some 
          time recognised that the Web site is an essential component in the organisation&#39;s 
          future and remains committed to cultivating Tate Online as a leading 
          21<sup>st</sup> century arts site, in its own right. </p>
        <p>Driving traffic from the Web site to the offline 
          galleries is one of the most important goals of Tate Online, but the 
          Web site now serves a variety of functions above and beyond ticket sales 
          and footfall. It simultaneously serves as a wide-reaching communications 
          tool, an extensive resource for information on British and Modern International 
          art, and an innovative, engaging entertainment channel. Visitors to 
          Tate Online include artists, students, academics, members, patrons, 
          tourists, journalists, government officials and job applicants. According 
          to survey responses collected in June 2003, 66% of these people are 
          from the UK, 11% from the USA and the rest from countries that include 
          Albania, Fiji, Lebanon, Paraguay and the UAE. Note that 19% have never 
          visited an offline Tate gallery, 35% visit Tate Online at least once 
          a month, and 45% are first time visitors to the Website.  </p>
        <p>The impact of Tate Online on the organisation as 
          a whole should not be underestimated. It is now broadly accepted that 
          museums are no longer solely about collecting and preserving cultural 
          artefacts, but also act as important forums for learning and cultural 
          exchange. The unique and now very familiar characteristics of the internet 
          (&#39;always open&#39;, &#39;highly flexible&#39;, provides &#39;limitless space&#39;), suit 
          it to a central role in the ever-evolving relationship between visitors, 
          the Collection and the offline galleries. Today, Tate Online is highly 
          dynamic with regular, daily content updates communicating with the full 
          range of offline and on-line visitors to the organisation. Most Tate 
          departments now contribute content to Tate Online, and there is no shortage 
          of excellent ideas on how the offering can be further improved and supplemented. 
          The amount of content has increased exponentially over the last five 
          years, and shows no sign of abating.  </p>
        <p>The inevitable result of this proliferation of ideas 
          for digital developments is conflicting demands for limited resources.  
          The biggest ongoing issue now facing Tate Online is how best to tackle 
          this conflict while ensuring that both visitor numbers and visitor satisfaction 
          increase in line with Tate&#39;s overall objectives. Various tactics 
          have been employed in an attempt to stay on this course, including most

        <p>These and other tactics have been initiated at Tate, but work is ongoing 
          in all cases. The rest of this paper will describe what is involved 
          in making use of these methods and any interesting findings that we 
          have encountered in the process.</p>
        <h1>The Creation Of And Adherence To A Shared Set Of Objectives</h1>
        <p>Tate as an organisation takes planning very seriously. All teams are 
          asked to review and submit their departmental plans on a yearly basis, 
          and Digital Programmes is no exception.  Each winter, the Digital Programmes 
          team reviews the overarching objectives for all Tate&#39;s cross-platform 
          public facing digital content, and more specifically for its primary 
          distribution channel: Tate Online. These core objectives are crucial 
          in informing the priorities for Tate Online and are communicated within 
          the organisation in an effort to ensure that all developments on the 
          site are orchestrated within a shared vision. The core objectives have 
          not changed radically since their inception, but the process of regularly 
          reviewing them does serve to focus and refine developments. The current 
          iterations are elaborated below in order to better indicate their relevance.</p>
        <h2>1. Increase access to Tate&#39;s Collection and Programmes</h2>
        <p><b>First</b>, this objective is about enticing more 
          people more regularly to the offline galleries by both increasing the 
          levels and improving the targeting of on-line marketing. Initiatives 
          such as <i>Explore Tate Modern</i> (which provides an interactive map 
          of the displays to facilitate planning a trip), along with microsites 
          (such as the <i>Warholiser</i>), and the monthly communications e-bulletins 
          have all proved successful in this respect. </p>
        <p><b>Secondly</b>, the objective means improving the 
          offering to visitors at the offline galleries, by providing increased 
          access to digital content via handheld computers and kiosks. The research 
          and development into multimedia PDA tours at Tate Modern, as well the 
          increase in use of site-specific interactives, such as <i>Turner&#39;s 
          Gallery</i> or the touch-screen sketchbooks displayed at the <i>Turner 
          in Venice</i> exhibition, both at Tate Britain, are examples of a growing 
          interest in the use of new technologies to improve the in-gallery visitor 
          experience.  </p>
        <p><b>Thirdly</b>, the objective relates to on-line 
          visits in their own right.  It involves increasing the number of visitors 
          to the Web site as well as the amount of time people spend on arrival, 
          engaging with the Collection and programmes. Obvious existing initiatives 
          that meet this objective are: the ongoing development of the Collections 
          section (which currently accounts for roughly 30% of all visitors to 
          Tate Online); an increasing focus on e-learning content which provides 
          a more structured opportunity to engage with Tate&#39;s works; and 
          the continued investment in the Web casting programme which enables 
          people to attend Tate conferences and seminars from any location with 
          internet access, at a time that suits them.  </p>
        <p>It should be noted, however, that this aspect of 
          the objective cannot simply be met by creating ever more digital content, 
          but rather must also be understood to mean improving the quality of 
          the content already available. Tate is committed to improving accessibility 
          to all content at the Web site by adhering to government guidelines 
          and where possible developing bespoke content for the socially excluded.</p>
        <h2>2.  Broaden, expand and diversify Tate&#39;s audience, both real and virtual 
        </h2>
        <p>The second objective states that Tate&#39;s digital 
          programmes should not simply focus on a general increase in visitor 
          numbers to the organisation, but should also take advantage of the opportunities 
          new media provide to encourage new audiences to engage with Tate&#39;s 
          activities. The objective is achieved by targeting under-represented 
          audiences with specific and relevant content, intended to stimulate 
          an interest in art.  Existing successful efforts in this respect include: 
          the promotion of Tate Online on 5,000 BT Vans; the ground-breaking <i>iMap</i> 
          project focusing on works by Matisse and Picasso and developed specifically 
          for the visually impaired; the creation of e-learning content around 
          Sonia Boyce&#39;s display at Tate Modern <i>From Tarzan to Rambo</i> 
          which explored issues of race and identity; and the recently launched 
          two-year on-line course, <i>Introduction to Modern and Contemporary 
          Art.</i></p>
        <h2>3. Function as a fifth site for Tate, featuring a distinct and identifiable 
          programme appropriate to the medium</h2>
        <p>The three key strands around which distinct programming 
          are currently developed for Tate Online are e-learning, net art and 
          the Collection.</p>
        <p><b>E-learning</b>: 21% of visitors to Tate Online 
          in June 2003 gave e-learning as their reason for visiting. This statistic 
          combined with the clear seasonal trends in visitor numbers suggests 
          that Tate is already attracting a significant learning-driven audience. 
          Furthermore, the audience for on-line learning is certain to grow in 
          the UK in parallel with government initiatives such as Curriculum Online 
          and Culture Online and the rollout of broadband to schools. In 2003 
          Tate hired its first e-learning curator, charged with developing a cross-site 
          e-learning strategy, intended to ensure that future initiatives in this 
          area are not simply opportunistic, and that the key audiences interested 
          in on-line education are both identified and catered to.  All e-learning 
          projects are currently based around but not limited to the Collection 
          and existing educational programmes.  Importantly, the initiatives are 
          designed to be self-contained, and do not rely on the ability of the 
          audience to visit the offline galleries. </p>
        <p><b>Net art</b>: The internet has developed in parallel 
          with concepts of globalisation, the communication age and the information 
          age, and is integral to their definitions.  If Tate&#39;s job is not 
          only to rethink the past, but also to celebrate what is most vital and 
          relevant now, then the internet cannot be ignored as a valid location 
          and focus for artistic practice.  In fact, net art fits well into post-1960 
          curatorial debates about the death of the object, the erosion of media 
          hierarchies, the expanded field and conceptual art. Tate has now displayed 
          net art on a few occasions, including in the Tate Modern pre-opening 
          programme and at Tate Britain as part of the <i>Art Now</i> series. 
          A small programme of net art commissions has also been initiated at 
          Tate Online.  The six Tate Online commissions to date are <i>Uncomfortable 
          Proximity</i> (2000) Graham Harwood, <i>Les Match des Couleurs</i> (2000) 
          Simon Patterson, <i>Borderxing Guide</i> (2002) Heath Bunting, <i>Tate 
          in Space</i> (2002) Susan Collins, <em>blessed-bandwidth.net</em> (2003) 
          Shilpa Gupta, and <i>AgoraXchange</i> (2004) Natalie Bookchin and Jacqueline 
          Stevens. Critical texts are commissioned to accompany each of the Tate 
          Online net art commissions, intended to encourage a broader audience 
          to engage with the practice.  Education and events are developed to 
          accompany these projects, and take advantage of Tate&#39;s network 
          of sites.</p>
        <p><b>The Collection</b>: The internet is unique and 
          arguably unsurpassed in its ability to display the Collection. Now that 
          Tate has digitised and made its entire Collection available on-line, 
          the organization is exploring what further information visitors would 
          like and increasingly expect to find alongside the images. Some interesting 
          recent initiatives in this respect include much of the work the Insight 
          team has delivered: digitising strands from the Tate archive; collating 
          all Turner&#39;s works worldwide to display them alongside Tate&#39;s 
          Collection at Tate Online; and experimenting with the use of richer 
          technologies to represent works in 3D. </p>
        <p>In addition, all content pertaining to Tate&#39;s 
          Collection in the <i>TATE</i> magazine is now re-purposed for on-line 
          distribution; work is underway to digitise texts from past Collection 
          catalogues; a hypertext glossary is in development, defining terms used 
          and intended to complement the Collection subject search; and two new 
          sections of the Web site are soon to launch, dedicated to Tate&#39;s 
          academic research and conservation work.</p>
        <h2>4. Promote and enhance organisational efficiency</h2>
        <p>As well as serving the general public, Tate Online 
          also serves business-related audiences including journalists, museum 
          professionals and job applicants.  The UK directive that all government 
          services should be delivered &#39;electronically, and in a customer-focused 
          way&#39; by 2005, suggests that the administrative functions of the 
          Tate Web site will, like other areas, continue to increase.  Recent 
          improvements in this area include the on-line sale of memberships, membership 
          renewals, ticket sales, monthly mailing lists, custom print sales and 
          licensing requests.  Work is underway to develop an improved on-line 
          press office; share research findings and Collection-related processes; 
          supply more corporate governance information on-line; integrate the 
          various registration systems currently provided across the site; and 
          ensure all content is appropriately listed on the most popular search 
          engines.</p>
        <h2>5. Generate revenue to support future Tate activities</h2>
        <p>Tate Online offers a number of opportunities for 
          revenue generation.  The shop is profitable if not booming; gift-membership 
          sales rocketed in the run-up to Christmas 2003; and in-house on-line 
          ticketing goes from strength-to-strength. Some events are now sold only 
          on-line, such the PJ Harvey concert at Tate Modern (2003) where over 
          200 tickets were sold within half an hour of being released, with all 
          commission from the sales going to Tate.  </p>
        <p>The longer-term vision is to enable cross-selling 
          off the back of these initiatives, so for instance an exhibition catalogue 
          might be offered at the on-line point-of-sale for the associated exhibition 
          ticket.  Consideration is now also being given as to whether all digital 
          content at Tate Online can always be offered free.  Content syndication, 
          micro-payments, and an e-membership scheme all remain possibilities 
          for the mid-to-longer term, but will be entered into only if they enable 
          Tate to meet visitor demands for additional content and services that 
          cannot be otherwise funded.</p>
        <h2>6. Facilitate new partnerships to improve the range of content and 
          services offered</h2>
        <p>A number of mutually beneficial partnerships have 
          already been formed around Tate Online, not least with BT (http://www.bt.com) 
          who provide both cash and technical expertise, with Groveart (http://www.groveart.com) 
          who supply artist biographies, with Historyworld (http://www.historyworld.net 
          ) who use Tate thumbnails in return for traffic, and with the development 
          of the <i>Tate@BBC</i> site.  Further partnerships will be explored 
          and established as long as the opportunities to develop digital content 
          around Tate activities continues to outstrip current in-house resources 
          to deliver such opportunities.</p>
        <h1>The Adoption of Guidelines and Devolved Content Management </h1>
        <p>Digital Programmes act as the gatekeeper to Tate 
          Online, and provides quality assurance for all content and services 
          found at the site, irrespective of whether the content is developed 
          by Digital Programmes itself, another Tate department, a freelancer 
          or a third party vendor.  All content is subjected to the same set of 
          standards and guidelines.  A high-level checklist has been compiled 
          to alert contributors to the most fundamental issues and is supplemented 
          by detailed information pertaining to copyright, usability, accessibility, 
          branding, style and implementation.  Standards and guidelines are distributed 
          via Tate&#39;s intranet.</p>
        <p>As indicated, Tate Online has evolved both quickly 
          and to a degree organically and as a result not all the necessary standards 
          and guidelines are yet in place. Furthermore, as new technologies and 
          their uses continue to evolve, so too will all these standards and guidelines 
          need to be reviewed and updated. More work is also needed to communicate 
          existing standards and guidelines better, and ensure that they are adopted 
          as soon as any public-facing digital content production is considered. 
          This will become ever more pressing as the number of distinct contributions 
          that are made to Tate Online increases. </p>
        <p>Aside from wholly new contributions, requests for 
          content updates and additions also remain on the increase. Many of these 
          requests are relatively straightforward because they are formulaic and 
          vary little from one occasion to the next.  The use of two full-time 
          Web editors to perform these simple tasks is not the optimum use of 
          their skills and reduces the time they have to focus on the development 
          of richer content. Publishing tools have already been developed for 
          some key, frequently updated areas of the site to eliminate the need 
          for the direct involvement of the Web editors.  These tools are currently 
          restricted to the Collection, Shop and Ticketing sections of the site. 
          The most regularly updated content in these sections is now managed 
          directly by the owners of that content, who sit within the Collection, 
          Enterprises and Ticketing divisions.</p>
        <p>Further pockets of content which will benefit from 
          similar tools have been identified.  These include press releases, job 
          applications, e-mail marketing bulletins and events listings. Tate has 
          recently purchased a license for a content management system (Rhythmix 
          by Percussion) and will be extending its use to these sections of the 
          site over the coming months.  The Web editors will remain responsible 
          for creating the basic templates for these areas and for providing quality 
          assurance and support as needed for content creation.  The use of guidelines 
          and devolved content management should give them more time to focus 
          on the overall consistency and improvement of the site as well as the 
          development of new content areas and services.</p>
        <h1>Visitor Profiling and Site Analysis</h1>
        <p>Some in-house analysis and evaluation is conducted 
          on Tate Online, but this is an area where again, we realise we would 
          benefit from being more sophisticated. High-level quantitative analysis 
          is already regularly undertaken to understand better usage patterns 
          and spot areas where improvements to the visitor experience can be made.  
          A combination of tools is used, including Webtrends (Tate Online logfiles 
          analysis), Crystal Reports (to represent e-commerce activities), and 
          Hitwise (providing competitive analysis based on UK ISP data). This 
          quantitative analysis has been supplemented with high-level qualitative 
          research into visitor attitudes and needs, undertaken through both on-line 
          and in-gallery surveys as well as visitor feedback (some of which is 
          carried out in-house, some by Red Sheriff, and some by MEW).  While 
          this is a great start, we now recognise a need for more in-depth analysis, 
          focused on more specific content areas and audiences and executed over 
          time.</p>
        <p>In parallel with this more focused analysis, a series 
          of three comprehensive reports are being commissioned to help evaluate 
          Tate Online and direct developments. First, a consultant has been commissioned 
          to conduct a survey of the on-line activities of Tate&#39;s national 
          and international peer group. The survey will concentrate on the museum 
          sector but include other relevant organisations offering art related 
          content on-line. The objectives are to create a snapshot of current 
          on-line activities and to identify and comment on relevant ideas and 
          trends.  Secondly, an audit of all the content and services currently 
          offered at Tate Online is to be conducted. The site has grown considerably 
          over the last few years, and many of the developments have to a lesser 
          or greater degree been opportunistic.  The time has now come to map 
          and evaluate these efforts in an attempt to determine the fate both 
          of sections and pages, and to define better the structure and usability 
          of the site as we move forward. Thirdly, an external agency is being 
          commissioned to audit and document Tate Online in terms of its accessibility.  
          The Digital Programmes team is aware that Tate Online is not as accessible 
          as it might be and are keen to get existing issues documented so they 
          can be systematically fixed.</p>
        <h1>A Re-Assessment of the Overarching Strategy </h1>
        <p>Digital Programmes is Tate&#39;s newest department, 
          and like Tate Online it has changed considerably since it was established. 
          Four new posts have been created, including a second Web editor, a team 
          administrator, an e-learning curator and a developer.  These posts join 
          the existing Web editor, the Web casting curator, a Collections content 
          curator, a senior digital content manager, and myself, the head of department.  
          The Digital Programmes department is not responsible for creating all 
          the content at Tate Online, but it is responsible for pulling it all 
          together in a way that is consistent with the objectives of both the 
          organisation as well as the Tate brand. The department&#39;s growth 
          has been critical to the development of Tate Online and has signalled 
          a continued increase in Tate&#39;s investment in the use of digital 
          technology to engage more effectively existing and new audiences.  In 
          order to continue to take full advantage of the opportunities afforded 
          by digital technologies, I believe it is important that Tate further 
          increase its investment in this area, in parallel with the site growth, 
          use and funding opportunities.</p>
        <p>Tate Online has now existed for six years, and both 
          director- and trustee-level discussions are planned to evaluate the 
          options and determine its future. These discussion will make use of 
          the reports mentioned above, but will also be based on the findings 
          of a series of internal, cross-departmental meetings that are underway 
          to debate future focus areas. The subjects and key issues for debate 
          are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="listwithbullets"> 
           Galleries: Is there any further content 
            being created at other Tate sites that should be re-purposed for Tate 
            Online? What content is currently available at Tate Online that should 
            be made readily available within the bricks and mortar galleries via 
            handhelds and kiosks? What are the site-specific needs for in-gallery 
            displays and how might these relate to Tate Online?</li>
        <li class="listwithbullets"> 
           Collections and Research: Now that Tate 
            has digitised its Collection, what is next? Should Tate be filling 
            in the gaps virtually to include works from other collections, and 
            if so which? Should Tate Online be the first destination to visit 
            on-line to find out about British art, 20th century art, contemporary 
            art or all art? How might we achieve this?</li>
        <li class="listwithbullets"> 
           E-learning: What audiences should Tate Online 
            focus on? Should Tate create digital resources which directly support 
            the national curriculum? Which other organisations should Tate partner 
            with to increase the resources available?</li>
        <li class="listwithbullets"> Net art: What can be done to raise the profile 
            of net art at Tate? Is Tate doing enough to support this ever-growing 
            practice? Should Tate Online be commissioning works and creating 
            online exhibitions? </li>
        <li class="listwithbullets"> 
           Members: What additional information and 
            services could Tate provide on-line to improve the membership offering? 
            Should Tate be offering a virtual membership package? How can Tate 
            engage its members using new technologies, and create further value 
            from these relationships?</li>
        <li class="listwithbullets"> E-commerce: What further revenue generating 
            opportunities exist at Tate Online? What can be done to improve existing 
            sales? Should Tate be charging any segments of visitors for any content? 
            Is there any existing Tate Enterprises content that could be sold 
            at Tate Online?</li>
        <li class="listwithbullets"> 
           Corporate information: What further corporate 
            information should be provided at Tate Online? Are there any further 
            B2B activities that should be facilitated? How should Tate corporate 
            information be positioned alongside other content? </li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>Enthusiastic conversations have started, and it is 
          fair to suggest that a range of opinions exist on each matter.  What 
          is consistent, however, is that the organisation recognises that Tate 
          Online is an essential component of Tate&#39;s future.  Tate is fully 
          committed to building on the success it has already achieved in the 
          digital arena, in a well considered way.</p>
        <h1>Tate Online&#39;s Future</h1>
        <p>Tate Online has come a long way in the first six 
          years of its existence, and has a lot further it could go.  Developments 
          in digital technology, not least the rollout of broadband, will result 
          in even more innovative ways for Tate to encourage public awareness, 
          understanding and enjoyment of art.  Not only does the whole on-line 
          experience become smoother and faster with a broadband connection, but 
          arguably more significantly, the connection is always on, thereby radically 
          improving the potential for museum Web sites to act as effective communication 
          tools. </p>
        <p>Other factors which suggest a bright future for Tate 
          Online are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           The Office of the UK e-Envoy&#39;s commitment 
            to providing internet access to all who want it by the end of 2005. 
            (<a href="http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk</a>)</li>
        <li> 
           Only 34% of visitors to Tate Online in July 
            2003 were based outside the UK, while the global internet population 
            is currently estimated to be 682,500,000. (<a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/" target="_blank">http://www.internetworldstats.com</a>)</li>
        <li> 
           Increases in global internet usage, which 
            despite growing by 90% in 2000-2003, still only equates to 11% of 
            the world population. (<a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/" target="_blank">http://www.internetworldstats.com</a>)</li>
        <li> 
           An aging population: as the population ages, 
            so will the percentage of those on-line. </li>
        <li> 
           As the range and amount of content that 
            is made available at Tate Online increases, so too will it appeal 
            to larger numbers of people for longer.</li>
        <li> 
           The continued rollout of broadband and &#39;always-on&#39; 
            connections are likely to increase the total time spent on-line by 
            individuals. Broadband will be available to 90% of the British population 
            by the end of 2004. (<a href="http://www.bt.com/" target="_blank">http://www.bt.com</a>) </li>
        <li> 
           Leisure usage of the internet, for entertainment 
            purposes as opposed to information retrieval, is increasing as connection 
            speeds improve, access costs decline, and platforms converge.</li>
        <li> 
           Government support for initiatives such 
            as Curriculum Online will create further demand for trusted, educational 
            materials.</li>
        <li> 
           A broad range of higher-education courses 
            are increasingly available for those interested in pursuing a creative 
            career, specialising in new media. </li>
        <li> 
           Wireless networks will continue to facilitate 
            ubiquitous computing, enabling access to Tate Online via more platforms 
            and from any location.
		</li>
	  </ul>
			
            <p>These facts all combine to suggest very forcefully that it is still 
              early days for Tate&#39;s digital programmes and its hub Tate 
              Online. Tate is working hard to figure out both how best to use 
              new technologies and where it should secure and devote the resources 
              needed to employ them. We do not yet have all the answers, but one 
              thing is clear: future generations of visitors and artists are actively 
              seeking information, inspiration and entertainment on-line. This 
              alone determines that Tate Online will continue to provide tremendous 
              impetus to the ever-evolving relationship between visitors, the 
              Collection and the entire organisation for generations to come.
