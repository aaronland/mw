<p class="PaperTitle">Multimedia Tour Programme at Tate Modern</p>

<p class="Author">Gillian Wilson, Tate Modern, United Kingdom</p>

<p class="URL"><a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.tate.org.uk</a></p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

 <p class="AbstractText">TheTate Modern&#39;s Multimedia Tour programme includes three
different types of handheld tours: a Multimedia Highlights Tour, a tour in
British Sign Language, and a Collections Tour. Through both quantitative and
qualitative evaluation we are gaining valuable knowledge about visitors&#39;
thoughts on handheld tours in museums. This presentation explores the ways
handheld tours relate to other gallery activities and fulfill many of Tate
Modern&#39;s interpretation aims. It goes on to review content approaches that work
for our visitors and those that don&#39;t. Particular areas discussed are opinions
on interactive content such as texting and games, artists&#39; contributions, links
between audio and visual, use of film clips, and provision of text-based
information. </p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p class="normal">In his recent book <i>Me++ The Cyborg
Self and the Networked City,</i> William J. Mitchell writes about how reliant
we have become on networks and, increasingly, on mobile, wireless access to
these systems of information and support. Through connection to global phone
systems or the Internet, our traditional ways of communication have expanded to
allow easy coverage across the world. </p>

<p class="BlockQuote">I am inseparable from my ever-expanding,
ever-changing networks... Not only are these networks essential for my survival
they also constitute and structure my channels of perception and agency - my
means of knowing and acting on the world. They continuously and inescapably
mediate my entire social, economic, and cultural existence. And they are as
crucial to cognition as my neurons.</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">William J. Mitchell, Me++ (2003)</p>

<p class="normal">Although opinions may vary on the extent
to which one becomes part of such systems, it seems inescapable that wireless
access to many forms of information will become more widely available day by
day. </p>

<p class="normal">Over the last two years at Tate Modern,
we have trialled a system of gallery interpretation which connects handheld
computers to a wireless network and provides multimedia information,
communication and access to database-stored texts. Although by no means the
interpretive staple at museums and galleries, similar forms of interpretation
are emerging with increasing regularity. This paper will explain our reasons
for embarking on such pilot projects, will describe the most recent Multimedia
Tour programme that has taken place in the gallery, and will explore approaches
towards developing content that are effective in this medium.</p>

<h1>Mobile Gallery Learning</h1>

<p class="normal">Many of our visitors take part in
low-tech, object-based gallery activities which are used to add to people&#39;s
learning experience as they make their way around the space, the key always
being to make sure that visitors&#39; attention is focused on the artworkather than
solely on the game they are playing. We know that people enjoy such means of
interpretation, and we have moved some way towards defining pedagogies or
methodologies which inform these learning resources. For example, at Tate
Modern we have researched the kinds of game strategies that work to help
families engage more closely with art on display, and as a result we produce
activities such as card games or matching games which families can borrow to
use when they visit the gallery. In our schools programme we have developed carefully
thought-out teaching methods which are learner-centred and involve the use of
activities and the handling of materials to encourage students to actively
engage with art.</p>

<p class="BlockQuote">The games give you a challenge. We
wouldn&#39;t have stopped without the games.</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Visitor comment on self-directed
family activities at Tate Modern</p>

<p class="normal">When we have been developing the
multimedia tours at Tate Modern, we have often thought about the learning
strategies employed in such mobile games, and how they could be adapted for a
mobile multimedia platform. Indeed, the new research initiatives into mobile
learning often express concern that study in this area should be focused on
just digital initiatives; school children, for example have always revised for
exams on the bus, and learning in museums has always been a mobile experience
(MOBIlearn project, <a href="http://www.mobilearn.org/download/results/guidelines.pdf" target="_blank">www.mobilearn.org/download/results/guidelines.pdf</a>)</p>

<p class="normal">Over the last two years we have been
researching visitors&#39; responses to low-tech gallery activities and other forms
of gallery interpretation and to our handheld multimedia tours, and have made
links between these areas of programming. While the multimedia tours draw on
the research that has been done on these other forms of gallery interpretation,
its use of new technologies does demand that we uncover some new strategies to
bring into play when developing content, and we are also beginning to discover
what some of these strategies might be.</p>

<p class="normal">It is a very particular experience that visitors will have as they walk through the gallery with a network-linked mobile
device - different even from using a multimedia resource in a gallery kiosk.
Using a mobile device in the gallery means that visitors must negotiate their
way around the space and around other visitors, while at the same time looking
at artworks and absorbing various media -a complex task, but one which visitors
have approached with relish.</p>

<h1>Tate Modern Principles of Interpretation</h1>

<p class="normal">Since Tate Modern opened in 2000, the interpretation
programme has developed a core set of principles which inform all kinds of
interpretation activity we carry out in the gallery. The Multimedia Tours
fulfill many of these key ideas and, from the gallery&#39;s agenda, can provide a
good system for gallery interpretation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interpretation is at the heart of the gallery&#39;s
    mission.</li>
  <li>Works of art do not have self-evident meanings. </li>
  <li>We believe that works of art have a capacity for multiple
    readings and that interpretation should make visitors aware of the subjectivity
    of any interpretive text. </li>
  <li>Interpretation embraces a willingness to experiment with new
    ideas.</li>
  <li>We recognise the validity of diverse audience responses to works
    of art.</li>
  <li>Interpretation should incorporate a wide spectrum of voices and
    opinions from inside and outside the institution.</li>
  <li>Visitors are encouraged to link unfamiliar
    artworks with their everyday experience.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Art galleries provide a space for a
diverse range of learning experiences to take place, from the gaining of
knowledge and acquisition of new skills to the emotional encounter with an
artwork. Our role as gallery educators and curators is to find ways to encourage
and nurture these experiences, and our hope is that the multimedia tours play a
part towards doing this.</p>

<h1>Multimedia Tour Programme 2003-04</h1>

<p class="normal">Following up our first successful pilot
project in the summer of 2002, we have embarked on a second trial of handheld
tours in 2003 and 04. Both phases of the programme have been sponsored
by Bloomberg.</p>

<p class="normal">Phase Two introduces three new types of tour: a Multimedia
Highlights Tour designed to appeal to the 16-25 age group, a British Sign
Language Tour designed for deaf people, and a Collections Tour that provides
different levels of digital information about all artworks in the Collections
displays. </p>

<p class="normal">The Multimedia Highlights Tour is specifically designed
for the 16-25 age group which responded particularly positively to the first
phase of the trials held in summer 2002. It focuses on 19 artworks in the Still
Life/Object/Real Life and Landscape/Matter/Environment displays. Bringing
together audio, video, image and text as well as interactive features such as
games and communication between visitors, this tour extends the content we were
able to provide the year previously. Content is designed to be stored on a
central server and is accessed through an 802.11b wireless network which has
been installed in the gallery for the purposes of this project; alternatively,
the content can be stored locally on the PDAs and the network used only for
bookmarking and peer-to-peer applications in addition to general tour
management and security.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="wilson_fig1.jpg" alt="Tate Tour Screen Shot" width="196" height="302"/></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 1: Home page screen</p>

<p class="normal">The interactive map provides a way of navigating through
the gallery space, as does the <b>select work</b> option. The jukebox plays
music which relates to works on display and <b>Tate txt</b> is a messaging
function between individual PDAs. <b>Gallery info</b> provides information
about other membership details, gallery events etc., as well as picture
credits.</p>

<p class="normal">In this pilot we wanted to develop interactive features,
one of which is the texting function. This allows visitors to send their views
on artworks to other people taking the tour. Visitors are also encouraged to
take part in opinion polls in front of selected works - such as voting on their
first impressions of the Rothko room - and are able to track the percentages of
other visitors who agree or disagree. Another feature is the facility to play
music from a jukebox through their headphones, and play games such as <b>Exquisite
Bodies</b> which was invented by the Surrealist artists, and involves visitors
taking turns to piece together an imaginary creature from different body parts,
without knowing what the previous contributions have been. </p>

<p class="caption"></p>
<p class="caption"><img src="wilson_fig2.jpg" alt="Game screen shot"/>
    </p>
  

<p class="caption">Figure 2: Surrealist game </p>

<p class="normal">We are also trialing a new digital British Sign Language
version in the second phase of the Multimedia Tour programme. This tour plays
video footage of an interpreter signing information about selected works in the
Collection displays. The aim of this trial is to develop a tour that will give
British Sign Language users the opportunity to take their own personal tour of
the Collection. </p>

<p class="caption"><img src="wilson_fig3.jpg" alt="Guide signing in BSL"/></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 3: BSL tour</p>

<p class="normal">The third tour is the Collections Tour, which allows
visitors to access textual information about all of the 300-plus works in the
Collection displays. It is linked to Tate&#39;s centralised information management
system and brings a wealth of additional information into the gallery spaces
for the first time. </p>

<h1>Developing a Handheld Tour</h1>

<p class="normal">The three tours have been developed in
association with Antenna Audio, who have much experience in providing audio
tours for museums, galleries and other cultural organisations, and are
increasingly creating mobile multimedia solutions to fit with their clients&#39;
requirements.</p>

<p class="normal">The Multimedia Highlights tour at Tate
Modern launched in mid-October 2003. It took a period of approximately six
months to develop from brainstorming the first ideas to allowing visitors to
use the completed tour in the gallery. Tate Modern interpretation staff worked
with a creative and technical team from Antenna Audio to develop content ideas
and approaches that would make full use of the possible technical applications
offered by the wireless system. We also worked with an advisory group of young
people of a similar age to our target audience. </p>

<p class="normal">Much time was taken up securing image and
audio rights and sourcing image prints or digital files. A script went through
several drafts; then story boards were created for the programming team from
Antenna to work from when putting together the digital content. The interface
was tested with visitors, as were sections of the tour; however, this is one
area which could have been extended had we had more time. Again, we needed to
leave more time for implementing technical systems and for testing the handheld
devices with the wireless network. The network was set up particularly for this
project by Tate Modern&#39;s Information Systems team and Antenna Audio, and there
were some teething problems which occurred due to the complex nature of
information systems and security necessary in a large organisation.</p>

<p class="normal">Distribution desk staff were trained, and
then the Multimedia Highlights tour was ready to launch to the public. The BSL
Tour followed during November 2003, and the Collections Tour is currently being
refined to try out with the public during March-May 2004.</p>

<h1>Evaluation </h1>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p class="normal">Every visitor who has used one of the
multimedia tours has been asked to fill in a questionnaire which asks a range
of demographic questions as well as about their experience of the project. </p>

<p class="normal">An independent professional evaluator,
Susie Fisher, carried out qualitative research on the Highlights Tour and the
BSL Tour during December 2003. Her evaluation consisted of three focus groups,
one of which looked exclusively at the BSL tour, and three accompanied gallery
visits where visitors using a PDAs were accompanied through the gallery as they
used the Highlights Tour. Both users and non-users were included in the sample
(the non-users were asked to try out the tour but wouldn&#39;t have chosen to do it
otherwise).</p>

<p class="normal">A PhD student has made a smaller study of
visitors using the Highlights Tour.</p>

<p class="normal">We also carried out a full evaluation of
the first pilot multimedia tour we produced in 2002, and we have drawn on that
when creating the new tours (Tellis and Proctor, 2003; Susie Fisher, 2003).</p>

<h2>General results</h2>

<p class="normal">Between 14 October 2003 and 15 February
2004 (a period of 4 months), 1,569 visitors returned questionnaires about the
multimedia tours, so we can infer from this figure that this is the minimum
number of visitors who have taken part in the tour programme. </p>

<p class="normal">The average amount of time spent with the
Highlights Tour was 70 minutes. Results confirmed that 87% of the people who
tried the tour thought it had improved their visit to Tate Modern, and 57% felt
they had stayed in the gallery longer than they would have if they hadn&#39;t taken
the tour.</p>

<h2>Successful approaches towards developing content</h2>

<p class="normal">Lessons learned from the first pilot
multimedia tour we produced in 2002 were that we should adopt a consistent
approach towards the layers of content offered throughout the tour experience.
Our first multimedia tour was very much a trial project, and we wanted to
experiment with a range of content approaches although we did not have much
idea what visitors would prefer. Each artwork included, therefore, used
different media; such as a video interpretation, audio plus contextual images,
purely text, or an interactive game. The interpretation would begin when the
play button was hit, leaving the visitor with no clue beforehand what might
unfold on the screen and through the headphones. We found that this resulted in
the tour&#39;s being perceived as rather disjointed and that visitors wanted to see
a more coherent approach in these kinds of projects.</p>

<p class="normal">For the current Highlights Tour we have
therefore offered a sub-menu of options which visitors can choose from for each
artwork on the tour.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="wilson_fig4.jpg" alt="Tour Menu"/></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 4: Sub-menu for Cornelia Parker stop</p>

<p class="normal">The menu options are not numbered, so
people can choose them in any order, and indeed each option can stand alone.
The option at the top of each menu however is a short, information-based
introduction to the artwork and artist, and gives a basic level of information
which will help towards further understanding of the work.</p>

<p class="normal">The options below present
information-based or interactive interpretation which makes use of various
media, but which is repeated as visitors progress through the tour, allowing
them to recognise an interpretation strategy that is applied to more than one
artwork.</p>

<p class="normal">Titles of the menu options were devised
to give a clue about the possible content of that section, and to intrigue and
appeal to our target audience of young people. Visitors choose which option to
take according to their mood and what they want from the tour. Those who are
serious and want information about the artwork will choose a commentary-based
option, such as <b>Abstract or not? The artist speaks,</b> while those looking
for a little more fun will choose an interactive game, texting or the juke box.
Often, the tendency for a visitor is to pick the first option, then to flick
through the list of others until they find something that interests them, or a
strategy they have enjoyed before.</p>

<h3>Audio</h3>

<p class="normal">In previous
research on audioguides, we uncovered strong opinions on which kind of voices
are best to use within audio tours. As discussed above, Tate Modern wants to
provide a range of voices and opinions that discuss artworks on display, so
careful thought went into the people chosen to be interviewed and the kinds of
voices that read out scripted parts.</p>

<p class="normal">Information and guidance sections of the
tour are narrated by a consistent voice. We chose a young narrator with a
London accent, who we thought would appeal to our target audience. The
narration has drawn both positive and negative comments, but, on the whole, it appeals to young visitors and sets a good tone.</p>

<p class="normal">The most popular voice to use is the
artist&#39;s - particularly when this is accompanied by an on-screen visual. We
have used film clips of artists Cornelia Parker and Mark Dion discussing their
work on display, as well as an archive recording of Jackson Pollock
energetically dripping paint onto a canvas, accompanied by his own voice-over
elaborating on his ideas and technique. </p>

<p class="normal">Visitors welcome the input of a range of
commentators, either well-known or not, from different professions and
backgrounds. The Highlights Tour includes audio opinions from characters such
as an army bomb expert and a marine biologist, commenting on Cornelia Parker&#39;s
artwork of a blown-up shed, and Damien Hirst&#39;s work that shows exotic shells now
devoid of the animals that once lived there. It also shows vox-pop interviews
with gallery visitors who discuss Rothko&#39;s <i>Seagram Murals. </i></p>

<p class="normal">The visitors&#39; own voices become apparent
through interactive features such as opinion polls and texting, discussed later.
Young people in particular want more of this; they want to feel empowered to
have their own opinions about works of art and not to be merely spoon-fed
prepared information.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>

<p class="normal">The <b>juke box</b> option provides
visitors with two ways in to hearing music that relates to particular works.
They can choose either to start with the music and then find the work, or to
start with the artwork and then listen to related music. The jukebox is seen by
our visitors as interesting and fun, but they don&#39;t want music to be an
unrelated soundtrack; it must have a connection to the art on display. </p>

<p class="BlockQuote">The Juke Box, there are songs which are associated with
art. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re expecting. After hearing the songs, you are
curious to check out the art.</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Visitor comment</p>

<h3>Image</h3>

<p class="normal">Audio commentary accompanied by visual
images is a highly popular strategy for engaging visitors with artworks
included in the tour. Most visitors wanted us to continue using this kind of
approach, and indeed to have more of it. In <b>content</b> sections, regarding
works such as T<i>he Four Seasons</i> by Cy Twombly, we composed a combined
audio and image piece which both zoomed in on details of the work as they were
discussed and provided a range of contextual images relating to the work and
what might have inspired it. A key point learned here is that visitors need to
be told when to look down at the screen; otherwise, they complain of missing
visual interpretive material. We also gave them pointers as to when to look
back at the work, to remind them not to view the PDA screen as a television
programme, but instead as a gallery interpretation tool where the focus is
always the artwork.</p>

<p class="normal">Zooming in to on-screen details is a
successful tactic employed to help people quickly locate a particular detail of
an artwork. (For a deeper discussion of approaches to documentary cinematic
techniques, see Zancanaro et al. Using Cinematic Techniques in a Multimedia Museum
Guide, paper from <i>Museums and the Web 2003</i>.)</p>

<p class="normal">Complex artworks can be successfully
decoded by providing an interactive interface which we titled <b>Touch and
Listen</b>. This approach was used to interpret Joseph Beuys <i>Lightning with
Stag in its Glare,</i> Cornelia Parker&#39;s <i>Cold, Dark, Matter: An Exploded
View</i>, and Kurt Schwitters&#39; <i>Picture of Spatial Growths - Picture with Two
Small Dogs</i>. Each work is reproduced on screen, with various elements
highlighted. When visitors touch a highlighted area, that detail appears larger
on screen, and an audio section about it begins. This allows visitors to choose
which parts of the work they want to hear more about and also gives them a
physical interactive experience with the PDA device.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="wilson_fig5.jpg" alt="Tour Screen Shot - touch and listen"/></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 5: &#39;Touch and listen&#39; screen for
Cornelia Parker</p>

<h3>Video</h3>

<p class="normal">In the first pilot multimedia tour at
Tate Modern, we were concerned that the use of video clips would draw visitors&#39;
attention to the PDA screen at the expense of the artwork, and we found that
visitors worried about this too. During this second multimedia tour programme,
visitors have been positive about the video clips used, as long as they are
short and directly related to what they are looking at in the gallery space. In
particular, video which reveals the creative production of an artwork can be
profoundly revealing:</p>

<p class="BlockQuote">The video is really interesting, Pollock, Jack the Dripper.
You could see how he did it and he was talking to me. </p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Visitor comment</p>

<p class="normal">Other video clips feature artists talking about their
work, and are equally popular, as mentioned above.</p>

<h3>Games</h3>

<p class="normal">We included two interactive games in the Highlights Tour,
as well as two sets of opinion polls where visitors were asked a question such
as &#39;Is this art?&#39; and then saw how others had responded to the same question.
This was successful in getting people to think about the question that had been
asked and then encouraging them to think about both sides of an argument as
they could instantly compare their answers to what other visitors thought. A
lesson was learned here from the first pilot project where we found visitors
were frustrated by not being able to see other people&#39;s answers to the opinion
poll included in that tour.</p>

<p class="normal">The games relate to &#39;<i>Hyena Stomp&#39;</i> by
Frank Stella, and <i>Lobster Telephone</i> by Salvador Dalì. If they are
successful, games reveal an insight about the work through having the visitors
doing something similar themselves. The colour and line game, exploring <i>Hyena
Stomp</i>, does this by showing the complexity of the composition as well as
challenging the visitor to make personal creative judgements. The Dalì <i>Exquisite
Bodies</i> game is not seen to relate as closely to the work. On the whole,
visitors appreciate the games and see them primarily as something light-hearted
and fun, and perhaps involving a degree of thought. We need to do more research
into the learning outcomes of such interactives, as gaming aspects to an
interpretation programme can encourage people to learn without their
necessarily realizing they are doing this. We do know, however, that visitors
want more games and more interactives, and like a balance between such
approaches and those that are more information-based.</p>

<p class="normal">Development time spent on interactive games needs to be
increased, and we need to test the games at various stages during this process.
Non-digital familygames take us around six months from the first brainstorming
sessions to final versions, and go through a continuous process of refinement
and adaption. There is a concern that games accessed on a handheld
interpretation tour can be seen as slightly cursory add-ons which are there
just for a bit of fun for visitors: however, their learning and entertainment
potential is much greater than this.</p>

<h2>Some Problematic Areas</h2>

<h3>Choice of work</h3>

<p class="normal">The current multimedia Highlights Tour
directs people to look at particular works, and essentially curates a new
selection of artworks to be viewed by the visitor in the broader context of the
collections displays. We have had some feedback which suggests visitors would
like to have more choice about which works to look at, as they are concerned
that by following the tour in its entirety they are missing works they would
otherwise be interested in. This is a problem that arises with any selective
gallery guide, but which can perhaps be resolved by marketing a range of tours
on different, clearly-outlined themes or subjects. Our Highlights Tour may not
be placed clearly enough as something which contains <b>highlights</b> and
people may expect a more comprehensive experience.</p>

<p class="normal">The database-driven Collections Tour,
which we are currently testing and which links to the Tate collections
information system, would also resolve this problem, allowing visitors to
choose the works they would like to look at and to view text information
available in the collections database on their PDA. However, the young visitors
from our focus group samples would be likely to find text-based content dull
after the multimedia content they have experienced on the Highlights tour. </p>

<p class="normal">In contrast, many visitors, particularly
those who are not experienced in visiting galleries, are thankful for a device
which guides them through the displays and gives them a focus in an otherwise
fairly unmediated space.</p>

<p class="BlockQuote">Informative, entertaining and fascinating and gives out
more intensity (given that I am not a professional and tend to get distracted
when I wander without a guide). Good idea!</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Visitor comment</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p class="normal">There are currently two ways visitors can
locate works included in the multimedia Highlights Tour: using an interactive
map which highlights rooms that contain an included artwork, or spotting a
special multimedia tour symbol and number printed on wall labels next to the
artworks. Visitors can touch the relevant area of the map to reach the
interpretive material for the work they&#39;ve chosen, or they can go into a key
pad to input manually the number they&#39;ve spotted on the gallery wall.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="wilson_fig6.jpg" alt="Tour Screen Shot -- Gallery Map"/></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 6: Interactive gallery map</p>

<p class="normal">Currently, there are several problems
with the tour navigation and for visitors matching up themselves, the PDA
screen and an artwork. The wall symbols are small and hard to spot, but it is
difficult to resolve this problem as the aesthetics of the gallery space would
be compromised by a large symbol, potentially distracting from the artwork. If
visitors are randomly walking through the gallery, it is difficult for them to
locate where they are on the on-screen gallery map. The obvious solution to
this problem is to include positioning software in the system, and we have
plans to do this for the Collections Tour we are currently developing.</p>

<p class="BlockQuote">It was confusing. I didn&#39;t know which place I should go.
There&#39;s no numbering to the rooms.</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Visitor comment</p>

<p class="BlockQuote">It will be very nice to have a virtual tour. The camera
would lead you in and takes you to the work of art, guiding you.</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Visitor comment</p>

<p class="normal">The result of the current problematic
navigation is that visitors tend to look at either artworks that are in the
first rooms they enter, or works that they can easily find. They feel that this
slightly random process means they don&#39;t have a chance to choose the artworks
they are most interested in, and suggest we include a screen of images of
artworks included in the tour so they can pick what they would like to look at
this way.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>

<h4>Peer-to-peer </h4>

<p class="normal">One of the home page options is called <b>Tate
Txt</b>, and provides an opportunity for visitors to communicate with one
another through a form of text messaging. This peer-to-peer application is made
possible through the wireless network. One of Tate Modern&#39;s main interpretation
principles is to encourage visitors to talk about art and to equip them with
ideas which enable them to hold carefully-considered opinions (see the
Interpretation Principles section above). We were aware of the solitary nature
of interpretation tools such as audio guides and wanted to experiment with a
system which enabled visitors to share their thoughts and ideas. After much
debate, we decided to implement a messaging system which used preset lists of
phases that could be chosen and combined to make comments about artworks or
other more general issues, often in a quirky and amusing way. We didn&#39;t include
an on-screen keyboard or other means of free texting as we were concerned that
visitors wouldn&#39;t use it to talk about artworks or would send inappropriate
messages to one another. In hindsight, we think this may have been the wrong
choice; responses have told us people feel very limited by the preset phrases
and want to be able to text freely as they are used to doing with their mobile
phones. </p>

<p class="caption"><img src="wilson_fig7.jpg" alt="Tour Screen Shot - Tate text"/></p>

<p class="caption">Figure 7: Tate Txt</p>

<p class="normal">In the UK, <b>texting</b> (or SMS) is
very popular, and young people in particular have made this system of
communication their own, creating a type of condensed new language. The system
our multimedia tours offer is not seen as texting in this sense. A solution may
be to call our system of communication by a different name, as <b>Tate Txt</b>
has set up an expectation with our visitors that the end activity does not
fulfil. To describe the activity as a kind of word game may be truer to its
nature.</p>

<p class="normal">Slightly more people took part in the
multimedia tour as part of a group or couple (48%), than did on their own
(40%). We know that visitors often want to communicate with one another as
they&#39;re taking part in the multimedia tour, and we are keen to continue to find
ways to make this more possible. Visitors have commented that they find
headphones awkward as they essentially cut them off from their companion and
are difficult to take on and off. Single ear pieces may be a more satisfactory
solution. Susie Fisher&#39;s research also shows that it is hard for visitors to
co-ordinate their menu choices with one another and hence to progress through
the tour at the same pace. An interesting project designed to get around this
problem of isolation while using a handheld was trialled at Filoli, a historic
house in California. Here, visitors were able to &#39;eavesdrop&#39; on the information
being accessed by other visitors&#39; PDAs, thus allowing them to interact more
successfully with accompanying friends (Woodruff et al. MW2002).</p>

<h2>Technical issues</h2>

<p class="normal">Visitors have many fewer technical
problems using the multimedia tour system than they did during the first pilot
project we ran in 2002. Many of the technical flaws have been ironed out by new
developments with the technology, such as better PDAs being available and
different adjustments to the software applications used. It is not the intent
of this paper to provide a detailed technical analysis, but a brief description
of the system used follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We use 25 Toshiba e750 PDAs, and are currently trying out
    the new Toshiba e800s, which
    are functioning even better than the e750s. Improvements from 2002 have been
    that the PDAs have faster processors, and include integrated wireless cards
    which improve system stability, responsiveness and ergonomics. The PDA is also
    robust enough for us to dispense with a protective case.</li>
  <li>Content is programmed in Macromedia Flash, version 6, and
    triggered via a Flash projector file to run in the Antenna Media Player(TM) rather
    than requiring a Flash plug-in to Internet Explorer. The operating system used
    is PocketPC 2003. </li>
  <li>Antenna Audio have developed the Antenna Multimedia System(TM) which
    resides client and server-side and operates with the Proximity Platform(TM) from
    PanGo Networks. </li>
  <li>The wireless system is standard 802.11b, running on a virtual
    LAN.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">The server computer is a Toshiba Magnia
300 Series(TM).</p>

<p class="normal">Thanks to Toshiba&#39;s hardware sponsorship
of the project, we&#39;ve had the opportunity to work closely with them to resolve
network continuity issues across such a large area and complex installation as
we have at Tate Modern. The e800, Toshiba&#39;s latest released PDA, has
dramatically improved network stability and device responsiveness, and will
allow us to develop Tate&#39;s multimedia tour possibilities even further in
future.</p>

<p class="normal">We are finding out. however, to what
extent technical faults disrupt our visitors and take away from the learning
experience. Even small delays while an image appears on screen or a video
downloads from the server draw visitors&#39; attention away from the art experience
and back to the technology. Ideally we want them to forget about the
functioning of the system and to fully engage with the art.</p>

<p class="normal">The interface design of handheld tours
presents an interesting dichotomy: we need a design which draws attention away
from itself, yet is intuitive and clear from the start. We therefore kept a
clear and uncluttered screen, using icons people would already recognise from
the Web. Responses to the interface have been overwhelmingly positive, with
just a few complaints about the volume control being difficult to adjust and
the back button not working all the time in the first release of the tour
(these problems have now been fixed).</p>

<h2>British Sign Language Tour</h2>

<p class="normal">Deaf visitors responded very similarly to hearing visitors
on most of the key content issues: they wanted to hear from artists themselves,
appreciated the video clips, enjoyed getting involved in the opinion polls,
found it hard to orientate themselves in the gallery. We had included mainly
similar content in the sign language version of the tour, but had to completely
rewrite the script to fit with British Sign Language, which has a different
conceptual and linguistic structure to English. The script was written in
English but in such a way that a signer could easily translate phrases and
meanings into BSL. </p>

<p class="normal">However, some issues were more salient for deaf people.
The narrator of the BSL Tour is a Tate Modern curator, a hearing person who
uses BSL fluently. Several deaf people questioned this choice of narrator,
feeling that it would be more appropriate to employ a deaf person for this
task. However, deaf people were overwhelming positive about the provision of such
tours in galleries and were delighted to see interpretation in their first
language rather than having to rely on interpretation in English or wait for a
monthly BSL-interpreted gallery tour. The BSL Tour is available whenever they
visit, something much appreciated, and not before its time!</p>

<p class="BlockQuote">It&#39;s great to have a BSL Tour
Model. I would come here in my own time and study all around the gallery.
Thank you.</p>

<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Visitor comment</p>

<p class="normal">As deaf people and students of Art, some of our deaf
visitors were more serious about content, wanting more informational content
and less play. They were very sensitive to fluctuations in speed and rhythm.
For example, if a weak PDA processor or a network connectivity problem slows
down the signing on screen, the BSL user can experience real comprehension
difficulties. The BSL Tour relies on video much more heavily than the
Highlights Tour does, so any slowness in playing the content is a real
irritation.</p>

<h2>Collections Tour</h2>

<p class="normal">The Collections Tour draws content from
Tate&#39;s centralised collection information system, meaning we can choose which
existing database information we would like to have accessed on the PDAs in the
gallery. Currently this is mainly text information, but as more content is
added to Tate&#39;s collections information system, this can also be available in
the gallery. The Collections Tour has the potential to act as a framework for a
whole range of customised tours, with relevant content sitting on the database
and being accessed according to the visitor&#39;s age, interests or previous
choices.</p>

<p class="normal">This tour is currently being developed,
and visitors&#39; responses to it will be explored and recorded. We found out from
our latest research that some visitors would like to access interpretation on
all works on display rather than following a more limited highlights tour;
access to collections database information could go some way to fulfilling this
request. Visitors have also commented that they&#39;d like to be able to key in an
artist&#39;s name to find out where those works are on display and get more information
about them - another task that the Collections Tour could carry out. </p>

<p class="normal">The wireless network was extended for
this project to cover all of floors 3 and 5: Tate Modern&#39;s entire permanent
collection display. Information from the collection information system is
stored in a central database on the tour system&#39;s server and delivered
wirelessly to visitors in the gallery. Visitors key in search terms, such as an
artist&#39;s name, through a telephone-style keypad. The system then searches the
database and reports its results as a text list on the PDA screen. From here,
the visitor can choose to read a range of texts on the artist or artwork,
including wall labels, catalogue entries and short essays.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p class="normal">Our research points to the recommendation
that Tate Modern continue with its programme of multimedia tours as, generally,
they are working well and are very much appreciated by our visitors. This
mobile means of interpretation adds to visitors&#39; learning experience in the
gallery and enhances their engagement with artworks on display. Fitting in with
many of our interpretation principles, the multimedia tours extend the
gallery&#39;s interpretation agenda as well as the visitors&#39; experience, and take
our pluralistic, activity-based approach towards learning to a new digital
dimension.</p>
