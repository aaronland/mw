<p class="PaperTitle">Northern Journeys: Design Infrastructure
</p>
<p class="Author">Roger M. Topp and Terry P. Dickey, University of Alaska Museum, 
    Fairbanks, Alaska, USA</p>
  <p class="URL"><a href="http://www.uaf.edu/museum" target="_blank">http://www.uaf.edu/museum</a></p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
   <p class="AbstractText">This paper explores the successes of the UA Museum <i>Northern 
    Journeys</i> Project, an on-line curriculum resource, at the end of Phase  
    II (infrastructure) and the initiatives underway for Phase III (library database 
    integration of museum object tours).<i> Northern Journeys</i> incorporates 
    the interpretation of museum objects into classroom activities to support 
    Alaskan and national content standards. <i>Northern Journeys’</i> intention 
    is to teach about Alaska through the disciplines of art, culture, history, 
    and science. Museum objects offer multiple perspectives for these disciplines 
    and so encourage users to learn more about differing local values and traditions 
    as they develop a sense of who they are within the community. For subjects 
    such as Alaskan History, the Museum objects and their interpretations represent 
    important examples of historical events, creating a visual textbook. Developed 
    in partnership with elementary school teachers and produced with the aid of 
    rural educators and cultural institutions, <i>Northern Journeys</i> embodies 
    the practice of community curation.</p>
   <p class="AbstractText">The project has been funded through the National Endowment 
    for the Humanities and the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications 
    and Information Administration’s Technology Opportunities Program.</p>
   <p class="AbstractText">Keywords: museum, school, resource, art, teacher, classroom, infrastructure,

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p class="normal">Museums across the country are using emerging technologies 
    to expand accessibility to their collections. Many are collaborating with 
    public schools to make their collections accessible directly to students through 
    the Internet. Some are working with educational entities to develop on-line 
    curricula. Other museums are sharing museum resources across diverse electronic 
    means to expand their range of regional influence (Larson and Meadow, 2003). 
    Collaborations like these have numerous benefits for all partners, from making 
    a wealth of information available to students of all ages to cultivating lifetime 
    patrons.</p>
  <p class="normal">Along these lines, the University of Alaska Museum (UAM) 
    has coupled technology-based activities and resources with collaborative relationships 
    to meet growing educational outreach needs. Drawing on a wide range of expertise, 
    including museum curators, University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) faculty, public 
    school teachers, and Alaskan Native organizations throughout Alaska, UAM’s 
    education department has developed activities and resources for use in classrooms, 
    home schools  on-line, and  the museum gallery to provide students and adults 
    with virtual access to UAM’s collections. Of greatest interest to current 
    operations and future goals is the means by which UAM has experimented with and 
    implemented various electronic content formats across alternative technologies 
    – and the impact these technologies have on rural Alaska.</p>
  <p class="normal">The scope, audience, content, and technological format 
    of these activities and resources must vary greatly from program to program. 
    This diversity of formats has aided in significantly expanding UAM’s role 
    as a learning laboratory, evaluating new technology approaches to museum 
    education for future larger scale implementation. After a major renovation 
    and construction project, UAM will open its new Art Gallery, Education Center, 
    and Auditorium in May of 2005 (See Figure 1) For UAM planners, this opening 
    represents a turning point in how this museum can integrate program development 
    with community outreach and curation. With multiple internal and external 
    access paths to UAM’s collections, leading to a museum without walls, our 
    programs both benefit and are bolstered by this access. </p>

    Center to open in 2005.</p>
  <h1>Northern Journeys</h1>
  <p class="normal"><i>Northern Journeys</i> begins with the museum object, 
    introducing the work or artifact, layering information about the Maker, Location 
    and Geography, curriculum theme, and closing with an Activity that has both 
    on-line and physical components. While the objects are accessed on-line, 
    each sequence of information layers, or tour, is linear. The versatility of 
    each Journey is detailed in a Teacher Resource Guide and enhanced by multimedia 
    support materials, including activities, animation, interactive maps, and 
    student and museum produced videos. </p>
  <p class="normal">The technological approach to <i>Northern Journeys</i> 
    is </p>
  <ol>
    <li>to 
        approach students in the classroom as a group; </li>
    <li>to 
        reach the growing population of home school and rural students throughout 
        Alaska;</li>
    <li>to 
        encourage teachers to create journeys that integrate directly with their lesson 
        plans and that promote the perspectives of rural Alaska. </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="normal">To attain these goals, this project has employed large 
    screen plasma displays, handheld devices, and tablet computers at the UA Museum, 
    digital projection in a Fairbanks Elementary School, laptops at the Fairbanks 
    Borough Library, and traveling video kits for distribution throughout rural 
    Alaska. The array of learning venues and technological tools provides the 
    appropriate flexibility to address the diverse needs of student and teacher 
    audiences.</p>
  <h1>Technology and Geography</h1>
  <p class="normal">In the year 2000, UAM visitor and school tour programs 
    saw limited employment for emerging technologies such as laptop computers, 
    DVD players, and digital projectors. UAM had launched its first audio-guide 
    tour and relied upon the ubiquitous slide projector for all visual presentations, 
    whether guest lectures, school tour programs, or ticketed shows. Fairbanks 
    school-district classrooms were in the initial stages of computer lab installations, 
    and Denali Elementary School was without student access to computers in the 
    classroom. The Fairbanks North Star Borough Library was just concluding a 
    major renovation and expansion; however, only two computers were designated 
    as Internet capable. Neither the UAM nor rural Alaska museums had considered 
    the possibility of on-line digital video resources as a means to merge the 
    interpretation of museum objects with audio/video references to local fauna, 
    landscapes, and people, especially not what could be filmed and edited in-village 
    by museum staff, teachers, and students.</p>
  <p class="normal">For the last four years, <i>Northern Journeys</i> has promoted 
    these technologies, and each year has seen an ever-expanding bubble of acceptance 
    as the Project and partners have approached new technologies from two parallel 
    vantages: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>what we know we can do, and</li>
    <li>this looks a little a risky, but we will try anyway.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="normal"> The ability of the project to run both the sensible and 
    the chancy but achievable initiatives under the same needs-based umbrella 
    has not only guaranteed baseline success, but also enabled great leaps in 
    technology development without risking the Project whole. What may almost 
    have been routine for a larger museum and in principle doable was a great 
    leap for a small museum in Fairbanks, Alaska, not only in terms of technology 
    infrastructure, but also in terms of the serious geographical and cultural 
    differences we were attempting to bridge.</p>
  <p class="normal">The University of Alaska Museum is dedicated to the preservation 
    and interpretation of the cultural and natural history heritage of Alaska, 
    the Circumpolar North, and the Northern Pacific Rim. It is the only accredited 
    museum serving as a repository for scientific collections in the State of 
    Alaska, and while it is located centrally in Fairbanks, its mission is to 
    serve a geographically and culturally diverse area twice the size of Texas 
    and possessing more coastline that the remainder of the United States. While 
    the greater portion of the state’s half million population lives in Fairbanks 
    and Anchorage, those teachers, students, and life-long learners in greatest 
    need of informal educational support live in the most rural of rural America 
    with no roads and no broadband. Travel is by plane and boat, and perhaps snow 
    machine in winter.</p>
  <p class="normal">Geography is Alaska’s greatest obstacle to community learning 
    (figure 2). It is often cost prohibitive to wire phones, much less fiber optics 
    for today’s standard of Internet use. Equally important is people’s impetus 
    for living in rural Alaska. These people have a very strong sense of their 
    locale and very strong feelings against becoming just another urban American. 
    However, this does not mean that they want to be isolated. People in Nome 
    and Kotzebue listen to Fairbanks’ public radio for their news. They are avid 
    readers of newspapers. It is often the traffic of ideas <i>out</i> of the 
    rural villages and the schools that is stalled or inhibited by both technology 
    and partnership infrastructures. Any project that seeks to benefit education 
    in rural Alaska must enable both live and asynchronous linking and bring these 
    people’s perspectives to bear on the art that we attribute to them. To UAM’s 
    advantage, its staff has had extensive experience in collaborating with small 
    museums statewide in the areas of interpretation, exhibit design, and museum-school 
    partnerships. This enables the project to improve on existing educational 
    approaches in two fundamental ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>By moving away from teaching <b>about </b>a culture to 
        teaching <b>within</b> a culture by using museum objects (Alaska Native Knowledge 
        Network, 1999)</li>
    <li>By incorporating interdisciplinary interpretation and community 
        curation through the inclusion of relevant tribal elders, humanists, scientists, 
        historians, poets, and the visual artists of Alaska’s communities. <i>Journeys</i> follows Alaska Standards for Culturally Responsive Schools (Assembly of Native 
        Educator Associations, 1998)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Historic Evolution. Part 1: The Pilot </h2>
  <p class="normal">The <i>Northern 
    Journeys</i> pilot, <em>Dogs in Alaska</em>, is an on-line resource incorporating the 
    interpretation of museum objects into classroom activities that support Alaska 
    Content Standards &lt;http://www.uaf.edu/museum/journeys&gt;. With funding 
    from the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities, Schools for a New Millennium 
    program, the pilot developed elementary-level supplementary curriculum materials 
    that teachers and students access through the Internet. The material is structured 
    as object-rooted narratives that discuss the Artwork, the Artist, Location 
    and Geography, Art in Life, and conclude with a hands-on or computer interactive 
    activity (See Figure 3). It is important to stress that the pilot covers a 
    limited breadth of content, as its goal was to derive an on-line format and 
    a working relationship with teachers and students, to the create exhaustive 
    resources. The format and resources on the implemented site were designed 
    to meet Alaska’s performance standards in math and language arts and suit 
    specific curriculum goals for the teachers involved. </p>

  <p class="caption">Figure 3. The Home Page for Northern Journeys Dogs in Alaska. <a href="http://www.uaf.edu/museum/journeys/dogs/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.uaf.edu/museum/journeys/dogs/index.html</a></p>
  <p class="normal">The Project’s 
    genesis stemmed from Fairbanks teachers’ expressed concern for a lack of Alaskan 
    examples when teaching the humanities. Most examples in school textbooks are 
    from the lower 48 states. When Alaskan, the topics appear so generalized that 
    local students have difficulty connecting to them. By using museum objects 
    to connect students to their community elders, to the landscapes, to the plants 
    and animals, and to the contemporary social, political, and economic environments, 
    the project strives to help students develop a sense of local responsibility 
    and ownership as involved members in their community. Because Fairbanks and 
    Alaska rural students come from culturally diverse backgrounds and are often 
    separated from family between villages or off in the lower-48 states, the 
    project emphasizes an appreciation for individual experiences and backgrounds 
    while highlighting the similarities, not the differences, between cultures. 
</p>
  <p class="normal">These issues 
    were tackled through the community-curated process of creating a modest pilot 
    Web site with a limited number of museum objects. The understanding of all 
    was that these interpretations could contribute to student learning in the 
    humanities and the sciences as well as the arts - and as integral elements 
    to the school curriculum. For example, the object narrative for the painting, 
    Mt. McKinley, by Sydney Laurence, would include pertinent information about 
    the artist, why art historians revere his paintings, and how his romanticized 
    painting style helped to shape our wonder at this mountain. Additional interpretive 
    levels for Mt. McKinley could include the following themes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>how the Alaska Range 
        was formed by plate tectonics, volcanoes, earthquakes, and glaciers </li>
    <li>a current political 
        discussion of the place name of Mt. McKinley vs. Denali, the cultural icon 
        used by Interior Athabascans for this mountain</li>
    <li> a description of 
        the alpine tundra flora and fauna </li>
    <li>oral history interviews, 
        including segments from Athabascan elders, cartographers, and mountain climbers. </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal">Woven through 
    the straightforward art and art process interpretation would be viewpoints 
    on alternative subjects present in the art. In the case of the pilot, the 
    topic of Dogs in Alaska was chosen to unify the selected art objects due to 
    its attraction for grades 2-4 students.</p>
  <h2>Historic Evolution. Part 2: Infrastructure Project</h2>
  <p class="normal"><i>Northern Journeys</i> II, with funding from the U.S. 
    Department of Commerce National Telecommunications and Information Administration 
    Technology Opportunities Program, significantly expanded <i>Northern Journeys</i> 
    by providing the technological infrastructure and equipment needed to support 
    better Statewide access and community curation of museum object interpretation 
    and education. Specific access and contribution sites were targeted at Denali 
    Elementary School in Fairbanks, at the Fairbanks North Star Borough Public 
    Library, and in UAM’s Galleries. Mobile contribution sites were created as 
    traveling video camera and editing kits for rural Alaska schools and museums. 
    Through this phase of <i>Northern Journeys</i>, UAM hoped to meet its educational 
    mission to promote life-long learning for Alaska by enlarging its programming 
    in three areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> UAM wanted to expand use of its objects in the classroom, increasing 
        student appreciation and knowledge of Alaskan history, science, and culture.

    <li>As the only museum within the University of Alaska system, UAM 
        has a mandate to bring teaching and learning resources, including interpretation 
        of museum objects, to a statewide audience. Recognizing that the Internet 
        provides a wonderful opportunity to bring resources statewide, we decided 
        that various types of technology combined with Web-based content would make 
        it possible for us to share objects, their interpretation, and inquiry-based 
        learning.</li>
    <li>Most important, we sought to create new links and partnerships 
        with communities throughout the State of Alaska to expand on-line content 
        and interpretation. Through these partnerships, we hoped to work with the

        personnel, students, and artists, to interpret community art and create on-line 
        exhibitions that better reflect AlaskaMost important, we sought to create new links and partnerships

        for life-long learning and community ownership.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Expected Outcomes</h4>
  <p class="normal">With these three goals in mind, Northern Journeys targeted 
    several key objectives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To increase student involvement in art discussions across disciplines. </li>
    <li>To increase student knowledge of local history, science, and 
      culture. </li>
    <li>
      To increase Museum visitation by Fairbanks elementary school 
      students and life long learners. We hoped to increase the local community’s 
      regular use of UAM’s physical resources.</li>
    <li>To increase involvement by home school and rural students and 
      teachers in Museum activities. </li>
    <li>To increase for underserved Alaska Native communities, both 
      urban and rural, access to their cultural patrimony housed at the University 
      of Alaska Museum. </li>
    <li>To foster new relationships between community agencies independent 
      of UAM.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal"><b>Project Venues: The UA Museum (Mobile and Kiosk)</b></p>
  <p class="normal">The Project 
    provided UAM with a server, wireless hub, three laptop computers, three tablets, 
    and five handheld pocket computers (figure 4). Additionally, prior projects 
    enabled the project to take advantage of a test-bed kiosk containing two computer 
    workstations enabling interactivity, a large format multimedia-driven plasma 
    screen, and a DVD driven television screen (figure 5). The kiosk was erected 
    to test education programs and multimedia projects in progress during museum 
    renovations. The platform has extended use and availability for <i>Northern 
    Journeys</i> and now for subsequent projects.</p>

  <p class="caption">Figure 5. UAM’s test bed kiosk with active workstations 
    and passive displays</p>
  <p class="normal">The original 
    project plan called for the use of laptops alone as mobile platforms for museum 
    programming during school tours. Because purchasing was phased over three 
    years to provide for formative evaluation and stepped project implementation, 
    we were able to reassess the technology throughout the Project. We determined 
    that different handheld devices were appropriate for different programs. While 
    the lightest, most portable handhelds were deemed best for general museum 
    visitors, tablet computers were more appropriate for school tour usage due 
    to greater computing and software power, ease of viewing by multiple students, 
    and their touring ability in the hands of a docent. Laptops were most valuable 
    in our education center classroom (until the completion of our museum expansion, 
    the museum’s conference room serves as the Education Center). Where desktop 
    devices are cumbersome in the museum classroom environment, laptops provide 
    mobility to match the changes in seating arrangement required by diverse program 
    topics and limited floor space. Whereas consumer handheld devices, appropriate 
    for use under the supervised rigors of evaluation, are not appropriate for 
    general museum visitors, (due to device complexity, security issues, power 
    charging and damage protection as determined by our research and that of Proctor 
    and Tellis, 2003), our test-bed kiosk has enabled continuous program testing 
    and evaluation over the long term and for the eventual implementation of gallery 
    handhelds. By placing materials potentially designed and constructed for the 
    Museum’s Web site or for handheld implementation on the kiosk, we have been 
    able to conduct a continuous evaluation of programs.</p>
  <h4>Project Venues: Local Elementary School</h4>
  <p class="normal">The project provided Denali Elementary School with ten 
    classroom sites. Each site included an iMac computer, printer, scanner, and 
    digital projector. Additionally, a digital camera and two digital camcorders 
    were obtained for rotation through the ten classrooms. The Fairbanks North 
    Star School District purchased both an onsite server and a microwave link 
    to upgrade the broadband connectivity from the School District hub to the 
    elementary school. The digital camera and digital camcorders supplemented 
    similar units purchased by the school the previous year. While the schools 
    current cameras were distributed by the school library to all teachers at 
    the school, the <i>Northern Journeys</i> cameras remained with one or more 
    class sites in the early phases of the project and then entered the library 
    distribution system as more and more teachers became involved. Immediate additions 
    to the site equipment included USB floppy drives and Firewire hard-drives 
    for the iMac computers. The floppy drives were designed to help with backward 
    compatibility with the schools older digital camera and were only required 
    for the three sites defined as the first phase of the project. The hard-drives 
    were attached to the class sites of the teachers who involved themselves to 
    a greater extent in video editing projects.</p>
  <p class="normal">The digital projectors proved to be the innovative core 
    of the infrastructure project in the classrooms, setting the <i>Northern Journeys</i> 
    sites apart from the computer bank or computer lab concept where the emphasis 
    is more on individual learning behind individual screens, or the standard 
    smart classroom approach where the computer workstation is built into a lectern 
    for the teacher/professor. With the computer and projector on a mobile cart, 
    the station served the dual purpose of classroom workstation and classroom 
    focal point, enabling both ‘in-your-seat’ and ‘at-the-board’ operation for 
    teacher, student, and whole-class collaborative learning (figures 6,7). For 
    the viewing of museum object images as stand-alone or pre- and post-visit 
    lessons, we find this flavor of group collaboration best replicates the experiences 
    we value for students in the museum gallery. “With regard to the acceptance 
    of human-computer interfaces, immersion represents one of the most important 
    methods for attracting young visitors into museum exhibitions” (Sauer et al. 
    2003).</p>

  <p class="normal"><b>Project Venues: Local Library</b></p>
  <p class="normal">The Fairbanks North Star Borough (FNSB) Library is two 
    blocks from Denali Elementary, across the street from Ryan Middle School and 
    Lathrop High-school where Denali students go for their secondary education. 
    Teachers and school district administrators indicated that this proximity 
    made the Library - Denali site locations optimal for student use in class 
    and after class. The Library, as a public site, was also deemed central to 
    home school student use local to Fairbanks. The project provided the FNSB 
    Library with a server, wireless hub, 6 laptop computers, and a projector learning 
    cart, to mirror the learning environments available at the school, the museum 
    (in the absence of the gallery objects), and users in the home.</p>
  <p class="normal">The <i>Northern Journeys</i> library server was conceived 
    as a caching engine for the museum Web site content to facilitate download 
    speed and uphold Borough defined limits on Internet access in the children’s 
    area of the FNSB Library. Rather than getting immersed in controversy over 
    filtering, <i>Northern Journeys</i> enabled the FNSB Library to cache and 
    internally re-serve UAM’s educational content without the use of filters. 
    The server also distributes specific museum CD-ROM originated content that 
    cannot currently be placed on the Web partially because of distribution restrictions 
    and partially because of the magnitude of the audio and video content and 
    the funding required to convert this content into a Web-ready format. The 
    FNSB Library-served content is delivered through wireless hubs to the Project 
    laptops, which are available at the library distribution desk for checkout 
    by any card-carrying library patron.</p>
  <h4>Project Venues: Rural Alaska</h4>
  <p class="normal">In addition to these site-based technologies, the project 
    provided for the development and assemblage of three traveling camcorder kits. 
    Each kit included a laptop computer, digital video camera, and accessories 
    including tripod, batteries, cables, and on and off-camera lighting (figure 
    8). These kits were lent to the Pratt Museum in Homer, the Sheldon Jackson 
    Museum and the Southeast Alaska Indian Cultural Center in Sitka, and the St. 
    Paul High School and Tanadgusix Native Corporation’s museum initiative in 
    St. Paul. Along with the kits, the Project provided on-site training for their 
    use.</p>
  <p class="normal">As these rural 
    Alaska Museums are even smaller than UAM, their fulltime staff numbering 2-5 
    employees, it was critically important that the project not only included 
    on-site training and distance support for the kits in use, but also timed 
    this training with otherwise on-going projects directed by these partners. 
    The kits had to solve immediate partner needs. In no other way could partner 
    time have been found for training or implementation of <i>Northern Journeys</i>. 
    All kit activities for <i>Northern Journeys</i> adhered to certain guidelines:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All material collected would be released for free non-commercial 
      use by UAM, the partnering museum for all viable electronic formats (Web, 
      CD-ROM, Gallery Kiosks/Displays) with appropriate Project, Institution and 
      Artist/Elder/Student credit.</li>
    <li>All footage would be clone-copied for UAM, the partner museum, 
      and the University of Alaska Fairbanks Rasmuson Library archives.</li>
    <li>All recorded material would be clone-copied digitally at UAM 
      where the project provided for the appropriate equipment.</li>
    <li>
      The Project kits would be returned to UAM at the Project’s expense 
      during the Project period or at the partner’s expense if an extension of equipment 
      use was desired and approved by UAM.</li>
    <li>One individual at each of the partnering sites would be responsible 
      for locally managing both storage and use of the equipment, as well as distributing 
      equipment to local users such as schools and other sub-partners like studio 
      artists and cultural organizations.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="caption"><img src="topp_fig08.jpg" alt="Camera and editing equipment" width="400" height="300"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 8. A Northern Journeys traveling camera and editing 
    kit</p>
  <p class="normal">It was clear from the outset that <i>Northern Journeys’</i> 
    rural partnership efforts required a flexibility that could meet the diverse 
    needs of urban and rural organizations and communities while at the same time 
    serving the Project as a whole. The traveling camcorder kits were originally 
    conceived as units to be placed in the hands of artists in order to film themselves 
    in the studio, both creating and talking about their art. The Project Team 
    very quickly shied from this approach as being self-limiting in terms of the 
    numbers of artists we could reach during the period of the grant, the longevity 
    of such a collaboration, and the lack of a local management plan for distribution 
    and equipment security. We turned quickly to the more obvious approach of 
    working directly with rural organizations that already had cultivated relationships 
    with local artists, Elders, and school groups. This approach was not considered 
    initially due to failing to identify on previous projects the appropriate 
    incentives for rural partners to invest limited staff time. Fortuitously, 
    five partnering organizations came to our attention during the Project. Three 
    of the partners had immediate needs for the kits and training for projects 
    underway, and two were thinking of building content for the future. As expected, 
    these last two saw less concrete results from the collaboration.</p>
  <p class="normal">The Sheldon Jackson Museum (SJM) in Sitka, Alaska, was 
    in the process of re-applying for a grant to film and edit their ongoing summer 
    artist residency program in 2003. The application of one of our rural kits 
    enabled them not only to attempt the project they had planned, but also to 
    evaluate the equipment lent to them prior to making their own purchases. Subsequently, 
    they received funds to continue this project in 2004. <i>Northern Journeys</i> 
    provided the equipment and the training for 2 members of the SJM staff and 
    filmed 3 artists in studio while the trainer was in Sitka. After training, 
    the SJM staff filmed 7 more artists both working and speaking to their work 
    (figure 9). In addition to providing the raw digital footage to UAM and University 
    archives, the Sheldon Jackson edited the footage for the Alaska State Museum 
    Web site and SJM school kits. UAM edited its own version of the footage for 
    the <i>Northern Journeys</i> Web site (figure 10). The <i>Northern Journeys</i> 
    trainer, while in Sitka, also made contact with the South East Alaska Indian 
    Cultural Center where several artists maintain studio residence. On-site filming 
    and training was completed during the visit; however, distribution of equipment 
    to this sub-partner was not feasible due to the priority requirements of SJM’s 
    summer residencies, and did not result in furthering content creation for 
    the project beyond the initial filming.</p>

  <h2>Content Limitations</h2>
  <p class="normal">As <i>Northern Journeys</i> was conceived under an infrastructure 
    grant and a proposed content creation grant was not funded through other sources, 
    large-scale content creation could not be completed within the duration of 
    the project. Content for use in development, evaluation, and implementation 
    was obtained through three means:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Through donated teacher in-service time at Denali Elementary, 
      the project produced the Sea Migrations unit of <i>Northern Journeys </i>based 
      on art object narratives and following the Dogs in Alaska model.</li>
    <li>Through artist, community, and student videography and interviews 
      at <i>Northern Journeys’</i> rural partnering organizations and schools, the 
      project launched the <i>Northern Journeys</i> Multimedia Resource site.</li>
    <li>Through prior multimedia projects and on-going exhibitions, 
      the project was able to repurpose on-line and CD-ROM-based resources, including 
      UAM’s <i>Unity in the Arts</i>, <i>The Photographic Works of Michio Hoshino</i>, <i>Forced to Leave</i>, and <i>A Sense of Place</i>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Principles for On-line <i>Journeys</i> Content</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-linear hub access to finite, linear, narrative journeys 
      (lessons)</li>
    <li>Straightforward journey-only navigation in main page area. Museum 
      site-wide navigation kept in footer</li>
    <li>State map used to identify object with place of origin, and 
      glossary to root terminology</li>
    <li>Style to be fun but not distracting - no excessive audio/visual 
      toys</li>
    <li>Straightforward icon use to reflect gallery icons and icons 
      across programs</li>
    <li>Introduction of a low number of journeys per theme (5 maximum), 
      to 
  <ol>
    <li>provide 
        limited but varied choices,</li>
    <li>clearly 
            communicate required and optional time investments to the user, and</li>
    <li> put 
            less strain on staff/collaborator workload and budget</li>
  </ol>
  </li><li>
    Design to require little teacher supervision in all activities, 
    and next to none for the narrative pages. </li>
  <li>
    Activities to promote thinking and comprehension of issue complexity 
    by building in design elements that keep students engaged mentally and pace 
    the user’s experience. The variety of design elements should reflect the diversity 
    of learning styles expressed in Kolb’s model (Kolb et al. 1999).</li>
  <li>
    Activities to meet Alaska Content Standards for the appropriate 
    grades, not only for individual activities (such as how long an activity takes 
    to complete), but for group activities; by looking at how different activities 
    address different subject areas, to promote different ways of learning, and 
    alternate between working alone and in groups.</li>
  <li>
    Northern Journeys to be as responsible for taking students away 
    from the Internet computer tool as for bringing them to it. For this reason, 
    many activities are designed as paper and scissors activities, e.g. building 
    a model bidarka (Aleut kayak) from a printed template (figure 11). Stuer et 
    al. 2001 expressed the importance of similar constructive components within 
    digital media.</li>

  <h1>Approaches to Evaluation Research</h1>
  <p class="normal">The evaluation of <i>Northern Journeys </i>was designed 
    to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Examine how technology can best be used in schools, at UAM, 
      and at the Public Library to increase student use of museum objects and ultimately 
      provide them with a greater sense of place  or greater understanding of the 
      history, science, and culture of their communities</li>
    <li> Examine how technology can best be used by UAM to share its 
      objects and their interpretation with a statewide audience</li>
    <li> Identify successful ways for the Museum to create new links 
      and partnerships with communities throughout the State of Alaska and to repeat 
      the results of these new collaborations</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal">The evaluation 
    included both process and outcome components. The process evaluation focused 
    on key implementation issues and Project activities, assessing whether each 
    step outlined in the original grant proposal had been completed, modified, 
    or not completed. The outcome evaluation focused on how well the project met 
    its objectives and other unanticipated outcomes. Evaluation tools included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Key Informant 
        Interviews</li>
    <li>Classroom 
        Observations</li>
    <li>Daily 
        Log of Technology Use</li>
    <li>Parent 
        Questionnaire</li>
    <li>Student 
        Work</li>
    <li>Kiosk 
        Electronic Survey and Tracking</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Reasons for a Successful Partnership</h1>
  <p class="normal">The project evaluation identified several reasons for the 
    highly successful collaboration with Denali Elementary School:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Northern Journeys</i> was built on the successful relationship 
      between UAM and Denali Elementary during the on-site server and microwave 
      link.</li>
    <li>Several Denali teachers, along with the principal, were involved 
      from the planning stages.</li>
    <li>The teachers felt a kindred spirit with UAM; they have benefited 
      from the docent program for years; they have been involved with UAM staff 
      via staff workshops, and they have shared resources and exhibits.</li>
    <li>Denali’s staff were committed to the idea of making UAM resources 
      available to students and staff, and administration allowed for use of teacher 
      in-service time for participation in the project.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal">A student in Robin Davis’ 2<sup>nd</sup> grade class came 
    to UAM in the early stages of the Project and exclaimed, “That’s my painting!” 
    Robin’s class was involved in initial student interpretations of artworks 
    for the Dogs in Alaska unit of <i>Northern Journeys</i>. The students were 
    integral in the creation of the Unit’s structure, content, and culminating 
    activities. The students involved in the creation of the <i>Northern Journeys’ 
    </i>pilot felt ownership of the objects on ‘their’ Web site and in the gallery. 
    This obvious benefit for students as builders as well as users pushed us where 
    possible towards greater Fairbanks and rural student content creation in the 
    Infrastructure Project. The traveling kits were conceived as creation tools 
    as well as access tools. The on-line activities for the Sea Migrations unit 
    were written with the aid of student classes in Fairbanks. The Multimedia 
    Resource page was built in collaboration with our rural partners, including 
    students at St. Paul High School in the Pribilof Islands (figures 12, 13). 
    Museum and school camcorders were used by school classes as part of museum 
    visits to create student movies, including one in which fourth grade students 
    filmed themselves interpreting objects in the Museum galleries; the technology 
    allowed for multiple student groups to operate simultaneously to capture footage 
    over the course of a two-hour visit (figure 14). The class’s <i>Northern Journeys</i> 
    classroom site allowed them to review and edit the footage into a movie to 
    share with other classes at the school and over the district’s Web site.</p>

  <h1>Conclusions</h1>
  <p class="normal">Students involved in the <i>Northern Journeys</i> project 
    at Denali Elementary School were exposed to new resources not seen before 
    in classrooms, resources heretofore accessible only through time limited visits 
    to UAM’s galleries.  Through technology granted by the DOC NTIA Technology 
    Opportunities Program, supplementary curriculum units created through a partnership 
    between teachers and museum staff, and resources contributed by partnering 
    organizations in other parts of Alaska, students became more familiar with 
    not only museum resources, but also the Alaska culture, history, and science 
    the objects represent. While the students learned about the role of dog mushing 
    in Alaska, the migration patterns of salmon, and the history of Alaska Native 
    people during World War II, both museum and school gained better methods of 
    not only incorporating museum object interpretation into the school curriculum, 
    but also meshing on-line and other electronic tools with the all-important 
    museum visit.</p>
  <p class="normal">Beyond the value museum objects imparted to student education, 
    the technology resources provided by the project have led to academic gains 
    in the areas of language arts, research skills, and technology skills. Teachers 
    were quick to report on the improvements technology has made in their ability 
    to teach and administer their classes (Larson and Meadow, 2003). Apart from 
    the obvious benefits of having a classroom computer to store and recall documents 
    easily, and keep in e-mail contact with parents, the technology kept a whole 
    class engaged in a single group activity. Too often, classroom technology 
    has kept fingers busy at the keyboard while at the same time isolating students 
    behind individual screens. The Computer-driven digital projector is the new 
    overhead projector, with on-line access to rich cultural and scientific collections 
    and interpretation. The implementation of these devices has been a clear breakthrough 
    in both Museum and School District thinking in Fairbanks.</p>
  <p class="normal">Teacher acceptance of technology and the technology training 
    were greatly benefited by a phased-in approach to the equipment installation, 
    with the minor drawback/advantage that each phase of equipment purchases resulted 
    in more and more powerful hardware and software for each new round of teachers. 
    The phased-in installation enabled the teachers most enthusiastic for the 
    project to involve themselves first, followed by teachers with fluency with 
    the technology, and then teachers who were inspired by the project as it developed; 
    they in many instances had already borrowed equipment to use on a week-to-week 
    basis. Teachers immersed in other projects had the opportunity of expressing 
    interest but postponed their involvement. The chief difficulty with this approach 
    appeared to be an over-reliance on teacher-to-teacher communications and teacher 
    technology credit hours for basic training needs, rather than budgeting for 
    a formal training schedule. Most teachers involved with this project proved 
    to be pro-active in their approach to getting technology training. Several 
    took courses or used personal time to become more familiar with the technology. 
    Several also reported learning the technology along with their students in 
    order to make the process a learning opportunity for everyone.</p>
  <p class="normal">The relationships developed between UAM and museums in 
    Homer, Sitka, and St. Paul have succeeded in the overall goal of increasing 
    UAM’s two-way content flow through partnerships. These organizations and UAM 
    act as a principal conduit of information between Fairbanks schools and the 
    community, and those in rural Alaska. The lessons learned through these partnerships 
    increase in value as UAM seeks to collaborate with other communities.</p>
  <p class="normal"><i>Northern Journeys</i> has been an important starting 
    point for UAM as it incorporates technology into its interpretive and educational 
    programming. We note especially that the ever-increasing adoption of technology 
    is viewed as far more viable in UAM’s near future due to the project’s role 
    in allowing museum planners to witness first hand how such technology can 
    fulfill on-line, school tour, and gallery visitor needs.</p>
  <h1>Our Next Step</h1>
  <p class="normal">Building on these successes, UAM began implementing the 
    <i>Arts Resource Community Residencies</i> (<i>ARCR</i>) Project in August, 
    2003, the <i>A Sense of Alaska</i> (<i>ASOA</i>) project in September, 2003, 
    and the <i>Museum Objects Library Interface Network</i> (<i>MOLINET</i>) in 
    October, 2003 &lt;http://www.molinet.org&gt;. These three projects will significantly 
    expand the work that began with <i>Northern Journeys</i>. <i>ARCR</i> provides 
    funds for the enhancement and recording of artists in residence at the University 
    of Alaska, Fairbanks; <i>ASOA</i> enables the continuation of community curation 
    and information sharing partnerships with rural Alaskan organizations; and 
    <i>MoliNet</i> redefines how schools and life-long learners can access museum 
    objects on-line through inclusion in core library catalogues. Together the 
    projects are designed to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Integrate museum object tours into the Rasmuson Library database, <i>ViLDA</i> Web portal, and Borough Library catalogue</li>
    <li>Use the Museum’s community curation model to enhance resource 
      creation and curation by teachers, students, artists, and Elders within partner 
      village schools</li>
    <li>Collaborate with partner educators in the planning, development, 
      and pilot use of museum objects and community resources to guide an improved 
      understanding of the sciences, arts, and humanities via a technology network</li>
    <li>Work with the statewide library consortium and rural partners 
      to ensure Internet portals through which statewide schools and home schools 
      can access the Museum</li>
  </ul>
