      <p class="PaperTitle">Beyond On-line Collections: Putting Objects to Work</p>
  <p class="Author">Brad Johnson, Second Story Interactive Studios, USA</p>
  <p class="URL"><a href="http://www.secondstory.com/" target="_blank">http://www.secondstory.com</a></p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
   <p class="AbstractText">Many great and small museum collections around the world 
    are on-line, accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime. This really is a wonderful 
    thing. Now what? This paper is a look at two exciting projects – The Smithsonian 
    National Museum of American History’s exhibition <i>America on the Move</i> 
    and  the Peabody Essex Museum’s ARTscape –  that go beyond the inquiry-retrieval 
    model of an on-line collection as an end in itself, to one that provides the 
    foundation for dynamic, extensible and diverse interactive offerings. While 
    it is possible to add objects to  and edit metadata in a collection database, 
    most interpretive presentations are fixed programs that are difficult to modify. 
    What if the same kind of browser-based administrative tools that are used 
    to easily update collections could be modified to enable museum staff to curate, 
    annotate, paginate and publish custom collections? Imagine curated collections, 
    new stories, tours, on-line exhibitions, and media-rich presentations easily 
    being added without involving designers, programmers or developers! When the 
    dynamic collection and the storytelling tools are integrated, audiences benefit 
    even more than the storytellers. Visitors can even create their own exhibits.</p>
  <p class="keywords">Keywords: on-line collections, enhanced browsing, dynamic 
    storytelling, storytelling tools</p>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p class="normal">As museums continue to make their collections accessible 
    on-line, objects are liberated from the hidden recesses of storage, archives 
    and unvisited gallery walls; audiences are empowered to make new discoveries 
    and connections, and our collective cultural heritage is enriched. On-line 
    collections offer an unmediated alternative to exhibitions and interpreted 
    interactive presentations staged by museums.  On-line visitors can directly 
    access what they want, how they want, when they want. Visitors can select 
    from a multitude of different pathways and a variety of perspectives; every 
    image that appears in the site itself becomes a hub linking to every other 
    instance (and hence context, story and perspective) of an object. Individuals 
    can forge new, personalized paths through the site, finding new connections 
    and meaning in the objects to reflect their own interests, experiences and 
    curiosities This interconnected, cross-pollinated approach provides many intersections 
    for interactive exploration to any subject matter.</p>
  <p class="normal">At its most basic level, an on-line collection is a tool 
    that helps individuals <i>find what they are looking for</i>. Fixed between 
    the hundreds, thousands or millions of objects in a collection and the hundreds, 
    thousands or millions of visitors who might access them is an interface: the 
    gatekeeper-arbiter of ‘who gets what’ and ‘how they get it’. The first responsibility 
    of a collections interface is to provide the clearest and most direct connection 
    between visitors and objects. Evolving from a library science model where 
    results are retrieved from focused, surgical inquiries, many conventional 
    collections interfaces are excellent for experts who know what they want, 
    but fall short for broader audiences that don&#39;t. </p>
  <p class="normal">The first step in extending the utility and value and of 
    an on-line collection is to help audiences discover <i>what they weren’t looking 
    for</i>. Interfaces that go beyond traditional inquiry-retrieval paradigms 
    facilitating unsolicited discovery and meaningful browsing serve wider audiences 
    and more diverse user experiences. When vague curiosities are rewarded as 
    effectively as focused inquiries, an on-line collection can migrate beyond 
    the mere ‘tool’ and start to be thought of as an experience.</p>
  <p class="normal">With the Peabody Essex Museum’s ARTscape, physical objects 
    in a gallery connect to a unique on-line collection tool. Visitors to the 
    museum bookmark objects with an audio wand, then retrieve the breadcrumbs 
    of their visit on-line. Through an intuitive interface that suggests relationships 
    between objects and ideas, and an extensive keywording system applied to all 
    objects, a ‘fuzzy logic’ approach helps users discover connections between 
    concepts, art and objects. Rather than generating a limited set of search 
    results, this approach helps forge experiences as unique and personalized 
    as each individual’s imagination. Focused searches or vague curiosities are 
    equally rewarded with new discoveries that can themselves be bookmarked and 
    shared with others.</p>
  <p class="normal">The Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History exhibition 
    <i>America on the Move</i> looks at how transportation technology shaped American 
    culture. The Web site’s dynamic collection database is the foundation for 
    the entire site: from the on-line exhibition to the thematic story-tours, 
    every screen in the site connects to and builds on the collection. Curators 
    can continue to add objects and presentations, ensuring that the collection 
    and the interpretive message work tomorrow as well as today.</p>
  <h1>Discovering and Sharing New Connections </h1>
  <h2>ARTscape</h2>
  <p class="normal">The Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, MA, the oldest museum 
    under continuous operation in the U.S., has over 2.4 million works of art, 
    architecture and culture in its diverse collections. The redesign of the museum’s 
    site coincided with a transformation of the museum’s physical form and a new 
    approach to the interpretation of art: one that creates a richer experience 
    for visitors by bringing art, architecture and culture together in new ways. 
    Central to this mission was realizing the new vision on-line with an innovative 
    experience that helped visitors forge personalized journeys through the collection 
    and  yielded unexpected discoveries. Towards this end ARTscape was created, 
    a tool that helps generate experiences as unique and personalized as each 
    visitor’s imagination. </p>
  <p class="normal">Launched in June 2003 with a record for every object on view, 
    ARTscape (http://www.pem.org/artscape) 
    directed visitors to commence their experience  either by browsing particular 
    collections (like <i>American Decorative Art</i>) or by searching for keywords 
    (keywords can be searched across all collections or within a particular collection). 
    Searching and retrieving is just the start for ARTscape, however; this experience 
    is about the process of discovery, revealing connections, and creating your 
    own ‘collections.’ Once an initial query is made, a spark ignites the process 
    by revealing thumbnails in a results strip along the bottom of the interface. 
    Visitors can quickly scroll through hundreds of results, scanning the cropped 
    thumbnail representations and rolling over them for titles. When something 
    is of interest, it can be clicked and loaded in the center of the interface 
    where the title, date, creator, origin, medium and donor are revealed. </p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig1.jpg" alt="ARTscape start screen"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 1: Visitors begin their experience with ARTscape 
    by selecting a collection to browse or by searching for keywords within a 
    collection. If visitors log in they can save their experiences or retrieve 
    previous visits.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig2.jpg" alt="Thumnails for the collection below the data on the selected work" width="400" height="323"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 2: Thumbnails from the selected collection appear 
    in the yellow ‘results’ zone of the interface. This illustration shows one 
    of the thumbnails selected and loaded into the stage.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig3.jpg" alt="Full data nd links for selected object"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 3: This record screen provides interpretive information 
    and links to additional media for the object, including a narrated audio segment 
    from the audio tour.</p>
  <p class="normal">With a result selected, a user can elect to view the record 
    where interpretive text and additional media are accessible. When users <b>Show 
    Connections</b>, they have the ability to find more objects in the collection 
    that are in some way related to the current record. This facilitates the rapid 
    discovery of related items according to the fields a user enables the connections 
    to be made in. For example, a visitor could elect to show connections for 
    items with the same origin, the same medium, or both. Rather than relying 
    on a fixed classification system, a predefined taxonomy or set cataloguing 
    conventions, an extensive Google-like keywording system is applied to every 
    record incorporating both concrete and abstract criteria. This <b>fuzzy logic</b> 
    approach results in interesting and unexpected connections between concepts. 
    Rather than generating a limited set of search results such as those typically 
    made through traditional on-line collections, ARTscape helps forge experiences 
    as unique and personalized as each individual’s imagination. </p>
  <p class="normal">The fruits of every journey through the collection can be 
    saved, shared and connected with visits to the physical museum. Across the 
    top of the ARTscape interface is a persistent zone where visitors can ‘bookmark’ 
    objects that they want to include in their personal collections. Results are 
    selected and records are bookmarked, thumbnails of which are visible in the 
    <b>Bookmarks.</b> If visitors are logged in, their sets of bookmarks can be 
    saved for later retrieval, or e-mailed to friends, students or colleagues. 
    This feature helps curators assemble exhibitions, teachers gather artwork 
    for lessons, and visitors revisit their trips to the museum.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig4.jpg" alt="Building a personal collection" width="400" height="323"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 4: When objects are bookmarked, they are added to 
    the visitor’s personal collection which can be saved.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig5.jpg" alt="Related Objects" width="400" height="323"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 5: Related objects can be discovered through the 
    Show Connections feature which can filter connections 
    based on title, date, creator, origin, medium or donor. As more objects are 
    discovered, the visitor’s bookmarks grow.</p>
  <h2>Bridging the Onsite and On-line Experience</h2>
  <p class="normal">As part of their admission to the museum, every visitor receives 
    an Acoustiguide audio wand to use throughout the galleries. In addition to 
    the traditional audio segments available for some works on view, these modified 
    wands have an additional ARTscape button. Every single object on view has 
    a five-digit ARTscape number clearly visible on its respective interpretive 
    panel. Throughout a visit, audiences can enter the ARTscape number of any 
    object of interest to them - hence bookmarking them - and their entries are 
    recorded in the wand. When the wands are docked in any of the kiosks deployed 
    throughout the galleries, visitors can interact with ARTscape where every 
    object they bookmarked in the museum will be represented. Before leaving the 
    museum, visitors can enter their e-mail address in a kiosk and an e-mail is 
    sent to them with a link to ARTscape. When this link is retrieved on the home 
    computer, the visitor can log into ARTscape and see a personal bookmarked 
    path through the museum!</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig6.jpg" alt="Bookmarking a painting"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 6: A visitor “bookmarks” a painting by entering its 
    ARTscape number into the modified Acoustiguide wand. </p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig7.jpg" alt="Finding out more at the kiosk"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 7: At one of the kiosks deployed throughout the museum 
    a visitor places the wand in a docking port and can learn more about the works 
    earlier bookmarked.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig8.jpg" alt="Emailing selected information home"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 8: Before leaving the museum, the visitor can enter 
    an e-mail address in the kiosk with the wand docked and the bookmarks of 
    the visit will be e-mailed to them.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig9.jpg" alt="Checking back in on-line"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 9: At home, the visitors can retrace their steps, 
    revisit their bookmarks, share their visit or find new connections to related 
    objects in the ARTscape on-line collection.</p>
  <p class="normal">These features transform an on-line collection into a powerful 
    tool enabling museum visitors to revisit, extend and enhance their experiences 
    on-line. A ‘breadcrumb trail’ is saved of their physical tour so more in-depth 
    information about bookmarked objects can be accessed at any time. Through 
    the <b>Show connections</b> fuzzy logic functionality, visitors can discover 
    other objects that are similar or related to their bookmarks, such that each 
    bookmarked object on view becomes a launching point for new journeys through 
    the collection.  As more records are added to the database over time, visitors 
    figuratively weave between the exhibition walls and the storage stacks where 
    every work of art - on-view or off-view - is an equal stepping stone in a 
    unique personalized pathway.  </p>
  <h2>Personalization, Playlists and the MP3 Paradigm</h2>
  <p class="normal">The recent evolution of music formats, distribution, collection 
    and playback has striking similarities to the ARTscape experience and plenty 
    of characteristics that are inspirational in developing new approaches to 
    on-line collections. Any MP3 playback application is essentially a front-end 
    organization tool and player for a collection of MP3 files. Music is ‘ripped’ 
    from a CD, and information is downloaded from remote databases containing 
    artist, disc title, track titles and other information and embedded in the 
    music files. Once an MP3 collection is amassed, music is organized according 
    to genres, artists, composers, albums, and tracks. Music can be easily found 
    and played, all without the tedious time-consuming tasks of finding CDs, inserting 
    them in a player and searching for the song of choice.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig10.jpg" alt="i-Tunes interface"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 10: Apple’s iTunes interface makes organizing collections 
    and creating playlists extremely easy.</p>
  <p class="normal">Just as a disc-jockey assembles a string of songs for a radio 
    show, MP3 applications make it easy to create and share custom playlists. 
    From a pool of MP3s in a collection, users can easily sort, sift and browse 
    tracks, adding any songs in any order to a playlist that can be saved, shared 
    or modified. The same collection of music could be used by several different 
    musicologists to assemble playlists that illustrate different interpretive 
    views. An orchestra’s music director could experiment with different arrangements 
    of work when developing a season’s schedule. Couldn’t we think of a museum 
    exhibition as a kind of playlist that a curator created in much the same way? 
    Couldn’t the shared ARTscape bookmarks of a curator from the Peabody Essex 
    Museum be considered an exhibition playlist? What if an on-line collection 
    could not only enhance the organization and browseability of a collection, 
    but also act as a personalized playlist editor, capable of  publishing on-line 
    exhibitions? That is exactly the concept behind the National Museum of American 
    History’s <i>America on the Move</i> on-line exhibition.</p>
  <h1>On-line Collections-based Storytelling</h1>
  <p class="normal">The administrative tools commonly used to manage content 
    in an on-line collection stand in stark contrast to the tools required to 
    publish interpretive presentations. While it is usually easy to add objects 
    to and edit metadata in a collection database, most interpretive presentations 
    are fixed programs that are difficult to modify. While many exhibition sites 
    provide unmediated access to the objects in an exhibition, that access is 
    most often accessible in a segregated part of the site, often connected but 
    wholly unlike the mediated presentations that interpret the objects. What 
    if the same kind of browser-based administrative tools that are used to easily 
    update collections could be modified to enable museum staff to curate, annotate, 
    paginate and publish custom collections? The flexible, fluid backend of an 
    on-line database can lay the foundation for interpretive presentations that 
    can be modified and expanded over time. Imagine curated collections, new stories, 
    tours, on-line exhibitions, and media-rich presentations easily being added 
    without involving designers, programmers or developers! </p>

    <i>America on the Move</i> (<a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove" target="_blank">http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove</a>) 
    looks at how transportation technology shaped American culture. The Web site’s 
    dynamic collection database is the foundation for the entire site: from the 
    on-line exhibition to the thematic story-tours, every screen in the site connects 
    to and builds on the collection. Curators can continue to add objects <i>and</i> 
    presentations, ensuring that the collection and the interpretive message work 
    tomorrow as well as today. </p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="johnsonFig12.html"><img src="johnson.fig12-t.jpg" alt="Schematic showing objects, collections and themes" width="400" height="292" border="0"/></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig12"></a>Figure 12: Object records in the Collection section bridge 
    different perspectives throughout the site.</p>
  <p class="normal">There are three principal sections of the site: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>in the Exhibition section is the meta narrative that glues together 
      the objects and themes of the site historically and geographically, from 1876 
      to today, from coast to coast. </li>
    <li>in the Collection section, visitors can browse objects based 
      on categories, eras or regions, or perform advanced searches with keywords 
      and additional topics. </li>
    <li>in the Themes section, visitors can explore the side roads of 
      the exhibition where curators have published dozens of annotated stories on 
      a variety of themes. </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal">While it might at first appear that these sections are traditionally 
    segregated, a few clicks through any section reveal their interconnectedness. 
    Every image on every page in the Exhibition section links to the corresponding 
    object record in the Collection section. From here a visitor can discover 
    every other instantiation of that object in the site and see how it is used 
    in other contexts, in the same way an MP3 player might show you every playlist 
    in which a selected song appears. </p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig13.jpg" alt="A collection record for Blue Flag Apple Crate Label"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 13: This collection record provides links to every 
    instance of this record in the site: visitors can see where it fits in the 
    overall Exhibition narrative (‘Delivering the Goods: Watsonville, California, 
    1895—Growing for a Wider Market’), or they can view it in the context of curator 
    contributed stories organized by theme (‘Words on Things—Some thoughts about 
    words on things’; ‘Watsonville’s Commercial Agriculture’; and ‘In Search of 
    the Apple’) </p>
  <p class="normal">As objective, neutral and unbiased as storytellers can hope 
    to be, the editorial decisions they make invariably posit a subjective viewpoint 
    that reflects their worldview, their culture or the age in which they live. 
    Another person, a different group of people or someone in the future would 
    make different selections. A different telling of American transportation 
    history will be more meaningful to a different age, and from the same collection 
    of objects at their disposal, a different perspective could be presented. 
    The objects in a collection are the building blocks of stories: they can appear, 
    reappear, be rearranged, regrouped, and reinterpreted throughout the site 
    in as many ways as there are perspectives or playlists to share. In this site, 
    the same database behind the on-line collection is supporting the Exhibition 
    and Themes interpretive sections so that the objects are not inextricably 
    bound together in a mediated ‘story.’ Every use of every object - be it on 
    a collection record page, the third page of a story about radiator emblems 
    or halfway through the exhibition narrative - is managed by the same database. 
    Every time a new story is created, objects are grouped, annotated and published, 
    and all related records pages are automatically updated. The building blocks 
    of the story are organized by the database, not trapped in the narrative. 
  </p>
  <h2>Turning Content Management Tools into Storytelling Tools</h2>
  <p class="normal">Museum staff, curators and invited experts use browser-based 
    content management tools on an administrative site to edit any record or page 
    of the site. Creating new stories is just as easy as adding an object to the 
    database, with additional flexibility for a high level of customization. Once 
    a new story is named, described and credited, the author decides  which themes 
    are relevant, related stories and links are identified, a custom color scheme 
    is selected, and representative thumbnails are chosen. Then the fun of assembling 
    the content begins. Site administrators can browse the collection and save 
    records to specific lightboxes, and they can have as many unique lightboxes 
    as there are stories they wish to compose. With a pool of objects and any 
    amount of text (some stories are purely playlists while others are more like 
    papers) ready to copy and paste from a text file, the creator can start authoring 
    a page. Pages are comprised of varying amounts of horizontal <b>components</b>: 
    custom containers for headers, text, images, audio and digital video. When 
    a component is added, the author must select from one of 20 different component 
    styles: one big block of text, a block of text and two images with captions, 
    an image, then text, then another image, etc. A new blank component is embedded 
    in the editing page where text can be pasted in and images cropped, placed 
    and captioned, right out of the author’s lightbox. As more components are 
    added to a page, the cumulative page size is totaled so pagination considerations 
    can be made in light of downloadability. At any time the components can be 
    reordered, and edited, and the page previewed. Once all the pages are satisfactory, 
    the story can be published; it is automatically interconnected in the theme 
    finder, related records pages and any related stories pages, all without any 
    designers, programmers or HTML authoring!</p>

  <p class="caption">Figure 14: The diversity of the stories is reflected in 
    the layouts each curator created. Some stories are more academic where captioned 
    images are treated like sidebars to the writing.</p>

  <p class="caption">Figure 15: Other stories are like annotated personal collections.</p>

  <p class="normal">If we care about creating interactive projects that can withstand 
    shifts and changes in technology, why wouldn’t we care about creating projects 
    that can withstand shifting points of view? Museums and cultural institutions 
    would like to think their efforts will be accessible, viewable and of value 
    to visitors in the future. Adhering to industry standards and separating data 
    development from technology development goes a long way towards insuring against 
    technological obsolescence. By developing sites that can accommodate dynamic 
    interpretive presentation generation, investments are as editorially extensible 
    as they are technologically extensible.</p>
  <p class="normal">When the dynamic collection and the storytelling tools are 
    integrated, audiences benefit more than the storytellers. This interconnected, 
    cross-pollinated approach provides many intersections for interactive exploration 
    on any subject matter. Visitors can select from a multitude of different pathways 
    (from mediated to unmediated) and a variety of perspectives (from the ‘official’ 
    museum meta-voice to diverse, alternative viewpoints); every image that appears 
    in the site itself becomes a hub linking to every other instance of an object. 
    Individuals can forge new, personalized paths through the site, finding new 
    connections and meaning in the objects to reflect their own interests, experiences 
    and curiosities.</p>
  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p class="normal">A survey of exhibition and content-related museum sites (as 
    opposed to institutional or promotional sites) from the past several years 
    reveals an exciting landscape of innovation, diversity and ingenuity. Some 
    museum Web sites provide austere library-science-like access to information, 
    while others have documentary film-like storytelling qualities. For some curators, 
    the Web is an opportunity to get out of the way and give visitors free access 
    to all that is hidden in their physical museum; for others, the multimedia 
    possibilities are a way to enhance their controlled presentations and add 
    on even more interpretive accessories. Some sites provide unmediated direct 
    access to their entire collection, while others provide carefully curated 
    presentations. </p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig17.gif" alt="Diagram  shoing dynamic/static, mediade / unmediated environments"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 17: The diagram above plots how dynamic a Web site 
    is on the x-axis where static, fixed presentations are on the left, and dynamic 
    database-driven offerings are on the right. The y-axis plots the degree of 
    intermediation, where the top represents a high degree of curatorial control 
    over the presentation, and the bottom gives users uninhibited control. If 
    one were to plot exhibition and content-related museum sites on the chart, 
    there would be a lot of density in the yellow band: there are many fixed, 
    mediated presentations and many unmediated database-driven offerings. </p>
  <p class="normal">There are great reasons for projects at each extreme of the 
    mediation gamut, but there are very few good reasons for fixed presentations. 
    While static presentations generally make it easier to create rich, compelling 
    and immersive interactive content, this comes at great costs. There is no 
    technological extensibility, no editorial extensibility and very little design 
    flexibility in fixed features. Dynamic features, by contrast, are fluid, flexible 
    and keep the components (content, presentation and technology) transmutable. 
    Over time these features will inherit the same rich, immersive characteristics 
    as fixed presentations.</p>
  <p class="normal">This paper looked at two approaches to expanding the strengths 
    of on-line collections into richer, mediated, storytelling experiences. Objects 
    in collections databases can be more than a query result. They can be put 
    to work as stepping stones in personal journeys. They can be bookmarks from 
    a museum visit. They can be the building blocks of story. When visitors themselves 
    can play a more active role in contributing their ‘playlists’, personal pathways, 
    annotated collections, and stories with these new interactive formats, then 
    we will get a taste of how revolutionary the Web can be. </p>
