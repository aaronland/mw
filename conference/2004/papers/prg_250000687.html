        <p class="PaperTitle">Museum Metadata in a Collaborative Environment: North 
          Carolina ECHO and the North Carolina Museums Council Metadata Working 
          Group</p>
        <p class="Author">Katherine M. Wisser, Duke University, United States</p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
         <p class="AbstractText">The digital environment increases pressures on the 
          museum community to construct unified metadata solutions that are compatible 
          with metadata solutions from other cultural institutions.  This paper 
          discusses the challenges of museum metadata implementation and outlines 
          a strategy devised for the state-wide initiative in North Carolina to 
          create an on-line portal for cultural institution material.  It outlines 
          the prominence of museums in North Carolina&#39;s cultural institutions 
          from survey results, and, through the experiences of a metadata working 
          group, it addresses the issues of museum metadata.  Those issues include 
          the variety of existing collection management systems, metadata diversity, 
          semantics struggles and the problem of the digital divide.  The paper 
          proposes a search and retrieval solution and concludes with a discussion 
          of the advantages and disadvantages of museum metadata in this kind 
          of effort.</p>
        <p class="keywords">Keywords:  Metadata, Museums, Collaboration, Digitization, 
          Collection management systems, Open Archives Initiative OAI </p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1><p>The digital environment has increased expectations 
          for collaboration between diverse cultural institutions.  State and 
          national initiatives are attempting to bring together cultural heritage 
          information in on-line portals that include resources from libraries, 
          archives, historic societies, museums and other cultural heritage institutions.  
          To achieve this, institutions serving a variety of missions and users 
          are coming together to provide standardized information about their 
          diverse resources.  Much of this standardization is made possible by 
          the creation and manipulation of metadata.</p><p>Collaboration in metadata has been a long-term tradition 
          for libraries, as demonstrated by the cooperative cataloging efforts 
          of OCLC and RLIN.  Archives, on the other hand, experienced a long-time 
          resistance to metadata standardization that has been due to the unique 
          nature of the materials.  While archivists conceded that they create 
          finding aids for their collections, they clung to the concept of institutional 
          individuality because those collections had exceptional qualities.  
          In the past few decades, archives have begun to follow the cooperative 
          initiative through such standards as <i>Archives, Personal Papers and 
          Manuscripts </i>and the corresponding MARC AMC format, Encoded Archival 
          Description (EAD), and most recently, the work of United States Task 
          Force on Archival Description (USTARD).  Metadata standards in this 
          environment succeeded because of their recognition of a unified structure 
          while providing flexibility in the creation of valid representation.</p><p>The museum environment faces these same challenges 
          to an even higher degree.  Individual museums use some kind of collection 
          management system.  These systems can be proprietary or home-grown, 
          but they serve the needs of their institutions in both administrative 
          and interpretive functions.  Recognizing the overlying structure of 
          that information to create a common metadata standard that will assist 
          in the sharing of information, though, is only part of the challenge 
          facing museums in today&#39;s collaboration environment.  Not only 
          do museums have to agree within the museum community, but they must 
          also fit in with established metadata systems in order to be included 
          in on-line cultural heritage portals.  In such collaborations museums 
          face a number of challenges to integrating their metadata systems with 
          other systems.  Museums, unlike libraries and archives, have differing 
          missions for their patron-base and correspondingly have different approaches 
          to how they deal with their materials.</p><p>The proliferation of digitization initiatives has 
          expanded the demands on collaboration for inclusiveness.  Cooperative 
          projects such as the On-line Archive of California (OAC) (<a href="http://oac.cdlib.org/" target="_blank">http://oac.cdlib.org/</a>) 
          and the Colorado Digitization Program (CDP) (<a href="http://cdpheritage.org/" target="_blank">http://cdpheritage.org/</a>) 
          have created all-inclusive on-line cultural heritage material access.  
          The Colorado Digitization Program has a </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">vision of creating a virtual collection of these unique 
          resources and special collections, expanding access to information on 
          Colorado&#39;s history, culture, and scientific heritage through digitization 
          (<i>Bishoff, 2000</i>).</p><p> NC ECHO&#39;s outlook is similar to that of CDP 
          in that both projects are attempting to integrate resources through 
          a digital portal.  The CDP is focused more towards the creation of digital 
          objects.  NC ECHO, on the other hand, recognizes that not all institutions 
          are ready or able to create digital objects, but it wants those institutions 
          to be able to include their information as well. NC ECHO hopes to include 
          information regarding non-digitized materials also.  </p><p>A unified museum metadata strategy is the first step 
          to inclusion.  Metadata challenges include the unique qualities of basic 
          descriptive parameters for museum and artifact-based collections, the 
          diversity of software solutions available to museums that discourage 
          standardized formats for expressing metadata about materials, and the 
          emphasis on differing layers of metadata regarding their materials that 
          do not always constitute public information.  These are the kinds of 
          challenges that we have been struggling with in North Carolina, in our 
          state-wide initiative, NC ECHO.  </p><p>This paper will address the efforts of the North 
          Carolina Museums Council (NCMC) metadata working group to confront metadata 
          issues to achieve inclusion within the NC ECHO state-wide portal.  It 
          begins with an understanding of the cultural institution landscape in 
          North Carolina.  It will then discuss the community approach to devise 
          a metadata strategy, including issues of existing collection management 
          systems, metadata diversity and a semantics struggle, the digital divide, 
          and finally it will outline a strategy to follow.  Some information 
          dissemination techniques will be discussed in order to reach the larger 
          North Carolina museum community.  The benefits of a common metadata 
          strategy are discussed in terms of a search and retrieval solution, 
          and the paper concludes with a discussion of the <i>metadata first</i> 
          approach adopted by NC ECHO, and some of the possible advantages and 
          disadvantages of this kind of cultural institution collaboration.</p>
        <h1>The North Carolina Cultural Institution Landscape</h1>
        <p>The overall NC ECHO project vision is to create a 
          portal that provides a single entry point for the citizens of North 
          Carolina to the cultural materials resources of North Carolina&#39;s 
          institutions in order to enhance education, research, and learning.  
          The NC ECHO project includes five distinct but inter-related components:  
        </p>
      <ol class="listwithnumbers">
        <li>
          a comprehensive 
            state-wide needs assessment and survey of all cultural institutions 
            in North Carolina; </li>
        <li>
          site visits 
            to each cultural institution and detailed reports; </li>
        <li>
          a web portal 
            and searchable directory of all cultural institutions; </li>
        <li>
          continuing 
            education programs offering a variety of workshops for institution 
            staff;  </li>
        <li>
          grant programs 
            to facilitate individual and collaborative digitization programs.  
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Through these initiatives, the NC ECHO project encourages 
          cooperation and collaboration among the different types of cultural 
          institutions extant in North Carolina and facilitates as well as encouraging 
          partnerships among institutions of varying levels of technical and professional 
          experience.  The first step that NC ECHO undertook was to conduct a 
          survey of the cultural heritage institutions, including the identification 
          of institutions and an assessment of current digital capabilities and 
          on-line presence.  </p><p>The survey of cultural institutions (projected completion 
          in 2005) serves as a foundation for the state-wide initiatives that 
          constitute NC ECHO.  Data here represent the survey results as of September 
          2003, when over 600 institutions had been contacted.  The results of 
          the survey demonstrate that North Carolina is rich in cultural heritage 
          and the state treasures that heritage.  Material spans from 165 million 
          BCE to the present day.  While most institutions responded that material 
          from the modern era (19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries) 
          form the largest parts of their collections, holdings represent the 
          whole range of human history.  Institutions account for approximately 
          428,546 total linear feet of material, with 8,456,161 art and artifacts, 
          145,517 microfilm reels, 38,855 oversized items, 24,711 motion picture 
          films, 15,787 videotapes, 99,247 audio tapes, and 4,275 computer media 
          items.  This demonstrates not only a wide variety of material but also 
          a wide number of challenges facing the NC ECHO project in providing 
          access to such diverse resources.  </p><p>In addition, there is an active interest among our 
          scholars, researchers and public in the cultural heritage information 
          of North Carolina.  Survey respondents reported a total of 130,728 research 
          requests communicated via postal mail, electronic mail, telephone, and 
          fax, and 7,395,705 visitors, including scholarly researchers (4%), exhibit 
          viewers (86%), and school children (10%).  Appealing to this wide variety 
          of patrons presents many challenges.  North Carolinians are the primary 
          users of cultural institutions in the state, but 59 (17%) of the 324 
          institutions that responded to the question indicated that over half 
          of their users were from outside of the state.  These kinds of demographics 
          place more demand on the virtual access to attract more out-of-state 
          users to the wonders that exist within cultural heritage institutions 
          in North Carolina.  </p><p>Patrons are visiting North Carolina cultural heritage 
          institutions for a variety of reasons.  Surveyed institutions reported 
          that the categories of genealogy, local history, scholarly research 
          and publications, undergraduate class work, K – 12 work, property 
          or legal research, publicity campaigns and public relations, administrative 
          or institutional support, education, and aesthetic appreciation were 
          all viable reasons why patrons visit North Carolina institutions.  A 
          preliminary analysis of the data presented from this question indicates 
          that genealogy, education or interpretation, and aesthetic appreciation 
          achieved the highest average percentage of purpose for use (over 40%).  
          Local history was in the next tier (28%), and while all other purposes 
          were below 16%, no purpose was ranked lower than 9% (property or legal 
          research).</p><p>With this varied landscape of users and material, 
          the variety of institutions surveyed through NC ECHO completes the landscape

          the institution types in North Carolina in NC ECHO.</p>

        <p class="caption">Chart 1:  Aggregate institution types</p><p>The importance of museums in North Carolina is clearly 
          demonstrated in this chart.  Institutions that indicated museum characteristics 
          comprise just over 50% of all institutions surveyed.  The museum category 
          groups all institutions that include museum in their title or have artifact 
          collections of any type in their description.  It also includes historic 
          sites, both public and private.  Archives, the second largest category, 
          includes those collections that are primarily paper or non-artifact 
          based (including but not limited to film, audio, digital, or photographic 
          materials) and includes libraries and special collections within libraries.  
          Societies and private institutions comprise a small percentage of the 
          whole of the North Carolina community, but can still present some interesting 
          problems for the metadata environment.  &#39;Other&#39; includes 
          archaeological labs which were included in museum metadata discussions 
          due to their artifactual nature.  The prominence of institutions constituting 
          museum characteristics clearly demonstrates the need for specific attention 
          to be paid to their metadata needs.  In addition, those comprising the 
          other 48% may have artifactual material that can be addressed through 
          a museum metadata strategy.</p><p>This aggregated view demonstrates the place museums 
          have in the cultural institution landscape in North Carolina, but within 
          the museum community there is a great deal of variety.  </p>

        <p class="caption" align="center"><b>Chart 2:  Specific museum types </b></p><p>Chart 2 demonstrates the different  kinds of museums 
          uncovered in the survey.  Because these categories are not mutually 
          exclusive, the survey directed respondents to circle all that apply 
          rather than to choose only one type.  Both charts demonstrate the concrete 
          challenges for a unified metadata environment.  Not only is there a 
          diverse spread of cultural institutions but also diversity within the 
          museum community.  To accommodate the NC ECHO mission for inclusion 
          of all cultural institutions, a metadata solution needs to address both 
          the inclusion of museum information in the larger cultural institution 
          vista but also to arrive at a consensus for museums dealing with very 
          diverse materials.</p>
        <h1>Devising a Metadata Strategy</h1>
        <p>Access to the materials in North Carolina heritage 
          institutions is the primary goal of the project.  Metadata constructs 
          will help to reach that goal, along with technological leveraging of 
          that metadata.  The NCMC metadata working group was formed to address 
          metadata issues for the museum community to assure that any metadata 
          solution can be easily integrated into other metadata solutions being 
          used by other institution types.  This working group is composed of 
          representatives from the array of museum types, including North Carolina 
          Historic Sites, the North Carolina Science Museum, the Department of 
          Archaeology research services, the North Carolina Art Museum and the 
          North Carolina History Museum.</p><p>Our initial discussions focused on metadata and its 
          role in cultural institutions as well as a state-wide collaborative.  
          Metadata, as the group understood it, is defined as </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">structured information that describes, explains, locates 
          or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use or manage an information 
          resource <i>(Hodge, 2001</i>).</p><p>  During those initial discussions, it became clear 
          that each museum type was already well invested in a metadata scheme, 
          as each had a structure in place used to manage their collections.  
          Those schemes included descriptive and administrative metadata components 
          and, for the most part, satisfied the individual institution&#39;s 
          needs.  Almost every type of museum software is implemented in North 
          Carolina, with Microsoft Access, Past Perfect, Re:discovery and FileMaker 
          Pro being the most prevalent.  These primarily perform in-house database 
          management, while some systems also offer on-line database access to 
          their materials.</p><p>One of the missions of NC ECHO is to provide on-line 
          access to all cultural heritage materials, whether they are digitized 
          currently, to be digitized at some point down the road, or would never 
          be suitable for digitization.  Some of these collection management systems 
          have on-line components; the &#39;home grown&#39; solutions, while 
          more tailored to the individual&#39;s needs, would require development 
          resources to create on-line interfaces.  Other systems focus on establishing 
          solid collection management and interpretive tools and had not considered 
          an on-line presence a priority.  This is not surprising; as Rinehart 
          notes, </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">given the importance of visual information to museums, 
          it is easy to understand why they did not rush to embrace the pre-image 
          Internet (<i>Rinehart, 2001</i>).</p><p>Some museums have yet to cross the digital divide.  
        </p><p>Another challenge in discussing metadata solutions 
          in this early stage was to make clear that museums would not be re-constructing 
          their existing collection management data in a new system or abandoning 
          their existing system.  Many have invested scarce resources, training 
          and staff time for implementation.  In order to get museums to want 
          to participate beyond their own walls, strategies for the metadata working 
          group included an understanding of existing systems and a re-purposing 
          of that information for the collaborative environment.  Obviously these 
          museums needed to do additional work to participate in the collaborative 
          environment, but minimizing that work would provide a lower barrier 
          to participation.  </p><p>Another aspect of the existing collection management 
          systems was the emphasis seen by museums on the administrative functions.  
          Not all data kept in these systems were considered appropriate for the 
          on-line environment.  In particular, appraisal information and security 
          of artifacts surfaced as inappropriate for the public arena.  It was 
          important to get a sense of the kind of information museums collected 
          and to discriminate between that appropriate for the Web and that used 
          in museum operation.  This meant that not all metadata held in the management 
          systems would constitute information suitable for the portal.  It was 
          important for metadata working group participants to understand that 
          on-line information could constitute a subset of the metadata required 
          for museums to organize their collections, but that museums had already 
          created metadata that could be repurposed for the on-line environment 
          rather than creating additional metadata.  </p><p>The next challenge for this working group was the 
          integration of metadata about diverse museum holdings.  For instance, 
          holdings by the science museums in the state do not necessarily integrate 
          well with materials more historical in nature.  Scientific and archaeological 
          materials often handle samples of species or shards of pottery that 
          are collected by the hundreds rather than individual unique items.  
          The question that occurred to us all, though, was why not include this 
          kind of material in the larger realm of cultural heritage information 
          in North Carolina?  For the metadata strategy, what kind of challenge 
          would that type of material present when this metadata was typically 
          geared toward item-level information.  </p><p>To solve these issues, the working group discussed 
          the categories each museum type had in common.  The problem of semantics 
          arose immediately.  For example, the discussion of <b>title</b> created 
          many problems.  Science museums do not have <b>titles</b> but, rather, 
          identify their material according to <b>genus</b> and <b>species.</b>  
          Historic sites and history museums identify their items by <b>genre</b> 
          more readily, but some items could also have titles.  Art museum materials 
          almost always have titles; that is how they are identified.  It was 
          clear that many of the working group members felt that the term <i>title</i> 
          did not apply to their material.  The connotation of terms had to be 
          overcome if we were going to come to a consensus on a metadata scheme 
          that could be used in a consortium.  The ultimate goal of these discussions 
          was to map individual institutional metadata systems to a generalized 
          XML scheme that could be exploited in a search and retrieval environment.  
          If we could not come to an agreement on the common categories of information, 
          a metadata strategy would be too fragmented to be of use in the collaborative 
          environment.  In order to come to that understanding, we talked in detail 
          about the individual institution metadata applications and how each 
          institution used that information.</p><p>The emphasis on digitizing also surfaced as a central 
          obstacle to these metadata discussions.  While each museum described 
          in detail the administrative and descriptive structures that they had 
          refined in their profession, they had the impression that &#39;metadata&#39; 
          was only necessary for those items that were going to be digitized.  
          In-house  collection management systems were sufficient for the institution 
          management, but the digital imperative created a need to look at metadata.  
          As stated, NC ECHO seeks to provide access to all the materials in a 
          museum&#39;s collection.  However, not all museums had an on-line 
          presence while some institutions had well-developed on-line resources.  
          Any metadata solution that met the NC ECHO goal for inclusion would 
          need to accommodate this digital divide.  For the search and retrieval 
          solutions NC ECHO was interested in, museums would either have to provide 
          a place to point to on-line or provide enough information to be presented 
          for patrons to make relevance judgments between one item and another.  
          This would mean that those institutions that had on-line resources could 
          be more easily integrated, whereas those that did not would necessarily 
          require more information within the display as a search result.  The 
          latter requires more information to be harvested than just the index-relevant 
          metadata in order for patrons to make that judgment.  </p><p>A final aspect of the metadata strategy is the dissemination 
          of information once this common metadata structure has been created.  
          Tactics for this will include presentations, workshops, user groups 
          for collection management systems, and communication through the Web 
          and e-mail lists.  Most importantly, any broadcasting must include a 
          marketing component to convince smaller or marginalized museums to participate 
          in the collaborative, in order to achieve the NC ECHO mission of <i>all 
          </i>cultural institutions.</p>
        <h1>Search and Retrieval Options</h1>
        <p>In creating any kind of working group solution, it 
          is always important to provide a larger view of how that work will be 
          leveraged. What will be the result of the information will be?  The 
          search and retrieval solution currently being explored is the Open Archives 
          Initiative: </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">The Open Archives Initiative develops and promotes 
          interoperability standards that aim to facilitate the efficient dissemination 
          of content.  The Open Archives Initiative has its roots in an effort 
          to enhance access to e-print archives as a means of increasing the availability 
          of scholarly communication <i>(Lagoze and Van de Sompel, 2001). </i></p><p>The technical framework has been described by its 
          creators as <b>low-barrier</b> in terms of its approach to interoperability.  
          This is to be understood in terms of other interoperability standards 
          such as Z39.50 which have a higher barrier for implementation.</p><p>The Open Archives Initiative Metadata Harvesting 
          Protocol (OAI-MHP) provides a solution that will allow NC ECHO to harvest 
          metadata created by individual institutions and create a common index 
          with search results that point to the institution for full record.  
          This solution, while technologically sophisticated to implement, has 
          been used by many large consortiums dealing with a variety of metadata 
          formats.  In considering the implementation of OAI-MHP, NC ECHO would 
          need to minimize metadata formats and control the metadata to be harvested 
          so that that harvesting can be done more effectively. </p><p>The metadata strategy for the museum community discussed 
          here is to create a common metadata language for museum information 
          using EAD, that is created through conversion scripts from existing 
          collection management systems.  Using EAD, an XML document type definition, 
          NC ECHO would like to exploit the sophisticated metadata constructed 
          by cultural institutions.  However, OAI-MHP requires unqualified Dublin 
          Core.  In addition, due to issues of browser compatibility, on-line 
          resources are typically presented in HTML.  Therefore, an automated 
          conversion from XML EAD to HTML both provides the on-line display and 
          creates the required unqualified Dublin Core for provision to other 
          OAI harvesters.  This will allow NC ECHO to both harvest and provide 
          metadata, so that North Carolina material can be included in national 
          consortiums as well as within its own portal (see Diagram 1). </p><p>The NCMC metadata working group is currently working 
          on best practice guidelines for the dissemination of museum collections 
          information that can interact with other cultural institution metadata 
          generated for the NC ECHO portal.  Using the proposed metadata strategy, 
          museums can maintain their current metadata systems, and NC ECHO would 
          provide assistance in transforming database information into easier 
          data sharing and interoperable solutions.</p>

        <p class="caption">Diagram 1:  Museums metadata solution overall view</p><p>In order to achieve this unified metadata structure, 
          there are a series of steps that need to take place.</p>
        <h3>Establish which collection management systems are currently 
          in use in North Carolina museums. </h3>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Initial &#39;test&#39; museums have been 
          very forthcoming with this information and a Museums Council survey 
          may be the best way to provide information regarding the larger museum 
          community.  This survey will have several positive outcomes.  It will 
          provide the metadata working group with a clear understanding of the 
          scope and diversity of technological solutions extant in North Carolina 
          museums.  It can also provide a good arena for User Group formation 
          for those museums using the same kinds of solutions.  Finally, it will 
          aid in on-line communication structures for those user groups and for 
          those museums interested in investing in a new system or converting 
          from one system to another.  The results of this first step will not 
          hinder movement on the other aspects that need to be accomplished for 
          the museum community in addressing their metadata needs.</p>
        <h3>Establish if an institution has an on-line presence, 
          is developing one, or would need assistance in providing on-line information 
          about their collections.  </h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>If a museum has its own on-line presence, metadata 
            extraction would be limited to information used for indexing a brief 
            display with URLs to institution displays.  For those museums that do 
            not have on-line interfaces for their collections, additional, non-indexed 
            information would need to be harvested for search results.  </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Create the transformation codes to extract metadata 
          from the current solution to the XML environment depending upon the 
          answer to (2).  </h3>
        <p class="BlockQuote">It is assumed that generalized transformation 
          programs can be constructed for the majority of collection management 
          systems being used.  These scripts can then be customized for individual 
          institutional adoption.  For those museums using uncommon collection 
          management systems, individual programming will be needed.  Because 
          many institutions used proprietary systems such as PastPerfect and Re:discovery, 
          this programming would best be done in partnership with the developers 
          of these systems.  It is hoped that the companies can then market the 
          transformation capabilities to other customers and would therefore see 
          the advantage of working in partnership with the NC ECHO project.</p><p>The most important aspect of this kind of solution 
          rests with finding the commonalities in metadata already gathered.  This 
          will expedite the mapping of museum information to XML EAD and HTML.  
          It will decrease the requirement for new, specialized crosswalking solutions 
          for each instantiation of museum metadata and allow for a generalized 
          framework that can be implemented at specific levels.  By clearly understanding 
          each individual museum type metadata requirements while placing those 
          individual types within the larger context of the museum metadata and 
          cultural institution metadata initiatives, we should be able to maximize 
          the available indexing information and provide adequate instruction 
          on use for the search portal.  This approach constitutes a &#39;metadata 
          first&#39; approach.  The metadata first approach focuses on existing 
          metadata systems rather than trying to retro-fit the existing metadata 
          into a technological solution.  While there is still a great deal of 
          work to be done to see if this kind of metadata solution is tenable 
          in the North Carolina museum environment, the support garnered by the 
          metadata first, grass-roots approach provides a solid foundation for 
          an inclusive solution for all cultural heritage institutions in North 
          Carolina.</p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Collaborating in consortiums creates many demands 
          on cultural institutions to conform to more generalized solutions.  
          There are advantages and disadvantages to the integration of museums 
          in cultural heritage portals.  This information can enrich the museum&#39;s 
          exposure.  The exposure, though, can create the possibility of raising 
          expectations of individual artifacts.  An emphasis on materials within 
          the museum collections could create a separation from museums&#39; 
          exhibit orientations to catalogues of artifacts.  Increased exposure, 
          though, can lead to increased community support and increased potential 
          for collaboration through the creation of virtual collections.  In addition, 
          this kind of work could serve to increase the awareness of the museum 
          communities of standards that are well-formed and active in other related 
          fields, while at the same time providing an arena for the museum community 
          to extend its own standards to other cultural institutions who do not 
          have museum expertise in describing their artifact materials.</p><p>The time of cultural institution integration in the 
          on-line environment is upon us, and the emphasis on digitization only 
          makes the issue more pressing.  Technological solutions constructed 
          outside of a metadata context do not often correspond with the goals 
          and users of institutions.  By taking into account the metadata challenges 
          and diversity in the museum environment, NC ECHO may be moving more 
          slowly, but surely, toward a strategy that is sustainable and effective 
          in the future.</p>
