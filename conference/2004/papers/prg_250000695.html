          Technology Services, developed, implemented, and evaluated an interactive 
          handheld museum guide as part of a larger study on interpretation. The 
          iTour handheld computers, made available to visitors during a three 
          month study on interpretive technology, contained rich content including 
          video of artists, audio of curators, textual information, and creative 
          play components. Research data was collected and analyzed on two main 
          foci: visitor engagement with the exhibit (with and without the iTour), 
        as well as comparison of three different types of handheld computers.</p>

      <h1>Experimenting with Interpretation</h1>
      <p>In 2003, the Blanton Museum of Art at the University 
          of Texas at Austin organized a thorough examination of the viability 
          and impact of mobile technologies on museum learning. The museum, in 
          collaboration with UT’s Information Technology Department, developed, 
          implemented, and evaluated the iTour—an interactive handheld museum 
          guide (Pocket PC). These devices contained rich content including newly 
          commissioned videos of artists and curators, textual information, and 
          creative play components, and were available to visitors during a three-month 
          study on interpretive technology. The museum collected data via written 
          surveys, observations, usability testing, and iTour usage tracking. 
          After careful analysis of this research data, the Blanton has concluded 
        that mobile technologies present an opportunity to:</p>
          <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li> 
           provide visitors with greater access to 
            the intellectual and cultural resources of the museum, </li>
        <li> 
           engage visitors with interactive learning 
            that promotes careful looking and critical thinking, and</li>
        <li> 
           enhance visitor communication with the museum 
            and dialogue with other visitors.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>The Blanton iTour study was part of a comprehensive 
          investigation, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, 
          to assess the value and effectiveness of the Blanton’s interpretive 
          programming. This larger study sought to determine characteristics, 
          strategies, and principles that best support exemplary interpretive 
          practice as the museum prepares for a new 155,000 square foot facility 
          scheduled to open in fall 2005. </p>
        <h1>Technology at the University of Texas</h1>
        <p>The iTour project compliments and intersects with one 
          of UT President Larry Faulkner’s key initiatives: UTopia (previously 
          known as the Digital Knowledge Gateway). Unveiled in March 2002, UTopia 
          is envisioned as an on-line service that will share the great intellectual 
          and cultural treasures of the institution with all the residents of 
          the state to whom they belong. ‘The university is setting the 
          goal of providing a digital knowledge gateway to all Texans,’ 
          Faulkner said. ‘We will provide access for every citizen, via 
          a personalized Internet window, into the resources of our libraries, 
          collections, museums and much more.’ Ultimately, the university’s 
          intention is to be a leading player in an emerging new world where research, 
          learning, and scholarly discourse are not limited by the walls of campuses 
          and laboratories. </p>
        <h1>Designing the Exhibit and the iTour</h1>
        <h2>Visualizing Identity – the Experimental Exhibition</h2>
        <p>The specific research question posed by Anne Manning, 
          Curator of Education and Academic Affairs at the Blanton, was</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Can handheld multi-media technology enhance visitor 
          learning, or does it distract and reduce careful observation and critical 
          thinking?</p>
        <p> In spring 2003, Annette Carlozzi, Curator of American 
          and Contemporary Art at the Blanton, in conjunction with Manning, designed 
          a small experimental exhibition entitled <i>Visualizing Identity, </i> comprised 
          of four works by contemporary artists. The exhibition offered a focused 
          look at works by artists Jesse Amado, Radcliffe Bailey, Byron Kim, and 
          Glenn Ligon through the lens of identity; it was also designed as a 
          research study to investigate the role of interactive multi-media technology 
          in the museum. The exhibit was designed to function both with and without 
          the multi-media component.</p>
        <h2>Principles and components of the iTour</h2>
        <p>A project team including curators, systems analysts, 
          a graphic artist, and a videographer was formed. The team gathered and 
          reviewed information on the works of art, the artists, museum interpretation, 
          interactive media, and handheld computers. Focus groups were held with 
          UT students, museum colleagues, professors, artists and the Austin community 
          to feed the design.  Then a storyboard was developed based on the following 
          principles:</p>
        <p><b>Focus on the Object</b>: The iTour should enhance 
          rather than supplement interaction with the object. Content should be 
          designed to stimulate observation and critical analysis of objects and 
          to promote discovery, understanding, and continued learning.</p>
        <p><b>Focus on the Learner</b>: The iTour should give 
          visitors with different backgrounds and learning styles the tools to 
          understand works of art, reflect on the world around them, and take 
          part in a broader, contemporary dialogue. The design should be intuitive 
          so the visitor doesn’t have to “work at” learning.</p>
        <p><b>Interactive, Personalized Learning</b>: The iTour 
          content should actively engage visitors, and allow them to direct their 
          learning and make connections with their own knowledge, lives, and experiences. 
          The iTour should promote curiosity, social interaction, personal reflection, 
          and discussion. </p>
        <p>The iTour storyboard for <i>Visualizing Identity</i> 
          was designed by the curators and education team. The following components 
          were created for each work of art:</p>
        <p><b>Text</b>:  To allow visitors to read the traditional 
          label information at their leisure and from any location in the gallery, 
          the wall text was available in the iTour. In addition to the traditional 
          label, an informal artist biography and an FAQ (frequently asked questions) 
          section were also available in text format.</p>
        <p><b>Video/Audio</b>:  Each artist was flown in during 
          the project to participate in public forums and discussions with curators. 
          The open forums were recorded and then edited by the curators and education 
          staff. The iTour held a total of 17 video clips and 21 audio clips (ranging 
          from 18 seconds to 3 minutes) of artists and curators discussing aspects 
          of the art works including process, materials, inspiration, and possible 
          interpretations.  </p>
        <p><b>Creative Play</b>:  To encourage visitors to explore 
          art in a non-linear fashion, the education staff designed an interactive 
          element specifically for each piece. One interactive piece allowed visitors 
          to mentally peel back the layers of one of the works and hear about 
          the significance of each layer in the artist’s own voice. Another 
          encouraged visitors to compare their own skin color to the panels in 
          Byron Kim’s <i>Synecdoche</i> and then choose that color on the 
          iTour, adjust it lighter or darker, and submit it to be added to a digital 
          canvas of all the other iTour visitors before them on the Blanton Web 
          site.</p>
        <p>The final storyboard resulted in the following hierarchical 
          structure:</p>

        <p class="caption">Figure 1: Hierarchical structure 
          of Visualizing Identity iTour storyboard</p>
        <h2>Technical decisions</h2>
        <p>Based on recent UT research, the Pocket PC platform 
          was chosen for the iTour. The specific benefits of the Pocket PC include  
          proven ability to handle rich media content, high quality display, and 
          content that can easily be multi-purposed for desktop machines/Web consumption. 
          The project was seeded with five Compaq iPAQ Pocket PC 3670s by Daniel 
          Updegrove, the Vice President for Information Technology at the University 
          of Texas at Austin. Microsoft Research generously donated three Dell 
          Axim X5s and two Toshiba e750s. All ten of these handheld computers 
          had the following software:  operating system - MS Pocket PC 2002, application 
          - Flash Player 6 for PPC.</p>
        <p>The units had enough memory to hold all the content 
          needed for the small exhibition, so resources were focused on creating 
          rich media that would be physically stored on the machine. If research 
          findings supported continued use of media such as video, it was assumed 
          that advances over the next year in wireless speed, on-board memory 
          and flash memory cards would handle any future needs. </p>
        <p>Benchmarking other handheld guides, the team decided 
          to experiment with two different headphone options: a standard two-ear 
          headphone and a single-ear headphone. The standard two-ear headphone 
          worked best during the pilot when the museum was busy: the two ear headphones 
          helped reduce the distraction of ambient noise. Usability testing demonstrated 
          that two-ear head phones did not lead to a more isolated museum experience, 
          as other studies have suggested, but rather promoted a more immersive 
          experience with the object. Users appeared comfortable interrupting 
          that experience to have a conversation with a friend or family member 
          and then returning to the iTour. During a particularly busy day, the 
          team also experimented by letting small groups use the iTour without 
          headphones,  relying on the pocket pc speaker. Blanton staff observed 
          good group dynamics and no additional disruption to other visitors. 
          Out of the three Pocket PC platforms tested, only the Compaq iPAQ 3670 
          had a speaker that was loud enough for this type of use.</p>
        <h2>Programming the iTour</h2>
        <p>Initial technical research led the team to choose Macromedia 
          Flash and Action Scripting as the tool for the interface design. Flash 
          was well suited for modular system architecture and was perfect for 
          handling the interactive and creative elements. Flash did a reasonable 
          job with the video and audio content. Screen loading speed was reasonable. 
          Video quality was not as high as desired, but acceptable for this experiment. 
          The team is anxiously awaiting the release of Flash Player 7 for PPC 
          as well as faster processing speeds. Sound quality was less than desirable, 
          but this was also a product of the original video/audio recording.</p>
        <p>To accurately collect visitors’ usage patterns, 
          the iTour was designed to automatically track individual start time, 
          end time, each page visited, the order each page was visited, and the 
          amount of time spent on each page . This data was stored in XML on each 
          Pocket PC and then synchronized to a desktop PC running mySQL database. 
          The XML was then parsed using a PHP script and stored in the mySQL database. 
          A unique id was automatically assigned to each visitor.</p>
        <h1>Evaluation Methods for iTour and Non-iTour Visitors</h1>
        <h2>Data collection</h2>
        <p>A detailed written survey was developed by the Blanton 
          staff to gather statistical data on the impact of the iTour. Altogether, 
          149 surveys were collected from non-iTour visitors (those who did not 
          use the iTour); 239 surveys were collected from iTour users. Each visitor’s 
          iTour usage pattern was linked to that user’s written survey data. 
          In addition, Blanton staff conducted usability testing and training 
          with visitors, docents, curators, and technologists. Prior to release, 
          the iTour was tested by over 200 museum visitors while Blanton staff 
          observed and solicited feedback.</p>
        <h2>Profile of respondents</h2><p><a>About six in ten respondents were female and four 
          in ten were male.  A majority of respondents were White. The average 
          age of respondents was 30-31 years old.  There were not any statistically 
          significant differences between iTour and non-iTour respondents with 
          regard to gender, race, or age.</a></p><p>iTour respondents were more educated than non-iTour 
          respondents (p&lt;.01). The majority of iTour respondents had at least 
          a four-year college degree, while the majority of non-iTour respondents 
          had less than a four-year college degree.</p><p>Half (51%) of iTour respondents and 61% of non-iTour 
          respondents were college students at the time of the survey. Of those 
          who were college students, more non-iTour respondents (79%) than iTour 
          respondents (61%) were UT Austin students (p&lt;.01). Very few respondents 
          were high school students; however, more users (3%) than non-users (0%) 
          were in high school (p&lt;.05).</p><p>A majority of survey respondents had visited an art 
          museum prior to this trip to the Blanton, while about one-fifth had 
          never visited an art museum. About half of the respondents had previously 
          visited the Blanton; of those, most had visited one to three times. 
          There were not any statistically significant differences in the previous 
          museum experiences of iTour and non-iTour respondents. </p>

        <h1>Overarching Findings and Observations</h1>
        <p>The average amount of time spent in <i>Visualizing 
          Identity</i> (which contained only four works of art) was nearly 21 
          minutes. Since this data was collected and recorded through the tracking 
          device on the handheld, an equal measure for determining visitor usage 
          without the iTour was not possible. However, observations of approximately 
          40 visitors indicated that visitors not using the iTour spent between 
          one and eight minutes in the exhibition. </p>
        <p>Observations of visitors using the iTour indicated 
          that rather than spending their time absorbed in the technology, visitors 
          demonstrated positive engagement with the works of art. Visitor viewing 
          patterns appeared to be directed and active - seeking out details in 
          the works, moving back and forth between works, moving closer to works, 
          pointing out details to family members and friends. In an open-ended 
          question on the visitor survey one person wrote: ‘I spent more 
          time exploring exhibits I may have passed over more quickly without 
          the iTour,’ while another stated, ‘The longer I spent with 
          the works the more impact I felt.’</p>
        <h2>Visitor reactions to the iTour</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <a> A majority (67%) of visitors were <i>very</i> 
            satisfied with their iTour experience; 28% were <i>somewhat </i>satisfied; 
            and 5% were <i>only a little </i>satisfied.</a></li>
        <li> 
           On average, visitors rated various aspects 
            of the iTour as <i>very good</i>.</li>
        <li> 
           Visitors gave the highest ratings to the 
            iTour’s ease of use and its content.</li>
        <li> 
           Use of the <i>not applicable </i>category 
            indicates that the interactive play component of the iTour may have 
            been used less than other components. </li>
      </ul>

          There was a statistically significant difference between iTour users’

          indicate that visitors using the iTour had more extensive learning experiences 
          and were able to: </p>
        <h3><b>1. </b>Describe 
          the works using more detail.</h3>
        <p class="BlockQuote"><b> </b>I learned what ‘synecdoche’ means, and what the artist 
          intended with these seemingly simple blocks of color (representing individuals 
          in a group portrait). I learned what the meaning of the unusual items 
          was in <i>I Pray</i> (mirror: self reflection, latex suit: artist, soaps: 
          cleansing/purification). And I learned how <i>Untitled</i> and <i>By 
          the River</i> represent the artists’ views of their place in society 
          (the former) and within family and history (the latter)</p>
        <h3><b>2. </b>Demonstrate 
          a deeper level of understanding and critical thinking. </h3>
        <p class="BlockQuote">‘<i>Hands</i> – I found the artist’s comments of the absences and presence very interesting 
          ‘(the March being about the absence/presence of the African American 
          voice in politics yet the March has an absence of gays/lesbians, women, 
          etc.). </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">I was especially interested in learning about the creative process 
          behind both <i>Hands</i> and <i>By the River</i>. Both artists of those 
          pieces were sensitive to the ambiguities of their materials—and 
          I don&#39;t think I would have considered such ambiguities without 
          the info from the iTour.</p>
        <h3><b>3 . </b>Make 
          more connections to their own history and background. </h3>
        <p class="BlockQuote"><i>I Pray</i> was striking and invoked memories of my Hispanic 
          childhood.</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote"> To a certain extent, I identified with every piece. Though every artist 
          is from a culture that is different from my own, I was given a chance 
          to reflect and celebrate my own culture and beliefs.</p>
        <h3 class="listwithnumbers"><b>4. </b><b>Engage 
      in greater personal learning.</b></h3>
        <p class="BlockQuote"><i>Untitled (Hands)</i> forced me to consider the special challenges 
          that gay African-American men face. Being neither gay nor African-American, 
      I felt like I glimpsed an entirely ‘new’ cultural vista.</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote"> I considered my skin color alone (without the rest of me) as a complete 
      representation of my identity, in a way I had never experienced before.</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote"> What are we? Are we the same existence in our perception as in others 
          eyes? These questions resounded within me when I was viewing the works.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of the iTour</h2>
        <p>In response to the question, <i>What was the biggest 
          benefit to you of using the iTour?</i> visitors described five elements 
          that held strong appeal: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           <b>The ability to access more information. 
            <br/>
          </b>’I learned a lot more about the artist, the techniques, the artist’s 
            backgrounds and motivation than if I had only read the side panel.’</li>
        <li> 
           <b>The ability to access contextual information. 
            <br/>
          </b>’Provides more context and background than you get from just the 
            information of the wall.’</li>
        <li> 
           <b>The self-paced and self-directed elements. 
            <br/>
          </b>’Being able to look and learn at my own pace and the ability to 
            return to elements of my choice.’<br/>
            ’I learned more about the works than I otherwise would have and the 
            interaction personalized the artist, and allowed me to focus on what 
            I was interested in.’</li>
        <li> 
           <b>The opportunity to see and hear the artists 
            talk about their work. <br/>
          </b>“think this method of informing is great because the artist is 
            sharing a personal experience with the viewer. It’s almost like attending 
            a live lecture. It’s great!’</li>
        <li> 
           <b>The ability to observe the works while 
            listening to the audio content. <br/>
          </b>’Being able to hear about the piece while I was observing it—not 
            having to look away, break concentration.’</li>
      </ul>
       
        <h2>Future Considerations</h2>
        <p>The study also revealed areas that can be strengthened 
          in the future. Visitors specifically reported the following drawbacks 
          and suggestions for improving the iTour:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          
            Minimize video content to short segments that are of high interest 
            and relevance.</li>
        <li>
          
            Simplify offerings so as to not overwhelm visitors. Let visitors know 
            they don’t have to do it all. Less is more.</li>
        <li>
           Re-think architecture so visitors don’t 
            have to drill down to retrieve information.</li>
        <li>
          
            Structure content to encourage even greater observation of objects.</li>
        <li>
          
            Create links to Web site to extend visitor learning to before and 
            after museum visit.</li>
        <li>
           
            Improve quality of video and audio components.</li>
        <li>
           
            Attach the units to lanyards, so visitors could relax and not have 
            to hold the units the entire time.</li>
      </ul>
      
        <h1>Technical Challenges and Lessons Learned</h1>
        <p>In addition to the extensive data that was collected 
          from both iTour and non-iTour visitors from the survey, the Blanton 
          team documented the following technical challenges and lessons learned.</p>
        <h2>Battery life </h2>
        <p>The battery life on the older iPAQ 3670s was approximately 
          one hour when the units were run full-tilt (full bright, full volume).  
          Both of the newer units, the Dell Axim X5s and the Toshiba e750s, had 
          a battery life of approximately two and one-half hours when run at full-tilt.  
          The recharge time for the Dell and Toshiba removable batteries was two 
          hours.  The recharge time for the iPAQ non-removable batteries was two 
          and one-half hours.  During the busiest day (more than 200 people), 
          the iPAQs couldn’t keep up with the demand (and the batteries 
          were not interchangeable). This issue is easily solved with the Dell 
          and Toshiba and newer iPAQ models, which have removable batteries. Fully 
          charged extra batteries were kept on hand so that those units could 
          stay in use. Batteries, an ancient chemical cocktail, are indeed the 
          biggest bottleneck for handheld computing.</p>
        <h2>Fragility</h2>
        <p>Pocket PCs are fragile. Screens get scratched, the 
          stylus can get stuck in some units (like the iPAQ 3670), and none of 
          them bounce well. During the pilot, one unit was dropped and broken. 
          Leather cases were used for the Toshibas and Dells. The Niteize Pack 
          Strap was used for the iPAQs and offered some protection and gave the 
          option to add a lanyard as well. For the most part, the Pocket PCs were 
          used without cases or straps. Micro-thin screen protectors were not 
          used because they reduced the clarity of the screen. PDA Screen Clean 
          was used to regularly clean the screens.</p>
        <h2>Processor speed</h2>
        <p>Response time on the Pocket PCs was reasonable but 
          not stellar. Video playback was acceptable, but not excellent. Macromedia 
          is working to find ways to increase response time.  When FlashPlayer 
          7 becomes available for PPC, it will provide a 200% speed increase in 
          video playback. The team is confident that advances in the processor 
          speed will continue to increase at a rate that will soon meet and exceed 
          our needs.</p>
        <h2>Pocket PC reliability, stability and ease of use</h2>
        <p>All three brands of handheld computers, Dell Axim X5, 
          Toshiba e750 and iPAQ 3670, performed well. The units were stable and 
          reliable and proved easy to use, even by people with no prior computer 
          or handheld experience. We specifically tested the use of the devices 
          with children (as young as 5 years old) and computerphobes - people 
          who dislike using computers. The children found the iTour easy to use. 
          The computerphobes were able to use the iTour, but responded that they 
          would prefer to have others run the iTour for them and then share the 
          information with them.</p>
        <h2>Creating media rich content</h2>
        <p>Creating a high quality 30-second video is very time 
          consuming! While the team knew that the original videos created for 
          this project would be labor intensive, we were still surprised by the 
          amount of effort required.  Major steps in iTour video production included 
          the following: determine purpose of video; coordinate video shoot, review 
          video; select clips, edit and format video for Pocket PC, and install 
          video in the iTour interface. Add to this the ambitious desire to video 
          the actual artist discussing his or her own work, and the logistics 
          involved in coordinating travel, dates, times, location, and compensation! 
          While visitors clearly indicated that the artist videos were a key element 
          to their satisfaction with the iTour; the study team advises incorporating 
          high quality video only when it is of high interest and relevance.</p>
        <h2>Omni-directional microphones for video and audio content creation</h2>
        <p>The cardinal rule of creating rich media, whether it 
          is audio or video, is that you must always use a high quality microphone. 
          Never rely on the microphone on the video camera and never rely on an 
          omni-directional microphone when trying to record a single speaker. 
          Always use a unidirectional microphone and make sure to monitor the 
          sound during recording using headphones. The iTour video production 
          had the best success with a wireless unidirectional lavaliere microphone. 
          The team learned quickly that you can shoot the most beautiful video 
          in the world, but if you don’t have good sound, what good is your 
          video?</p>
        <h2>Keyhole navigation</h2>
        <p>Following our principle that the focus should be on 
          the work of art, the designer developed an icon to represent each work 
          of art. The icon for each work was a small keyhole<b>,</b> or detail, 
          from the work. To figure out which icon represented which work, the 
          museum visitor would have to look carefully at the physical work of 
          art first. While this idea sounds good, it did not pass the usability 
          test. Users uniformly were confused and frustrated by the keyhole navigation. 
          This experiment confirms the principle that a handheld museum guide 
          needs to be intuitive and not demand cognitive load for navigation. 
          We want to encourage visitors to think about the art, not about the 
          Pocket PC.</p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>As museums move into the 21st Century, we are challenged 
          to find new and dynamic ways to connect people, ideas, and objects. 
          Mobile technologies offer a unique possibility to provide visitors with 
          greater access to the intellectual and cultural resources of the museum. 
          Digital images of works in storage and from other collections, conversations 
          with curators and artists, contextual material in the form of photographs, 
          film footage, music, and excerpts from related textual materials can 
          all be made available to the visitor at the touch of a button. With 
          the availability of these resources comes the opportunity for the visitor 
          to personalize the experience and make connections with prior knowledge, 
          experience, or interests. Moreover, mobile technologies can help museums 
          fulfill their role as forums for public exchange and dialogue; visitors 
          can now share their experiences and knowledge with the museum and other 
          visitors. Thus museum space begins to expand beyond the gallery walls 
          and into schools, homes, campuses, and across borders into other states 
          and nations.</p>
