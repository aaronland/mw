        <p class="PaperTitle">Visitor Interactivity Becomes Museum Exhibit</p>
        <p class="Author">Billie J. Jones, Penn State Capital College, USA</p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
       <p class="AbstractText">Visitors to the Smithsonian Museum of American History&#39;s 
          September 11 (2001) exhibit, which closed on July 6, 2003, were invited 
          to record their memories of September 11 either in writing or in recorded 
          telephone messages. Some of those written messages were displayed in 
          several locations throughout the physical exhibit. All of these memories, 
          written and recorded, will be made available through <i>The September 
          11 Digital Archive </i><a href="http://911digitalarchive.org/" target="_blank">http://911digitalarchive.org</a>, where they 
          join other writings prompted at that site. This intermingling of contributed 
          memories, written texts and recorded messages, left at the physical 
          museum and at the virtual site (not a direct arm of the Smithsonian), 
          provides a rich field for study.</p>
         <p class="AbstractText">In this paper, I will share a rhetorical analysis 
          of writings left by visitors to the Smithsonian Museum of American History&#39;s 
          September 11 (2001) exhibit, comparing these to memories recorded at 
          the <i>September 11 Digital Archive</i> (http://911digitalarchive.org/). 
          These writings, private memories recorded to become part of public discourse 
          displayed on a museum wall or an Internet site, serve as a memorial 
          to the lives, and a way of life, lost that day. More than words, however, 
          their visual presence and even suppositions as to the writers&#39; exigency(ies), 
          common yet very personal, and purposes for writing/sharing their memories 
          are all fruit for rhetorical study. </p>
         <p class="AbstractText">Beyond that I will explore the actual shift from 
          the writings being created as a result visitor (physical or virtual 
          space) to the writings becoming artifacts within the exhibit. More 
          than simply an outlet for memories and volatile emotions, the writings 
          become much of the meat in the digital archive, drawing more visitors. 
          This sort of uber-interactivity makes the virtual museum space a constantly 
          evolving exhibit, with visitors having a greater ownership than ever 
          before.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Interestingly, according to the Pew Internet and American Life Project 
          sponsored study, <i>How Americans Used the Internet After the Terror 
          Attacks</i>, &#34;The Internet was not a primary source for news or 
          outreach for Americans&#34; in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist 
          attacks on September 11, 2001. (<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/reports/toc.asp?Report=45" target="_blank">http://www.pewinternet.org/reports/toc.asp?Report=45</a>) 
        </p><p> In fact the study, which is &#34;based on data 
          from telephone interviews conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates 
          between September 12, 2001 and September 13, 2001,&#34; reports that, 
          &#34;Only 3% of Internet users say they got most of their information 
          about the attacks and the aftermath from the Internet.&#34;</p>
          <p>This lack of reliance on the Internet, usually regarded 
          for its immediacy is curious, if not surprising. However, because most 
          television news sources (from which 81% of people reported receiving 
          their news during the immediate aftermath) (<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/reports/toc.asp?Report=45" target="_blank">http://www.pewinternet.org/reports/toc.asp?Report=45</a>) 
          broadcast live feeds from the scenes, the medium of television offered 
          the most immediacy, with the Internet offering little more than a mimesis 
          of television. Another possible reason for decreased Internet usage 
          as a news source is the need for comfort. As an older medium, many 
          people may have felt more comfortable with the more familiar television 
          -particularly with the greater likelihood of finding others gathered 
          around a television set rather than a computer screen. Americans wanted 
          -in fact <i>needed</i> the comfort of others. </p><p>Despite our initial preference, for whatever reason(s), 
          for television as our primary news source about the events of September 
          11: </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">[t]here were increases in some online activities in 
          the wake of the tragedy, perhaps the most notable of which was the greater 
          proportion of Internet users posting and reading comments from other 
          Americans about their emotional response to the attacks and the ways 
          America might retaliate. . . . In the 48 hours after the crisis, 13% 
          of Internet users &#39;attended&#39; virtual meetings or participated in virtual 
          communities by reading or posting comments in chat rooms, online bulletin 
          boards, or email listservs. . . . On a typical day only 4% of online 
          Americans visit chat rooms. After the terror attacks, Internet users 
          were doing everything online from grieving, to comforting each other, 
          to having reasoned discussions about policy options, to having flame 
          wars where emotions ran high and insults were exchanged. Online communities 
          were an emotional, spiritual, cerebral, primal, and sorrowful place 
          for Americans to sort out their feelings and hash out their views.</p>
        <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/reports/toc.asp?Report=45" target="_blank">http://www.pewinternet.org/reports/toc.asp?Report=45</a>) 
        </p><p>In the more than two years since those first few 
          days of surveyed Internet usage, Americans have continued to use the 
          Internet to &#34;sort out . . . feelings&#34; and to grieve about 
          the events of September 11, 2001, and doing &#34;grief work&#34; in 
          this new forum is certainly not restricted to the tragedy of September 
          11. Losses as private as a single pet or loved one to losses of national 
          proportion like the terrorist attacks of September 11 or the recent 
          Operation Enduring Freedom are memorialized on the Internet, which Susan 
          Crane (2000) likens to museums and other &#34;prosthetic cultural devices 
          created to supplement mental memory functions . . . without supplanting 
          them&#34; The Smithsonian National Museum of American History&#39;s <i>September 
          11 Bearing Witness to History </i>exhibit and <i>The September 11 Digital 
          Archive</i> (<a href="http://911digitalarchive.org/" target="_blank">http://911digitalarchive.org</a>) are both 
          such archival devices. Both begun on September 11, 2002, as part of 
          a commemorative effort on the one-year anniversary of the tragedy, these 
          sites, the first primarily a physical-space exhibit and the latter a 
          virtual archive, have attracted large crowds. During the Smithsonian 
          exhibit&#39;s &#34;ten-month run, it attracted over a million visitors 
          from across the nation and around the world&#34; (<a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/september11/exhibition/index.asp" target="_blank">http://americanhistory.si.edu/september11/exhibition/index.asp</a>), 
          and the Smithsonian exhibit will expand its <i>place</i> to reach more 
          people as it becomes a traveling exhibit later this year.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this paper is two-fold: to analyze 
          some of the writings contributed by visitors to the physical and virtual 
          exhibits, in order to determine the impetus to contribute to the exhibit(s) 
          in such a way and to discuss the effects that soliciting written comment, 
          which becomes contribution, which becomes artifact, has on the virtual 
          exhibit.</p><p>(Before beginning, I want to explain my use of the 
          term &#34;Americans.&#34; In this paper, I will refer to the American 
          response(s) to September 11, 2001. In the use of that term I am being 
          as inclusive as possible. Rather than defining &#34;Americans&#34; 
          as a specific cultural group or birth-heritage group, I am referring 
          to anyone who identifies themselves as &#34;American,&#34; regardless 
          of their birthplace. I also wish to note that I realize that there 
          is no single &#34;American&#34; culture, nor was/is there a singular 
          &#34;American&#34; response to the attacks, but in the use of the 
          term &#34;American&#34; here I am making a generalization for the 
          sake of discussion.)</p><p><b>The Rhetorical Analysis</b></p><p>The tragic events of September 11, 2001, represented 
          a cosmic disjuncture in the world&#39;s social order - at least to our Ameri-centric 
          mindset. Considered a world leader (with both positive and negative 
          connotations of that term), America&#39;s position of strength and prominence 
          was challenged by the terrorist attacks which resulted in the collapse 
          of the WTC and a portion of the Pentagon, as well as the loss of 3000 
          American lives. To understand American&#39;s response to these attacks, 
          it may be helpful to turn to rhetorician and social critic Kenneth Burke&#39;s 
          concept of guilt.</p><p>In <i>Permanence and Change,</i> (as well as elsewhere), 
          Kenneth Burke explains the [cycle of] terms: guilt, purification and 
          redemption as representing the effects of acceptance and rejection of 
          hierarchy[ies], [which he considers multiplicitous and inherent in society] 
          . . . (Burke, 1965). (According to Burke, the need to purge oneself 
          of guilt and this cycle, is the root of all rhetoric (http://www.afirstlook.com/manual5/ed5man22.pdf).) 
          &#34;. . . [T]o deal with rejection [of hierarchy] so common in the 
          social drama, Burke suggests [that] society uses two forms of ritual 
          purification, mortification and/or victimage, as a resolution for guilt. 
          [M]ortification, which involves personal sacrifice by the guilty, in 
          which the individual or group experiencing guilt makes a symbolic offering 
          to appease society and thus restore balance and social order. A person 
          accused of wrongdoing acknowledges it publicly and may offer an explanation 
          or perform some act of remorse. [In victimage, on the other hand, guilt 
          is purged] through [the creation of] a scapegoat, [some external agent] 
          that symbolizes guilt (Scott &amp; Brock, 1972). (Samra <a href="http://acjournal.org/holdings/vol1/iss3/burke/samra.html">http://acjournal.org/holdings/vol1/iss3/burke/samra.html</a>)</p><p>Guilt then for Burke is a natural outgrowth of disjuncture 
          in the ‘normal’ social order. Some might angrily think it 
          heretical to claim that the American people have responded with guilt 
          to the events of September 11, 2001; however, the Burkean concept of 
          guilt, its motivation to produce rhetoric, and the cycle of guilt-purification-redemption 
          are evident in many of our post-9/11 responses. First of all, Americans 
          reacted quickly with a barrage of rhetoric aimed at restoring their 
          presumed role in the world hierarchy. In fact, some of the earliest 
          rhetoric: signs, slogans, and billboards, passionately declared America&#39;s 
          strength, determination, and leader status. The media was flooded with 
          images of that purported strength and superiority. Whether or not our 
          pre-September 11-world view was accurate, our most rapid responses were 
          direct attempts to restore that hierarchy, primarily through scapegoating. 
          (While mortification becomes evident in the writings to be analyzed 
          later in the larger project, accepting self-blame is difficult - along 
          with being undeserved in many instances). Our enemy became the Arab 
          world, and even the most rational individuals were forced to struggle 
          to keep that scapegoat image from growing unchecked and resulting in 
          discrimination toward innocent peoples. </p><p>With time, however, America&#39;s attempts to purify 
          the guilt felt from that disjuncture of the world order have become 
          somewhat more tempered, more multi-modal and multi-vocal, reflecting 
          a wide range of responses. For example, memorialization can be read 
          as a purifying action seeking redemption, and physical memorials and 
          memorials acts sprang up almost instantly. At the Bellevue Wall of 
          Prayer, &#34;created at the First Avenue and 27th Street entrance to 
          Bellevue Hospital&#34; (http://www.mcny.org/Research/behind/Bellvue/behindbellvue.htm), 
          posters looking for those feared lost in the attack, quickly became 
          memorials to the victims pictured there. </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">The Wall, actually a construction-site fence, became 
          a spontaneous bulletin board for posting hundreds of fliers with the 
          images of the lost as well as prayers, poems, and statements of support 
          from surviving New Yorkers and others from around the United States 
          and abroad. From September 11 to November 3, the Wall grew to be approximately 
          200 feet in length </p>
        <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(<a href="http://www.mcny.org/Research/behind/Bellvue/behindbellvue.htm" target="_blank">http://www.mcny.org/Research/behind/Bellvue/behindbellvue.htm</a>). 
        </p><p>This Wall, once intimately rooted to the scene of 
          the tragedy, is now in the custody of the Museum of the City of New 
          York, whose curatorial staff is working with the Smithsonian to determine 
          the best methods of preservation and display. Prayer vigils on site 
          and around the country, moments of silence - first weekly, and then 
          monthly - served as memorial acts and evidenced our purifying efforts.</p><p>The other two crash sites became memorial sites as 
          well. Spontaneous memorials of candles, flowers, photos, signs, and 
          other memorabilia were left at both the Shanksville, PA crash site and 
          on lawns near the Pentagon and the adjacent Arlington National Cemetery, 
          already an established memorial site. The places of this tragedy are 
          linked to their memorialization, and the concept of place has been linked 
          to memory and memorialization, etymologically and metaphorically, since 
          the first mention of memory, at least memory training, beginning with 
          Simonides, a Greek lyric poet (<i>circa</i> 556 to 468 BC). Simonides 
          is credited with having first discovered a means to train memory after 
          being able to identify the victims of a roof collapse after having only 
          recently left the building himself, by mentally reconstructing where 
          each man sat in the room. He inferred from this, that one could train 
          one&#39;s memory by visualizing images in some sort of orderly fashion. 
          This legendary joining of place and memory led to methods of memory 
          training as well as recurring metaphors that have continued the relationship 
          of place and memory, and thereby memorialization, to the present.</p><p>This notion of images stored in places is the beginning 
          of one of two metaphorical strands, identified by Carruthers (1990), 
          which are used to define memory: &#34;memory as a set of waxed tablets 
          upon which material is inscribed, and memory as a storehouse or inventory&#34; 
          (p. 14). A memorial site, like the Bellevue Wall of Prayer, comprised 
          of a collage of individual posters, or even a museum exhibit or Web 
          site, can be seen as a series of cells in a honeycomb or in a pigeon 
          coop, individual yet joined together by like purpose: to memorialize 
          victims, and in Burkean terms to purge our collective selves of guilt.</p><p>Moving the Wall of Prayer off-site changes the dynamics 
          of its memorialization, but it remains a physical memorial. While spontaneous 
          memorials, like roadside markers of crash fatalities or even the Wall 
          of Prayer, frequently spring up at the site of a tragedy, permanent 
          memorials are often constructed off-site for a variety of reasons. 
          First of all, for some survivors and surviving victims, creating a memorial 
          at the actual site may be too painful a reminder, causing rather than 
          healing a prolonged (and often indefinite) period of grief. Furthermore, 
          it may simply not be feasible because of access or lack of public exposure 
          to turn a site of tragedy into a permanent memorial site. </p><p>While plans are underway for multiple, permanent 
          memorial sites, the Smithsonian recently undertook a memorial of national 
          scale. Washington, DC is THE site for national memorials, not only 
          because its location as our nation&#39;s capital affords access to its many 
          visitors, but also because it makes a statement of the gravity and enormity 
          of the event/life being memorialized.</p><p>That memorializing efforts for September 11 have 
          come to Washington, DC should come as no surprise, then. Neither should 
          it be surprising that memorials may actually take a discursive form 
          - more than inscriptions on marble, but words written to inform, to 
          remember, and to memorialize. As in the Bellevue Wall of Prayer, words 
          take on a greater power as they attempt to convey the spirit of the 
          individuals and events they seek to record. While the Bellevue Wall 
          was predominantly contributed to by people in the NYC area, two <i>places</i> 
          where national and international visitors have been able to contribute 
          to this written memorial effort are at The Smithsonian National Museum 
          of American History&#39;s <i>September 11 Bearing Witness to History </i>exhibit 
          and <i>The September 11 Digital Archive</i> (<a href="http://911digitalarchive.org/">http://911digitalarchive.org</a>). 
        </p><p> In the physical-space <i>September 11 Bearing Witness 
          to History </i>exhibit, after viewing photographs like one of Father 
          Mychal Judge, NYFD chaplain and the official first victim of the terrorist 
          attacks, taken moments before his death, and artifacts like twisted 
          pieces of structural steel from the WTC or remnants of damaged rescue 
          equipment, visitors can enter a room with tables, chairs, and writing 
          equipment, where they are invited to write (or draw) in response to 
          the following prompts: &#34;How did you witness history on September 
          11, 2001? What do you most remember, and how has it affected your life?&#34; 
          Telephones are also available, through which visitors can leave their 
          memories in audio format, which will later be transcribed and made available 
          on <i>The September 11 Digital Archive</i>. These writings, private 
          memories recorded to become part of the public discourse displayed on 
          a museum wall (in several locations within the Smithsonian exhibit, 
          contributed writings are displayed for visitors to read) or World Wide 
          Web site, serve as a memorial to the lives, and a way of life lost that 
          day. In Burkean terms, they also serve as a means to achieve redemption.</p><p>The opportunities to write continue at the Smithsonian 
          exhibit&#39;s Web site, http://americanhistory.si.edu/september11/ and <i>T</i><i>he 
          September 11 Digital Archive</i>, http://911digitalarchive.org, a project 
          of the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University and 
          the American Social History Project at the City University of New York 
          Graduate Center (<a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/september11/tellyourstory/index.asp">http://americanhistory.si.edu/september11/tellyourstory/index.asp</a>), 
          where visitors are still prompted to make their memories part of the 
          public record and memorial. (<i>The September 11 Digital Archive</i>, 
          &lt;http://911digitalarchive.org&gt; site is also charged with digitally 
          archiving the writings left by visitors to the physical exhibit at The 
          Smithsonian National Museum of American History.)</p><p>Visitors who have contributed their memories in either 
          venue have likely done so for a variety of reasons. Surviving victims 
          likely seek to bear witness to their own experiences, and to share first-hand 
          accounts of those victims who did not survive. According to Socolovsky 
          (2002), &#34;[t]his archival impulse reflects a desire to make oneself 
          immortal and to cross the boundary created by time, place, and experience,&#34; 
          and Huyssen (1993) notes that &#34;the obsessive self-memorialization 
          per camcorder, memoir, writing, and confessional literature . . . can 
          be said to function as key paradigms in contemporary postmodern culture&#34; 
          (cited in Socolovsky (2002). </p><p>Narrative has a long history as a means of testifying 
          to historical events, so it is only natural that one utilizes narrative 
          to cope with an event as frightening as September 11. World Trade Center 
          survivor Lisa Lefler reports, &#34;I have found one thing to help me 
          get through day by day. I have been telling my story to anyone who 
          wants to hear it.&#34; (http://americanhistory.si.edu/september11/tellyourstory/index.asp). 
          From Odysseus on, victims have chosen to recount their experiences through 
          personal narrative both to bear witness to the experience of themselves 
          and others, and to undergo healing through catharsis. </p><p>&#34;Catharsis&#34; is an ambiguous term, referred 
          to by Aristotle as &#34;&#39;the proper purgation of these emotions,&#39;&#34; 
          and by Plato as &#34;the process of purification by which the soul 
          collects its elements, brings itself together from all parts of the 
          body . . . &#34; (Holman and Harmon, 1992). This catharsis might be 
          likened to Burke&#39;s redemption.</p><p>Psychology has recognized the therapeutic value or 
          putting trauma into words since Joseph Breuer and Sigmund Freud concluded 
          that hysteria was a reaction to psychological trauma, and that, &#34;Hysterical 
          symptoms could be alleviated when the traumatic memories, as well as 
          the intense feelings that accompanied them were recovered and put into 
          words&#34; (Herman 12, emphasis added). Pierre Janet claimed that 
          &#34;To overcome the traumatic reminiscences and the feelings of helplessness 
          the experience had to be &#39;liquidated,&#39; that means: transformed into 
          a <i>personal narrative</i>&#34; (Kleber and Brown 14, emphasis added). 
          Freud maintains that although a victim must exhibit an &#34;adequate 
          reaction&#34; in order to achieve catharsis, &#34;&#39;<i>language serves 
          as a substitute for action</i> . . . &#39;&#34; (Scheff 38). Again emphasizing 
          the importance of language, Freud states that catharsis is most effective 
          &#34;when the patient had described the event in the greatest possible 
          detail and put the affect into words&#39;&#34; (Scheff 38). The importance 
          of words and narrative is evidenced by the best known of Breuer&#39;s patients, 
          Anna O., whom Freud&#39;s biographer claimed &#34;&#39; . . . was the real 
          discoverer of the cathartic method&#39;&#34; (Scheff 28), and who actually 
          named her treatment by Breuer, the &#34;&#39;talking cure&#39;&#34; (Herman 
          12). Even though Freud eventually abandoned Breuer&#39;s &#34;talking 
          cure,&#34; for his own theory of &#34;insight,&#34; what remained 
          constant was that putting trauma into words could bring about healing. 
          As a result, &#34;[m]any psychotherapists and counselors, as part of 
          therapy and counseling, use personal journals to help patients discover 
          their feelings and find closure for unresolved issues in their lives&#34; 
          (Vaught-Alexander 153). </p><p>More recently, psychology professor James Pennebaker 
          has done studies on the effects of victims writing about traumatic events, 
          finding that although the victims may initially feel worse about their 
          experiences, after time has passed, they do seem to have been able to 
          gain insight about the trauma through the writing and reflecting about 
          the traumatic event. </p><p>Beginning first in 1983, with college students, Pennebaker 
          and graduate student Sandra Beall designed a study that allowed them 
          to gauge the effect of writing about traumatic events on subjects&#39; physical 
          health, noted by frequency of health center visits, and their emotional 
          health, determined by answers that the writers gave on surveys, both 
          administered immediately after the writing experience and several months 
          later. The students were divided into four groups and each group was 
          prompted to write about a traumatic event (or in the control group&#39;s 
          case, a trivial event). Those who wrote about traumas, particularly 
          those who wrote about the emotional effects of those traumas, reported 
          feeling worse immediately after the writing experience; however, subsequent 
          surveys, completed four months after the writing experience, reported 
          a marked attitudinal improvement. Furthermore, those students who delved 
          deeply into their feelings about the trauma through their writing visited 
          the health center fifty percent less than those groups who wrote either 
          about only the facts or the emotions of a traumatic event or about superficial 
          topics (Pennebaker, 1990). Although Pennebaker and Beall (1986) discount 
          the notion that writing about traumatic events represents a cathartic 
          release of emotions, because, they believe, such a venting should have 
          resulted in a more positive attitude in the subjects immediately after 
          writing (280), Pennebaker (1990) believes the study indicates that the 
          long-term effect of &#34;writing about their deepest thought and feelings 
          about traumas resulted in improved moods, more positive outlook, and 
          greater physical health.&#34; </p><p>Other &#34;victims&#34; - those whose acquaintances, 
          colleagues, friends, and/or family members died as a result of the crashes 
          on September 11 - suffer the trauma of loss and the rupture of familial 
          or societal hierarchies. Survivor and secondary-survivor guilt, then, 
          can be seen as the result of a disjuncture in these hierarchies: &#34;I 
          lived, and others did not. That&#39;s wrong.&#34; These victims write 
          to purge themselves of that guilt through memorializing the dead.</p><p>Writing about their experiences affords surviving 
          victims a means of healing through gained understanding and insight 
          about their experiences, but whatever healing occurs is also the result 
          of being able to memorialize the dead through their remembrance. In 
          fact, although healing through writing comes from insight that evolves 
          through the process, the actual writing and sharing of these September 
          11 memories is also a memorial act - and being able to memorialize the 
          dead through this commemorative outlet may have a healing power of its 
          own.</p><p>A final group of writer-survivors becomes survivors 
          through identification. By identifying with the victims, and by regarding 
          the attacks as against all Americans, most Americans consider themselves 
          to be survivors of 9/11. And as &#34;survivors,&#34; they suffer 
          from a pseudo, secondary-survivor guilt, from which they seek purgation 
          as well.</p><p>My analysis of these writings has only begun, but 
          all of these motivations are evident in the texts. As a work in process, 
          I have few conclusions, only preliminary observations:</p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li>
          
            A wide variety of emotions are depicted in these writings: anger, 
            rage, sympathy, empathy, sorrow, guilt, remorse, regret, fear, shock, 
            disbelief - and even relief and gratitude.</li>
        <li>
          
            The audiences to which these writings are directed vary, and some 
            texts&#39; audiences shift within the piece. In addition to a general 
            public audience, writings are directed at God; the enemy; the dead,; 
            and their families.</li>
      </ul>
      
        <h1>Writing as Contribution, Writing As Artifact</h1><p>The potential effects of contributing writing to 
          these archival museum exhibits are evident. The question remains: what 
          are the effects that written comment, which becomes contribution, which 
          becomes artifact, have on a virtual exhibit? More than simply an outlet 
          for memories and volatile emotions, the writings submitted to the <i>September 
          11 Digital Archive</i> (&lt;<a href="http://911digitalarchive.org/" target="_blank">http://911digitalarchive.org/</a>&gt;) become 
          much of the meat in the site, drawing more visitors as either contributors, 
          readers, or both. This sort of uber-interactivity makes the virtual 
          museum space a constantly evolving exhibit, with visitors having a greater 
          ownership than ever before.</p>
        <p>Most physical-space museums offer visitors choice 
          - exhibits to see, in whole or in part, exhibits to merely gloss or 
          skip altogether. Although there are certain design techniques in the 
          spatial and temporal arrangements of the museum that can be employed 
          to focus visitors in certain directions, exhibition creators in those 
          settings cannot be sure that visitors will see &#34;Exhibit A&#34; 
          before &#34;Exhibit B,&#34; or that will see &#34;Exhibit A&#34; 
          at all. (One obvious exception to this is the United States Holocaust 
          Memorial Museum. With its strong narrative thread, and nearly uni-directional 
          traffic pattern, visitors are practically guaranteed to be exposed to 
          &#34;Exhibit A&#34; before &#34;Exhibit B.&#34; Of course as with 
          any text, exposure does not guarantee visitor interaction. As Socolovsky 
          (2002) notes, </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Any webpage invites its viewers or readers to sample, 
          rather than master, the online text, and the cursor, signaling the reader&#39;s 
          [visitor&#39;s] presence, can change the text itself, processing and manipulating 
          what appears and replacing one page with another, so that no final or 
          fixed version of the online text exists.) </p><p>The customary visitors&#39; selectivity in the physical-space 
          museum is increased exponentially with the hypertextuality of the Internet, 
          and with that, the role of museum exhibition designer changes. Not 
          only does the designer have little control over how much of or in what 
          order visitors experience the museum site, the designer must also work 
          with the knowledge that the exit is only a click or two away, taking 
          visitors away from the museum as easily as they arrived. While on one 
          hand the powerlessness to fix a determinant museum text can be disconcerting, 
          it also means that the virtual museum exhibition is not limited to its 
          physical holdings (or the representation of those holdings). Links 
          to other sites can actually extend one virtual museum into another, 
          creating a rich tapestry of museum exhibitions through which a visitor 
          can navigate at will. In fact, as sites link to one another, the tapestry 
          changes, thereby ensuring even more multiplicitous museum experiences.</p><p>Allowing visitors to actually contribute to the exhibition 
          as has been done in the Smithsonian Museum of American History&#39;s September 
          11 (2001) exhibit and now at the <i>September 11 Digital Archive</i> 
          (&lt;<a href="http://911digitalarchive.org/" target="_blank">http://911digitalarchive.org/</a>&gt;) clearly changes the overall 
          <i>text</i> of the museum exhibit. In the physical-space Smithsonian 
          exhibit, the area in which visitors were invited to write was less than 
          10% of the total exhibit space, and the spaces provided in several spots 
          throughout the exhibit for the display of these writings-turned-artifacts 
          was insignificant, particularly alongside dramatic objects like pieces 
          of structural steel from the South Tower of the World Trade Center or 
          the panel from a Pentagon Station fire truck. </p>
          <p>In the <i>September 11 Digital Archive</i>, however, 
          visitors are constantly being encouraged to &#34;Be a part of how the 
          history of September 11 gets told!&#34; (&lt;<a href="http://911digitalarchive.org/email/" target="_blank">http://911digitalarchive.org/email/</a>&gt;) 
          by submitting e-mail received on or shortly after September 11, 2001, 
          &#34;photographs, digital creations, or any other image regarding the 
          events of September 11 and their aftermath,&#34; or to join over 10,000 
          others who have told their personal stories of that tragedy. According 
          to Socolovsky (2002), &#34;This archival impulse reflects a desire 
          to make oneself immortal and to cross the boundary created by time, 
          place, and experience.&#34; It would be on overstatement to say that 
          the <i>Digital Archive</i> is largely comprised of visitor contributions, 
          but those contributions do make up a sizeable portion of its holdings. 
          As a result, while the site designers could conceive of the conceptual 
          face of the archive, the distinctive facial features of the exhibit 
          are ever changing and only hazily visible from the designers&#39; more global 
          view.</p>
          <p>This level of visitor contribution to a site&#39;s virtual 
          holdings poses challenges to site designers. Not only do the number, 
          size, and quality of these contributions vary, but issues of suitability 
          and potentially even censorship also come to the fore. In order to 
          maintain site integrity, these contributions may need to be monitored 
          in some way. Just as moderated listservs weigh the appropriateness 
          of posts, so too must these contributions be evaluated for appropriateness.

          <p>Or should they? &#34;Appropriateness&#34; is an 
          enigmatic term—difficult to define, and it varies based on the 
          site&#39;s audience and purpose and of course the visitors&#39; perspective(s). 
          However, when the site deals with an issue as sensitive as the terrorist 
          attacks of September 11 - and one likely to prompt contributors to engage 
          in actionable incidents of hate speech - site-sponsoring institutions 
          walk a narrow line. In late 2002, the 44 country-members of the Council 
          of Europe moved to add an amendment criminalizing hate speech on the 
          Internet (text of the amendment is available at &lt;<a href="http://www.coe.int/T/E/Legal_affairs/Legal_co-operation/Combating_economic_crime/Cybercrime/Racism_on_internet/PC-RX(2002)24E.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.coe.int/T/E/Legal_affairs/Legal_co-operation/ Combating_economic_crime/Cybercrime/Racism_on_internet/PC-RX(2002)24E.pdf</a>&gt;) 
          to the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime (text of the treaty available at 
          &lt;<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm" target="_blank">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm</a>&gt;). 
          The amendment is like a similar call that was deleted from the original 
          2001 Convention in hopes of garnering more signators, who might have 
          been reticent to deal with this freedom of speech issue. While the 
          original 2001 Convention has been signed by 30 nations, including the 
          United States, the amendment has been signed by only 20 nations. One 
          of the most noticeably missing signatures on this amendment thus far 
          is the United States (Schrees, 2002). </p>
          <p>This issue is a difficult one for governments and 
          site designers to deal with. Sites supported by mainstream institutions 
          are even more constrained to avoid the appearance, on one hand, of promulgating 
          hate speech and, on the other hand, of violating free speech rights. 
          Furthermore, the censoring of written contributions such as those submitted 
          to the <i>Digital Archive</i> can easily be perceived of as censorship 
          intended to drive a particular political agenda by silencing particular 
          factions of the population. </p><p>To leave the issue of criminalized Internet hate 
          speech and its conflict with that of free speech aside for a bit as 
          an issue of the extreme, more likely the markers of &#34;appropriateness&#34; 
          need be considered because for many the site serves a memorializing 
          function. Socolovsky (2002) writes, &#34;Archival memory on the Internet 
          comes to mean collection and display,&#34; and as Crane (2000) reminds 
          readers, &#34;Being collected means being valued and remembered institutionally; 
          being displayed means being incorporated into the extra-institutional 
          memory of the museum visitor&#34; On one hand, care must be taken 
          that the contributions do not defame victims, but when for some, all 
          &#34;Americans&#34; and in fact &#34;American-ness&#34; itself has 
          fallen victim, anything less than seemingly blind allegiance to our 
          government can be read as defamation of America&#39;s victimage. (Even 
          as I write these words, I realize that I risk seeming un-American, thereby, 
          defaming those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001.) </p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Allowing for visitor contributions to museum sites 
          like those of the Smithsonian Museum of American History&#39;s September 
          11 (2001) exhibit (physical and virtual) and the <i>September 11 Digital 
          Archive</i> (http://911digitalarchive.org/) presents exhibit designers 
          with numerous challenges; however, the richness of these contributions 
          does more than simply archive history, instead these archival sites 
          actually give the ordinary individual a hand in creating history. Given 
          this richness, and the ownership that it affords site visitors, designers 
          should be encouraged to meld physical holdings and virtual ones from 
          traditional and non-traditional sources to enliven the historical record 
          with the voices of the victims and the survivors—for all those 
          who seek to assuage guilt and to simply remember.</p>
