        <p class="PaperTitle">What Clicked? A Report on Audience Research and Media 
          Resources</p>
        <p class="Author">Diane Herman, Cincinnatus Inc.; Kate Johnson and James 
          Ockuly, Director of Interactive Media, The Minneapolis Institute of 
          Arts, USA</p>

        <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
       <p class="AbstractText">The Minneapolis Institute of Arts has completed 
          a major research and development project — called What Clicks? — 
          assessing its audiences&#39; awareness of, and satisfaction with, its interactive 
          media/Web resources. Following up on last year&#39;s mid-project interim 
          report (Ockuly 2003) this paper will draw some conclusions and discuss 
          lessons learned, insights gained, and other pertinent aspects of the 
          project. The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, an encyclopedic art museum, 
          produces and maintains two Web sites (<a href="http://www.artsmia.org/" target="_blank">http://www.artsmia.org</a> and <a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/" target="_blank">http://www.artsconnected.org</a>  
          — the latter in conjunction with Walker Art Center). It also provides 
          its physical visitors with a host of interactive media programs in the 
          museum itself - from an interactive museum directory to a large number 
          of permanent collection-based programs located throughout the building. 
          The research was designed to a) measure audience awareness of and satisfaction 
          with these resources; b) respond to those findings with improvements; 
          then c) re-measure to gauge the effect of the improvements. A further 
          goal of this project was to share its logic model, methodology, instruments, 
        and findings with the museum community. </p>
        <p class="keywords">Key words: What Clicks?, Audience satisfaction, improvements, 
          logic model, museum evaluation</p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Minneapolis Institute of Arts&#39; (MIA) <i>What 
          Clicks?</i> project was funded by a National Leadership Grant from the 
          Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) for the purpose of evaluating 
          and enhancing the audience effectiveness of the MIA&#39;s digital 
          media resources. The full report is available at <a href="http://www.artsmia.org/what-clicks">http://www.artsmia.org/what-clicks</a> 
          . </p>
        <p>Using multiple research tools and measurements, the 
          <i>What Clicks?</i> project team evaluated the key concepts of visitor 
          awareness, use, and satisfaction as they apply to the museum&#39;s 
          Directory, seventeen Interactive Learning Stations (ILSs) that are immediately 
          adjacent to the galleries, and the MIA&#39;s Web site, artsmia.org. 
          The project included four phases: baseline studies in 2002 to determine 
          initial findings; a period of analysis and interpretation; followed 
          by the enrichment and redesign phase; and concluding with follow-up 
          studies in 2003 to determine the impact of the changes. Various marketing 
          initiatives were undertaken throughout the project to increase awareness 
          of all the technology-based resources offered by the Institute. The 
          overall project goal was to benefit not only the MIA and its audience 
          but also other museums through the publication of the <i>What Clicks?</i> 
          process and findings.</p>
        <h1>Logic Model and Evaluation Plan </h1>
        <p>As specified in the grant, the design of the <i>What 
          Clicks?</i> project used an outcomes based model for program evaluation: 
          the logic model. This model clarified the team&#39;s thinking at the 
          outset of the project. The following key questions helped identify those 
          factors we wanted  and were able to measure: awareness use and satisfaction 
          with three specific applications of technology. </p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li> 
           What are the desired outcomes for each?</li>
        <li> 
           Who will benefit from each? </li>
        <li> 
           What key activities will bring about the 
            intended changes? </li>
        <li> 
           What are the inherent values of the proposed 
            actions?</li>
        <li> 
           What are the - perhaps hidden - assumptions 
            about the actions? </li>
        <li> 
           What kind of lasting impact is expected?</li>
      </ul>
       
        <h1>Key <i>What Clicks?</i> Elements </h1>
        <p>The <i>What Clicks?</i> project included numerous 
          quantitative and qualitative studies both before and after the enrichment 
          and redesign phase: museum visitor surveys, surveys of in-museum technology 
          users, a focus group study of small video monitors in the galleries, 
          a usability lab for the museum&#39;s Directory, Web site visitor surveys, 
          Web site usability labs, a Web site terminology survey, and a thorough 
          analysis of user statistics for the in-museum technologies and the Web 
          site. Following the initial baseline research, the project team concentrated 
          on the following enrichment and redesign activities:</p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li>
           
            Redesign of the Museum Directory </li>
        <li>
           
            Physical modifications to all seventeen ILSs to enhance visibility 
            and usability</li>
        <li>
           
            Testing of small video screens with focused, object-specific content 
            in proximity to works of art</li>
        <li>
           
            Numerous changes to the artsmia.org Web site to improve visitor usability</li>
        <li>
           
            Launch of a comprehensive advertising and promotion plan for the Web 
            site and in-museum technologies</li>
      </ul>
      
        <h1>Museum Directory Findings</h1>
        <p class="caption"><img src="ockuly.fig1.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: Director Redesigned with clear areas" width="400" height="258"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 1: The redesigned Museum Directory is organized 
          in four main sections and emphasizes information to meet the immediate 
          needs of the visitor.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the project, the MIA&#39;s 
          electronic Directory consisted of three touch-screens located in the 
          inner lobby of the museum and, after its redesign, a keyboard and mouse 
          for each screen.  The Directory&#39;s contents include information 
          about special exhibitions, permanent collection galleries, lectures, 
          films, Family Days, tours, membership and amenities such as restrooms, 
          coat check, and cafes. </p>
        <p>The <i>What Clicks?</i> pre and post surveys and 
          a Usability Lab provided direction for a major redesign of the museum&#39;s 
          Directory.  The <i>What Clicks?</i> project team increased visibility 
          with an attract video, larger screens and keyboards; modified the program 
          to include more timely information related to the current visit and 
          added an Art Finder function; and made behind-the-scenes improvements 
          to increase accuracy of the information and reduce staff time to gather 
          and enter it.  As of this writing, additional Directories have just 
          been installed on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> floors of the 
          museum.  Key findings related to the Directory include the following:</p>
        <p><span class="SubHeader">Directory Awareness</span>: 
          Visitors to the museum are surprisingly unaware of the Museum Directory; 
          however, the addition of an attract video and keyboards dramatically 
          increased Directory awareness from 35% in 2002 to 44% in 2003.  Visitors 
          generally became aware of the Directory because they saw it on a visit, 
          suggesting that if a Directory is to benefit visitors, it has to be 
          prominent and inviting. </p>
        <p><span class="SubHeader">Directory Use</span>: About 
          1 in 5 visitors in both 2002 and 2003 said they used the Directory on 
          any previous museum visit, and the primary reason for use was a need 
          for information about a specific exhibition or event, or a general overview 
          of galleries and exhibitions.  Repeat use as measured in 2002 was low 
          (41% had used it previously), and the primary reason for non-use in 
          both years was that visitors did not see a need or already &#39;knew 
          their way around.&#39;  The addition of an Art Finder function was 
          a very positive step because 24% of Directory users in 2003 were motivated 
          to use the Directory &#39;to find a specific work of art.&#39;  
          Duration of use increased to 39% of users reporting 5 minutes or more 
          vs. only 15% in 2002; it is likely that more pertinent and timely Directory 
          content in 2003 held their interest for longer periods.</p>
        <p><span class="SubHeader">Directory Satisfaction</span>: 
          When asked how to improve the Directory, users in 2002 said they wanted 
          information to help them find works of art, more information about current 
          happenings, and additional Directory locations throughout the museum.  
          <i>What Clicks?</i> improvements to the Directory resulted in a dramatic 
          increase in overall satisfaction from 59% of users in 2002 to 77% of 
          users in 2003 reporting they were &#39;extremely or very&#39; satisfied.  
          Similarly, more users in 2003 felt the information was &#39;extremely 
          or very&#39; clear (86% vs. 73% in 2002), and more users in 2003 said 
          they found what they were looking for (92% vs. 82% in 2002.) In addition, 
          high percentages (87% and 88%) in both years found the Directory &#39;extremely 
          or very&#39; easy to use. </p>
        <p><span class="SubHeader">Additional Directory Findings</span>: 
          During the Enrichment and Redesign phase, museum staff learned that 
          they could create a program that drew from existing databases, thereby 
          eliminating the need for redundant and inconsistent updating.  An on-site 
          Usability Lab, which tested the design and function of the new Directory 
          program, yielded insights for improvement and confirmed that the redesign 
          was on track. </p>
        <h1>Interactive Learning Station Findings</h1>
        <p class="caption"><img src="ockuly.fig2.jpg" alt="Photograph: learning stations off the galleries" width="331" height="240"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 2: The Arts of Asia Interactive Learning Station

        <p>The MIA installed its first Interactive Learning 
          Stations (ILSs) in 1990 and now maintains a total of seventeen (17) 
          ILSs immediately adjacent to many of the galleries.  Each ILS concentrates 
          on a specific area of the museum&#39;s permanent collection and is 
          designed to encourage visitors to connect what they learn from the programs 
          with the actual works of art.</p>
        <p>The <i>What Clicks?</i> project team used information 
          from pre and post visitor surveys, focus groups and ILS user statistics 
          to redesign and enhance the ILSs.  Because early research revealed low 
          ILS awareness coupled with high user satisfaction, the team focused 
          primarily on physical changes to the ILSs to increase visibility and 
          promote use. The team&#39;s ability to detect statistically measurable 
          differences from one year to the next was limited somewhat by relatively 
          low sample sizes and the team&#39;s change in focus from only two 
          ILSs in 2002 to a redesign effort that affected all 17 ILSs. In 2003, 
          the team also tested visitor reaction to small video screens with focused 
          content located in direct proximity to specific works of art.</p>
        <p><span class="SubHeader">Learning Station Awareness</span>: 
          In the 2002 survey, half the users said the ILSs were &#39;not very 
          visible&#39; or &#39;easy to miss.&#39;  The team&#39;s efforts 
          to increase ILS visibility led to a significant increase in visitor 
          awareness from 43% to 53% in 2003.  An evaluation of user statistics 
          for all the ILSs further demonstrated that the more visible the individual 
          ILS, the greater the visitor use.  Many ILS users in 2002 (43%) were 
          not aware that other ILSs existed in the museum, and efforts to &#39;cross 
          sell&#39; with rack cards placed within every one of the seventeen 
          ILSs did not achieve measurable improvement at the time of the follow-up 
          surveys.  As with the Directory, the primary source of awareness for 
          ILSs (75% of visitors) is direct observation in the museum. </p>
        <p><span class="SubHeader">Learning Station Use</span>: 
          About a third of museum visitors in both years used the ILSs on a previous 
          visit.  Among ILS users who were surveyed, the majority in both years 
          reported using the ILS for 5 to 14 minutes.  Repeat ILS usage appeared 
          to be relatively low in both years, with more than half identifying 
          themselves as first time users.  The main reason ILS users were motivated 
          to use them was a desire to &#39;learn more about works of art.&#39;  
          The primary stated reason for not using ILS&#39;s among non-users 
          was they &#39;would rather look at art.&#39;</p>
        <p><span class="SubHeader">Learning Station Satisfaction</span>: 
          Due to high ILS satisfaction, the <i>What Clicks?</i> team focused primarily 
          on increasing visibility and usability rather than making changes to 
          content.  Not surprisingly, there were no 2003 increases in the already 
          high satisfaction measures for overall satisfaction, ease of use, clarity 
          of information and amount of information learned while using the ILS.  
          Most important, very high percentages of ILS users (76%) in both said 
          the experience &#39;enhanced their understanding and appreciation 
          of the art.&#39; </p>
        <p><span class="SubHeader">Additional Learning Station 
          Findings</span>: An important finding related to the ILSs in both years 
          was that an overwhelming majority of users (78% in 2002 and 85% in 2003) 
          said they prefer the stations to be &#39;located in the gallery close 
          to the art.&#39;  In addition, a strong majority of ILS users said 
          they preferred the information to be &#39;tied closely to specific 
          works of art in the gallery.&#39;  The percentage of users who preferred 
          only general/background information about art in the gallery declined 
          from 23% in 2002 to 10% in 2003, a statistically significant drop.</p>
        <p> Small LCD Video Displays in the Galleries: As a 
          result of these 2002 findings related to location and content of the 
          ILS&#39;s, the <i>What Clicks?</i> team added a focus group study  
          during the Enrichment and Redesign phase to test the use of small video 
          screens, with object-specific content, in direct proximity to works 
          of art.  Three groups of diverse respondents were exposed to six different 
          installations of the video monitors and interviewed by a moderator at 
          several points during the 2 1/2 hour visit.  </p>
        <h1>Focus Group Conclusions</h1>
        <p>The following are among the key conclusions from 
          the focus group study:  </p>
        <p>The presence of small video displays in the galleries 
          enhanced the visitors&#39; understanding and appreciation of the works 
          of art.  All types of visitors, including those who might be considered 
          more &#39;art savvy,&#39; felt they benefited from the videos.  
          Importantly, the video displays did not detract from the visitors&#39; 
          experience of the works of art; indeed, only a small number of visitors 
          even noticed the video screens upon entering their first gallery.  (Initially, 
          visitors did not know that the videos were the focus of the study.)  
          Most respondents felt that the soft, culturally appropriate music accompanying 
          some of the videos added significantly to their experience.  In some 
          cases, the video displays filled what visitors described as a gap between 
          the more general information provided by museum signs and the labels 
          for specific works of art, creating a mid-level contextual piece that 
          resulted in deeper understanding of the works of art in the room.</p>
        <h1>Web Site Findings</h1>
        <p class="caption"><img src="ockuly.fig3.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: home page" width="400" height="403"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 3: The Minneapolis Institute of Arts&#39; Web site 
          home page.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the study, the museum&#39;s 
          Web site, artsmia.org, provided on-line activities, an event calendar, 
          educational resources, and up-to-the-minute information and previews 
          of current and upcoming exhibitions.  The <i>What Clicks?</i> team evaluated 
          the artsmia.org site with pre- and pos-t on-line surveys of Web site 
          visitors, pre- and post- Usability Lab studies, an analysis of the museum&#39;s 
          Web site statistics, and a survey related to Web site terminology conducted 
          among visitors to the museum.</p>
        <p>Based on the 2002 research which showed relatively 
          high Web site visitor satisfaction and very high repeat visits, the 
          project team&#39;s enrichment and redesign efforts focused on two 
          primary areas:  (1) attracting new visitors to the Web site and (2) 
          making site improvements based on the Usability Lab and Web Terminology 
          research. </p>
        <p><span class="SubHeader">Web Site Awareness</span>: 
          The <i>What Clicks?</i> Pre- and post- museum visitor surveys revealed 
          that more than half museum visitors are aware that the museum has a 
          Web site (54% in 2002 and 59% in 2003). Web site awareness in both years 
          was higher among museum members than non-members. The Web site survey 
          revealed that most visitors find the Web site by using a search engine. 
          At the time of this writing, there were no measurable increases in awareness.</p>
        <p><span class="SubHeader">Web Site Use:</span> Overall, 
          visits to the site based on the MIA&#39;s Web statistics showed that 
          visits continued to grow at an historic increase of 50% per year during 
          the <i>What Clicks?</i> study.  It is unknown whether this growth would 
          have occurred in the absence of the <i>What Clicks?</i> improvements 
          to the site and increased marketing. MIA staff knew from the Web statistics 
          that visitors to the site tended to stay on the site for a relatively 
          long period of time (10 to 12 minutes) and this was confirmed by the 
          Web survey in which 54% said they visited for at least 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>A major finding in the on-line surveys is that a 
          very high percentage of visitors are repeat visitors (78% in both 2002 
          and 2003.)  The ever-changing, content rich site appears to provide 
          ample reason to come back.  The survey research afforded the MIA its 
          first opportunity to learn who, specifically, visits the Web site.  
          Among other demographic findings, the team learned that Web site visitors, 
          in contrast to museum visitors, are younger, live further from the museum, 
          and are more likely to be employed. </p>
        <p>Another important finding confirmed the important 
          relationship between visits to the Web site and the museum itself.  
          In 2003, more Web site visitors had visited the museum (78% vs. 70% 
          in 2002). In addition, more Web site visitors in 2003 said they searched 
          for information to plan a museum visit (52% vs. 38% in 2002).  A Technology 
          Awareness survey of museum visitors revealed that 37% of museum visitors 
          said they had visited the Web site in the past year. One-fourth of Web 
          site visitors are museum members, while one-third of museum visitors 
          are museum members.</p>
        <p><span class="SubHeader">Web Site Satisfaction:</span> 
          The 2002 Usability Lab provided excellent guidance for improving the 
          overall navigability and usability of the site.  Examples of changes 
          made during the redesign period included  making it easier to return 
          to the Home page; clarifying calendar functions; adding gallery locations 
          to specific works of art; improving search functions; and improving 
          the image zoom interface (for examining thousands of permanent collection 
          objects).  These and other changes were retested in the 2003 Usability 
          Lab and in a Terminology Survey among museum visitors. </p>
        <p>The on-line Web surveys indicated that overall satisfaction 
          among Web site visitors was high in both years, with a majority reporting 
          they were &#39;extremely or very&#39; satisfied.  (The increase 
          to 65% in 2003 from 62% in 2002 did not meet tests of statistical significance.)  
          There was an increase in the percentage of visitors who said they found 
          the information on the site &#39;extremely&#39; current (29% vs. 
          24% in 2002). Reassuring to the team was the fact that both the 2002 
          and 2003 surveys revealed that most (80%) of the Web site visitors found 
          what they were looking for.  (An additional 10% said they were not looking 
          for anything in particular.)</p>
        <p>A new survey question in 2003 helped the museum prioritize 
          new ways in which Web site visitors would like to interact with the 
          site.  44% would like to buy tickets to exhibitions and events; 31% 
          want to buy museum shop merchandise; 30% want to sign up for e-mail 
          news and reminders; and 25% want to register for classes. Note: on-line 
          shopping and membership purchase were made available on the site just 
          after the follow-up research was conducted.  The relative success of 
          on-line membership purchases and renewals has been a surprise.</p>
        <p><span class="SubHeader">General Web Site Findings:</span> 
          A key finding of both the Usability Lab and the Web Site Terminology 
          Survey was that terminology familiar to museum staff may not be clear 
          and meaningful to the Web site visitor.  For example, terms such as 
          interactive media and on-line programs are part of the internal language 
          of MIA staff, referring to collection-based on-line thematic programs 
          (e.g., <i>Modernism</i>, <i>Arts of Asia</i>); these were sometimes 
          confusing for Web site visitors.  </p>
        <p>However, an important finding of the Web statistics 
          evaluation of the Top 10 areas of the site reveals that nearly half 
          of Web visitation is going to these very programs that appear to be 
          ineffectively named in the menu.  Many of these programs are also available 
          within the museum via the ILSs.  Thus, with its Web site, the museum 
          is able to extend the reach of its rich collection into the homes of 
          many more people than those directly served within the walls of the 
          museum, and to reach multiple audiences with related program content. 
        </p>
        <h1>Marketing Findings </h1>
        <p>When the 2002 baseline surveys indicated that satisfaction 
          is relatively high for all the MIA&#39;s technologies and that awareness 
          is relatively low, the <i>What Clicks?</i> project team turned its attention 
          to marketing.  What could be done to increase awareness, and ultimately, 
          use, for all the technologies?  Numerous marketing strategies and tactics 
          were developed and implemented, including new or revised print and collateral 
          materials, television and radio advertising, on-line advertising, a 
          public relations campaign and training of staff to encourage visitor 
          use of available resources.   </p>
        <p><span class="SubHeader">Marketing Findings for In-Museum 
          Technologies</span>: Despite the stepped-up marketing for the Museum 
          Directory and Interactive Learning Stations, the overwhelming driver 
          of awareness continues to be direct observation while on a museum visit.  
          There was a small but significant increase in users who became aware 
          of the ILSs through Institute mailings and publications.  Eight out 
          of 10 Directory users in both pre- and post- surveys became aware of 
          the Directory on a museum visit.  This finding does not suggest, however, 
          that marketing of in-museum technology is ill-advised.  Rather, because 
          most of this advertising is free in the sense that the museum&#39;s 
          communications would occur in any event, it is only a matter of including 
          references to museum technologies.</p>
        <p><span class="SubHeader">Marketing Findings for the 
          Web site</span>: The Web marketing part of the <i>What Clicks?</i> study 
          was particularly informative because MIA staff had had little experience 
          with Web marketing prior to the project.  Using a test-retest approach, 
          MIA marketing staff learned that on the Web, targeted messages to targeted 
          audiences delivered the greatest results.  For example, local media 
          sites, such as the local newspaper, delivered higher click-throughs 
          than less targeted national sites.  Similarly, the highest coupon redemption 
          from all on-line advertising came from direct, personalized e-mail messages 
          to self-selected e-mail group lists.  Designing an ad for on-line advertising 
          is similar to creating ads for other advertising media in that larger, 
          eye-catching ads with compelling messages do best.  On the other hand, 
          movement must be used carefully; too much movement may offend some viewers 
          and movement may take up too much file space to be practical.  The efforts 
          of <i>What Clicks?</i> to test on-line advertising failed to demonstrate 
          that it is an effective way to drive museum attendance.</p>
