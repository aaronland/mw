       <p class="AbstractText">Can virtual library and museum collections offer 
          significant advantages over traditional physical displays? Clearly there 
          are benefits in avoiding the natural temporal and spatial limitations 
          of physical collections: location, opening hours, display space; but 
          what other opportunities do new technologies offer? Can such collections 
          overcome the problems that traditional curatorial/cataloguing taxonomies 
          sometimes present for users? Can they ever be a viable alternative to 
          the physical, or do they serve a different or complementary purpose? 
          How important is the physical, tactile nature of artefacts to the user? 
          This paper outlines the processes involved in the creation of three 
          virtual resources at the University of Aberdeen: an on-line museum collection, 
          and two library projects that focus on specific aspects of the region&#39;s 
          history. It details how these resources were enhanced by the careful 
          use of new technologies. The authors argue that virtual spaces can indeed 
          complement traditional collections if properly researched, resourced 
          and designed. Moreover, the virtual world can present exciting opportunities 
          for placing materials in new contexts where meaningful relationships 
          can be drawn. The authors contend that in addition to widening access 
          for traditional audiences, virtual collections may also enable access 
          for a different demographic; one that would not normally use libraries 
        or museums. </p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1><p>The University of Aberdeen is an ancient university, 
          and in common with other historic institutions has large collections 
          of rare manuscripts, printed books, archival material and artefacts. 
          Whilst the University&#39;s Historic Collections Division makes every effort 
          to promote and exploit this rich heritage, it is inevitably limited 
          in its activities by traditional obstacles: resources, time, space, 
          and the difficulty of raising awareness to audiences who are not necessarily 
        close at hand.</p><p>The University is not alone in facing these types 
          of issues and historically there have been considerable initiatives 
          by government and other parties to facilitate the exploitation of these 
          &#39;locked&#39; resources via new technologies. Whereas previously it could 
          be argued that such developments lacked central vision and co-ordination, 
          there are now significant recognised national standards and programmes 
          for the development of such collections. Two of the most widely recognised, 
        <i>nof-digitise</i> and <i>JISC&#39;s Learning and Teaching (5/99) Programme 
        </i>are discussed herein.</p><p>The paper outlines the processes involved in the 
          creation of three virtual resources at the University of Aberdeen: an 
          on-line museum collection, and two library projects that focus on specific 
          aspects of the region&#39;s history. It details how these resources were 
          enhanced by the considered use of new technologies, and outlines evaluation 
        processes. Technical details are also covered in brief. </p>
      <h1>LEMUR - LEarning with MUseum Resources</h1><p>LEMUR is a 3 year project funded by the JISC&#39;s Learning 
          and Teaching (5/99) Programme that aims to provide wider access to the 
          University of Aberdeen&#39;s historical collections. It is a digital collection, 
          a database currently of 3500 images and accompanying text, available 
          through the Web. The LEMUR database brings together a wealth of material 
          from the University&#39;s collections that can be used for teaching in the 
          Arts, Social Sciences and Sciences not only at Aberdeen but also more 
          widely throughout the Higher Education community. High quality digital 
          images and the basic computer catalogue are enhanced with contextualising 
          material, such as early hand-written inventories and letters from the 
          collectors, as well as a virtual re-creation of the displays at Marischal 
        Museum.</p><p>The objects depicted in LEMUR come from the Marischal 
          Museum, the University Art Collection, the Natural Philosophy Collection, 
          Special Libraries and Archives and the Herbarium, as well as from collections 
        held by the Departments of Zoology and Geology.</p><p>Marischal Museum was established in 1786. Today the 
          collection consists of around 70,000 items, donated by graduates, staff 
          and friends of the University over the centuries. Many objects are of 
          national significance, with particular strengths in Scottish prehistory, 
          Scottish militaria, African and Oceanic ethnography, Classical coins 
        and Egyptology.</p><p>The Natural Philosophy Collection is part of the 
          University&#39;s School of Physics, and is one of the finest of its type 
          in the UK. The collection contains over 2,000 items spanning two and 
          a half centuries, from mid eighteenth-century astronomical equipment 
        to late twentieth-century digital computers. </p><p>LEMUR&#39;s objectives are to:</p>
      <ol class="listwithbullets">
        <li>          demonstrate the value of university museum 
            and gallery collections in the delivery of Higher Education teaching 
        and in enhancing the learning process </li>
        <li>          enhance the Distributed National Electronic 
            Resource (DNER) (<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=dner_home" target="_blank">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=dner_home</a>) 
            through integrated resources utilising important museum, gallery and 
        archive collections </li>
        <li> 
           increase access to important material in 
            the collections of the University of Aberdeen for teaching and learning 
        across the Higher Education community </li>
        <li> 
           create digital surrogates of fragile or 
            rare material in the collections of the University of Aberdeen, enabling 
            its use for teaching and learning both in the classroom and at a distance 
        </li>
        <li> 
           enhance the teaching of specific courses 
        through the use of teaching packages using these digital resources</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="Section1"><p>LEMUR is thus a resource which is designed both for 
          local curricular needs and those of the broader Higher Education (HE) 
          community. Its products are therefore designed both to be tailored to 
          the specific requirements of teaching and learning within the University 
          and to be a valuable resource in a much broader sense to a much wider 
          audience. Its potential usefulness to the museum and the university 
          as an interface with the general public is also acknowledged, as will 
          later be addressed.</p><p>A variety of factors made the case for the on-line 
          provision of digitised resources from these collections: </p>
        <p class="listwithbullets"><span class="SubHeader">Conservation</span>: 
          the fragility of many of these objects has made access difficult in 
          the past. </p>
        <p class="listwithbullets"><span class="SubHeader">Lack of display space</span>: 
          access to the collections is made difficult by the lack of available 
          space in which to display them and as a result curatorial staff have 
          to be highly selective in choosing items for display. Items on display 
          at any one time represent only a small proportion of the collections.</p>
        <p class="listwithbullets"><span class="SubHeader">Physical access</span>: 
          it is necessary to visit the museum or collection in person in order 
          to access its resources. This is an issue for local as well as distant 
          users: the Marischal Museum, for example, is located some distance from 
          the main campus and opening hours may not suit all users. Wheelchair 
          access is problematic due to museum&#39;s location on the first floor 
          of a traditional building. Aberdeen is the UK&#39;s most northerly 
          university city, precluding casual usage and placing considerable burdens 
          on those determined enough to visit from outside the local area.</p>
        <p class="listwithbullets"><span class="SubHeader">Awareness</span>: many 
          people are simply not aware of the existence of the museum due to limited 
          resources for promotion and its physical location within university 
          premises.</p><p>LEMUR has produced two primary, interlinked Web-based 
          deliverables:</p>
      </div>
      <ol class="listwithbullets">
        <li> 
          <div class="MsoBodyText"><strong>A search facility for the complete LEMUR 
            catalogue</strong>: This enables free-text searching of the 
            whole catalogue by a range of criteria. Using a format familiar to 
            users of many other museum and image databases, users can select individual 
            items from the matching results to examine the full, illustrated item 
            record. </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class="MsoBodyText"><strong>The Marischal Virtual Museum: </strong>A 
            virtual representation of the Marischal Museum in which the spaces, 
            displays and objects within the museum can be explored. Floor plans 
            for each room can be selected which give access to individual displays 
            which in turn give access to illustrated records for each object therein. 
            360 degree panoramic views at key viewpoints in the museum are also 
            available from the floor plans, enabling the user to see the displays 
            in the context of the museum&#39;s spaces. The Virtual Museum is 
            built on the LEMUR database, using the subset of objects physically 
            located in the Marischal Museum.</div>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="Section1"><p>In addition to these two primary deliverables, discrete 
          teaching packages have been and can continue to be developed, using 
          the database and/or the image library.</p>
        <h2>Technical Information</h2><p>The primary components around which the deliverables 
          are built are the museum catalogue database and the image collection. 
          The database software is MySQL and the images are stored in JPEG format, 
          affording a compression ratio of c90%, which typically reduced a c1MB 
          image file to c100K. The Web site itself was created in PHP, producing 
          HTML output with some JavaScript for non-critical applications, e.g. 
          mouseovers.</p><p>Objects were photographed, where practical, in a 
          studio environment on slide film for maximum clarity. Due to the large 
          number of images required an external contractor was employed to make 
          high resolution scans which were written to CD in batches of 100-150. 
          These were then supplied to the site developer to be reduced to a suitable 
          size for Web use and added to the on-line collection. Quality control 
          procedures were exercised by museum staff after scanning and after Web-mounting.</p>
        <h2>Development</h2><p>Academic staff from Physics, History of Art, Cultural 
          History and History and Philosophy of Science worked with IT specialists 
          and museum curators from the outset: selecting objects; deciding how 
          they would be photographed; updating catalogues; writing captions, and 
          developing new teaching packages. The core project team undertaking 
          development of the Web site comprised a Project Manager (the Senior 
          Curator of the museum), a Curatorial Assistant, a photographer and the 
          Web site developer.</p><p>Initial requirements called for an &#34;on-line 
          database&#34; and &#34;virtual museum&#34;. These would be built 
          on the museum&#39;s existing catalogue, held in a Cardbox database. 
          The catalogue&#39;s data format is based on the SPECTRUM museum documentation 
          standard developed by the Museums Documentation Association (1997), 
          a format which accommodates an extensive range of fields allowing for 
          rich descriptions of objects. The catalogue was extracted to a comma 
          delimited text file and uploaded into the MySQL database. The publicly 
          available fields are a cut-down selection of the full database records.</p>
        <h2>Database Search Tool</h2><p>Development of the Web interface for searching the 
          database needed to take into account the needs of both casual/novice 
          and specialist/expert users. A design was chosen which will be familiar 
          to users of similar applications for searching image-oriented databases, 
          with results returned as rows of thumbnail images and summary information. 
          The search tools provide a default behaviour which will be familiar 
          to users whose only prior experience of searching on the Web is Google 
          or Amazon; augmented by tools to specialise, broaden or blend searches, 
          including Boolean terms. Display options allow criteria for ordering 
          results to be changed and an alternative output in a timeline format.</p>

        <p class="caption">FIG. 1: Results returned by the LEMUR search interface</p><p>Users can select objects from the results to examine 
          in greater detail. Upon selecting a result they are presented with the 
          full (public) record for the object alongside a larger image. Thumbnails 
          of all other images available of the object are displayed beneath the 
          record. All images can be selected to show the largest available version. 
          If the item is held in the Marischal Museum, a link is provided to the 
          Marischal Virtual Museum (see below) and the display case or area in 
          which it resides.</p>

        <p class="caption">FIG. 2: Full object record</p>
        <h1>The Marischal Virtual Museum</h1><p>The Virtual Museum was developed in response to a 
          requirement for a package which would give a virtual experience of visiting 
          the displays of Marischal Museum and to reveal the processes behind 
          the creation of the displays. In contrast to the database search capability, 
          where finding individual objects is the primary function, the Virtual 
          Museum aims to provide context and meaning for the collections, exploring 
          relationships between objects.</p><p>Although initial discussions discussed the notion 
          of a &#34;virtual walk-through&#34; and an entirely immersive 3D 
          Virtual Reality experience, it became clear that while this approach 
          might appear impressive it would be limited in its educational value. 
          Instead, a floor plan based navigational structure was chosen which 
          would allow users to browse areas (broad themes) of interest and then 
          focus on individual displays for further information and access to individual 
          objects. This provides a big-picture view from the museum as a whole, 
          down successively to broad themes, individual collections, individual 
          displays and finally to the objects themselves. In this way both the 
          character and layout of the museum and the history and rationale of 
          the collections can be understood. A series of 3-dimensional QTVR (Quicktime 
          Virtual Reality) sequences, accessed from the floor plans, give added 
          spatial context to the museum, enabling users to see how the museum 
          appears to the visitor and how the spaces inside are used.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="mcconnell.fig3.jpg" alt="virtual museum plan" width="400" height="250"/></p>
        <p class="caption">FIG. 3: The Marischal Virtual Museum</p><p>An A-Z index of topics and collections was added 
          to in order to make the site more accessible a) to visually impaired 
          users and b) to those searching for a particular topic or collection 
          or an overview of the museum&#39;s contents.</p>
        <h2>Problems Encountered in Development</h2>
        <h3>Requirements specification and setting expectations:</h3><p>LEMUR was in some senses a highly experimental development 
          and represented a major move into integrating technology with teaching 
          for the academic partners, some of whom had had little experience in 
          this area. Inevitably there were instances of confusion where assumptions 
          were made tacitly which later resulted in the requirement for a re-think 
          of methodology. This underlines the need for thorough requirements specifications 
          at an early stage and to set expectations at a reasonable level.</p><p>Specifying requirements was further complicated by 
          the multiple audiences and purposes of LEMUR, and particular attention 
          had to be paid to balancing the needs of the various stakeholders: teaching 
          staff&#39;s requirement for specific materials; the university&#39;s 
          desire to broadcast the riches of its collection and make them widely 
          available; the institutional aims of the funding bodies.</p>
        <h3>Quality issues with data:</h3><p>The collection catalogues from which the LEMUR database 
          was built were designed for use by their creators and serious issues 
          surfaced when they were converted for use by a general audience on the 
          Web. Quality of data was known to be an issue beforehand, but was made 
          evident when the first Web prototypes were produced which clearly displayed 
          items with missing and erroneous data and incorrect pictures. </p>
        <h3>Image quality:</h3><p>In spite of rigorous quality control procedures it 
          was found that image quality across platforms and displays was highly 
          variable, and this continues to be the case. Colour balance and brightness 
          are well known to vary between, for example, Mac and PC, but we have 
          found that, even on the same platform, colour and brightness in certain 
          images can vary to an extraordinary degree. Individual monitor settings 
          are only part of the problem, as tests run across a wide range of machines 
          at the university showed little consistency. In some cases the only 
          solution has been to create two copies of an image with, for example, 
          one suited to darker screens and one to lighter screens.</p>
        <h3>Conflicting Objectives</h3><p>Consideration needed to be given to the differing 
          needs of the stakeholders involved. This was a factor which complicated 
          requirements specifications: there was potential tension between the 
          university institutional desire to improve resources for its own students, 
          the university&#39;s desire to broadcast the riches of its collection 
          and make them widely available and the institutional aims of the funding 
          bodies.</p>
        <h2>Evaluation:</h2><p>Evaluation of LEMUR is in progress at the time of 
          writing; both internally and externally (the latter by JISC, the funding 
          body, who will report shortly). Feedback both from formal and informal 
          evaluation has been encouraging. Informal feedback from staff noted 
          that &#34;an unusually high quality of debate has been observed amongst 
          the participating students&#34;. </p><p>Laboratory testing was undertaken in the form of 
          a task-based exercise with a cohort of 15 students. Initial returns 
          from a recent questionnaire survey suggest a highly positive impression. 
          Positive comments focus on the extent of information available, strong 
          sense of &#34;where you are&#34; in the Virtual Museum and the ability 
          to navigate quickly around the museum. </p><p>Formal results of evaluation are expected to be available 
          in early 2004. </p>
        <h1>Library projects</h1>
        <h2>Background </h2><p>The University of Aberdeen&#39;s library collections 
          are rich in resources of unique historical significance, particularly 
          in materials relating to the North-East of Scotland. The University&#39;s 
          Historic Collections Division has extensive experience in digitising 
          such material for on-line delivery, and has in recent years created 
          several popular Web based resources that bring its collections to a 
          wider audience.</p><p>This section discusses the development of two new 
          collections that draw on these materials, <i>The Music of James Scott 
          Skinner </i>and<i> The Voice of Radicalism</i>. These projects were 
          largely funded by the New Opportunities Fund, a charitable organisation 
          funded by the UK National Lottery that awards grants to education, health 
          and environment projects throughout the UK. The objectives of the projects 
          support the broader aims of the New Opportunities Fund; that is, to 
          provide the wider public, community groups, education communities and 
          the like with an easy means of access to material either hitherto unpublished 
          or difficult to obtain, and to ensure that such resources are accessible 
          for future generations.</p><p>At the time of writing, <i>The Music of James Scott 
          Skinner </i>resource has been completed and successfully launched; the 
          final evaluation report is due for publication shortly. The process 
          followed and lessons learned from this project have formed a useful 
          template for <i>The Voice of Radicalism</i>.</p>
        <h2>The Music of James Scott Skinner </h2><p>James Scott Skinner (1843 –1927) was a key 
          figure in Scottish traditional music who was renowned for his playing 
          and compositions. <i>The Music of James Scott Skinner</i> (http://www.abdn.ac.uk/scottskinner/)is 
          a Web based learning and research resource that details Skinner&#39;s life 
          and work. </p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="mcconnell.fig4.jpg" alt="home page screen shot james scott skinner" width="400" height="235"/></p>
        <p class="caption">FIG. 4: The Music of James Scott Skinner</p><p>The site is based around a large collection of manuscript 
          and printed music, letters, published texts, images, videos and archive 
          audio excerpts created and sourced by The University of Aberdeen and 
          its project partners, including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
           
            A comprehensive, searchable database charting Skinner&#39;s life 
        and music </li>
        <li>
          
            Skinner&#39;s handwritten copies of his work <i>The Harp &amp; Claymore

        <li>
          
        Archive audio excerpts of Skinner recordings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The site additionally includes work by Skinner&#39;s 
          contemporaries and also draws upon the University&#39;s substantial collection 
          of Scottish music, some of which dates back to the beginning of the 
          eighteenth century. The resource thus attempts to show how Scottish 
        traditional music has developed over the past three hundred years.</p>
      <p>Multimedia elements illustrate dances as Skinner 
          taught them and archive audio excerpts of Skinner recordings demonstrate 
          the distinctions between the different types of melody which are not 
        always apparent to contemporary listeners.</p>

      <h2>Project Process</h2>
      <p>The Web site was created by the University of Aberdeen&#39;s 
          Historic Collections department, in collaboration with Aberdeen City 
          Council, Aberdeenshire Council and Angus Council. The project team comprised 
          one full time project officer and a project manager, director and board 
          who oversaw the site&#39;s development, and coordinated input by the project 
          partners and other interested parties. Additional technical expertise 
          was provided by the University&#39;s Audio Visual Unit and the site was 
          designed and authored by a WWW author from the University&#39;s central 
        Web team.</p>
      <p>The project was completed over a period of 18 months.</p>
      <h3>Technical data</h3>
      <p>It was a requirement of the funding body that the 
          Web resource complied with the <i>nof-digitise</i> standard (<a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/nof/support/" target="_blank">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/nof/support/</a>); 
          a national standard for development of resources created under the New 
          Opportunities Fund programme (<a href="http://www.nof.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.nof.org.uk/</a>). 
          This standard makes recommendations on specific technologies utilised 
          by developers in order to ensure the accessibility and longevity of 
          the ensuing resources. Requirements state that materials should, where 
          possible be presented in non-proprietary formats. An additional requirement 
          of these projects was the creation of appropriate Dublin Core (<a href="http://dublincore.org/" target="_blank">http://dublincore.org/</a>) 
        meta data.</p>
      <p>Images were scanned at 300ppi using UMAX Power Look 
          1100 Flatbed, saved as TIFF files for archiving, and then converted 
          to JPEG format for display on the Web. It was imperative that the compression 
          process did not jeopardise the legibility of the documents and thus 
        further compression of the resultant JPEGs was minimal.</p>
      <p>Videos were captured using digital video tape and 
          then edited into appropriate clips using Adobe Premier. The clips were 
          then compressed using Sorenson Squeeze, which creates Macromedia Flash 
          files. After considerable deliberation, Flash was chosen for the video 
          clips, because although a proprietary format, it offered the by far 
          best compression without loss of quality. As it was essential that the 
          video clips were accessible to the widest possible audience (in particular 
          those using slower connections), it was considered that the desirability 
          of effective compression outweighed the proprietary format in this instance. 
          As a concession to the funder&#39;s requirements, and for those clients 
          who do not wish to install Flash, the clips are also available in streamed 
          Mpeg 4; a non-proprietary format. Audio material is presented in MP3 
          format; another non-proprietary format that offers good file compression 
        in is in widespread use. </p>
      <p>A MySQL database was created to store the information 
          about each artefact. This database was populated by the project officer 
          via a Web interface. The database includes the record fields as they 
          appear on the public site and additionally a number of fields including 
          appropriate Dublin Core meta information for each record. PHP is used 
          to interrogate the database and display the records and images. Both 
        PHP and MySQL are non-proprietary, open-source formats.</p>

      <p class="caption">FIG. 6: A database record displayed on the site</p>
      <h2>Evaluation</h2>
      <p>After launch, the site immediately generated a considerable 
          amount of informal positive feedback. It was decided that a more formal 
          evaluation process should take place in order to elicit user feedback 
          on the project design; whether the site was accessible and usable to 
          users; whether it met NOF criteria, and additionally to report on server 
        logs, which give an indication of the site usage.</p>
      <p>A sample of users was selected from the audience 
          invited to the official launch of the Website. This audience included 
          pupils from local schools, retired and working people. Other users were 
          selected from appropriate organisations, including subscribers to the 
        <i>North East Ceilidh</i> list, a Yahoo user group dedicated to Ceilidhs 
          and traditional music and dance events in North-East Scotland; a Web 
          site dedicated to Celtic music (http://www.footstomping.com/); and ALP 
          Scots Music Group, a community education project based in Edinburgh 
          which aims to make the traditional music, song and dance of Scotland 
          widely available to everyone. As an incentive for completing the questionnaire, 
          the University offered a prize draw of a Scott Skinner audio CD and 
        a calendar. </p>
      <p>The sample users were contacted by letter and requested 
          to complete a short questionnaire which could be returned either in 
          Web form (<a href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/scottskinner/survey/" target="_blank">http://www.abdn.ac.uk/scottskinner/survey/</a>) 
          or hard copy. The questionnaire sought feedback on the usability of 
          the Web site; its colour scheme; navigational aids; the quality and 
          usability of the multimedia materials and some basic demographic information 
        about the users.</p>
      <p>Responses were received from a wide demographic: 
          72% working people, 19% retired, 16% at university or college and 3% 
          at school. Feedback was encouraging, with 94% of people rating the site 
          design as good or excellent; 76% stating that the site was easy to navigate, 
          and 73% reporting no problems with using the site. Problems/issues that 
          were reported related to download times for video clips and images. 
          Additionally some broken links were reported, all of which have now 
        been repaired.</p>
      <p>In addition to the questionnaire feedback, the site 
          was evaluated for accessibility against the <i>TechDIS Seven Precepts 
          of Usability and Accessibility</i> (<a href="http://www.techdis.ac.uk/seven/precepts.html" target="_blank">http://www.techdis.ac.uk/seven/precepts.html</a>) 
          by the University&#39;s resident accessibility expert. Some concerns were 
          raised regarding text alternatives for video clips and advice was offered 
          on how the site might be adjusted to allow text-readers to skip navigational 
        elements. These issues will be addressed in the near future. </p>
      <p>The process followed during the development of the 
          Scott Skinner site and the evaluation results are currently informing 
          the development of the other NOF funded resource, <i>The Voice of Radicalism</i>. 
          It is hoped that the lessons learned will result in cost and time savings 
        for the project team.</p>
      <h2>The Voice of Radicalism</h2>
      <p><i>The Voice of Radicalism</i> (<a href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/diss/historic/radicalism/" target="_blank">http://www.abdn.ac.uk/diss/historic/radicalism/</a>), 
          like the Skinner site, exploits resources from the University of Aberdeen&#39;s 
          Historic Collections Division and presents these resources in a meaningful 
          context. The project charts the development of people&#39;s rights during 
          the 19th century by focusing on events in the North East of Scotland. 
          The Web resource presents a rich array of contemporary materials, including 
          political articles from newspapers and journals, prints, squibs and 
          ephemera such as handbills and song sheets, and is augmented by audio 
        recordings of political ballads that relate to some of these themes.</p>
      <p>It is intended that the materials presented will 
          be additionally contextualised by sections on themes such as the Reform 
          Acts, Chartism, political and social grievances, trade-unions, the rise 
          of the Labour Party and the women&#39;s suffrage movement. Multimedia elements 
          will include recordings of political ballads that relate to some of 
        these themes.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>The development of <i>The Music of James Scott Skinner</i> 
        site was relatively problem free; problems that did arise were mainly 
        technical ones related to video compression. However, it became clear 
        that the project team had given little initial thought as to how the 
        database records would display on the Web; probably because they were 
        regarding the database primarily as a cataloguing tool. This meant that 
        several readjustments to site sections and to the database were required 
        in order to accommodate new fields and to flag others for Web display. 
        These could have been avoided by clearer specification at the outset. 
      </p>
      <p>The success of <i>The Music of James Scott Skinner</i> 
        is arguably at least partly due to the highly specific nature of the 
        project and the obvious benefits multimedia elements lend to the particular 
        subject. It will be interesting to see if <i>The Voice of Radicalism</i> 
        achieves the same degree of widespread popularity, given the nature 
        of the materials.</p>
      <h1>Conclusions</h1>
      <p>It is proposed that the examples discussed above 
          succeed as resources because as virtual exhibits they offer significant 
          advantages over traditional physical displays. First and most obviously, 
          the collections represented by these projects are no longer physically 
          difficult to access. The spatial and temporal barriers inherent to physical 
          locations are removed: users can access the resources at any time, from 
          anywhere in the world. Mobility-impaired users are not impeded and the 
          visually impaired can access the sites with a talking browser. Objects 
          not normally on display due to lack of space can be examined; fragile 
          objects can be examined without putting them at risk. Historical artefacts 
          are freed from boxes, shelves and stores, enabling their examination 
        by anyone, anywhere, anytime with a Web browser.</p>
      <p>As well as spatial/temporal barriers, other barriers 
          are broken down: results from the evaluation of the resources also suggest 
          (encouragingly) that the use of virtual space not only widens access 
          in terms of usage of the resources, but also may widen access to such 
          collections to a different demographic; one that would not normally 
          use libraries or museums. It could be argued that in the virtual world, 
          users remain in control and are not limited or intimidated by traditional 
        or &#39;expert&#39; barriers such as cataloguing systems or curatorial taxonomies.</p>
      <p>Widening access to materials is not the only benefit 
          of these Web resources: in reconsidering how to present the materials 
          and recontextualising for the Web, these virtual spaces present us with 
          possibilities for placing a disparate range of materials in a context 
        where meaningful relationships between them can be explored. </p>
      <p>In the case of Scott Skinner, this involved setting 
          Skinner&#39;s work in its historical context; comparing it with that of 
          his contemporaries and also placing it in the context of the canon of 
          Scottish traditional music. Such comparisons could not easily be made 
          in the traditional physical environs of the library for various reasons: 
          cataloguing, the collection being dispersed in various locations; access 
          restrictions to rare/fragile manuscripts, etc.. The multimedia elements 
          moreover provide an immediately obvious enhanced experience for the 
        site users.</p>
      <p>In the case of LEMUR the combination of a searchable 
          database and the extensive contextualisation provided by the Virtual 
          Museum mean that the user no longer sees objects from the catalogue 
          as individual, disparate items, rather as members of collections which 
          themselves have a rationale and history. Meaning is imparted to objects 
          by their relationships and associations. Users are provided with a space 
          in which they can see a &#34;bigger picture&#34; which they can 
          explore to see how individual parts are related to each other and to 
        the whole.</p>
      <p>Although not a primary objective, a welcome outcome 
          has been that the LEMUR project has also stimulated research at the 
          museum: the close attention paid to each item as it was photographed 
          and its database records checked revealed new insights into several 
          objects, including some whose very nature or purpose has been reassessed 
          (Curtis and Taylor, 2002). The process has also had the highly beneficial 
          effect of improving the accuracy and completeness of the database record. 
          Moreover, the manner in which the database records are displayed in 
          Web interfaces (images and text presented together in a more user-friendly 
          format than the old Cardbox system) has brought to notice inaccuracies, 
          inconsistency and incompleteness in the data. This has provided the 
        impetus for the museum to make the necessary improvements.</p>
      <p>After singing the praises of the Web, it is well 
        to consider some caveats and highlight pitfalls.</p>
      <p>A virtual collection is likely to be selective in 
          what it presents: users must understand if this is the case. Not only 
          objects are the subject of selectivity: the capabilities and functionality 
          of the virtual resource are defined by the creators: the views available, 
          the places you can go - users may wish to see &#34;the side not pictured&#34;, 
          or see one aspect in more detail than the photography and image size 
          allows. In virtual environments you see only what its creators want 
          you to see, or thought that you wanted to see. If the context is an 
          important part of the experience of viewing an object, this must be 
          conveyed. If a museum is more than the sum of the objects it holds, 
          virtual counterparts need to consider what else it is they are trying 
        to convey.</p>
