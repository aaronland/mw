          Cloth &amp; Clay: Communicating Culture</p>
        <p class="Author">John Dalrymple and Roxane Shaughnessy, Textile Museum 
          of Canada; Barbara J. Soren, Independent Consultant; Diane Wolfe, Gardiner 
          Museum of Ceramic Art, Toronto, Canada</p>
        <p class="URL"><a href="http://www.textilemuseum.ca/cloth_clay/home.html" target="_blank">http://www.textilemuseum.ca/cloth_clay/home.html</a></p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
         <p class="AbstractText"><i>Cloth &amp; Clay: Communicating Culture</i> is 
          an on-line exhibition developed by the Textile Museum of Canada and 
          the Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art. It explores over 2,000 years of 
          Mexican, Central and South American history, introducing ancient and 
          contemporary objects and the people who made them to a global audience. 
          The on-line environment brings the two museum collections together in 
          an interactive and visually enticing environment not possible in a traditional 
          museum gallery.  </p>
         <p class="AbstractText"><i>Cloth &amp; Clay</i> is a vast information resource 
          that maximizes the exploratory, unrestricted nature of the Web. Careful 
          information architecture and quality overall design combine to produce 
          the very language of storytelling on-line.  Every object in <i>Cloth 
          &amp; Clay</i> has a story to tell.  Multiple paths of discovery lend 
          multiple voices to the object&#39;s storytellers, enhancing presentation 
          and broadening audience appeal.  </p>
         <p class="AbstractText">The<i> </i>site was created over a one-year period, 
          and offers a model for other institutions hoping to achieve meaningful 
          museological expression on-line. The launch of the on-line exhibit on 
          the Virtual Museum of Canada Web site in October, 2002, paralleled a 
          temporary physical exhibition at the Textile Museum of Canada. We will 
          outline the model we developed to create this product – which involved 
          cutting edge audience research, unique curatorial perspective, indigenous 
          consultation and contribution, academic advisors, institutional collaboration 
          and managing technology – at the Museums and the Web 2004 conference.  
        </p>
         <p class="AbstractText">Target users helped with the design of the site 
          through front-end concept testing, formative evaluation of the prototype 
          Teacher Resources section, and summative evaluation on-line. We will 
          focus on the Summative Evaluation phase of our audience research. As 
          small to medium-sized institutions, we wish to show by example the great 
          potential the Web has for museums of any size to reach out in meaningful 
          ways to a wide audience.  </p>
         <p class="AbstractText">The creation of the <i>Cloth &amp; Clay</i> Web 
          site has had a significant impact on each partner institution, encouraging 
          new investments in technological infrastructure and raising staff awareness 
          of this medium&#39;s great potential for museums. The CD-ROM version of 
          <i>Cloth &amp; Clay: Communicating Culture </i>won the 2003 AAM Museum 
          Publications Design Competition for CD-ROMs / Budget above $500,000. 
          The 2003 winners of the Best of the Web competition based on Museum 
          Web sites from around the world included <i>Cloth and Clay</i> in the 
          list of five finalists (retrieved from <a href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw2003/best/final_virtual.html">http://www.archimuse.com/mw2003/best/final_virtual.html</a>)</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Through electronic networks, images and ideas from 
          the world&#39;s cultural heritage can be brought together in a virtual space.  
          In <i>Cloth &amp; Clay: Communicating Culture</i>, we have devised a 
          virtual exhibition that integrates a selection of Mexican, Central American 
          and South American ceramics from the Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art 
          with related textiles from the collection of the Textile Museum of Canada.

        <p>The Web site <i>Cloth &amp; Clay: Communicating Culture</i> 
          <a href="http://www.textilemuseum.ca/cloth_clay">http://www.textilemuseum.ca/cloth_clay 
          </a> is a joint project funded by the Virtual Museum of Canada. Exploring 
          over 2,000 years of history, this rich and detailed on-line exhibition 
          introduces ancient and contemporary objects from the two museums&#39; collections, 
          and tells some of the stories belonging to the descendants of ancient 
          weavers and potters.  </p>
        <p>Textiles rarely seen outside of museum storage facilities 
          and ceramics are featured in an interactive, image-rich environment 
          which through multiple perspectives and points of view invites viewers 
          along a path of discovery. A physical counterpart to this virtual exhibition 
          was mounted at the Textile Museum of Canada (September 2002 – February 
          2003). It presented some of the objects featured in the Web site, showing 
          the relationships discovered among them.</p>
        <p>Key aspects of this Web site project were Front-end, 
          Formative and Summative audience evaluation, the hiring of indigenous 
          and academic advisors, and information architecture designed for accessibility 
          (no plug-ins, or special downloads). The Web site receives over 160,000 
          visitors a year. Recently, <i>Cloth &amp; Clay</i> was one of the five 
          finalists in the international &#34;Best of the Web&#34; competition organized 
          by Museums and the Web.  The project has also won awards from the American 
          Association of Museums and the Ontario Association of Art Galleries 
          for publication excellence, curatorial writing, and Web design.</p>
        <h1>The Textile Museum Of Canada and The Gardiner Museum Of Ceramic Art</h1>
        <p>The Textile Museum of Canada (TMC) and the Gardiner 
          Museum of Ceramic Art (GMCA) are medium-sized institutions with specialized 
          collections situated in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Annual visitors to 
          the GMCA number 60,000 and to the TMC, 40,000. </p>
        <p>Both museums have membership bases of around 1,000. 
          We mount several exhibitions a year and carry out active outreach and 
          pubic educational programming centered on our collections and exhibitions. 
          The TMC holds over 10,000 textiles and related artifacts from around 
          the world. The GMCA has over 3,000 ceramics in its collection. Both 
          institutions constantly seek new ways of providing broad and meaningful 
          access to the collections we hold in trust.</p>
        <p>The Web project was inspired by the desire to bring 
          together collections from both museums representing similar geographic 
          and cultural contexts. By combining them in virtual space, we wanted 
          to discover the relationships among them. It was an opportunity to explore 
          the potential of the Web for medium-sized institutions, provide on-line 
          access to two outstanding collections, and deliver the best methodology 
          we could develop for presenting cultural information on-line. </p>
        <h1>Front-End &amp; Formative Audience Research</h1>
        <h2>User-Testing</h2>
        <p>Collecting concrete audience feedback to the concepts, 
          designs, and goals of an exhibition is crucial for any project meant 
          to create a visitor-centered museum experience.  User or usability testing 
          at various stages of development provides in-depth qualitative information 
          about users&#39; on-line preferences, interests, and experiences.  For example, 
          Dowden, Sayre, and Wetterlund (2000) reported on user testing of <i>ArtsConnectEd</i>, 
          a collaborative collections/resource database developed for teachers 
          and students by the Walker Art Center and The Minneapolis Institute 
          of Arts (<a href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw2000/abstracts/prg_75000189.html">http://www.archimuse.com/mw2000/abstracts/prg_75000189.html</a>). 
        </p>
        <p>User testing was conducted in three phases throughout 
          the development and production of the <i>Cloth &amp; Clay</i> Web site 
          through Front-end, Formative, and Summative audience research. Dr. Barbara 
          Soren developed the audience research, in consultation with John Dalrymple, 
          the Project Manager (see also Soren, 2004, <a href="http://www.informalscience.org/download/case_studies/report_68.pdf">http://www.informalscience.org/download/ case_studies/report_68.pdf</a>; 
          Soren, in press; Soren &amp; Lemelin, 2004). </p>
        <h2>Front-end Testing</h2>
        <p>Front-end testing occurred at the commencement of 
          the project to test the preliminary content and design concepts for 
          the Web site.  Individuals were invited to the museum to participate 
          in two-hour, one-on-one interviews with Dr. Soren.  Every session was 
          recorded on audiotape and observed by the Project Manager and Web designer.  
          Participants in the testing were selected as  being likely end-users 
          and as representatives of key target audiences.  Front-end test participants 
          included teachers, students, museum professionals, artists/craftspeople, 
          Web designers, Museum members, and general museum-goers.</p>
        <p>Users were asked a series of questions relating to 
          the objectives and concepts defined in the original funding application 
          for the project.  They provided feedback that helped the development 
          team streamline and refine the stated goals of the Web site.  An important 
          area of focus for each user-test was participant feedback relating to 
          individual objects.  The curatorial team had selected 80 objects for 
          potential inclusion in the exhibition: 40 from each institution.  Digital 
          images of each were arranged in sequence for scroll-through viewing 
          on a computer screen.  As the images of each object slowly scrolled 
          by, users were encouraged to stop the scrolling and draw attention to 
          any object they wished.  </p>
        <p>This unrestricted activity was crucial to discovering 
          which objects tended to attract more attention, as well as to revealing 
          the true opinions of users.  Because the objects were presented without 
          any formal design, important information was revealed about design considerations 
          unique to presenting museum objects in the Web medium. For most objects, 
          users were curious to know what it was, how it was used, where it came 
          from, who made it, and why people made the objects.  This helped the 
          designer frame the presentation of much of the interpretive information 
          so that it correlated with those questions.  This also gave curatorial 
          team members an opportunity to present each object from a variety of 
          perspectives.</p>
        <p>Through this process, the importance of storytelling 
          became very clear.  Many of the ancient objects have been damaged by 
          the ravages of time, leaving them with missing sections or other injury.  
          Others still, as products of another culture and time, did not appear 
          to have any utilitarian purpose easily recognized by the user-test participants.  
          Time and again, questions were asked relating to these issues.  &#34;What 
          happened to that missing section?&#34;  &#34;Who is that person depicted on 
          that vessel?&#34;  People wanted to know the stories behind these individual 
          objects.  It became clear that this method of presenting information 
          about how an object was made, used, interred and later rediscovered 
          – in a narrative format – would be a meaningful way of building knowledge 
          with the public. </p>
        <p>The section titled &#34;Let the Objects Speak&#34; was heavily 
          influenced in both design and interpretive approach by the feedback 
          gleaned from users.  It stands as an effective model for presenting 
          this type of material culture in an on-line environment.</p>
        <h2>Formative Testing</h2>
        <p>We determined that a key target audience for <i>Cloth 
          &amp; Clay</i> would be teachers.  In order to make the Web site more 
          useful and effective for them, resources were invested in the creation 
          of a &#34;Teacher&#39;s Resources&#34; section containing themes and classroom activities 
          related to the Ontario school curriculum, but useful to a global audience.  
          Patricia Bentley, Education Curator at the TMC, developed these resources. 
          As the success of this section depended on its actual usefulness to 
          teachers, the development team identified it as an element appropriate 
          for a Formative Evaluation. Therefore, the second phase of user testing, 
          a formative stage to test the Teacher&#39;s Resources prototype for the 
          Web site, was undertaken in the late spring of 2002, six months after 
          we completed the front-end user testing.</p>
        <p>Once the &#34;Teacher&#39;s Resources&#34; were defined and Web-developed, 
          one-on-one focus group interviews were conducted by Dr. Soren with teachers 
          and students from a variety of school boards, grade levels, and subjects.  
          As end-users with defined and practical concerns, their feedback to 
          the design and contents of this section was extremely useful to developers, 
          allowing the team to refine the presentation to better suit the needs 
          of school-based users.</p>
        <h1>Design Of the Web Site</h1>
        <p>In its design and presentation, <i>Cloth &amp; Clay</i> 
          represents the culmination of three years of inquiry into presenting 
          Museum content on-line.  The end result is not a <i>flashy</i> site.  
          It is meant to be aesthetically appealing and it relies heavily on visual 
          communication, but it is very straightforward.  We wanted a design that 
          would be democratic and easily viewed on a variety of systems.  This 
          is a cornerstone of museum practice- to make the artifacts and activities 
          accessible to the widest public possible - so it was crucial to us that 
          we not abandon this spirit when working on-line.</p>
        <p>An important design imperative of the <i>Cloth &amp; 
          Clay</i> project was to see how far we could push the envelope of basic 
          HTML.  The designer felt that this basic coding system could still be 
          used to create impressive, dynamic Web content that is accessible to 
          all and cost effective to produce.  <i>Cloth &amp; Clay</i> requires 
          no plug-ins or special downloads as all multimedia were formatted for 
          play in default media players.</p>
        <p>One of our main objectives was to provide information 
          of the highest quality.  While styles and tastes may change quickly 
          on-line, the need for reliable and useful information will always be 
          constant.  We invested in academic advisors to ensure accuracy and indigenous 
          advisors to create more inclusive content. The feedback we received 
          from Front-end user testing informed our design and improved the site&#39;s 
          ability to communicate.  </p>
        <p>Our desire to include useful and high-quality information 
          produced a large body of text and images, far exceeding anything that 
          would be digestible in a traditional gallery space.  It was important 
          that the design of the site creatively manage all of this information 
          in a format that would not overwhelm the visitor. </p>
        <p>The design of the information architecture is one 
          of the most significant features of the <i>Cloth &amp; Clay</i> design.  
          Extensive labour was spent reformatting massive amounts of textual information 
          – there are over 65,000 words of text on the site - so that it would 
          be presented in a way that was neither overwhelming nor monolithic.  
          The text was crafted and layered to allow users to explore their own 
          paths of discovery, and to uncover more and more knowledge in greater 
          detail as they move through the site in a trajectory based on their 
          own interest.   </p>
        <p>Another important aspect of the Web site&#39;s design, 
          one which helps manage the great amount of textual content, is the utilization 
          of visual communication.  The design team worked under the premise that 
          casual Web users tend not to read in detail Web pages that feature many 
          hundreds or thousands of words of text.  It was key that each level 
          of text presented be brief and succinct (but with links to more information).  
          To bolster the succinct texts, it was important to utilize other forms 
          of communication.  <i>Cloth &amp; Clay</i> relies heavily on the adage 
          that one picture is worth a thousand words.  Information about geography, 
          ecology and culture is communicated through images throughout the site.  
          Technical information about objects is also conveyed through high quality 
          images.  </p>
        <h1>Curatorial Perspective</h1>
        <h2>Layers of Information</h2>
        <p>Feedback from the participants involved in Front-end 
          testing made it clear that we were being asked to present objects from 
          a variety of perspectives and to provide multiple levels of information. 
          Therefore, we hired advisors with academic backgrounds specific to the 
          subject matter presented to appraise the validity and quality of the 
          product. All objects were researched in depth so that information at 
          all levels could be presented on the Web site. A &#34;Research Resources&#34; 
          section was developed for reference purposes, and a catalogue record 
          was produced for every object on the site. More or less information 
          could be accessed depending on the visitor&#39;s interests.</p>
        <h2>The Interpretation of the Objects</h2>
        <p>The wishes of the test group to know the stories 
          behind the objects gave rise to the concept of storytelling, and the 
          narrative format was adopted and used in this exhibition to contextualize 
          the objects. </p>
        <p>Based on this narrative concept, several paths of 
          inquiry were developed to bring context and understanding to the objects: 
          <i>Let the Objects Speak</i>  for object analysis and storytelling; 
          <i>Exploring Landscapes</i>, for placing objects in a physical and cultural 
          context; and <i>Learn How</i>, for exploring contemporary practices 
          through the stories of the descendants of the ancient weavers and potters.</p>
        <p>But museums, individually, are at a disadvantage. 
          In the words of George MacDonald, the first director of the Canadian 
          Museum of Civilization, &#34;No museum has in its keeping the sum total 
          of human knowledge. Each holds pieces of a gigantic jigsaw puzzle&#34; (MacDonald 
          &amp; Alsford, 1997).  Other pieces of the puzzle are held by other 
          museums, collectors, and libraries - or have been lost over time. </p>
        <p><i>Cloth &amp; Clay</i> (the virtual exhibition) 
          brings separate pieces of our cultural heritage on-line in virtual space. 
          School children and professional researchers alike can explore the objects, 
          and information ranging from how objects are made to in-depth analyses 
          of their cultural contexts provides a range of opportunities for knowledge 
          building, depending on the interests of the visitor. </p>
        <p>A Chimú loin cloth, for example, is pictured with 
          its dimensions, the probable place where it was buried, a timeline of 
          its place in history, an illustration of how it was worn, and details 
          on its structure, with links to explanations of the textile techniques 
          used to create it.  It is also possible to delve deeper into the Chimú 
          culture through the &#34;Resources&#34; section, exploring examples of Chimú 
          pottery. A user can also find out more about the landscape of the Chimú 
          culture through the &#34;Exploring Landscapes&#34; section and discover how 
          the dry desert environment and the need to control irrigation contributed 
        to the rise of the Chimú kingdom on the north coast of Peru.</p>

        <p>The virtual space created by the Web site enables 
          us to place these objects in multiple narratives or stories, providing 
          the visitor with the opportunity to become a virtual curator engaged 
          in the ‘discovery&#39; of the object in a variety of ways of the visitor&#39;s 
          own choosing (Mackenzie, 1997). These combinations of objects and their 
          stories should lead the visitor to new insights and a more profound 
          understanding of our ‘interconnected&#39; cultural heritage.</p>
        <h1>Summative Audience Research </h1>
        <h2>On-site / On-line Summative User Testing</h2>
        <p>Coinciding with the launch of the <i>Cloth &amp; 
          Clay</i> site was an in-gallery installation at the TMC.  This arrangement 
          provided an opportunity to explore the relationship between on-line 
          and in-gallery experiences with the same objects.  Significantly, the 
          Web site preceded the gallery in execution, a rare occurrence in on-line 
          museum activity. </p>
        <p>Participants in both the Front-end and Formative 
          evaluations were invited to  this final user testing process. Research 
          assistants for the Summative evaluation were Suzanne Einstoss and Gabrielle 
          Trépanier, who were in the final year of the Museum Studies program 
          at University of Toronto. The Summative user testing was an in-depth 
          study with six people  previously  involved in the Front-end or Formative 
          user testing invited to visit the physical museum and explore the Web 
          site. These participants were already familiar with the project, had 
          previously responded to the objects for the Web site and completed a 
          participant questionnaire, and were thought to be like-minded in their 
          interest in the on-site and on-line exhibition. They were asked to visit 
          during a specified time when the exhibition was open to the public on 
          a Wednesday evening or weekend. The evaluation team was available during 
          those times to observe the Focus Group visitors and to compare their 
          behaviours in the exhibition with casual visitors visiting at the time.</p>
        <p>The group included three males and three females 
          of diverse ages: </p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li> 
           An older Asian Canadian artist who has curated 
            and designed exhibitions at both museums and has little interest in 
        technology</li>
        <li> 
           An older architect with expertise in Maya 
        culture, as well as most of the content in the exhibition</li>
        <li> 
           A man in his early 30s with technology expertise 
        who had visited the regions featured in the exhibition</li>
        <li> 
           A woman with an indigenous background in 
        her 20s with little technology expertise and preparing to be a teacher</li>
        <li> 
           Two experienced visual art teachers of intermediate 
            level Grades 6-8 students (36-45 and 46-55 years), both artists and 
        with experience in textiles (one also had experience with clay) </li>
      </ul>
     
        <p class="listwithbullets"> At the admission area to the Textile Museum, 
          participants received a Textile Museum of Canada folder with their name 
          on it, and inside were materials related to the <i>Cloth and </i>Clay 
          exhibition. They were asked to visit the on-line exhibition after their 
          experience in the exhibition at the Textile Museum, and to keep in mind 
          or note:</p>
      <ol class="listwithnumbers">
        <li> 
          Objects or contents they found memorable 
        or interesting.</li>
        <li> 
          How the on-line experience related to their 
        in-gallery experience.</li>
        <li> 
          Individual objects or aspects from the on-line 
        and on-site exhibition.</li>
        <li> 
        Time spent on-line.</li>
        <li> 
        Sections visited on-line.</li>
        <li> 
        Styles of presentation they found interesting.</li>
        <li> 
          Impressions on seeing specific objects they 
        had identified as interesting in their previous user tests.</li>
      </ol>
     
        <p>Later, they met as a Focus Group within the gallery 
          space to discuss their impressions and experiences, as well as to assess 
          the project&#39;s success relative to the goals set.</p>
        <p>Participants were paid an honorarium and given free 
          parking. Two teachers in the group also received a CD of the Web site 
          to thank them for their participation in the Formative Evaluation of 
          the <i>Teacher&#39;s Resource</i> section of the Web site.  </p>
        <h2>On-Site Observations</h2>
        <p><b>Average Time</b>: The Focus Group visitors spent 
          31 minutes in the <i>Cloth and Clay</i> exhibition at the Textile Museum, 
          a little longer than the group of Casual visitors who spent an average 
          time of 27 minutes.</p>
        <p><b>General Flow Patterns</b>: For each group, visitors 
          stopped most in the last ‘red&#39; room where there were two mounted display 
          cases with  exquisite, stretched white lacy gauze fabrics; displays 
          with mannequins in everyday costume; woven caps hung on the wall; and 
          a display case of shoes. This gallery focused on the life of the weaver 
          today in the various countries of focus in South and Central America. 
        </p>
        <p>In looking at the stopping frequencies of the Focus 
          Group visitors and Casual visitors, the Focus Group visitors were more 
          diligent with the texts and stopped in front of panels more often, while 
          the Casual visitor group looked more. </p>
        <h2>Focus Group and Interviews </h2>
        <p>For the Focus Group, held in the popular ‘red&#39; room 
          of the on-site exhibition, we asked participants to compare their on-line 
          and on-site experiences about the following general topics:</p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li> 
        Themes and objects</li>
        <li> 
        The design of the on-line and on-site exhibitions.</li>
      </ul>
     
        <h3>Reactions to Ceramic and Textile Objects</h3>
        <h4>Which objects did you find interesting on the Web site?</h4>
      <p class="caption" align="left"><img src="dalrymple_fig3.jpg" alt="Artefact" width="229" height="322"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Web image courtesy of the textile Museum of Canada &amp;<br/>
        the Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art<br/>
      <a href="http://www.textilemuseum.ca/cloth_clay/research_moche1.html">http://www.textilemuseum.ca/cloth_clay/research_moche1.html</a></p>
        <p>Specific elements of objects on-line and on-site 
          that participants particularly appreciated were the Moche fragments, 
          the ability to restore the hair on one on-line object, and the objects 
          speaking in the first person. Individuals were interested in objects 
          that conveyed &#34;drama and narrative,&#34; and felt quite strongly that an 
          on-line image is never as compelling as seeing the actual objects. One 
          of the teachers missed not seeing the Feathered Serpent in the physical 
          exhibition, a theme in the <i>Teacher&#39;s Resource</i> section on-line 
          (<a href="http://www.textilemuseum.ca/cloth_clay/research_teachers2.html">http://www.textilemuseum.ca/cloth_clay/research_teachers2.html</a>).</p>
        <h4><b><i>Was there anything you wanted to know that 
          you didn&#39;t find?</i></b></h4>
      <p>Content related to the objects that participants 
          missed finding was:</p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li> 
        Information on how the clothes were worn.</li>
        <li> 
        Religious information.</li>
        <li> 
           The presence of hats in the exhibition but 
            not on the site (and on the wall above where the Focus Group was conducted). 
            You wonder about the wearer of the hats. They would be engaging things 
        to have on a Web site. We could relate to them.</li>
        <li> 
           The idea of contemporary and past, this 
        message is present on-line more than in the physical exhibition.</li>
      </ul>
       
      <p>The Maya expert interviewed missed the following:</p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li> 
           Each of the three main sub-sites (Objects, 
            Explore, How to) has an introduction. Are there links to other museum 
            sites in each sub-section? To what extent did you want to cross-reference 
            the three areas (e.g., Andean, Panama, Maya, Aztec cultures)? Would 
            it be of any value? Is it better generalized across all rather than 
        focused on individual areas?</li>
        <li> 
           Is a timeline map for individual civilizations 
<i>vs.</i> 
            a general worldview?</li>
        <li> 
           How did the information you were able to 
        find out about the object compare at the Museum and on-line?</li>
      </ul>
       
      <p>People said, again, that when they were on-line they wanted to come 
          to the Museum. There is &#34;more information on-line&#34; but &#34;you can&#39;t beat 
          the real objects.&#34;  When they were in the physical exhibition they liked: 
      </p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li> the inclusion of Web site information, such as fabrication. </li>
        <li> costume in relation to geography and gender and would have liked 
          to see that information on the Web site. </li>
        <li> &#34;There was not as much text of course, but it was more interesting 
          to look closely at the objects and see things&#34; </li>
        <li>it was &#34;more organic&#34; - while on-line the site could be used for research 
          and further information. </li>
      </ul>
       
      <p>Suggestions to improve comparisons on-line and on-site: </p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li>
          better linkages between objects in the real and 
            on-line spaces. There were some links between textual elements, but 
            they were not extensively discussed, and opportunities to use computers 
            in the exhibition space were not as well set up as they could have 
            been. 
        </li>
        <li>
          There was a sense of repetition 
            between the two exhibitions.
        </li>
        <li>
         More information about someone who does the work 
            was missing in the physical exhibition.
        </li>
        <li>
        A timeline in the physical 
            exhibition would have been helpful.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
        <h3>Themes for the <i>Cloth &amp; Clay</i> Exhibition </h3>
      <p><em>There are four themes on-line (Explore the Landscape, Let the Objects 
          Speak, Learning How Objects were Made, Travel Back in Time). Which were 
          most helpful?</em></p>
        <p>People generally felt that links between themes on-line and in the 
          exhibit seemed fairly parallel. One significant comment was: &#34;Some text 
          was identical - word for word duplicate, therefore I just skipped by 
          the written information&#34; in the physical exhibition.  &#34;I connected visually 
          with the objects.&#34; Another thought it was important that the on-line 
          and on-site exhibitions &#34;are able to stand alone.&#34; Others felt that 
          &#34;Integration would be best,&#34; &#34;It depends what the Web site is for.  
          If you want it to stand alone then you need all that information&#34; that 
          is on-line.</p>
        <p>The Maya expert saw comparisons between the <i>Let the Objects Speak</i> 
          and <i>Explore</i> sections. <i>Explore</i> showed the environmental 
          context for objects. But the &#34;brutality for most cultures at the time 
          was not there.&#34;  There could be links to Canadian Haida culture (e.g., 
          Michael Fortune making furniture out of mahogany) or an Inca / Mohawk 
          connection with a cultural extension by trade. There could be a link 
          to the Anthropological Web site.</p>
        <p>One teacher spent two hours on-line with four Grade 8 students, two 
          boys and two girls. One of the boys was a special needs students and 
          the other a high-end reader. The two girls were high visual learners. 
          They read and considered together on-line. They went to the <i>Back 
          in Time</i> Adventure first, tried all the different responses together, 
          then went to <i>Let the Objects Speak</i> and <i>Explore the Landscape</i> 
          at the end to see how the objects were made. Students liked 3-D and 
          &#34;went for the pottery on-line.&#34;  They particularly liked the pot with 
          a head (a god eating a figure), which led them to the Nasca fabric piece 
          (heads with hair on them) and were interested in this as the oldest 
          remnant of fabric in the exhibition. They asked about techniques and 
          if people still make the pottery, and wanted to visit the Museum to 
          see the objects and then go back to computer. The teacher wanted to 
          go back to the exhibition to see the trophy heads after she read materials 
          with the CD she was given - she found the story so interesting, and 
          the weaving was strange. </p>
        <h3>Design Aspects: Connections between the design on-line and on-site</h3>
      <p>Focus Group participants spent considerable time discussing the graphic 
          and textual elements in the on-line and on-site exhibitions. Generally, 
          they found the typeface small, and the amount of text intimidating. 
          The colours were more appealing on-line, and the relationship of text 
          to images easier on-line. Participants agreed that the on-line and on-site 
          exhibitions were laid out in a similar fashion; the organization<b> 
          </b>was more or less the same. </p>
        <p>There were several important comments about the challenges of reading 
          text on-line and on-site:</p> <p class="BlockQuote"> &#34;It was very difficult to read text on coloured background.  
          I prefer contrast of black and white in the on-line and physical exhibit.  
          Bigger font would be good.&#34;</p> <p class="BlockQuote">&#34;I had an easier time reading on-line because I am 
          relaxed and sitting <i>vs.</i> in the gallery where you are standing 
          and walking. We all have the tendency to scan to get to what we want.&#34;</p> <p class="BlockQuote"> &#34;I hate an overload of information. It seems to be 
          the trend. The amount of information in the exhibit was intimidating. 
          Hierarchy of information would be good.&#34;</p> <p class="BlockQuote">&#34;Keep fonts consistent, have a little more space&#34;</p> <p class="BlockQuote">For a person who does not need to wear glasses, the 
          fonts were too small, the size has to be bigger on-line and at the Museum. 
          At the Museum she had to get so close to read the text she worried that 
          an alarm might go off.</p>
        <p>One  teacher (who had expertise in Xerox digital prints) and her students 
          made important observations: </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">&#34;It would have been nice to know more about types 
          of dyes used. Brown, green, red, and yellow were clear in the exhibition 
          at the Museum but more about blue, a primary colour, would have been 
          helpful.&#34; </p>
        <p>Her students suggested that the screen be re-organized with the text 
          links to the left (i.e., Who, What, Where), the Objects in the centre, 
          and the text box as it is to the right. This would give more of a sense 
          of vertical space and use more of the space on the screen. They wanted 
          more links throughout the Web site.A map of North / Central / South 
          America was needed to know where exactly this area is geographically.</p>
        <h3>Inclusivity</h3>
      <p><i>This exhibition intended to interweave the voices of the curators 
          and the Indigenous peoples represented in Cloth &amp; Clay.  Did this 
          come across in the exhibit and on-line? If so, how? </i></p>
        <p>Focus Group participants all agreed that inclusivity was stronger on-line 
          than on-site.  They noticed the integration of ‘other&#39; voices in the 
          exhibition. Some felt inclusivity was stronger in the contemporary area, 
          and not as much in the object area of the physical exhibition and the 
          Web site, and that maybe the two areas (contemporary and objects) needed 
          to be combined a bit more. Work made in the past and now, and indigenous 
          to those areas, was clearly labeled with photos of people who made the 
          work. But the aboriginal voice was missing. </p>
        <p>Generally, users involved in the on-line and on-site Summative evaluation 
          process confirmed that the goals of the project were clearly and effectively 
          met.  The ability to explore interpretive material relating to the objects 
          on display in both virtual and physical mediums was recognized as a 
          genuine asset.  It was understood that the Web could never capture the 
          inspirational sensation conveyed when in the presence of a rare or unique 
          museum object.  However, the Web can provide more user-directed and 
          in-depth exploration by utilizing medium-specific information architecture.  
          Thoughtful Web design can deliver many layers of curatorial information 
          with multiple paths of discovery and exploration without overwhelming 
          the user.</p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p><i>Cloth &amp; Clay</i> actively exploits the potential of the Web 
          medium, most significantly by exploring many different points of view 
          and perspectives and placing individual objects within multiple narrative 
          streams.  It is difficult to look at one object from several different 
          angles or interpretive perspectives in a traditional gallery space, 
          since the object has to sit where it is installed, whereas on-line there 
          is no such limitation, as the design of <i>Cloth &amp; Clay</i> demonstrates.</p>
        <p>This project represented an important step for both the Textile Museum 
          of Canada and the Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art. It allowed us to work 
          with complementary material and expertise, pooling our resources and 
          knowledge with the goal of engaging the virtual museum visitor in an 
          exploration of past and present cultures that survived the impact of 
          European exploration. These cultures preserved and stimulated ideas 
          which still inform our daily life. Both of our institutions are important 
          centers of learning, but virtually combining the collections and establishing 
          connections to provide context was an innovative experience for both. 
          The benefits included new research on objects, improved knowledge of 
          both collections, the introduction of the staff and Board volunteers 
          to the potential of the Web,  and increased enthusiasm and support for 
          digitizing the collections and developing each Museum&#39;s own Web site. 
          Finally, and significantly, both access to images of and information 
          about the ceramic and textile objects have been made available to interested 
          publics, scholars, school children and others around the world, raising 
          the profile of both Museums within the international community.</p>
