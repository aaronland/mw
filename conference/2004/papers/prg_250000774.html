  <p class="PaperTitle">Key Ingredients: How the Smithsonian Built an Interactive 
      Web Site for 150 Small Museums</p>
  <p class="Author">Chuck Barger, Interactive 
      Knowledge, Inc.; Rozanna Sokolowski, Museums on Main Street, Smithsonian Institution 
      Traveling Exhibition Service, USA</p>
  <p class="URL"><a href="http://www.keyingredients.org/" target="_blank">http://www.keyingredients.org</a></p>
  <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
  <p class="AbstractText">In 2003, a new traveling exhibition that explores the 
      diverse and constantly evolving food of the United States began a five-year 
      tour. Key Ingredients: America by Food was created by Museums on Main Street, 
      a partnership of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service 
      (SITES) and the Federation of State Humanities Councils. The project includes 
      a unique educational Web site that features a timeline of American eating 
      titled <i>500 Years of American Food</i>. Visitors to this section of the 
      site can explore the rich diversity of American food culture by a wide variety 
      of interesting topics including regions of the country, time periods in American 
      history, and food related themes. </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">But the most interesting feature of the Key Ingredients 
      Web site is the fact that it is designed to continue to grow and expand exponentially 
      throughout the five-year tour of the exhibition. The site has two major sections 
      that contained little information when the site was launched in the spring 
      of 2003, but which continue to be populated with new content. As the five 
      identical copies of the exhibit travel to 150 small museums across the country, 
      the Web site will continue to offer new content and a valuable resource for 
      the museums, visitors to the museums and anyone interested in food who has 
      Internet access. </p>
  <p class="keywords"><b>Keywords: </b>American foodways, eating, American Cookbook 
        Project, food, food culture, recipes, Key Ingredients</p>
  <h1>Key Ingredients Web Site</h1>
  <p>Key Ingredients is a small but mighty Web site designed 
      to meet several specific criteria of the client - Museums on Main Street, 
      a division of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service.  The 
      Key Ingredients exhibit is small and low security.  It&#39;s basically a panel 
      show with a few artifacts of interest.  Five copies of the exhibit have been 
      made and the show will travel for five years to over 150 communities all of 
      which have populations of less than 10,000.  The Web site is designed to be 
      a well-designed and highly useful way for these venues to publicize the exhibit.  
      In many of these rural communities, the Smithsonian Institution coming to 
      town is cause for great celebration.  By publicizing the Web site address 
      with its promotional materials, each venue is linked favorably with the Smithsonian.  
      The venues which are currently exhibiting Key Ingredients are listed prominently 
      on the home page of the site.  As the exhibit travels extensively over the 
      next five years, the site will serve as an archive for the programming activities 
      it generated.  But more importantly, it will document the local and regional 
      food traditions as well as current places to enjoy the local cuisine as described 
      by the locals who eat there.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="barger.fig1.jpg" alt="Early 20th century woman with her preserves" width="400" height="262"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure  1: The Key Ingredients Home Page</p>
  <h2>400 Years of Food  </h2>
  <p>In addition to supporting the venues that host the exhibit, 
      the site has excellent content that can be useful whether one has seen the 
      exhibit or not.  A critical piece of the exhibit content is describing American 
      foodways.  That is, how and why Americans eat what they eat. The Web site 
      features an interactive exhibit titled <i>400 Years of Food.</i>  This section 
      includes 40 different stories that highlight content from the exhibit, but 
      can be organized according to criteria chosen by the Web site visitor.  The 
      story told in the exhibit unfolds in the Web site by interacting with <i>400 
      Years of Food</i>.  The interactive timeline allows users to choose their 
      approach to the content from three different organizational schemes: Time 
      Periods, Themes and Regions.  Following is a listing of these topics:</p>
  <h3>Time Periods</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1500 - New World / New Food</li>
    <li>1600 - Colonization</li>
    <li>1700 - A New Country </li>
    <li>1800 - Expansion</li>
    <li>1900 - Modernization</li>
    <li>1950 - Recent Trends</li>
    <li>2000- The Future of Food</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Themes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Growing Food</li>
    <li>Preparing Food</li>
    <li>Everyday Food</li>
    <li>Celebrating with Food</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Regions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Northeast</li>
    <li>Southeast</li>
    <li>Midwest</li>
    <li>Northwest</li>
    <li>Southwest</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="caption"><img src="barger.fig2.jpg" alt="Early settlers eating " width="400" height="253"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure  2: 500 Years of American Food — an interactive 
        timeline of American foodways</p>
  <p>The story of how American cuisine has developed and evolved 
      unfolds in the Web site.  Interested visitors can follow the changes in regional 
      foods, look at the national changes by reviewing information on each century 
      since Columbus or look at broader categories such as growing or preparing 
      foods.  </p>
  <h2>Eating Across America</h2>
  <p>Two key words that sum up American cuisine are <b>diverse</b> 
      and <b>regional</b>.  In order to capture this important concept, the Web 
      site is designed to give each of the 150 venues an opportunity to share their 
      unique food traditions with the world.  In the section titled Eating Across 
      America, each venue will be able to post information about that communities&#39; 
      contribution to American cuisine.  Using an easy to understand, password protected 
      front-end, each venue can post photos of community, list all the programming 
      and events planned to support the Key Ingredients exhibition, and share information 
      about community food festivals and local eating establishments with the rest 
      of the country.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="barger.fig3.jpg" alt="Eating from coast to coast" width="400" height="277"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure  3: Eating Across America will offer in-depth information 
          on food related events and places to eat in over 150 small American 
        towns</p>
  <p>The value of this part of the Web site to venues hosting 
      the exhibition cannot be overstated.  The majority of communities visited 
      by this exhibit will have a rich heritage of foodways that span several generations.  
      The site is designed to give anyone in the world who visits the site a chance 
      to glimpse how food has shaped and continues to influence the lives of the 
      people living in that region.  Programming designed to support the exhibit 
      typically includes food festivals, bake-offs, chili cook-offs, cooking lessons, 
      lectures on the local cuisine&#39;s history and many other topics.  Many of the 
      venues have taken the opportunity offered by this site to upload photographs 
      of their community and events related to the exhibit. </p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="barger.fig4.jpg" alt="Pancake Breakfast" width="400" height="561"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure  4: An image of the painting that won first prize 
          in the Key Ingredients art competition recently in Huntsville, Utah 
        has been uploaded to the Web site</p>
  <p><i> </i>Another great source of information on the communities 
      who will host the exhibit is the listing of places to eat.  This section allows 
      the venue to promote local restaurants, diners, saloons, cafeterias, dives 
      or 4-star establishments.  The idea is to document how the locals eat when 
      they go out and to make recommendations for anyone coming to the community 
      who has an appetite but no local experience for what&#39;s good to eat.  Ideally 
      this section of the site will create a rich archive for travelers, tourists 
      and locals to use when planning a trip through some of America&#39;s less populated 
      regions.</p>
  <h1>The American Cookbook Project</h1>
  <p>The Key Ingredients exhibit hopes to inspire each visitor 
      to reflect on the unique food traditions that have shaped his or her life.  
      The Web site is designed to allow anyone to do a lot more than reflect.  A 
      section titled The American Cookbook Project is a forum, open to the public, 
      for sharing recipes and stories.  Anyone can submit a recipe and tell a story 
      or share a memory that is attached to the dish the recipe creates.  The person 
      who submits the recipe can also choose from a number of categories in which 
      to classify their submission.  Newspapers across the country, including the 
      Chicago Tribune have reviewed the Web site and urged their readers to add 
      to The American Cookbook Project.  This section of the site is growing and 
      will likely grow exponentially as the exhibit appears around the country.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="barger.fig5.jpg" width="400" height="351"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure  5: The American Cookbook Project has the potential 
        become the largest online recipe database in the country</p>
  <p>Because the backend of The American Cookbook Project is 
      a robust database, visitors to the site can search through the recipes based 
      on four useful categories: Recipe Type, Story Type, Heritage Type and State.  
      Each of the categories is also divided into a number of topics.  For example, 
      anyone interested in the stories that are included with each recipe can sort 
      the selections by eighteen unique categories including; Family Traditions, 
      Comfort Foods, Prize Winners and Food Disasters.  Anyone can submit a new 
      recipe and story any time. </p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="barger.fig6.jpg" alt="Joan Salee&#39;s recipe for Warm Pudding" width="350" height="528"/></p>
  <p class="MsoCaption"><span class="caption">Figure  6: A recipe for Warm Pudding 
        submitted by a cook in Kentucky</span></p>
  <p>The on-line form is easy to use and allows ample guidance 
      for completing all the necessary information needed to list a recipe and tell 
      a story.  Anyone submitting a new recipe and story also chooses the appropriate 
      categories from a series of pull down menus.  A Museums on Main Street staff 
      member reviews recipes as they are submitted and uploads those that are appropriate 
      for addition to the site.  Currently there are 75 recipes listed but the expectation 
      is that the site will host hundreds of recipes and stories within a few years.</p>
  <h1>Promoting the Site and Growing the Content</h1>
  <p>The Smithsonian, Interactive Knowledge and the Federation 
      of State Humanities Councils have undertaken a number of activities designed 
      to encourage everyone involved to build the site&#39;s content. Communities participate 
      in two planning meetings before they receive the exhibition. At both meetings, 
      communities are reminded of the Web site and its ability to share their piece 
      of the food story.  At the planning meetings, written instructions for entering 
      content into the Web site are handed out and if possible, there is a brief 
      demonstration of the process.  Most of the communities have seen the usefulness 
      of the Internet for promoting new programs and exhibitions.  Nonetheless, 
      there is usually some reluctance to embrace this technology at first.  The 
      most successful venues in terms of the amount of content uploaded to the site 
      as well as the number of new stories and recipes added from the community 
      to The American Cookbook Project, seem to be those that receive a call from 
      Interactive Knowledge to remind them of the opportunity to upload content 
      before the exhibit opens.  </p>
  <p>Current PR efforts have already reached over 500 food writers 
      at local newspapers and periodicals across the country. This effort has resulted 
      in a number of great reviews and increased activity at the Web site. Articles 
      have appeared in small circulation, rural weeklies as well as some of the 
      largest newspapers in the country. The Key Ingredients Web site will be viewed 
      as a success if everyone follows the advice of Chicago Tribune Food Writer 
      Renee Enna in her glowing review of the Web site last fall.  She concludes 
      her article with the admonition to &#34;Check it out — and don&#39;t forget to 
      add a recipe of your own.&#34;</p>
