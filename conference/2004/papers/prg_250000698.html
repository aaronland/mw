      <p class="PaperTitle">XML Coding Of Dramatic Structure For Visualization</p>
      <p class="Author">Gabriele Scali, Space S.p.A., Italy and Graham Howard, 
        System Simulation Ltd, UK</p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
       <p class="AbstractText">Every work of storytelling, play, film, novel, opera, 
          musical, is characterized by the development of a plot in which characters 
          embody certain roles, establish certain relationships, evolve their 
          feelings, generate and get affected by events. It is a world populated 
          by several possible levels of interpretation often difficult to follow. 
          The delivery of narration-intensive media becomes everyday more common 
          on the Internet where the Web provides a more interruptible and fragmented 
          way of interacting with them, making their comprehension even more difficult 
        than usual. We present an XML Schema defining a language (XNDL 
          XML Narrative Description Language) dedicated to describe the time-based 
          evolution of roles, relationships, events and consequences within a 
        narration.</p>
       <p class="AbstractText">An XNDL file can be fed into a&#39;plot visualization 
          and discovery tool&#39; able to render a graphical representation 
          of it through vector graphics, where stylized shapes, colors, size, 
        arrows etc. all concur to simplify and explain what&#39;s going on. Why did that character act like this? Wasn&#39;t 
          she supposed to be friend with this other, why are they fighting now? 
          And how&#39;s she feeling, uh I see, she&#39;s marked as&#39;betrayed&#39;… 
        Did I miss something? And what&#39;s the relationship between those 
          others: are they friends, lovers, is one of them taking advantage of 
        the other?</p>
       <p class="AbstractText">Such a tool can be used stand-alone or even be synchronized 
          with the timed delivery of the media it refers to. There are several 
          scenarios we foresee for both the Schema and the tool, from the obvious 
          educational ones, to the cross-exploration possibilities a codified 
          version of the plots would provide (how Verdi&#39;s <i>La Traviata</i>, 
          Dumas&#39; <i>La dame aux camellias</i> and the Greek myth of Orpheus 
          relate to the movie <i>Moulin Rouge</i>?), to being provided as a stream 
        of information on iTV channels.</p>
      <p class="keywords">Keywords: plot, narrative structure, visualization, 
        XML</p>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>As the use of narration intensive media through new communications 
          channels become more widespread, content representation tools are being 
          envisaged to help enrich user experience and interaction with it. We 
          present our work in defining a language for the description of narration 
          content in terms of narrative structure, plot elements, character stereotypes, 
          character interactions, events and character behavior, all referred 
          to as stereotypes. Editing and visualization tools based on such a language 
          could potentially help in the study of narrative analysis and comparative 
          analysis, in rich media delivery experience for entertainment, and of 
        course in education and learning dramatic structure stereotypes</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Thus from the first edition of this little book, I 
          might offer (speaking not ironically but seriously) to dramatic authors 
          and theatrical managers, 10,000 scenarios, totally different from those 
          used repeatedly upon our stage in the last 50 years. The scenarios will 
          be, needless to say, of a realistic and effective character. I will 
          contract to deliver a thousand in eight days. For the production of 
        a single gross, but 24 hours are required. Prices quoted on single dozens...</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> George Polti, 36 Dramatic Situations</p>
      <p>The British philosopher Alfred North Whitehead defined art as &#39;a 
          model imposed on experience&#39;. This very lucid definition helps 
          explain why art in all forms refers to a limited number of themes and 
          thought schemes, precisely because they are at the basis of our human 
          experience. It&#39;s surprising how these schemes remained the same 
          throughout human history and how they remain consistent in any form 
          of narrative, be it songs, fables, novels, drama, legends, movies or 
        jokes.</p>
      <p>Karl Gustav Jung called these recurring themes <i>Archetypes</i>, universal 
          models that we inherit from our collective unconscious. At the beginning 
          of the Twentieth Century, the structuralist approach to analyzing narrative 
        structure spawned the separate discipline of <i>narratology</i>.</p>
      <p>Since then, many researchers and authors, over time, have attempted 
          to capture the inner mechanisms of plots, the progression of dramatic 
          situations and the variety of characters in terms of stereotypes, among 
        these:</p>
        <ul class="listwithbullets">
          <li> Ronald 
            Tobias&#39; 20 master plots</li>
          <li> Georges 
            Polti&#39;s 5 basic conflicts, then originating the 36 Dramatic 
            Situations</li>
          <li> The 
            nine-act structure</li>
          <li> The 
            69 situations attributed by Ronald Tobias to Rudyard Kipling</li>
          <li> Three 
            basic patterns by William Foster-Harris</li>
          <li> Vladimir 
            Propp&#39;s 31 standard functions of the folktale (narratemes)</li>
          <li> Joseph 
            Campbell&#39;s 19 steps of the hero&#39;s journey</li>
          <li> Syd 
            Field&#39;s three acts paradigm</li>
          <li> Dramatica.com&#39;s 
            8 Archetypal Characters and 16 motivation elements</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Whether any of these can really encompass all works of fiction or not, 
          is a matter of much debate. In most cases, though, the proposers only 
          intended to provide a sample of the most common situations, not exhaustive 
        thesauri.</p>
      <p>When adapting them to describe real world narrations, these situations 
          can be modified, extended, mixed, added together or integrated to create 
          completely new ones. What can be concluded by looking at these studies 
          is that stories can indeed be decomposed and analyzed, either by pooling 
          them into a set of predefined schemes (similar to what happens when 
          a necromancer can read any possible stories from a fixed set of tarot 
          cards) or by recognizing and using new themes when the existing ones 
        fall short of our aims.</p>
      <p>It is possible to perform a perfectly similar operation with the subject 
          of human feelings and behaviours, instead of situations. With a certain 
          grade of approximation, a character&#39;s temperament and emotional 
        state can be depicted in terms of a number of stereotypes.</p>
      <h1>Story and plot</h1>
      <p>The distinction between <i>story</i> and <i>plot</i> can probably be 
          found back in <a href="http://www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/intranet/englishbasics/Plot01.htm" target="_blank">Aristotle</a>, 
          who differentiated between facts in the real world and elements taken 
          from them and organized in narration called <i>mythos</i>. These very 
          terms, as intended in literary studies today, were introduced and defined 
          by the novelist and critic E.M. Forster in his famous work <i>Aspects 
        of the Novel</i> in 1927.</p>
      <p>From then on, <em>story</em> is the sequence of events that form the 
          basis to the narration, and <em>plot</em> is the way these events get 
          revealed to the reader/spectator and how they relate to each other through 
        relationships of cause-effect.</p>
      <p>In many cases plot does not match story in terms of time sequence, 
          especially in the more modern narrative genres, such as novels or movies, 
          which often break the Aristotelian principles of unity of time, location 
        and action (e.g. with flashbacks). </p>
      <p>In the description language we propose, we chose to keep as a basis 
          the time of the media and therefore describe events and their consequences 
          in the order they are narrated, thus preserving the possibility of associating 
          the metadata directly to the media through MPEG-7. This even preserves 
          the possibility of describing stories instead of plots, as they can 
          be treated as special sub-cases of plots, in which events get narrated 
        in the strict order in which they happen.</p>
      <h2><b>A Language To Describe Plot</b></h2>
      <p>Based on the above assumptions we set out to create a formal language 
          that could be used to tag media (thus including text) and describe the 
          contents in structural narrative terms, the XML Narrative Description 
        Language (XNDL), which is currently implemented as an XML Schema.</p>
      <p>Using XML Schema gave us a chance to focus our efforts on trying different 
          arrangements without the added constraints of them complying with an 
          existent format, a precious advantage at this early stage. XNDL closely 
          reflects concepts to be found in the MPEG-7 Structure and Semantics 
          Description Schemes and will soon be transposed into MPEG-7&#39;s 
          Description Definition Language (DDL). As DDL is based on a compatible 
          superset of the XML Schema language, such transposition should be rather 
        straightforward.</p>
      <p>The XNDL language can be used to describe the plot underlying a certain 
          narration: indicating how it affects characters and which stereotypes 
        are used inside it.</p>
      <h2>Patterns</h2>
      <p>Associating plots to stereotyped dramatic structures is very similar 
          to the well known and useful <i>Patterns</i> approach to sharing software 
          design, originated by the work of architect Christopher Alexander in 
          the late 1970s. Software Patterns are defined in terms of a description, 
          prerequisites, list of participants, consequences and examples. We thought 
          that this would be a good basis for the description of stereotyped dramatic 
          elements, temperament or behaviour, and adopted this word to refer to 
        them.</p>
      <p>Let us summarize the main concepts we have incorporated in our Schema 
        and their meanings:</p>
      <h3>Dramatic structure</h3>
      <p>The root element contains all the necessary elements to describe and 
        break into a hierarchical structure a narrative work.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="scali1.jpg" alt="dramatic structure" width="487" height="258"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1. The DramaticStructure element</p>
      <h3>Stereotypes</h3>
      <p>A collection of Patterns that can be referenced in the Patterns section 
          of a segment. The stereotypes collection may be provided by an authority 
          or modified/extended by each single user. This section is intended to 
          be used as a library. It could be provided by some authoritative source 
          or be shared among a collection of XNDL files maintained by an individual 
        organization.</p>
      <h3>Pattern</h3>
      <p>A single, well identified, stereotype situation, character type or 
          narrative schema that describes its workings and a number of roles within 
          it. A pattern can be attached to any segment at any level, and multiple 
        patterns can be attached to a single segment.</p>
      <h3>Structure</h3>
      <p>A time based hierarchical subdivision of the media</p>
      <h3>Segment</h3>
      <p>Each of the time spans in which a structure is recursively divided, 
        basically following the same element defined by MPEG-7</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="scali2.jpg" alt="structure of a segment" width="409" height="482"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 2. The Segment element</p>
      <h3>Agent</h3>
      <p>A character or object playing a role in a segment of the narration. 
          Agent can also be used to record when a characters enters/exit the stage. 
      </p>
      <h3>Fact</h3>
      <p>The change of internal properties of a character (e.g. mood) or the 
          performance of an action or the occurrence of an event not generated 
        by a willing cause</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="scali3.jpg" width="412" height="325"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 3. The Fact element</p>
      <h3>Directive</h3>
      <p>Includes a number of optional secondary indications about location, 
          lights, costumes etc. which, if used, can be useful to represent and 
        visualize the narration more accurately</p>
      <p>The Schema has been conceived so to maintain as much generality and 
          extensibility as possible. The <i>segment</i> concept for example, which 
          reflects the same concept in MPEG7, being hierarchical, can easily be 
          used to represent chapters, scenes, libretto lines, sequences, any structural 
          decomposition should be regarded as functional to a specific representation. 
          Therefore the concepts associated to it, such as <i>pattern, </i>can 
          be referred to any level of narration, from the whole narrative to the 
        single sequence, and can coexist at different levels.</p>
      <p>Inside any of these levels, the <i>role </i>attribute can be specified 
          by a segment within that level or by a character or event. In this way, 
          for example, the <i>nine act structure</i> pattern can refer to the 
          whole narration while its acts or scenes would reference <i>roles </i>within 
        it.</p>
      <p>Similarly and without contradicting the above, a single scene can be 
          attributed the <i>pursuit</i> pattern and the <i>fugitive</i> and <i>punishment</i> 
        roles attributed to different characters, or groups of them.</p>
      <p>The pattern concept itself has been defined but no attempt to restrict 
          the nature or number of possible patterns has been attempted. It has 
          been left to the users to define which and how many patterns to use. 
          They can choose to rely on free imagination to describe the situations 
          or, possibly, choose to adopt a library of predefined patterns provided 
        by some authority and/or based on some particular theory.</p>
      <h2><b>Visualizers</b></h2>
      <p>XNDL does not define in itself a means of visualizing information, 
          which is therefore left to special visualization programs to understand 
          the language and deliver it to the viewers. Visualizers can be thought 
          of as very simple or sophisticated and based on many different graphical 
          devices. There are virtually no restrictions to what metaphor a visualizer 
          can use to represent the underlying information contained in an XNDL 
        file.</p>
      <p>A visualizer can choose to ignore certain information and many will 
          want to provide discovery and cross searching tools, in order to identify 
          similarities between different XNDL files, or order and classify them 
        based on the dramatic patterns they use.</p>
      <p>We implemented two simple visualizers, a text based one, which basically 
          transforms the information contained in an XNDL file into textual descriptions, 
          as they occur during the narration; and a vector graphics (SVG) based 
          prototype, which uses color, shape and arrows to give metaphorical descriptions 
        of characters, roles, mood, actions and events.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="scali4.jpg" width="607" height="404"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 4. An SVG visualizer for XNDL</p>
      <p>One possibility we would like to explore is to produce a visualizer 
          capable of rendering XNDL through UML collaboration diagrams, modeling 
          characters as objects with the addition of a few dedicated stereotypes. 
          Collaboration diagrams are, in fact, well suited for showing the relationships 
          (thanks to the links) between objects and for dynamic animation aimed 
        at continuously representing the evolving status of a system.</p>
      <h1>Possible Uses</h1>
      <h2>An authoring tool</h2>
      <p>With the XML schema in place, how the information is built up becomes 
          critical. Authoring unaided would be an unwelcome task for most people 
          whose work centers on the narrative. To ameliorate this situation an 
          authoring tool will need to be created to enable people to build the 
          structured information in a natural way. Such an authoring tool would 
          have both a text input aspect and a graphical vector display of the 
        plot visualization as it is built up.</p>
      <h2>Expert interpretations</h2>
      <p>How a narrative develops is part of the interaction between the author, 
          the text/drama/opera/film and the listener/reader/viewer. However, experts 
          in particular fields have ways they characterize such things, so they 
          are the natural users of our extensible schema. By capturing their views 
          in the schema, they can be made available to others, who can access 
          the resultant XML. Given an appropriate authoring tool, such experts 
          will be able to draw out the parallels and differences between different 
          narratives, providing the grounds for comparative study. With an agreed 
          standard, dramatic structures can be shared around the world, giving 
          the possibility of comparing the way Mongolian shamans tell stories 
        and the way Homer told his.</p>
      <h2>Learners&#39; interpretations</h2>
      <p>As a student of drama we may come across many different approaches 
          by experts to any particular plot; comparing them can often be difficult. 
          Being able to see the plots as visualizations can immensely ease this 
          process, enabling the development of a critical understanding. But further 
          to this is the possibility that the learners themselves can create their 
          own interpretation, visualize them and help themselves develop new and 
        clearer understandings of dramatic structures.</p>
      <h2>Building a community of learners</h2>
      <p>As experts and learners develop their own interpretations of narrative 
          structure, some interesting new possibilities arise. Given a standard 
          XML Schema, this material can be shared. This means that, for example, 
          students working in a school in England can develop a shared environment 
          for the study of drama with students at a school in New Zealand. This 
          network capacity opens up possibilities for diasporas everywhere. The 
          traditional narratives of Nigeria can be studied by the Nigerian diaspora 
          in the U.S. and their dramatic structures understood. This helps to 
          build communities of understanding centered upon narrative architectures. 
          The nuances of understanding, so often lost on distant observers/readers, 
          can be elaborated by culturally embedded learners. By subtle semantic 
          tagging, new emotional understanding can be revealed, providing a stronger 
        basis for the creation of mutual understanding and significance.</p>
      <p>With a shared schema in place, as time moves on, it will become possible 
          to literally see the way in which understanding of certain dramas has 
          changed over the years. We would find it very enlightening now to be 
          able to really comprehend how the members of the audience of the first 
          night of Shakespeare&#39;s Romeo and Juliet understood the drama and 
          compare it with the way the first night audience of West Side Story 
        would have characterized its narrative development.</p>
      <h1>Analysis Of Other Narrative Forms</h1>
      <h2>Speeches</h2>
      <p>The use of the schema is not limited to what we think of as dramatic 
          narratives, although this includes a vast range of cultural objects 
          from epic poetry, plays, and operas to novels, musicals and films. We 
          can also see how this schema can be applied to other narrative or dramatic 
          objects. We can understand a speech as a dramatic object; the ancient 
          art of rhetoric is based upon this premise. For instance, if we look 
          at the way Plato unpacks the moral qualities of a speech in the Phaedrus 
          we can see how significant this is. If we apply this approach to the 
          speeches of modern politicians, we can picture the journey they are 
        taking us on as listeners.</p>
      <h2>Conversations</h2>
      <p>Conversations can be mapped in similar ways, whether they are face 
          to face, on the telephone or on-line. To be able to visualize conversations 
          as dramatic structures is revealing. It enables us to understand the 
          ebb and flow of ideas. This could be especially important where the 
          conversation in question has special significance, in a court of law, 
        for instance.</p>
      <h2>Journeys</h2>
      <p>Journeys can also be seen as a special sort of narrative. We only have 
          to think of the narratives based upon the journey as a motif, from the 
          Odyssey through to Chaucer and Dante, to contemporary road movies. Journeys 
          have their own narrative structure, felt by the protagonist and observable 
          through the filters of time and distance. Journeys can be mapped as 
          dramatic structures, and the visualization of these can be linked to 
        the geographic map of the journey.</p>
      <h2>A quick overview of a narrative</h2>
      <p>As well as the more intense uses outlined above, there are other situations 
          where we want a quick, easy-to-understand overview. We might be rushing 
          to get to the opera, not knowing what the basic plot is, wanting to 
          just quickly scan the key elements on a mobile phone, or we might be 
          needing a clear overview of a book we had hoped to have read. Or we 
          might have missed the first part of a drama on television and want to 
          catch up with what has happened and learn how the character relationships 
          have developed. In these circumstances a visualization of the plot and 
          the characters trajectories would enable us to grasp the essentials 
          quickly and easily. This is especially true for those of us who think 
        configurationally rather than in sequences.</p>
      <h2>Authoring of dramatic structures</h2>
      <p>Whilst the XML schema was initially developed to help the understanding 
          of existing narratives, it could also be used in the creation of new 
          ones. We know that authors work in many ways, from those who plan out 
          their work in minute detail before starting to write to those who start 
          with characters and a situation and follow them to a conclusion. Especially 
          for those who craft the plot beforehand, a visual representation can 
          be useful. Being able to compare and contrast it with other narrative 
          developments by other authors could engender new departures. Certainly 
          if the narrative needs to be shared with others at an early stage, then 
          a visualizer with the ability to adjust the elements would form a strong 
          shared working environment. Effectively, a plot outliner could be built 
        based upon this schema.</p>
      <h2>Storyboarding / Screenplay writing</h2>
      <p>The activity of storyboarding could be greatly facilitated by the use 
          of a tool based upon the Schema. This could allow both the basic outline 
          of plot and character development and the adjustment of these to suit 
          the desired purpose. Such a tool could enable the creator to change 
          both the values within the schema and the trajectory of the narrative 
          in the visualization. Imagine if Juliet had wakened earlier and left 
          the vault with Romeo, only to be confronted by the two rival families 
          continuing their turf war. Such a plot change could be made in the visualization 
        and the consequences explored.</p>
      <h2>Authoring interactive narratives</h2>
      <p>Whilst any narrative could benefit from such visualizations, the interactive 
          narrative with its enormous potential complexities could benefit most 
          of all. Being able to see the nodal points with their multiple pathways 
          and how they relate to character and context could give greater chance 
        of more resonant structures being developed.</p>
      <h2>Building new toolsets</h2>
      <p>We have just suggested a few of the simple toolsets which might be 
          developed on the basis of this schema. There are many more. Others 
          could develop new tools which could enhance our communication and understanding 
          in the context of the narrative, in ways that we have not yet thought 
        about.</p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>With the present work we have described our efforts to create a specific 
          language to represent plots and dramatic patterns within works of narration. 
          The possibilities springing from our first findings are very encouraging, 
          and we intend to extend our research and develop further prototypes 
          in the near future. The many application areas which we envisaged before 
          now promise new challenges and possibilities to try our work with real 
          world projects. We look forward to them to improve and refine XNDL. 
          As soon as it is stable enough we will transpose it to be compliant 
        with the MPEG-7 standard.</p>
