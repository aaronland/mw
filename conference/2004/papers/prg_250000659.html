      <p class="PaperTitle">Digital Storytelling at the National Gallery of Art</p>
      <p class="Author">Julie Springer, National Gallery of Art;  Sara Kajder, 
          University of Virginia; Julia Borst Brazas, Chicago WebDocent Project, 
        USA</p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
       <p class="AbstractText">Stories put us in touch with ourselves, others, 
          and our surroundings. Using innovations in multimedia technology, student 
          and adult audiences can make personal connections to visual art and 
          museum artifacts through new ways of storytelling. Digital storytelling 
          is a new medium for this age-old practice and one that is humanistic, 
          culturally rich, and globally relevant. This paper will review the pedagogical 
          dimensions of a digital storytelling tutorial for K-12 teachers that 
          took place at the National Gallery of Art&#39;s Teacher Institute 
          in the summer of 2003. It will also examine how the concepts presented 
          have been translated into real-world experience in Chicago public schools. 
          The value of digital storytelling - for teachers and for museums - will 
          be addressed through the perspectives of the museum educator who organized 
          the Institute, a language arts teacher who served as a technology coach, 
          and a program enrollee who develops on-line educational resources for 
        Chicago public schools.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The 2003 Teacher Institute explored the connections among storytelling, 
          imagery, and learning, while it examined the ways teachers can use art 
          objects with storytelling activities in the classroom. The last three 
          days of the program were an intensive, hands-on tutorial in which participants 
          told their own stories about an artwork, artist, or experience with 
          art through short, digital movies.  With help from coaches, teachers 
          wrote, designed, and produced an electronic story using Adobe Photoshop 
        Elements, Apple iMovie software, and Smartsound Sonicfire Pro.  </p>
      <p>Prior to their arrival, participants were offered tips on script duration, 
          number of images, and use of video clips. A password-protected Web site 
          was established to help them prepare.  The site outlined the educational 
          premise for storytelling (digital and otherwise) and offered bibliographic 
        and Web resources for crafting an effective movie (See Figure 1).</p>

      <h1>Why Storytelling, and Why Do It Digitally?</h1>
      <p>With the growing interest in storytelling across many sectors of society, 
          it seemed a timely topic for the Teacher Institute and offered a perfect 
          link to narrative art. Word and image go hand in hand. Until the Twentieth 
          Century, paintings and sculpture were often vehicles for storytelling, 
          and effective storytelling has always used rich visual metaphors for 
          immediate, sensory effects. Recent research also suggests that people 
          process and retain information in narrative structures and that stories 
          are fundamental to making meaning.  According to learning theorist Roger 
        C. Schank, stories are at the core of human intelligence.</p>
      <p>Stories allow us to share our experiences and build a sense of community 
        with others. Penninah Schram says,</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Storytelling connects people.  It connects hearts.  
        It helps answer questions like: Who am I? Who are my people?  With what 
          values did they live?  How should I live?  How should I die?  What are 
          the legacies that I want to transmit to my children and to the next 
        generation? (Mooney &amp; Holt, 1996). </p>
      <p>Bill Harley believes that storytelling is particularly important today:  
      </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">With all the noise we have in this culture, it&#39;s 
          heartening that one person talking can still command attention.  (Mooney 
        &amp; Holt, 1996<i>).</i></p>
      <p>The pedagogical dimensions of storytelling could be summarized as follows: 
        they are</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <div class="listwithbullets">
            Humanistic: a culturally rich and venerated practice, global in relevance; 
            encourages people to value their experiences both imaginary and real, 
            and it puts us in touch with ourselves and others. Stories communicate 
            values. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="listwithbullets">
            Cross-disciplinary: stories apply to many K-12 subjects, including 
            language arts, history, social studies, and humanities</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="listwithbullets">
            Cross-cultural: narrative structures cut across cultural and geographic 
            spaces and unite oral, written, and technological literacies.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="listwithbullets">
            Multisensory, multimodal:  they have visual, auditory, kinesthetic 
            properties</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="listwithbullets"> 
            Constructivist: storytelling is learner-centered; tales are created 
            out of an individual&#39;s knowledge and experience.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="listwithbullets">
            Learning directed:  we learn in narrative structures and think in 
            terms of stories. </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Storytelling about museum objects can be particularly powerful. Cultural 
          treasures that have been singled out for preservation - cherished over 
          time, fought over, bartered, stolen, celebrated in verse - can have 
          a singularly powerful and evocative presence. Properly structured, storytelling 
          activities encourage people to connect to these artifacts on a deeper, 
          more personal level, reaching an understanding that goes beyond the 
          more traditional, intellectualized parameters established by museum 
          professionals (historical, cultural, stylistic, and biographical).  
        If proof is needed of the power of museum treasures to inspire storytelling, 
        witness the rise of popular books and movies inspired by works of art, 
        most recently Jan Vermeer&#39;s <i>Girl with a Pearl Earring.</i></p>
      <p>Digital storytelling allows many of the traditional elements of performance-based 
          storytelling to be seamlessly integrated - the visual and verbal, the 
          kinesthetic and auditory.  Because it incorporates a wide range of task 
          - including scriptwriting and editing, image manipulation, voice-over 
          narration, music selection, and timing - digital storytelling allows 
          educators to address multiple learning styles within a single lesson.  
        Since it draws on a wide range of academic skills, digital storytelling 
        also has impressive cross-curricular potential.  Finally, it helps learners 
          of all ages build the technological skills required in an increasingly 
          electronic society.  As they learn word-processing and imaging software 
          or transfer video clips and still photographs from digital cameras to 
          computers for use in their movies, digital storytellers master general 
        technology concepts and operational skills.</p>
      <p>Among master teachers, digital storytelling is rapidly becoming a major 
          vehicle for building twenty-first century literacies. According to Kathleen 
          Tyner (1998), it offers the advantages of an experiential approach to 
          learning while combining oral and alphabetic literacies with those intrinsic 
        to the new multimedia. </p>
      <h2>The National Gallery Experiment</h2>
      <p>These theories and educational goals informed the 2003 Teacher Institute 
          at the National Gallery of Art.  As part of a six-day professional development 
          program about storytelling and the visual arts, teachers of varied disciplines, 
          K-12, participated in a three-day digital storytelling tutorial conducted 
          by Joe Lambert and Emily Paulos of the Center for Digital Storytelling 
        in Berkeley, California.</p>
      <p>Using Apple iMovie and Photoshop Elements imaging software, teachers 
          produced a 3- to 5-minute movie that focused on an artistic motif of 
          their choice.  They were asked to come to Washington with a one-page 
          script of their voice-over narration and 10 to 20 images with which 
          to tell their story. Participants were also provided with step-by-step 
          guidance on how to build an effective story: the Center for Digital 
          Storytelling&#39;s May 2003 revision of the <i>Digital Storytelling 
          Cookbook and Travelling Companion  </i>was made available to them in 
          printed and pdf formats. Upon completing the Institute, all were given 
          copies of Lambert&#39;s book (2002), which covers technical matters 
        while making an eloquent case for the transformative power of storytelling.</p>
      <h2>Meg&#39;s Story</h2>
      <p>Digital storytelling can be a compelling and satisfying process, from 
          crafting the right story through every stage of the technological telling. 
          It is learner-centered in the best way imaginable as it asks us to make 
          meaning out of experience <i>we </i>deem significant. <b> </b>The digital 
          story made by Meg Garcia, a high school English and Art History teacher 
          from southern California, is an outstanding example of authentic, object-based 
          storytelling. Meg&#39;s story revolved around the child she hopes 
          one day to have - a daughter, to be named Matisse after the French early 
          Twentieth Century artist.  His colorful, decorative paper cutouts provided 
          the visual foundation of the narrative.  In these decorative collages 
          painted with opaque watercolor (gouache), cut with scissors and then 
        pasted in place, Meg saw her dreams for this child unfold:  </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Matisse Margaret Garcia will be the name of my daughter. 
          I want my child to be unique and use her personal pair of scissors to 
          craft the shape of her life. I want her imagination to be as vivid as 
          gouache on paper . . . I want her to be named after Matisse, who, in 
          the face of crippling arthritis could not keep the sea snail in the 
        depths of the ocean . . . .</p>
      <p>Several factors make Meg&#39;s digital story successful. First, she 
          is comfortable enough in her knowledge of Matisse and his work to allow 
          her personal reflections to remain center stage. She thus avoids anything 
          reminiscent of the documentary or historical narrative, which too often 
          seems amateurish. Throughout, she strikes exactly the right emotional 
          chord, overcoming the novice storyteller&#39;s inclination to aim 
          for neutrality and distance, while steering clear of the opposite extreme: 
          sentimentality.  Her sensitivity to the artworks is keen and the associations 
          gleaned from each personal and real.  Words are chosen with a precision 
          and economy that allow the individual images to carry the force of the 
          story.  What cannot be conveyed here, in writing, is the expressive 
        power of Meg&#39;s own voice.</p>

      <p class="caption">Figure 2:  The calligraphic 
          forms of Matisse&#39;s Beasts of the Sea (1950) inspired the voice-over:

          arthritis could not keep the sea snail in the depths of the ocean.&#39;  (Paper collage on canvas, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 
        Ailsa Mellon Bruce Fund, 116 3/8 x 60 5/8 in.)</p>
      <p>For educators looking to provide students with opportunities to develop 
          literacies beyond the traditional printed word, digital storytelling 
          is ideal (Kinzer &amp; Leander, 2002; Leu, Karchmer, &amp; Leu, 1999; 
          Kinzer &amp; Leu, 1997).  It brings students&#39; narratives and inquiry 
          into the classroom, extends their literacy skills, and challenges them 
          to create within a multimedia environment that develops their skills 
          as writers, directors, artists, programmers, and designers.  Further, 
          students must exercise comprehension skills as viewers, asking how it 
          is that they understand the story as it&#39;s now told in an oral, 
          visual, and textual form.  Here, meanings are not fixed and additive 
        but multiplicative (Lemke, 1998).  </p>
      <p>Classrooms across the country have integrated digital storytelling 
          into their content curricula.  Secondary science students use digital 
          stories and a process of narrative inquiry to develop hypotheses about 
          natural phenomena. In English and language arts classrooms, students 
          write personal narratives that are delivered as digital stories.  Mathematics 
          students create and solve digital story problems. In social studies, 
          students learn community histories told through digital stories. The 
          process of digital storytelling gives students opportunities to discover, 
          reflect, narrate, explain, and persuade both orally and in writing. 
      </p>
      <p>Part of the instructional appeal of digital storytelling is that the 
          process of writing, editing, and narrating a script strengthens and 
          reinforces basic literacy skills. Reading, both in and outside of the 
          classroom, is about much more than simply absorbing words on a page. As 
        Gallas writes,</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">to read a text with understanding and insight, we 
          must move inside a text, pulling our life along with us and incorporating 
        the text and our lives into a new understanding of the world.  (2003.</p>
      <p>Equally important are the social and multicultural aspects of the digital 
          story. Storytelling and the narrative inquiry process integral to oral 
          history provide opportunities for sharing and better understanding our 
          individual experiences and larger cultural traditions. As Bakhtin explains, 
          words are learned from interactions with others: ‘none of us is 
          the first speaker, the one who disturbed the eternal silence of the 
          universe&#39; (1986).  From words that are spoken to us, we glean 
          lexical meaning and identify our individual roles in the communities 
          where those words are voiced.  Words teach us our history and who we 
          can become.  Words are another link in the chain of speech communication, 
          revealing both where we&#39;ve been (where our words were learned) 
          and where we are (how we use them). With digital stories, student writers 
          pair their words with images and sounds to further communicate intended 
          meaning.  As readers, students are challenged to develop more complex 
          senses of self as they test, interpret, and learn from the stories shared 
          by others. These stories allow students to make connections between 
        texts, ideas, and the world outside of their classrooms.</p>
      <h1>Crafting a Digital Story in the K-12 Classroom</h1>
      <p>The technologies available in our schools change expected literacies 
          and modes of communication (Kinzer &amp; Leander, 2002), as they challenge 
          classroom teachers to integrate tools and curricula meaningfully, authentically, 
          in such a way as to expand student learning.  In terms of technical 
          requirements, digital storytelling requires only that students have 
          access to a computer with some sort of digital video software. As operating 
          systems bundle in programs such as Apple iMovie or Windows MovieMaker, 
          these tools are becoming increasingly present and almost ubiquitous 
          in schools. Students also benefit from the use of digital cameras, scanners, 
          and printers, which are likewise becoming increasingly prevalent. The 
          bare-bones requirement is simply that students compile images and recorded 
        narration, side by side.</p>
      <p>The process of digital storytelling consists of six steps: 1) scriptwriting, 2) 
          artifact searching, 3) storyboarding, 4) revising the script and storyboard, 5) 
        constructing the digital story, and 6) screening.  </p>
      <h2>Step One:  Scriptwriting</h2>
      <p>In English and language arts classrooms, students work to convey their 
          own personal narratives or to share findings of community oral histories.  
        Reading, writing, speaking, and representing are at the core of the 
        traditional language arts curriculum. Students share and discuss family 
          stories, books from their childhood, and their experiences in school. These 
          classrooms are driven by Langer&#39;s idea that ‘all literature 
          - the stories we read and those we tell - provides us with a way to 
          imagine human potential&#39; (1995). Students sound and balance their 
          stories against the authors read in an attempt to validate, understand, 
          and critically consider their experiences. Written scripts are read 
          aloud, bringing the students&#39; voice into a story that is shared.  
      </p>
      <h2>Step Two:  Artifact Searching</h2>
      <p>Digital stories are typically built using still photos and/or moving 
          images. Students must work not only to identify powerful images that 
          convey intended meanings, but also to revise their written scripts to 
          allow the images time to speak. This requires students to slow down, 
          see the extraordinary in the ordinary, and become better writers through 
        close observation and careful use of language.</p>
      <h2><b>Step Three:  Storyboarding</b></h2>
      <p>Students map each image, technique, and element of their story by constructing 
          a storyboard on paper. This visual story has two dimensions: chronology 
          (what happens and when) and interaction (how audio information and image 
          interact) (Lambert, 2002).Using a storyboard, students arrange images 
          listed on sticky notes. On another line on the storyboard, students 
        sequence the images with the narrated text. </p>
      <h2>Step Four:  Revising the Script and Storyboard</h2>
      <p>Storyboarding requires students to examine their scripts closely. As 
          Heard explains, revision ‘involves changing the meaning, content, 
          structure or style of a piece of writing rather than the more surface 
          changes that editing demands&#39;(Heard 2003). To that end, students&#39; 
          work centers on bringing voice to their pieces or on helping the events 
        come alive for the viewer-reader.</p>
      <h2>Step Five:  Constructing the Digital Story</h2>
      <p>To build their digital stories, students import or digitize their photos; 
          add transitions and special effects; record narration; add a soundtrack; 
        and burn their finished work to a CD. </p>
      <p>Conventional digital stories involve the writing of a script that is 
          read aloud and recorded to provide narration.The most essential element 
          of the scripting and narration process is that the student&#39;s voice 
          be present in the reading of the printed text. Students are present 
          as readers, writers, and thinkers throughout the project, some for the 
        first time.</p>
      <p>With a ratio of 80 percent content to 20 percent effect, construction 
          should emphasize content over presentation. Otherwise, students become 
          too caught up in zooms, pans, and special effects that show knowledge 
          of the tools but little control of the story. By putting the story first, 
          students become selective about effects, choosing those that drive the 
          story as opposed to those that mimic what might be seen in popular films 
        or television.</p>
      <h2>Step Six:  Screening</h2>
      <p>Students and teachers screen the finished digital stories with the 
          additional requirement that students provide written and oral responses. 
          Shared responses can celebrate students&#39; attempts to reflectively 
          add meaning to past events or request more detail. Others might explore 
          technical suggestions for both the presentation and the content, referring 
          to cinematic terms or class texts. These conversations generate a collaborative 
          interpretive community and supportive structure for students to talk 
        and interact as readers and as writers.</p>
      <h1>Storytelling and the Chicago WebDocent Project</h1>
      <p>The Teacher Institute inspired the Chicago WebDocent Project (CWD) 
          to explore storytelling as a tool for teachers and students to find 
          their own meanings in museum objects. The WebDocent Project, started 
          in 1999, is an initiative of the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) / University 
          of Chicago Internet Project and eight cultural institutions: Adler Planetarium 
          and Astronomy Museum, Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago Historical Society, 
          DuSable Museum of African American History, Field Museum, Museum of 
          Science and Industry, Newberry Library, and the Oriental Institute. 
          (<a href="http://www.chicagowebdocent.org/" target="_blank">http://www.chicagowebdocent.org/</a>) 
          The goal of CWD is to develop story-based, on-line curriculum materials 
          featuring objects, images, and texts in various media from Chicago&#39;s 
        world-class museum and library collections.  </p>
      <p>Based on what CPS teachers consider to be needed materials or areas 
          of special interest to their students, CWD focuses on social studies 
          and science topics for grades 3 through 8. Teachers identify the scope 
          and sequence of the curriculum module to be developed, and they write, 
          review, and field-test the lessons, which are aligned with the state 
          and national learning standards. Lessons are delivered as an interactive 
          multimedia experience, via the Internet, exclusively to Chicago public 
        schools. </p>
      <p>Teachers decided to develop the lessons as stories because they wanted 
          to create materials that would be student-ready, in contrast to lesson 
          plans which require facilitation by a teacher (and which are already 
          abundant on the Web). They also wanted to avoid the impersonal voice 
          of the textbook. Storytelling is an effective way of communicating a 
          lesson that engages students&#39; imagination while delivering content 
          to meet standards for learning. By developing lessons as stories, the 
          aim was to make the curriculum friendly and responsive to students.  
      </p>
      <p>Storytelling complemented CWD&#39;s goals to create deep, rich, and 
          interactive materials using Chicago&#39;s museum and library collections. 
          In the process of working together, teachers and CWD staff developed 
          an interface design that combined elements of a chapter storybook with 
          interactive, multimedia features. Students interact with lessons through 
          multiple modes of learning. They read, write, explore high-resolution 
          still images, listen to sounds, view animations that explicate processes, 
        and engage in simulations where they can manipulate museum objects.</p>
      <p>Teachers write their lessons in the personas of guide characters to 
          give vivid, firsthand accounts of an historical event, era, or scientific 
          discovery. Often the guide is a peer of the student who will be reading 
          the lesson. The guide shares personal details and particulars of his 
          or her life to give context. The storytelling approach personalizes 
          and humanizes historical events, making them more appealing to students. 
          Details of the guide&#39;s life and experiences become the bridge  
        for connecting to formal student learning goals.</p>
      <p>Integrating material culture, technology, and storytelling has required 
          new teacher training to achieve a consistent result. The teachers who 
          participate are a heterogeneous group with a wide range of skills and 
          experience. Most enjoy the museum experience and have been active field 
          trip visitors with their students. But not all teachers are practiced 
          curriculum developers or adept writers, nor does pre-service training 
          prepare them to integrate technology and teaching practices. A range 
          of skills is needed to develop lessons for the WebDocent Project: those 
          of the museum educator, author, classroom teacher, performer, and technologist.  
      </p>
      <p>In addition to a more effective teacher-training program, CWD developed 
          ways to streamline lesson production to strengthen the storytelling 
          and multimedia possibilities of the WebDocent curriculum development 
          model. The WebDocent Content Management and Presentation system (CMAP) 
          provides a template for lesson writing and access to media elements 
          so that teachers may outline and organize their lesson on-line. They 
          can write and edit text, as well as search and select objects, images, 
          texts, sounds, video, and other media elements. Teachers incorporate 
          media using a drag and drop function to add desired elements to each 
          page. High-resolution images can be bookmarked to bring attention to 
          specific details. These features appear in a unified interface, making 
          CMAP a user-friendly tool for developing story-based lessons. The ease 
          with which teachers can add digitized museum and library resources encourages 
        them to enrich every page in their story with multimedia.</p>
      <p>Increasingly, CWD&#39;s focus is to train teachers to use storytelling 
          to achieve learning goals more engagingly and meaningfully and to help 
          teachers create lessons that capitalize on the rich experience offered 
          by interactivity and multimedia content. A pilot training program has 
          been developed to help teachers acquire instructional skills using material 
          culture, including interpretation of objects and elicitation of stories 
          from them. One aspect of this program is training teachers to use CMAP. 
          Training precedes lesson writing, which takes place as a peer-review 
          circle where teachers share and critique lessons in development on a 
          cooperative Web workspace. The pilot training program uses digital storytelling 
          elements presented at the Teacher Institute to foster the multiple skills 
        needed for the project.  </p>
      <h1>Integrating Elements of Digital Storytelling into Teacher Training</h1>
      <p>One of the difficulties teachers experience using objects and images 
          in teaching is that they do not learn techniques for using primary resources 
          or material culture in their pre-service training. A concept emphasized 
          in the digital storytelling workshop and adopted in CWD teacher training 
          is the notion of making personal connections to an object or image. 
          This experience is fundamental for teachers who are learning to interpret 
          objects and present them in a narrative joining historical fact and 
          imagination. Most teachers find it easy to draw out stories from objects 
          or images that already hold personal meaning for them; finding a personal 
        connection to unfamiliar material is more difficult.</p>
      <p>To help teachers transfer storytelling skills from the familiar to 
          the new, they are asked to bring an object or image that holds personal 
          meaning for them. In a workshop setting, they share stories about their 
          artifacts. These stories are rich in detail and emotion. Other members 
          of the group contribute knowledge, expertise, and their own experience. 
          The end result is a shared understanding of the artifact from both personal 
          and cultural perspectives. For example, a teacher describes her personal 
          attachment to a ceramic vessel she received as a gift; an art teacher 
          explains the process for throwing a ceramic vessel; and a history teacher 
          who has traveled extensively shares knowledge of the region from which 
          the object originates. Through group discussion, ideas that link the 
          combined knowledge with formal learning goals are generated. To aid 
          teachers in observing, describing, and analyzing new and unfamiliar 
        material, CWD training incorporates Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS).</p>
      <p>In subsequent training at participating museums, teachers learn about 
          the collections from museum educators, curators, and archivists. Teachers 
          are encouraged to write down on index cards heir feelings, what they 
          have learned, and what they find interesting. Personal and shared meanings, 
          knowledge, and experience are shared among the group and become the 
          raw material for creating story-based lessons later. Using an approach 
          based on Egan&#39;s story form model (1986), teachers identify: 1) 
          what is most important about the shared knowledge of the artifact in 
          terms of learning goals, and what is most affectively engaging about 
          it; and 2) what the most powerful aspects of this knowledge are, that 
          best communicate the learning goal to students. This approach helps 
          teachers develop a dramatic narrative for their story. It also strengthens 
          the link between artifact and learning goal, rather than making the 
          artifact subordinate (or merely illustrative) to the learning experience. 
          The museum artifacts, along with additional content such as audio, video, 
          and other media elements, are loaded into the CMAP database in advance 
          of the lesson-writing phase. Teachers refer to their index cards and 
          other resources to outline and organize their lessons on-line; these 
        lessons are reviewed by the group as they are developed into stories.</p>
      <p>The success of the pilot training program will be monitored and findings 
          used to improve what we hope will become the standard preparation for 
          CWD writers. The project is also exploring a student-side interface 
          for the CWD database. Ideally, this tool will be used by students returning 
          from field trips as a follow-up activity to tell the story of a personal 
        connection to particular artifacts. </p>
      <p>The Chicago WebDocent Project is a demonstration of how the creative 
          and intellectual aspects of digital storytelling can be use as a curriculum 
          development model. At the same time, museum-school-university collaborations 
          such as CWD can expose students and teachers alike to a rich array of 
          museum and library resources and learning experiences that are only 
        possible through multimedia technology.</p>
