    <p class="PaperTitle">The Gernsback Machine: Towards a Museum 
      of Possible Futures and Probable Pasts </p>
    <p class="Author">Valerie J. Hobbs and Diarmuid 
      J. Pigott, Murdoch University; and Marjolein Towler, Consultas Pty Ltd, Australia</p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
     <p class="AbstractText">Museums have traditionally used timelines 
      as a means of creating narratives of historical, cultural, political, geographical 
      and social change. However, such timelines are only one aspect of a potential 
      infinity of semantic continua, and fail to exploit fully the possibilities 
      implicit in the objects that exemplify them. In this paper we describe the 
    &#39;Gernsback Machine&#39;, a novel categorisation and navigation model based on 
      principles of facet analysis that enables descriptive metadata terms to be 
      located within a fully navigable universal facet tree. The navigation potential 
      of &#39;step, flip or zoom&#39; inherent in the GM permits exploration through all 
      semantic continua, and, by allowing the users to follow their own particular 
      threads, enables complex narrative structures to be created. We describe how 
      the Gernsback Machine can be used to create a virtual museum space for new 
      or existing collections, using a series of recursively defined &#39;bento&#39; containers 
      to define the museum content. We describe how our prototype illustrates the 
      potential of the GM in exploring different aspects of the time facet, in a 
    &#39;museum of the history of possible futures and probable pasts&#39;.</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1><p>History is the science and art of the 
      plausible construction of narratives out of such fragments as we have been 
      left by the havoc wrought by time. Museums have traditionally used devices 
      such as timelines to create these narratives. The simplest timeline may illustrate 
      only a single theme, with historical events or occasions mapped against a 
      chronology; more complex ones weave together parallel streams to produce a 
      rich network of explicative narration (e.g. Rock+Roll Hall of Fame Museum, 
      <a href="http://www.rockhall.com/" target="_blank">http://www.rockhall.com/</a>; Metropolitan Museum 
      of Art Timeline of Art History, <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/splash.htm" target="_blank">http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/splash.htm</a>; 
      Natural History Museum&#39;s Dino Directory, <a href="http://flood.nhm.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dino/index.dsml" target="_blank">http://flood.nhm.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dino/index.dsml</a>). 
      The history of the human race may be represented through a superimposition 
      of the facts of fashions, reigns, civilisations, lives of famous people, culture, 
      and technology on a common linear axis, with parallel streams sometimes representing 
      these different threads of narrative for the same locale, and sometimes different 
      physical or geopolitical locations for the same time-display.</p><p>Underlying all timeline displays is a 
      set of presumptions that go overlooked and mainly unchallenged: these are 
      to do with the commensurability of events, the correspondence between narrative 
      structures, and the implicit assumption of the universal subjective temporal 
      standpoint which McTaggart (1908) called &#39;the unreality of time&#39;: the 
    &#39;God&#39;s-eye-view&#39; that permits such temporal arrays to be strung together like 
      beads on an abacus, each with its own measure but each in its role in the 
      greater system. Fraser (1975) draws on Uexkull (1934) to show that such constructs are necessary 
      subjective knowledge structures created by our sense of time, which belongs 
      in a noetic umwelt overlaying 
      the physical. Luce (1972) shows how our time-sense and hence our 
      co-ordination of time&#39;s passage are necessarily embodied, and how the very 
      selection of scale for time recording takes for granted much that must be 
      considered in presenting a succession of events tied to a series of circadian-based 
      sense impressions.</p><p>It is not that such systems are inaccurate 
      or inappropriate, but rather that their use implicitly entails continuously 
      ascending and descending a tree of interoperability to work (Figure 1). Any 
      use of a timeline will always involve this reinterpretive nature, and this 
      is especially significant whenever different term-sets (e.g. 1620s, 17<sup>th</sup> 
      century, Jacobean, Renaissance) are used to describe the same moment in time.</p><p>     </p>
    <p class="caption"><a href="hobbsFig1.html"><img src="HobbsFigure1Thumb.gif" alt="Time Concepts" width="400" height="115" border="0"/></a> </p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1"></a>Figure 1. Tree showing organisation of time concepts. </p><p>Every comparison between a <i>sociological</i> 
      view of history (reign, lifespan, generation) and a <i>chronological</i> one 
      (century, decade, year) involves backtracking up this tree to the nearest 
      common point and down again to the desired scale. As we see from Figure 1, 
      the common ancestor for both sociological and chronological time is <i>linear</i> 
      time. However, to move from a moment expressed as linear time to the same 
      moment expressed as <i>circadian</i> time involves reference to the root node 
      of the temporal tree.</p><p>Consider an example: a late summer day 
      in England. We can determine the <i>linear</i> senses easily enough - <i>sequential</i>: 
      19:00/196/1911 CE; <i>chronological</i>: Saturday, 15 July 1911 AD; <i>historico-political</i>: 
      Eventide, St Swithin&#39;s Day, Coronation Year of King George V; <i>sociological</i>: 
      Edwardian/Georgian period - and we can move between them by common reference 
      to the parent node of linear time. Similarly, we can move to the <i>circadian</i> 
      sense (e.g. <i>natural</i>: early evening, midsummer; or <i>sociologically</i> 
      <i>determined: </i>stumps, Saturday&#39;s cricket match) by drawing on the explicit 
      alignment of the linear temporal with the circadian, an alignment inherent 
      in temporality. </p><p>We can appreciate this concept more clearly 
      if we make a small change to one of the received facts. If we change the <i>historico-political</i> 
      value, so that we are now in the coronation year of George VI, rather than 
      George V (but still Eventide on St Swithin&#39;s Day), then the only value that 
      changes for the <i>sequential </i>is the year (1937 CE); the day of year (196) 
      and time of day (19:00) will not alter. However, the <i>social</i> sense 
      of the moment has gone from the golden dawn of a new century to the darkness 
      of the Depression with the threat looming of a new European war. And the significance 
      for the <i>circadian</i> values is considerable: while on a mundane level 
      the day is now Thursday, and has all of the appropriate <i>sociologically-determined</i> 
      circadian associations (workday, not half day), on a more sophisticated level 
      it is unlikely to be an occasion for cricket, and much less likely to be a 
      celebratory occasion (being further away from the Coronation date, and in 
      a time of great austerity). On the other hand, the <i>natural</i> circadian 
      sense (early evening, midsummer) remains untouched, as indeed it should.</p>
	  <p>If on the other hand the coronation were 
      that of King George IV, while the change for the <i>sequential </i>would have 
      had been similar (i.e. a change in year only), for the other senses of time 
      the differences would be considerable. The s<i>ociological </i>sense<i> </i>of 
      the moment would be placed in the turmoil of Georgian England, and while it 
      again happens to be a Thursday, it would be the Thursday four days <i>before 
      </i>the coronation, and the likelihood of celebration would have been high 
      (although the prospect of cricket negligible).</p><p>We can see from these examples that, by 
      having common ancestral terms, the inter-operation of the timescales can be 
      guaranteed, and this is the mechanism that validates the parallelism that 
      is involved in the multi-timeline display. As we shall discuss later, the 
      tree structure in Figure 1 has all invocations of the temporal that are required 
      in timeline displays, and any timeline display will always involve one or 
      more of these categories. </p><p>Another way of examining the timeline 
      is from the point of view of the signifiers marked along it: in other words, 
      from the perspective of the <i>subject matter</i> that applies at the particular 
      date. So our various interpretations of the point in time (19:00/196/1911 
      CE) become &#39;Sport, Edwardian, Cricket&#39; or &#39;Harvesting, Early 20c, England&#39; 
      or any other combinations. The delineation on the line now becomes one of 
      the interactions of several possible subjects of interest, and the secondary 
      (i.e. <i>non</i>-temporal) significances are a matter of the implicit subject 
      of display - to be in <i>this</i> timeline, it must have <i>this</i> feature. 
      The problem of timeline representation then becomes one of multiple subject 
      classification, one of which is always time.</p><p>The problem of classifying the temporal 
      in determining the subject matter of documents is of course a constant problem 
      for bibliography, and Ranganathan&#39;s (1959) distinction of a temporal &#39;facet&#39; offers 
      an insight for our timeline study. Time is only one of several continuously 
      interacting facets of meaning operating in any high-level description of a 
      set of facts, and to give meaning to the description must interact with other 
      facets (space, matter, personality, etc) to give a clear understanding of 
      the subject at hand. And every point in a timeline that has a spatial or material 
      significance can also be represented as a point on a spatial or material continuum 
      (effectively a &#39;space-line&#39; or a &#39;matter-line&#39;) where the point has a temporal 
      significance. We can then see that a timeline is a specific form of a generalised 
      <i>facet continuum</i>, and that all such continua will have a primary facet 
      which determines the nature of its contents, with secondary, tertiary, and 
      so on facets qualifying the meanings of the labels used.</p><p>We can see equivalent semantic organisational 
      hierarchies for facets other than time. The facet-tree in Figure 2 describes 
      extension in <i>space</i>, showing, for example, <i>political</i> features 
      (empires, nations, alliances in time) or <i>ecological</i> features (marshlands 
      and beaches in recent history indicating global warming). </p><p class="caption"><a href="hobbsFig2.html"><img src="HobbsFigure2Thumb.gif" alt="Space Concepts" width="400" height="115" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2"></a>Figure 2. Tree showing organisation of space concepts. </p><p>In a similar way, we can describe a <i>matter</i> 
      tree, for examining the instantiation of the agent and background for depicting 
      historical events (Figure 3).</p><p class="caption"><a href="hobbsFig3.html"><img src="HobbsFigure3Thumb.gif" alt="Matter Concepts" width="400" height="93" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig3"></a>Figure 3. Tree showing organisation of matter concepts. 
    </p><p>Beyond the root nodes of these individual 
      facets there can be conceived a single facet tree which informs all these 
      continua. The richness and evocative power of this tree lies in the large 
      amount of symbolic content that can be placed within its framework. This is 
      why timelines <i>per se</i> are so popular and ubiquitous: they have great 
      psychological appeal, as if one had a glimpse into the engine of history, 
      and could see the effects of causality embedded in its fabric.</p>
	  
	  <p>Let us now return to the idea of timeline 
      as narrative. When such timeline-based displays are conceived, their designers 
      are effectively creating a narrative to convey a sense of time&#39;s passing to 
      the intended audience. The events, occurrences or periods chosen for display 
      (and perhaps more significantly, the artefacts chosen to exemplify them) are 
      drawn from the designer&#39;s world-view, for all that they invoke the universal 
      objective that McTaggart criticized. And when we place a series of artefacts 
      in a line like beads on a wire, they are made into a pattern that conveys 
      an idea of temporality, but their essentially quantal nature might equally 
      well tell another story that fitted them. </p><p>This multiple interpretation is of serious 
      concern to the exhibition designer - the effect of revisionism on older exhibits 
      is to make them exposed to ridicule, for all that they had serious intention 
      in their design. A review of art histories by Elkins (2002) shows a dangerous reliance on the European 
      Leonardo to Picasso period, with a distorted view of the rest of human creativity. 
      When Gould analyses historical timelines (Gould, 1987), trees of life (Gould, 1989) and categorization of race (Gould, 1981) he shows how much the designer 
      serves as an unconscious interpreter for their audience.</p>
	  
	  <p>Paradoxically, however, this polysemy 
      is also of great potential benefit to the designer of such exhibitions. Given 
      the multiplicity of potential interpretations for any point in the timeline, 
      and for any artefacts instantiating that point, the question becomes one not 
      of designing a timeline, but rather of selecting an interesting one from the 
      myriad narratives implicit in the artefacts themselves.</p>
	  <p>The act of collecting and preserving that 
      is the raison d&#39;etre of museums cannot predict what will end up being important, 
      nor can it say with any surety what was once important. But when making an 
      exhibition, a pathway can always be drawn to connect and explain certain objects 
      within a hypothesised narrative structure. This applies not only to the curator, 
      but also to the museum visitors, who can select their own paths through an 
      exhibition from the many possible ones that may be of interest. And the power 
      of such narratives as educational and research tools is obvious: by creating 
      time- and space-lines to record the contents of a collection, the users can 
      create their own information matrix in that collection&#39;s holospace.</p><p>However, not all exhibitions will be coherent 
      merely from the happenstance of their conjunctive orthogonality - there must 
      be an intelligible rationale if the entire system is not to be become chaotic 
      or anarchic in its presentation. So the challenge for the designer of such 
      a museological information system is to try to restrict the potential to the 
      plausible and interesting, without imposing too fixed a view onto the process 
      of timeline creation. This leads to the establishment of a possible framework, 
      not only for classifying objects in a collection, and for displaying them 
      in timeline-based tours, but also for a systematic subject/facet-based interaction 
      between collections that are geographically distinct, either within a multi-homed 
      collection, or between different members of the museums community.</p>
	  <p>Bearman and Trant (2002) in a recent 
      critique of museum Web practices, observed that increased access to independent 
      sources of knowledge has not yet led to an emergent unified museum-based knowledge 
      resource, as the Web currently &#39;takes little advantage of the interrelationships 
      between and among disparately located museum objects&#39;. They go on to state 
      that &#39;museums&#39; collective knowledge can only be identified, navigated, explored 
      and integrated if its structure is explicitly declared (Bearman and Trant, 
      2002, 5). </p><p>In this paper we present a prototype for 
      a virtual on-line museum that permits visitor-constructed narratives for museum 
      exhibitions within a multifaceted, interrelated information space. The categorisation 
      and navigation model at the heart of this system - the Gernsback Machine - 
      permits novel types of exploration along all facets of meaning for any object 
      or grouping of objects, and the system itself can draw on both local and Internetworked 
      resources. </p>
    <h1>The Gernsback Machine</h1><p>At the heart of the Gernsback Machine 
      is a set of facet categorisations that determine the applicability of values 
      to all of the objects within a collection. It is this commonly determined 
      yet distinct categorisation system that enables the Gernsback Machine to perform 
      its twin roles of cataloguing and navigation. The selection of different faceted 
      termsets is an integral part of the process of accession and curation, and 
      of the virtual museum&#39;s tour experience.</p><p>Our framework draws on Ranganathan&#39;s facets, 
      but recognises the need for rich cultural (and more significantly non-book) 
      materials to be represented in the multiple dimensioned trees that we have 
      already described above. Each facet has a matching branch of a single unified 
      facet tree, and the four levels of the branch give an invariant framework 
      for scaling the appropriate continua and enable the collection objects to 
      be located and navigated.</p>
    <h2>The Facet Tree </h2><p>Despite a preponderance of metadata schemes 
      and schemas for organizing metadata and encouraging metadata interchange, 
      there remains (Doerr, Hunter, &amp; Lagoze, 2003) a cultural 
      relation aspect to most metadata use. When use has been made of traditional 
      library science organizing principles such as Dewey (OCLC, 2004) and LCSH (Library of Congress, 2004), the tendency has 
      often been to map the most likely occurrence of an artefact (i.e. to facilitate 
      retrieval), rather than use them to indicate the semantic richness of an artefact. 
    </p><p>Rather than take this approach, we have 
      drawn on the Facet Analysis system&#39;s ability to represent the knowledge embodied 
      in objects with the maximum amount of polysemy, and so make the consultation 
      process much more informative. By maximising the points of access into a system, 
      we maximise the likelihood of an inquiry being successful, not the 
      case with single mode classification systems. </p><p>Facet analysis can be seen as an attempt 
      to get a unified location of &#39;slot/descriptor&#39; pairs within an intellectual 
      universe of discourse. In this it presages the frame model of knowledge representation 
      (e.g. Minsky, 1981), and it can be used to inform 
      a frame-based media/collection description system. In drawing on the facets 
      to organise our metadata-rich media artefacts and the objects for which they 
      are proxy, we are proposing a new organising principle based on the facet 
      classification system and applicable not only to existing metadata 
      stores, but also to existing metadata schemas. </p><p>(It is important to note that in some 
      knowledge management and information retrieval literature we find a different 
      use of the term &#39;facet&#39;, to describe a common system of headings for metadata, 
      and to group lists of descriptors under those headings: in contrast to our 
      usage, they present a faceted information space as one partaking of the grouped 
      slot/term pairs, rather than the systematic that informs them.) </p>
    <p>We have already introduced three of the facet trees in the 
      Introduction: those for <i>time</i>, <i>space</i> and <i>matter</i>. There 
      are corresponding trees for the remaining Ranganathan concepts (<i>personality</i> 
      and <i>energy</i>), and to these we also add one for <i>ontology</i> and one 
      for <i>causality</i>. These two additional facets are necessary because of 
      the nature of the museum exhibitions that are to be supported: <b>ontology 
      </b>because we are drawing comparisons between objects and sets of objects, 
      and need to show how they fit together in relation to each other and the world, 
      and <b>causality</b> because part of what we are trying to establish is a 
      way of depicting the relations between the objects, especially when trying 
      to illustrate complex object relationships in an historical setting. </p><p>We describe the facet trees in general 
      terms here, and defer a complete discussion of their structures to another 
      paper. Each facet tree has four levels - facet, domain, quality and 
      measure - with each level considered a <i>dimension</i> of the termset that 
      is used to determine the value of the object (Figure 4). These four levels 
      are the minimum to get a necessary and sufficient set of terms to clearly 
      define a termset. The application of a term to an object results in a value: 
      to reconstruct that value, the full termset must be recreated as an enfolding 
      context. Each path down a facet tree from node to measure represents distinct 
      categorisations of values that cannot be mixed or translated without losing 
      information or (worse) committing category errors. This is a significant point, 
      as it is the manner in which we can underwrite the intelligibility of the 
      classification practices involved from facet to value.</p><p class="caption"><a href="hobbsFig4.html"><img src="HobbsFigure4Thumb.gif" alt="Time Facets" width="400" height="200" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig4"></a>Figure 4. Part of the facet tree for Time showing (from 
      top) dimensions of domain, quality and measure. </p><p>At the top of the facet tree is the root 
      node, which corresponds to the facet itself. Below the root node is a dimension 
      that represents the universe of discourse or <i>domain</i> within which the 
      term operates. Although domains partake of the same facet, generally they 
      are incompatible with each other - they are describing different experiences 
      of the same facet. In the example of the time facet, the three domains (linear, 
      circadian, and cyclical) are actually incommensurate - there are no one-for-one 
      equivalences possible between them. Of course, some values (such as linear 
      chronological values) will have components that may be translatable by reference 
      to an absolute table of correspondence, but generally to consider one domain&#39;s 
      value from the perspective of another is to commit a category error.</p><p>The dimension below the domain, <i>quality</i>, 
      does however permit inter-translation. Here the ways in which the value can 
      be applied to the object are regularised. The qualities within a domain are 
      compatible with one another, but operate within different terms of reference. 
      In our example in the introduction, we showed the different ways in which 
      a point of time could take linear values. </p><p>Below the quality dimension is <i>measure</i>. 
      This is the level at which the mechanism for description for the subject is 
      determined: it can be selection of a units system, it can indicate a preference 
      for vocabulary or customary use, or it can be indexical to an external authority 
      that will act as a source for terms. In Figure 4 some of the measures for 
      linear and circadian time are indicated. Here the examples elaborated in the 
      introduction can be mapped out, and the correspondences clearly seen. </p><p>Thus, when we have the four reference 
      points of <b>facet</b>, <b>domain</b>, <b>quality</b> and <b>measure</b> set, 
      then the domain of application of the <b>termse</b>t is established. The termset 
      determines a value for the object, and that value is uniquely defined by that 
      termset. </p>
    <h2>Navigation </h2><p>The facet tree is used to retrieve objects within a collection 
      by choosing a termset from the facet tree, and selecting values within that 
      termset to use as search terms for the objects. Each selection of termset 
      +values makes a constraint set (or <i>heuristic</i>), and application of an 
      heuristic results in a set of objects that satisfy its being returned (the 
      <i>ambit</i> of the heuristic). Repeated application of heuristics and movement 
      within an ambit are what enables navigation through the museum space. Several 
      constraints may be applied concurrently, permitting complex heuristics to 
      be developed. </p><p>There are three types of operation possible within the 
      collection space. We can move from one object to another either within or 
      between ambits; we can change the heuristic so that it includes more or fewer 
      objects in its ambit; or we can shift the focus of the system to another ambit 
      entirely. It is these three core operations that determine our systems navigation: 
      <i>stepping</i> between objects, <i>zooming</i> the heuristic (increasing 
      range or increasing detail) and <i>flipping</i> the view (shifting the path) 
      between ambits. </p>
      <p><i>Stepping</i> is the main navigation mode in the Gernsback 
      Machine. It is how we proceed from one object (or composite object) to another. 
      With step, we move in a direction from one object to the next in the currently 
      selected continuum. Alternatively, movement can be in graded measures along 
      a continuum (when there do not have to be objects present for those gradations), 
      e.g. moving along a timeline one decade at a time, or synchronizing several 
      sparsely populated timelines.</p><p><i>Zooming</i> involves either changing the measure at 
      which the ambit is viewed (e.g. from century to decade), or else changing 
      the range of the heuristic to take in more or fewer features on the same measure 
      (e.g. viewing one, three or five centuries on the displayed continuum). Generally, 
      increasing the range of ambit increases the overview of the continuum, while 
      increasing the measure increases the resolution (the detail visible). The 
      zoom feature is also useful for orienting the Gernsback Machine when there 
      are no objects visible. Zooming out to maximum range enables the entire collection 
      space to be seen as a whole, and the user can then home in on the regions 
      that are populated. Zooming in on the areas that are densely populated can 
      enable the user to see the object disposition in finer detail.</p><p><i>Flipping</i> is the least familiar of the GM navigation 
      modes. It serves to re-ordinate the ambit through the use of shared metadata 
      that is not related to the current heuristic. To understand this, it is necessary 
      to remember that the metadata which is <i>not</i> responsible for placing 
      the object being viewed within the current ambit will share potential heuristics 
      with other objects that are also not in that ambit. In flipping, any given 
      term from an object&#39;s metadata set can serve as a query-by-example navigation 
      system to show other potential heuristics the object may exemplify, and those 
      other objects which either share common or adjoining values with the current 
      object in alternate continua. The user can then flip from the current continuum 
      to one of the alternate continua, with the current object still the centre 
      of focus.</p><p>As an example of flipping in action, consider a meeting 
      of several captains of the fleet in the wardroom of a galleon in 1625. If 
      it were a meeting of different nationalities, then the heuristic that the 
      meeting exemplified (say of chronological time and nominal space) could serve 
      as the pivot to enable the user to flip around to the maritime activities 
      of any one of the nations (but only one of them) present. However, the situation 
      could also pivot on the designer of the wardroom, or the writer of the report 
      being read, or any other such metadata. </p><p>The significance of this feature is that it is a <i>navigation 
      by network</i> - by the very interconnectedness of the elements of data - 
      and this is the type of connection in an information space that is the most 
      difficult to explore (it is incredibly costly in processor resources) yet 
      the most intuitive to experience. What is more, a navigable graph is the only 
      form of pathing through an information space that is guaranteed to cover every 
      object.</p><p>After each navigation operation, the new continuum is itself 
      the subject of stepping, zooming and yet more flipping. </p><p>A session with our hypothetical maritime museum would include 
      all these navigation modes seamlessly. The user would search for a value (&#39;La 
      Perouse in Sydney Harbour&#39;), find adjoining information by stepping (the First 
      Fleet) and then see where one of the First Fleet ships went next (flip). From 
      that ship&#39;s next flotilla engagement (step) we could zoom out to the entire 
      fleet, then flip to the Admiral in charge. Following a letter home from the 
      Admiral (flip) might lead to a discovery of 17<sup>th</sup> Century child 
      illness (flip), thence to 17<sup>th</sup> Century medicine (flip), and so 
      on.</p>
    <h1>Building A Gernsback Machine Virtual Museum </h1><p>In this section we describe the architecture 
      required for our museum, and how we have implemented the prototype. We then 
      describe the process of constructing a virtual museum based on this architecture. 
    </p>
    <h2>Architecture</h2><p>The virtual museum space is a digital 
      domain that represents the collections within a museum or group of museums, 
      but which is separate from it. In essence it provides on request annotated 
      displays of media artefacts that represent either the objects in the collections 
      or associated material. In the context of exhibitions the museum will also 
      include reference material and navigational aids (maps, lists etc) so that 
      within the museum space there is a universe of information that is complete 
      in itself. </p><p>Practically, the museum is a combination 
      of a database, a metadata system and a media-server, working through an application 
      facilitated by a Web-server. </p><p>The base level unit in the museum space 
      is a containerised media resource with a metadata halo, which we term the 
    &#39;bento&#39;. (A bento is a Japanese tray or compartmented lunch box, designed 
      to hold different items of food. Apple used the term to define their &#39;Bento 
      Specification&#39; in 1993 for a platform- and content- neutral data wrapper. 
      However we use the term here in its more general descriptive sense and do 
      not make use of the Apple specification, or any other implementation, in our 
      project.) </p><p>The bento has three characteristics that 
      are important for the GM: it contains standard &#39;media slots&#39; that can be filled 
      with simple or complex media artefacts; it is completely self-descriptive 
      with metadata (subject, technical, structural and administrative); and, importantly, 
      each bento is potentially linkable with any other, constrained only in a semantic, 
      not a technical, sense. </p><p>Formally the bento is a <i>frame</i>: 
      it contains data to describe itself, contains a dictionary of values, and 
      maintains details of links with other bentos. The frame is a standard knowledge 
      modelling format which has had great success in knowledge management, and 
      the bento, by maintaining both the media artefacts and the pertinent metadata, 
      serves doubly as cataloguing and navigating instrument. Since the bento can 
      store media artefacts and access their metadata transparently, it follows 
      that it can contain other bentos as well, and this mechanism can be as recursive 
      as is necessary. </p><p>In Figure 5(A), the bento is laid out 
      like the components of the lunchbox. As it is a frame, it has its own identifying 
      metadata (including ownership, copyright, purpose, accession or creation details), 
      references to related bentos (as a means of organising the bentos in sequences 
      and modules) and can also identify media artefacts for which it is the parent. 
      The AVI component in (A) is in fact itself a bento, and the blow-up in part 
      (B) of the same diagram shows how it internally has its own metadata component. 
    </p><p class="caption"><a href="hobbsFig5.html"><img src="HobbsFigure5Thumb.gif" alt="Bento architecture" width="400" height="381" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig5"></a>Figure 5 - Bento architecture</p><p>This structure makes the bento the ideal 
      vehicle for recording the sequences of media artefacts necessary to instantiate 
      a virtual tour of the museum, and by an ordered mechanism for creation and 
      display, a single bento becomes all that is necessary to contain the entirety 
      of the tour and its accompanying metadata. The lower order bentos in the hierarchy 
      will then be self-organising, and an instruction to the top level tour bento 
      to display next component, previous component, restart, time left in tour 
      or even print/export will be dealt with at the top level.</p><p>Such a tour will consist of two types 
      of bentos: those that contain artefact bentos with rich descriptions, and 
      those that act as segues, standing in between other bentos and providing any 
      necessary semantic buffering. The annotated bentos could then serve as building 
      blocks to many other tours as well as the tour in which they are being included.</p><p>Since the bento provides both the content 
      for the museum and its navigation potential, it is designed to enable the 
      objects&#39; information also to be retrieved from the system for the purpose 
      of aligning the object with the continua, as part of a visitor&#39;s querying 
      the GM. This means it can not only display the media artefacts as they occur 
      within a tour or query result set, but each one can also display potentiality 
      for further digressive navigation options, in the explorative manner outlined 
      above. </p><p>In terms of guarding intellectual capital, 
      bentos can also ensure that no object or representative artefact is ever displayed 
      without the context of copyright, watermarking and precedent details, and 
      can mediate these when the exhibition is derived from many different real-world 
      institutions.</p><p>Figure 
      6 shows the recursive nature of the bento, and defines some terms that we 
      shall use later in describing our museum space. </p><p class="caption"><a href="hobbsFig6.html"><img src="HobbsFigure6Thumb.gif" alt="Recursive bentos" width="400" height="277" border="0"/></a></p>

    <h3>Implementation</h3><p>The prototype museum database is a hybrid structure of 
      authority tables, hierarchical metadata sets and standard data records. The 
      challenge was to develop a design for a bento structure that permitted the 
      maximum freedom for the content developers, while permitting the full potential 
      of the GM navigation structure to be available, and to provide as seamless 
      a way of cataloguing as possible to provide the full metadata description.</p><p>It was decided to make the GM&#39;s own native data format 
      XML, and although the actual XML data is stored in a relational database, 
      it is viewed and edited in XML form. There are two main XML trees involved 
      in its implementation. Primarily there is the bento-space for recording the 
      details of the bento material. This is done in our own XML dialect, as a KRL 
      (frames are usually recorded with a KRL). The namespace is established with 
      reference to knowledge management and expert system current practices, to 
      ensure adaptability. </p><p>The secondary XML tree is the facet tree, which is made 
      from the original Ranganathan set, with our own isolates extended via the 
      three lower dimensions. The facet tree is based on general principles of faceted 
      classification systems and the various compound classification systems and 
      metadata ordering systems currently in use in the museums and library communities, 
      such as AAT, ULAN, and TGN (Getty Vocabulary Program, 2004). This tree serves 
      as the basis for the interoperability between the user and the museum - informing 
      the dialogs and organising the material. Extensive term lists are not included 
      in the tree, as (apart from reasons of efficiency) the actual values are either 
      resident in other systems or are derived from the bento-space. The entire 
      tree (about 300 termsets) plus candidate values (from the trial set and the 
      external lists - about 4,000 terms) are extracted from the system in various 
      XML metadata standards such as XFML (XFML, 2004), Topic maps (ISO/IEC, 2002) 
      etc, and analysed for full coverage of the facets and their domains. </p><p>The result sets are created by an X-PATH match between 
      the two XML systems, and the results displayed using an XSLT transform. This 
      was done to make the solution as universally acceptable as possible. </p><p>An initial bento dataset (about 50 items) was populated 
      by hand, with a view to seeing the architecture populated as soon as possible 
      to test the interactive aspect of the GM. Media artefacts were created, together 
      with appropriate metadata, and these were used to build up tours and exhibits. 
      Although minimal curation was done, sufficient words were entered for the 
      segue bentos to build up appropriate bento tour sets.</p><p>The bentos themselves were drawn from several different 
      sources, and identified primarily by the space and time facet metadata. Multiple 
      continua for time and place were established and explored.</p>
    <h2>Process</h2><p>The museum when operating works by presenting 
      a common interface to acccessioner, curator and visitor: they are all effectively 
      different levels of user. This is necessary because when the Gernsback Machine 
      is being used, the various controls that establish the presence of termsets 
      represent the context for the value being applied. Therefore a matching dataset 
      must be in place when retrieving it.</p><p>The initial contact between the museum 
      and an object intended for the collection is at the stage of accession when 
      a user describes the object, and creates artefacts to represent it, by use 
      of the context-representation mechanism of the GM. This consists of selecting 
      a termset via the facet tree, and then (depending on whether the termset wants 
      a descriptor, a term picked from a restricted list, a referent to an external 
      table, a date, or a numeric value) entering a matching term.</p><p>Cataloguing an item for inclusion in the 
      virtual museum involves selecting an optimum number of terms to serve as retrieval 
      keys. This would be in conformity to pre-existing practice in the parent institution, 
      or if the virtual museum is a stand-alone concern, in conformance with the 
      best-practice museum cataloguing standards. These terms are linked back to 
      the termset when accessioned (i.e. the termset + value is stored as a key 
      in the bento). </p><p>This is where the GM comes into its own: 
      to perform such a task comprehensively is normally beyond the capabilities 
      of the museum staff (in terms of time and resources), but the metadata components 
      can be easily engaged either singly or as sets of metadata, while the action 
      of placing an object within a continuum can present a set of suitable values 
      to the user.</p><p>When curating an exhibition or tour, the 
      same process repeats itself - the material can be gathered by a faceted search, 
      and the items retrieved, and then the objects are lodged within the tour, 
      with a new metadata set pertaining to their proposed new role in the tour. 
      This process can reveal even more material as the collection grows in size, 
      and fully documented and annotated bentos become available for inclusion.</p><p>This is the same for all levels of the 
      exhibition - each time the same process of selection enables the curator to 
      draw on more and more semantically rich material, all of which is deemed to 
      fit the same faceted semantic halo (Figure 7). At each point in the selection 
      process, the material from the level of complexity below is retrieved by the 
      search, and that is the raw material for yet another bento layer.</p><p class="caption"><a href="hobbsFig7.html"><img src="HobbsFigure7Thumb.gif" width="400" height="253" border="0"/></a></p><p class="caption"><b><i><a name="Fig7"></a>Figure 
      7  Accession and curation process forming composite structures</i></b></p><p>In retrieving material from the museum, and therefore indirectly 
      finding potential tours of interest, the visitor to the museum repeats this 
      process. The difference between the visitor&#39;s displays and those to which 
      the staff have access is that the searches the visitor conducts are to an 
      extent managed. Not all material will be visible, and not all metadata will 
      be available for searching.</p><p>The collection is of course firmly grounded in the museo-informatic 
      community of practice, and so it is not only appropriate, but also necessary 
      to enable the virtual museum to partake in the common metadata initiatives 
      that are being developed at the moment. Because the facet tree is an organising 
      rather than an enumerating system, it is possible for the administrator to 
      make the system fully co-operative with on-line open systems initiatives like 
      the OAI (Open Archives Initiative, 2004). By having a hermeneutic layer built 
      into the system as a dictionary, either all or part of the OAI interface can 
      be implemented.</p><p>The public/private distinction that enables differentiation 
      between the scholar&#39;s access to a collection and that of the ordinary visitor, 
      or between the private access afforded an owner or curator and the public 
      generic interface, serves to make a distinction also between the local and 
      remote forms of the collection material. In the prototype, there is an ability 
      to have a &#39;second shot&#39; approach at finding material - the user can request 
      that the search include remote material in addition to the local resources. 
      This approach has already been trialed successfully with the NCSTRL (Networked 
      Computer Science Technical Reference Library, 2004) repositories, and in the 
      end it is more a question of reliability and certainty in making the mappings 
      than a question of technological limitations. And from this point it is a 
      small step - albeit one requiring a fair degree of co-ordination - to Bearman 
      and Trant&#39;s (2002) metadata-controlled collection interoperability. The use 
      of a public/private metadata distinction permits the GM interface to pick 
      up on a distributed and decentralised set of objects displayed upon a series 
      of continua.</p>
    <h2>Design issues</h2><p>The problems of disappointment and letdown from a visit 
      to a virtual, rather than an actual, museum are well known. The haptic and 
      kinetic experiences of realia are part and parcel of the curator&#39;s art, and 
      the design for the computer experience is a greater challenge than the recreation 
      of the experience of cinema for television. Over and above this problem is 
      the challenge of designing the system for the principle of least surprise, 
      of not stopping a visitor to the virtual museum because of an unfamiliar interface. 
    </p><p>The challenge for the user interface design is to ensure 
      that the visitor&#39;s three fundamental concerns of <i>Where am I?</i> <i>What&#39;s 
      here? </i>and <i>Where can I go?</i> (Veen, 2001) are addressed; while making 
      available (but not overwhelming) the unusual navigation potential of the Gernsback 
      Machine, based as it is on an unimaginably large information space that has 
      no physical analog, and possessing a navigation operation (flip) that is unlike 
      anything normally encountered.</p><p>It is well know that since users are only ever presented 
      with a single screen, there is no inherent sense of the larger structure that 
      sits behind that single page. Therefore, enough information needs to be conveyed 
      within the page to invite further interaction. However, if this involves a 
      high degree of computer literacy, or following detailed instructions, then 
      a user  without a compelling reason for exploring 
      the site is unlikely to persist with the interaction. </p><p>A particular challenge is how to represent the potential 
      of the &#39;step, flip, zoom&#39; navigation in an intuitive manner. The default set 
      of interface controls that we have developed are similar to the slider controls 
      on a graphic equalizer, but they each have an informatic property to match 
      a dimension of the GM. The four sliders correspond (left-to-right) to Facet, 
      Domain, Quality and Measure, and the option to select a value from a pick 
      list, enter a number, or retrieve a match is given to the user. </p><p>As the constraints are cumulative and additive, it follows 
      that there can be a potentially infinite number of such slider sets combined 
      to make for quite detailed searches. The interface enables these cumulative 
      queries to be created, and the individual constraints removed one at a time 
      from a running list of elements. If the display sliders are altered, then 
      the labels on the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 4<sup>th</sup> are reset 
      to blank, until a movement at a higher level re-enables them. </p><p>Of course, the slider sets that we have used here are only 
      some of many possibilities, including virtual reality interfaces, that would be 
      possible. Part of the designer&#39;s challenge is to create different consoles 
      to match different purposes.</p><p>Another challenge for the designer is to create exhibitions 
      out of the simple but raw outputs of the GM in making bento sets, which as 
      we have noted form the basis for the museum exhibition. By default they produce 
      an unsophisticated narrative told in terms of artefacts alone, with simple 
      labels derived from the metadata. Before the exhibition is ready for the visitor, 
      some additional design work will normally be necessary to ensure the exhibition 
      is coherent and attractive. Here the GM and the virtual museum can help the 
      curator and designer prepare a series of displays for an exhibition.</p>
    <h1>Examples</h1>
    <h2>16<sup>th</sup> Century Ships</h2><p>Our first example demonstrates the use 
      of the Gernsback Machine within a relatively conventional subject setting. 
      This hypothetical on-line museum provides a variety of virtual exhibitions, 
      which include both guided tours and free exploration. The museum home page 
      is shown in Figure 8, with three exhibitions, <i>Ancient Eastern Dances</i>, 
      <i>16<sup>th</sup> Century Ships</i> and <i>Korean Dynasties</i>. </p><p class="caption"><a href="hobbsFig8.html"><img src="HobbsFigure8Thumb.jpg" alt="Home page" width="400" height="301" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig8"></a>Figure 8. Home page for on-line museum, 
      showing three available exhibitions</p>
    <h3>Guided tours</h3><p>The visitor selects a desired exhibition 
      and enters its start page (Figure 9). This page shows the narrative structure 
      of the <i>16<sup>th</sup> Century Ships</i> tour, set out as thumbnails along 
      a narrative line. The visitor may begin at any point within the tour. In Figure 
      9, the main narrative consists of the exhibits <b>Navigation and Maps</b>, 
      <b>Trade Routes</b>, <b>Life on Board</b> and <b>Ship Building</b>. <b>Trade 
      Routes</b> also branches to other related exhibits, <b>Shipwrecks</b> and 
      <b>Re-enactments of Voyages</b>. </p><p class="caption"><a href="hobbsFig9.html"><img src="HobbsFigure9Thumb.jpg" alt="16th century ships" width="400" height="301" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig9"></a>Figure 9: 16<sup>th</sup> Century Ships 
      Tour, showing narrative structure between exhibits.</p><p>The visitor clicks the &#39;Life on Board&#39; 
      thumbnail and is taken to the Life on Board exhibit (Figure 10). The position 
      of the Life on Board exhibit within the main narrative of the tour is indicated 
      at the top of the page, and the alternative narrative pathways on the left. 
      The topics that make up the exhibit are shown as a navigable list at the top 
      of the page.</p><p class="caption"><a href="hobbsFig10.html"><img src="HobbsFigure10Thumb.jpg" alt="Life On Board" width="400" height="301" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig10"></a>Figure 10. The Life On Board exhibit page, 
      showing the visitor&#39;s current location within tour (top and left), and topic 
      panels within exhibit (centre).</p><p>The visitor now has the options of exploring 
      the topics within Life on Board, or continuing to the next exhibit in the 
      <i>16<sup>th</sup> Century Ships</i> tour by using the top menu, or calling 
      up more detail on any of the individual objects in the exhibit. To view more 
      details about a particular museum object, the visitor clicks on the object 
      (e.g. Cutlery) and is taken to the object page (Figure 11).</p><p class="caption"><a href="hobbsFig11.html"><img src="HobbsFigure11Thumb.jpg" alt="object page" width="400" height="301" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p><b><i><a name="Fig11"></a>Figure 11. Object 
      page in tour mode, showing descriptions and media artefacts about museum object</i></b><b>. 
    </b></p><p>The object page is the simplest level 
      available to the visitor, and consists of a description and media artefacts 
      (e.g. images, video) about the museum object, here a set of 16<sup>th</sup> 
      Century cutlery. From here the visitor may view other object pages within 
      Eating Utensils (Goblet, Bowl) or may return to the Eating Utensils panel 
      in the Life On Board exhibit.</p>
    <p>Another option available to the visitor at this point is 
      to leave the guided tour, and embark on a free-form exploration of the exhibition 
      space. This possibility is indicated by a <b>Go Exploring</b> button and is 
      described next.</p>
    <h3>Exploration</h3>
    <p>To leave the tour, the visitor clicks on the <b>Go Exploring</b> 
      button on the object page. The page changes to exploration mode (Figure 12), 
      and the slider sets that permit the facet navigation about the selected object 
      appear. (Note that three slider sets are shown here, but, as discussed earlier, 
      the number is potentially infinite - in practice, the number of sets available 
      depends on the judgment of the designer and the limitations of screen real 
      estate.) The surrounding narrative structure disappears, as it is no 
      longer applicable in the free exploration (although a <b>return to tour</b> 
      icon enables the visitor to leave the exploration at any point and return 
      to their last place in the guided tour).</p>
	  <p class="caption"><a href="hobbsFig12.html"><img src="HobbsFigure12Thumb.jpg" alt="Object Navigation model" width="400" height="301" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig12"></a>Figure 12. Object page in exploration mode, 
      showing facet sliders</p><p>Exploration begins when the visitor selects 
      a facet for exploration. It is important to remember that when considering 
      the object outside the context of the original tour narrative, there is no 
      single &#39;true&#39; location of the object, and it is therefore up to the visitors 
      to choose what facet(s) they are interested in seeing the object located in, 
      and to continue navigating from that point.</p><p>For example, to see where the object was 
      located in time, visitors would select the Time facet on one of the slider 
      sets. They could then select to view where they were in Linear (rather than 
      Circadian or Cyclical) time, and within Linear, Chronological. Within Chronological 
      they might choose to view at a measure of Century, and the final value for 
      the object, 16<sup>th</sup> Century, would be displayed (Figure 12). The visitor 
      now knows that in terms of linear, chronological time, the object is located 
      in the 16<sup>th</sup> Century on a measurement scale of centuries. Equally, they could have chosen to view the object in 
      terms of Linear, Social time and found that the object was located in, say, 
      the age of colonial expansion. </p><p>Leaving any of the parameters in a slider 
      set unselected results in either arbitrary or default values being shown. 
      For example, a designer might choose to set defaults for domain and quality 
      to Linear and Chronological respectively, so that if only the Time facet was 
      set by the visitor, the most common concept of time, that of chronology, would 
      be displayed for the object. </p><p>The visitor may also set any of the other 
      facets to constrain further the description of the museum object. Other values 
      are not shown in Figure 12; however, possible values for Matter and Space 
      could result in the Cutlery object being described by &#39;cutlery, Dutch merchant 
      ships, 16<sup>th</sup> Century&#39;.</p> <p>Although the visitors have now constrained 
      the description of the original object within the parameters they are interested 
      in, other objects within the collection will also fulfil this heuristic. Clicking 
      a &#39;<b>Show All&#39;</b> button at this point changes the display view to thumbnail, 
      and the original object is shown along with others that are located in the 
      same facet space. </p><p>The three types of navigation - step, 
      flip and zoom - that characterize the Gernsback Machine are now available 
      to the visitor. </p><p><i>Zoom</i> navigation 
      occurs by altering the Measure slider, for example from Century to Decade. 
      Again, a different object set (but one that contains the original object) 
      is displayed: e.g. &#39;cutlery, Dutch merchant ships, 1580s&#39;. Alternatively, 
      changing the measure of ship type could expand the view to &#39;all types of Dutch 
      ships in the 16<sup>th</sup> Century&#39;.</p><p><i>Step </i>navigation 
      occurs by stepping to the next century on the timeline, to see what other 
      objects are displayed, for say the 17<sup>th</sup> or 15<sup>th</sup> century. 
      A new set of objects is displayed. Stepping to a different value on the Time/Linear/Sociological 
      view of the timeline would permit a comparison with (e.g.) &#39;Post-Colonial&#39;, 
      while concentrating on the Space/Functional/Political would permit different 
      a narrative of comparison of nationality to be followed, and would retrieve 
    &#39;cutlery, French merchant ships, 16<sup>th</sup> Century&#39;. </p><p><i>Flip</i> navigation 
      occurs by altering the quality or domain sliders. For example, to flip from 
      chronological to social time would return anything relevant from the social 
      age (&#39;age of colonial expansion&#39; or &#39;age of exploration&#39;) that the object 
      being viewed exemplified. Another flip (say on space to &#39;Functional/Political/Nationality&#39;) 
      would move to French or English maritime cutlery, and from there perhaps to 
      medical implements from the age, or to food preparation. The power of the 
      flipping mechanism is by its nature the most powerful for exploration. </p><p>The same principles of exploration apply 
      to the self-guided exploration of the visitor as to the curator who constructs 
      the guided tours: semantic coherence is best achieved by making only small 
      changes from set to set, rather than altering several facets at the same time. 
      Another factor that ensures the visitors are not overwhelmed by the vast number 
      of navigation possibilities is that they are constrained to navigate within 
      an exhibition, rather than the entire collection space of the museum. The 
      options available to them (on the slider sets) will therefore be constrained 
      accordingly (in our example, the visitors would still be exploring within 
      16<sup>th</sup> Century Ships- space, not within the Korean Dynasties or Ancient 
      Eastern Dances exhibitions). </p>
    <p>As the exploration progresses, other tours in which the viewed object (or 
      set of objects) is used are dynamically displayed, and visitors can then choose 
      to jump to one of the tours and continue in a pre-written narrative again. 
      A trail showing their exploration path is also generated (blank in Figure 
      12), with the option to save for returning to later. </p>
    <h2>Extending The Timeline: A Museum Of The History Of Possible 
      Futures And Probable Pasts</h2><p>Our second example illustrates the potential 
      of the Gernsback Machine navigation by concentrating on manipulating aspects 
      of a single facet, that of time. Our hypothetical virtual museum this time 
      is a museum of &#39;the history of possible futures and probable pasts&#39;. This 
      museum draws on predictions of the future made at various times, both in the 
      past and in the present, from different sources (such as science, science 
      fiction, sociology), to create a media rich, interactive virtual space. </p><p>As we saw in the Introduction, a timeline 
      as commonly seen often uses the same continuum to express many different aspects 
      of facet-relative detail. However, a facet-line can convey token-reflexive 
      information as well - for instance with time, by showing a date, and then 
      pointing to the next day, the following year and so forth. Thus the next monarch 
      of the United Kingdom can be placed on a timeline after Elizabeth II, even 
      though the details are surmised (probably Charles III, but possibly William 
      V).</p>
    <p>An interesting notion arises here: of expressing the multiple possibilities 
      of prediction (or with regard to the distant past, analysis) for the same 
      point of time. Our current present is, as the saying goes, &#39;yesterday&#39;s tomorrow 
      and tomorrow&#39;s yesterday&#39;. We can see that there is an infinitude of token-reflexive 
      expressions for any point in time with reference to any other point in time. 
      It becomes a matter of selecting the interesting narratives from the many 
      possible ones and comparing them. So, we can compare the futures of Swift, 
      Bergerac, Verne, le Queux, Wells, Huxley, Orwell, Bradbury and so forth: it 
      makes sense to speak of a series of denoted presents for these authors  2004 
      [Swift], 2004 [de Bergerac], 2004 [Verne], 2004 [Le Queux], 2004 [Wells] 
      , 2004 [Orwell], 2004 [Huxley], 2004 [Bradbury]. We can envisage plotting 
      these futures on axes leading from their time of writing to the present with 
      a varying degree of detail. Within this context, it would be a simple matter 
      to cross-reference these dates with other faceted axes, as shown in Table 
      1.</p>

    <p class="caption">Table 1. The future as imagined by various 
      authors</p><p>Table 1 shows interesting contrasts in 
      sharp relief — how the future was a means of satire, of lampooning the present 
      for early writers, but a dystopian view, a means 
      of warning for later ones; and how the means of expression of the futures 
      reflected the technology of the time. The model can be extended further — 
      it is possible to see how (say) Huxley versus Orwell saw the poor in the future 
      (invisible vs. ubiquitous), or how foreign countries 
      were seen, or how change was expected.</p><p>A prototype version 
      of the museum has been implemented, and filled with some of the futurological 
      and science fiction of England and France from the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> 
      Centuries. Using the Gernsback Machine, it 
      is possible to present concurrently on a single display the relevant details 
      and associated media artefacts of exactly such hypothetical futures as are 
      discussed in Table 1. Such analyses permit comparisons of same time/place 
      with different social strata for different authors, for instance comparing 
      Orwell&#39;s Proles with the leisure class of Huxley.</p><p>In a fully-populated museum, we could 
      also look at the &#39;pasts that never happened&#39; - the 1965s of Orwell, Wells, 
      Le Queux and Verne, say, and see if it would be possible to get 
      to where we are now from there. We might also compare them with the &#39;pasts&#39; 
      that are the staple of social advocates (both optimistic and pessimistic) 
      to see if they are any more plausible. At each stage of comparison the detail 
      can be fleshed out with comparative illustrations from book and film - a sense 
      of the continuous lives led by the different characters makes for a play of 
      Pirandellan synchronicity unfolding before the visitor to 
      the exhibitions.</p><p>In an interactive mode, the user could 
      examine the different continua for reasonable hypotheses: given what we know 
      about AIDS and global warming. How does that colour Huxley&#39;s gentle promiscuity, 
      or Verne&#39;s coal-power technocracy? As the timelines diverge between predicted 
      futures and our own past, comparisons can be made between the objects that 
      the writers chose to symbolise their imagined futures, and those that were 
      present in our past. We can imagine these metonymic tokens arrayed in their 
      own continua, yet compared along axes of attitude and intention.</p><p>This all makes for a fascinating tool 
      for research, enabling new methods, including statistical analysis of gaps 
      in the literature, with targeted sites for further research, and identifying 
      concentrations of influence between hitherto unrelated items. Enriched by 
      the superabundance of illustrative media artefacts in sound, picture and moving 
      image, it also draws one to think of Hesse&#39;s <i>Glasperlenspiel</i> 
      (Hesse, 1943) and of the intellectual game of infinite comparison of the arts and 
      sciences of the past and future.</p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1><p>The Gernsback Machine offers a new approach to the construction 
      and exploration of virtual museums. By recognising that time is only one of 
      several continuously interacting facets of meaning for any set of facts or 
      objects, the conventional museum timeline is itself seen to be only one representation 
      of a number of possible semantic continua that may be drawn through a collection. 
      The GM is a categorisation framework based on a facet tree that provides both 
      the definitions of the termsets used to describe objects, and the navigation 
      potential through the collection space, enabling exploration of these alternate 
      semantic continua in a way that opens up possibilities for new types of narrative 
      structures. </p><p>The facet tree that provides the twin functions of cataloguing 
      and navigating is indexical and integrates with existing metadata schemes 
      and metadata sets, providing the potential for metadata-controlled interoperability 
      of museum collections. The containerising and recursive nature of the bento, 
      the base level unit of the GM museum space, enables existing digital collections 
      and their metadata to be incorporated into new virtual exhibitions constructed 
      from logically-defined sources.</p><p>The GM provides a powerful tool for museum curators and 
      exhibition designers, and permits new visitor-constructed narratives of the 
      museum space. It also has great potential as a research tool, and has been 
      successfully applied in this manner in a separate project on the history of 
      programming languages (D. Pigott, unpublished). </p><p>Our back end prototype has demonstrated the proof of concept 
      of the cataloguing and navigation engine of the Gernsback Machine. Much exciting 
      work remains to be done to develop interfaces to support the curatorial process 
      and to explore appropriate metaphors and innovative interfaces for the visitor. 
    </p>
    <h1>Note</h1>
    <p>We named our cataloguing and navigation model the <b>Gernsback 
      Machine</b> after Gibson&#39;s short story, &#39;The Gernsback Continuum&#39; (Gibson, 1981), in which a man who leaves the 
      current space-time continuum after an extended period of photographing and 
      analysing futuristic art-deco buildings finds himself to have slipped sideway 
      through time into the Gernsback continuum. This is an alternate time continuum 
      to our own, wherein the future envisaged by the science fiction illustrator 
      Leo Gernsback has come to pass. The artefacts that are out of place and unimportant 
      in our continuum have become the most significant, while the buildings of 
      Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright are marginalised. A subtext of the story 
      is the notion that there may be an infinity of such continua, one step away: 
      the essence of our Gernsback Machine.</p>
