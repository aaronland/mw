<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>In real museums, visitors may find the help of a human tour guide in order to guide them through the exhibition and present information tailored to their interests. Accordingly, online museums could also benefit from digital &#39;life-like&#39; characters in order to guide users to virtual tours and to customize the tour information in accordance to users&#39; interests. Digital characters have been explored in online museum websites with different degrees of interaction and modes of communication (Bertoletti et al., 2001; Adams et al., 2001; Isbister et al., 1999). Such researches, however, do not explore interactive &#34;conversational&#34; characters. Our main interest is in a tour-guide character that provides tour information through dialogue with the user. Our research developed an interactive conversational character that establishes a &#39;character-user&#39; dialogue while guiding the user through the virtual tour. The tour-guide character provides tour information and responses to users&#39; textual inputs by speaking through audio output and gesturing accordingly. Moreover, the tour-guide character attempts to provide adaptive guidance, to perform engaging storytelling and to promote user&#39;s participation through the virtual tour. In this paper, we describe the experiment focusing on the creation of the paths for the dialogue flow and on the character&#39;s knowledge database. We further describe the system&#39;s implementation and evaluation; and, finally, discuss some evaluation conclusions.</p>
