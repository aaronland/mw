<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>Present unworkable situation:<br/>
The European Commission requires the owner of disputed objects to prove that an object has not been stolen.<br/>
Approximately 125 databases of missing objects are presently available on the Internet.<br/>
This decentralized storage of relevant information makes combatting illicit traffic nearly impossible. Originally meant as a public information database to be consulted by police, custom, art dealers and others, the Art Loss Register makes searching by the average Sherlock - who is not trained as an Art Historian - nearly impossible if not unworkable.<br/>
Solution<br/>
The solution to the present problem is the cooperation of museum networks working &#39;bottom-up&#39; within their domains instead of the present &#39;top-down&#39; process by Police, Customs and Interpol, who are bound by a diversity of laws and local regulations - which resulted in the current 125 scattered databases of stolen art.</p>
<p>Our paper will address these legal problems, the solutions offered based on the most recent IT developments in Collection Management Systems, a proposed data model, the synchronization of data packages and quick and the easy &#39;positive&#39; registration and documentation of cultural heritage objects.</p>
