<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>The eight Swiss National Museums are located in various states of Switzerland; the main museum is in Zuerich. For the purpose of renovation the 110 years old building of the main museum will be closed for a few years. The reopening is planned for 2007. Meanwhile the collections are not open for the public. So a new museum, the ?No. 9? will open its virtual showrooms in cyberspace. The virtual museum isn?t just a substitute for the Swiss National Museums but it will have its own identity with a virtual exhibition space, shows, shops, storage, conservation department, online-fundraising, publications, PR, education program and his own docents and trustees. To lead the ?visitor? to a real interactivity on a high quality level will be one of the main goals of this project; to create a permanent attraction in the www another one. For the period of the renovation of the Swiss National Museum in Zuerich the careful defining of long-term strategies are a must for the success of the project. For the MW2002 the author, involved in the planning and realization of the Swiss Virtual Museum, will give an introduction in the design and management of this exceptional project.</p>
