<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>Remember that wonderful feeling you had when you visited a museum? You could go to whatever exhibit interested you. You could wander aimlessly or stare intently as long as you liked. You could fill yourself with knowledge or gloss over all the information and just look. You could stay as long as you liked or leave when you were through. Students can have the same opportunities in classrooms by using virtual museums. Virtual museums are new tools in the technology arsenal that allow teachers to promote standards for their subjects as well as promote reading, writing and research. They give students the opportunity to wander through and wonder at the world</p>
