<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>In 2017, Canadians from coast to coast will celebrate Canada&#39;s 150th birthday. To mark this milestone, five of this country’s top science organizations have joined together in a year-long, nationwide celebration of our innovative past, and our exciting future.</p>
<p>In 2016, the Canada Science and Technology Museums Corporation, along with its STEM partners, began to create a digital storybook that would help create, connect and celebrate Canada&#39;s story of innovation.</p>
<p>Rather than solely pushing out stories &#34;we&#34; felt were worthy of sharing, we took a different approach. We decided to take a more participatory approach, which required us to built a platform that would allow Canadians to share &#34;their&#34; stories of innovation through user-generated content.</p>
<p>In this session, attendees will learn:</p>
<p>- How to identify your audience and their needs<br/>
- How to entice users (the public and partners) to submit user-generated content (e.g. campaigns, partnerships, etc.)<br/>
- How to continuously engage a community<br/>
- How to let go while maintaining relevant and quality content<br/>
- How to embrace a participatory approach<br/>
- How to build the required tools for successful user-generated platform<br/>
- How to measure success<br/>
- How to build a culture of innovation</p>
