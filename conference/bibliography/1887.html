<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>Audiences expect to find information about museum events and exhibitions in many formats using a variety of devices. Some people may use their local community paper to find a listing of the next weekend&#39;s events but many others will use their smartphones, tablets, or laptops-or seek instant access to the information once they&#39;ve arrived at a destination. Given museums&#39; limited staffing, re-entering data is not an efficient use of resources. But what are the best practices for creating content for multiple platforms?</p>
<p>At the Balboa Park Online Collaborative, we have created a flow through which calendar events are created for the Balboa Park website and are fed out to a branded Balboa Park iPhone app, Spotlight Mobile&#39;s Meridian platform (for iOS and Android devices), and on-site interactive kiosks. We have also made duplicate versions of this feed available to media outlets for their use in creating community calendars.</p>
<p>This paper and session will review the steps through which participants could develop a similar flow for their organizations&#39; content and discuss aspects of the content that need to be optimized for mobile apps and kiosks.Â </p>
<p>This session is appropriate for staff who manage web and mobile content for their organizations.</p>
