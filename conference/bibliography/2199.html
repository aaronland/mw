<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>Museums have often been understood in both intellectual and popular circles as mausoleums, as centers of accumulation of objects which no longer have a living relationship with the present. This is an image which makes it almost impossible to associate the museum with debates about contemporary cultural issues. In this paper I want to propose that this is no longer a valid way of representing the museum, largely because the museum is now deeply implicated in electronic media flows making it an important site for the newly emerging &#39;information society&#39;. This new relationship between electronic technologies and museums has fundamentally questioned the traditional museum&#39;s orientation to objects, an orientation which, I argue, led to the image of museums as mausoleums in the first place. As a result the metaphors we associate with museums are beginning to change, away from the idea of the museum as disconnected from the social world towards the opposite -- the museum as a site of cultural, technological and social convergences. This involves a re-evaluation of the role of objects in museums as well as that of the curator and museum&#39;s relationships to communities.</p>
