<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>This paper will present the findings of primary research conducted for The National Gallery London, which examined the exact role of digital in the visitor experience and exploring audiences&#39; digital behaviours, motivations, and content needs. Customer journey mapping to improve visitor experience is not a new process, but understanding the role of digital, at every stage of a customer journey, adds in a layer of additional complexity. We will discuss the challenges of this type of research, explore different methodologies for creating digital journey maps, and review the benefits of having this type of view of the visitor.</p>
<p>In line with an increasingly audience-centric approach to their digital strategy, the National Gallery wanted to better understand digital behaviours â€“ whether as part of an on-site visit or with a digital only journey (including interactions with online collections and/or the online shop). We will explain the process used to map how different types of visitors use digital, their perception of the role of digital touchpoints and the quality of the experience. The research outputs, which were used to help inform the redevelopment of the digital strategy and digital product development, included individual digital journey maps for four audience segments, to give teams at the Gallery a visual and accessible view of digital behaviours.</p>
