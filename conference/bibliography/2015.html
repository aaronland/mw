<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>The purpose of this study is the development of a navigation system that will help enhance appreciation for urban art by connecting viewers with other people&#39;s thoughts and opinions of art pieces. Hiroshima, located in western Japan, has many works of public art that have assumed a theme of peace. However, in Japan, it seems that the appreciation of art is restricted to the elite, and the majority of people do not seem interested enough to visit art museums. We have designed a system that allows users to share an appreciation of public art in urban spaces by using their mobile phones.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of this study  were to build a system that:-</p>
<p>?induced a positive appreciation among users</p>
<p>?enabled the sharing of text and images</p>
<p>?heightened user-experience through involvement</p>
<p>?was  based on User-centered design and had provisions for color blindness.</p>
<p>The system which we have designed has been tested and improved on three occasions to date and is targeted at those who have few opportunities to appreciate art. The repetition of this experiment within the confines of Hiroshima City, found that the experience of public art was enhanced through the use of this mobile phone system.  These results would seem to indicate that public art pieces do benefit the average person who rarely visits museums in a positive way.</p>
