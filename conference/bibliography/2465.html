<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>In recent years, the UK&#39;s Victoria and Albert Museum has embarked upon various projects designed to improve access to information about its collections, publications and exhibitions. An increasing proportion of the Museum&#39;s curatorial objects are included in the Collections Information System (CIS), and the V&amp;A&#39;s National Art Library <a target="_new" href="http://www.nal.vam.ac.uk">http://www.nal.vam.ac.uk</a> is close to completing a major project to transfer all its older records to an online catalogue. An Online Museum project has been established, and the V&amp;A&#39;s web site <a target="_new" href="http://www.vam.ac.uk">http://www.vam.ac.uk</a> has been relaunched. In addition to populating these core information and documentation systems, V&amp;A staff have embarked upon various initiatives designed to capture crucial information relating to the Museum&#39;s own historic activities. Examples include the compilation of a comprehensive bibliography and chronology of the V&amp;A&#39;s publishing and exhibition history, and the computerisation of the Museum&#39;s institutional records. In collaboration with staff and students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Massachusetts, an online version of the full text of important documents relating to the Museum&#39;s earliest acquisitions is also being created, in XML format. The paper attempts to demonstrate how the various projects relate to other information systems and standards in the V&amp;A and indeed elsewhere, with reference to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), Computer Interchange of Museum Information (CIMI),Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Spectrum and MARC21, among others.</p>
