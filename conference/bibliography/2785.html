<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>VOLUMEONE was introduced by a team led by Prof. Junko IWABUCHI of the Research Institute for Digital Media and Content, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan, in May, 2006, as a prototype multi-channel video presentation platform on the Web. It is designed to host museums of various disciplines to distribute their in-house-produced educational video programs for audiences of K to 12 Schools, Universities, adults, and children in hospitals with long-term illness who require educational and intellectual entertainment programs without going outside.Prof. Iwabuchi&#39;s firm belief is that more diversified use of museum content will be a great service to those mentioned above, and with that in mind, her team created a video content distribution platform that is easy to manage for the administrator and graphically attractive for the audience.Since its introduction in May 2006, there have been some alterations done to the original platform. New features have been added since October, 2006: Pod-casting, rating by the audience, sorting by categories, and search tags. The visual appearance is also slightly different now as the current platform is not in multi channels, but in a single channel with categories and sort-by search tags. A new section distributes &#34;news&#34; independently of video files.</p>
