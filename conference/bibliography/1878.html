<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>Get together with other conference attendees and play games in this unique interaction facilitated by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) and Carbon Five, a technology development firm. A special emphasis will be placed on experiential learning through Agile games and exercises.</p>
<p>This will be an updated version of a very popular and well-attended session presented at Museums and the Web 2010 titled, &#34;Play at Work: Applying Agile Methods to Museum Web Site Development.&#34; (<a href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw2010/abstracts/prg_335002326.html">http://www.archimuse.com/mw2010/abstracts/prg_335002326.html</a>)  A successful half-day workshop version of this was also presented at the Museum Computer Network 2011 conference. </p>
<p>In this session at Museums and the Web 2012, new games will be covered, including &#34;Five on Friday&#34; and &#34;Ping Pong Pairing,&#34; and case studies from the latest development on the SFMOMA website will be used.</p>
<p>The facilitators, Dana Mitroff Silvers from SFMOMA and David Hendee from Carbon Five, will demonstrate how a successful partnership between SFMOMA and Carbon Five has created a lasting procedural legacy, and how the Agile process continues to provide a tactical toolkit to streamline ongoing development work and improve teamwork.</p>
<p>Attendees will get a taste of some of the novel activities we use to encourage collaboration, communication, and fun, while engaged in the messy business of creating web software.</p>
<p>Participants will get a taste of Agile and will learn how to:</p>
<p>-Break down, prioritize, and classify projects to make decisions on what&#39;s important -Apply these tools and practical applications to any project -Establish a sustainable cycle of planning, development, and delivery</p>
