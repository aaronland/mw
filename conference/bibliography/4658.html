<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>Artificial Intelligence. It’s a concept that holds lots of promise, generates endless buzz, and is starting to make its way into everyday life. In 2015, artificial intelligence went mainstream, and undoubtedly, in 2016, we will begin to see an increase in experimentation within the cultural space. </p>
<p>In this presentation, we’ll explore some of AI’s most powerful uses related to machine learning and its impact on galleries, libraries, archives, and museums in the areas of collections, ticketing, and attendance data.</p>
<p>We’ll also examine machine vision; a computer’s ability to understand what it is seeing. Machine vision can be used to inspect and analyze images. Imagine being able to classify all of your visual objects with the flip of a switch (actually, a few lines of code).</p>
<p>We’ll explore real examples of machine learning on the following topics:<br/>
-Identifying subject matter<br/>
-Exacting color composition<br/>
-Sentiment analysis<br/>
-Text/character recognition<br/>
-Recognizing similarity and patterns<br/>
-Art authentication</p>
<p>Machine learning and vision are very powerful tools and are more accessible than ever before. In the hands of museums, these technologies will inevitably lead to interesting discoveries, rich data, and new paths into your collection.</p>
