<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>The AR Perpetual Garden App. is an immersive augmented reality (AR) application for use inside and outside museums to extend the learning impact of real dioramas and gardens. Using data visualizations and bioacoustics to reflect scientific data sets, this design enhances the perceptual experience to create virtual dioramas capable of interaction. Two contrasting scenarios, Woodland in Balance and Woodland out of Balance, are shown to instantly communicate the complex narrative on tropic cascade. This design extends prior art in Virtual Nature research into AR, using similar methods. Additional information is easily accessible at the click of a button, including the curatorâ€™s interpretive narrative and facts on a linked website. The AR Perpetual Garden App. was developed in part as an international collaboration between Harrington Lab at the University of Central Florida, Powdermill Nature Reserve at Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and the MultiMediaTechnology program of the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences, Austria. Undergraduate and graduate students were involved in the production. Download The AR Perpetual Garden App. from the Carnegie Museum App stores.</p>
