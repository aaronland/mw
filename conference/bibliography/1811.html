<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>This session will help you to plan how to make your web services responsive, mainly focussed on mobile-responsive and tablet-responsive displays, but also covering other less well-known aspects of responsive-design including large-screen responsiveness, orientation-responsiveness and responding to users&#39; emotional needs.</p>
<p>You will get evidence-based arguments for how you should consider responsive-design conceptually, backed up with real-life issues from experience of live implementations. You will hear how to move from important theoretical principles to useful strategic implementation.</p>
<p>This session is user-focussed based upon an understanding of users&#39; needs in their daily lives.</p>
<p>The session includes user-involvement and testing, evidence-gathering, interface design, development options, managed digital assets, budget limitations and more. It offers pragmatic solutions to challenges and tactical options to navigate projects round barriers. It also considers the role of prioritisation and compromise in order to deliver continuous incremental benefits.</p>
<p>Some examples from other smaller projects are also included, to give a balanced range of options when you only have a limited budget.</p>
<p>You should attend if you are responsible for managing the delivery of web digital experiences. No detailed technical knowledge needed to gain from this session. </p>
<p>Take-aways:<br/>
- Greater overall awareness of how responsive services benefit your users<br/>
- Understanding of common issues that affect how displays can usefully respond to mobile and tablet use<br/>
- A basic technical grounding in the way responsive sites work and implementation issues<br/>
- How to prioritise development effort based on evidence of user need, including web analytics and qualitative research<br/>
- Practical planning advice on breaking down work into deliverable enhancements<br/>
- Confidence to make informed decisions about supplier engagement</p>
