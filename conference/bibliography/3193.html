<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>The power of oral history lies in its ability to turn an event or topic into a personal experience between two people: the interviewee and the user. Digital oral history collections, however, are usually presented as a long-form video and a separate transcript or index document. This disconnect between the transcript document and the audio/video recording makes for a disjointed and time-consuming user experience, undermining the potential of oral history to connect users with historical narratives.</p>
<p>This paper accompanies a how-to session that gives an overview of the Oral History Metadata Synchronizer and the work the Ohio History Connectionâ€™s Multimedia Services team has done to create a new distribution platform for &#34;Oral History Interactives.&#34; It discusses the challenges of producing high-quality oral histories and the additional challenges of producing them as interactives, and gives workflows developed to meet these challenges. This include such topics as on-location scanning, portable studio setups for artifact photography, and efficient ways to collect narrative descriptions to use as metadata.</p>
