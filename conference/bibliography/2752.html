Most museums catalogues, publications and even web sites and multimedia applications follow this pattern: they need a sizable span of time to be developed, a sizable effort and relevant financial resources.Very recently a new trend is slowly emerging: budget is shrinking, new opportunities (needs) of communication are springing up, technologies and devices are rapidly changing. The consequence of the above is that a new approach must be taken: &#34;instant multimedia&#34; (analogous to &#34;instant books&#34;) means that in a short span of time, with little budget a good quality multimedia application must be produced, possibly involving several technological channels (from Web to mobile and iPOD).Low budget means that the production can be repeated often; short span of time means that opportunities can be taken when they appear; good quality means that the impact upon users is granted.Instant multimedia imply an &#34;instant design method&#34; (design must be accomplished fast), an &#34;instant workflow&#34; (every one in the team should know what to do), and an &#34;instant technology&#34; (fast and easy to use and reliable).In this mini-workshop we will:</p>
