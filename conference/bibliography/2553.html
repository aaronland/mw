<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>Real time communications and messaging software is a powerful technology that allows people and groups to talk and collaborate together using the Internet. This paper will study real time communications and examine their practical use in a museum. We will give a general overview of the technology and examine how museums can use this technology to enhance their web presence. The various advantages and disadvantages of the technology will be examined as well as how museums can use the technology with their audiences to generate interest in their web site and provide added benefits to donors or VIP visitors. The paper will also describe the process that the Holocaust Museum used to create a real time communications system on their site. An analysis of the planning and the implementation of the process will be discussed as well as how the museum is using the technology to further the goals and mission of the institution.</p>
