<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>#Taull1123 is an immersive on-site experience that brings visitors of the Romanesque church of Sant Climent de Taüll (in the World Heritage Site Vall de Boí) to the past—precisely to the year 1123, when the apse of the church was painted with the iconic figures of God and saints. Those paintings were moved to the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya in Barcelona in 1920. Now, with this project, they are virtually returned to the walls of the church thanks to a mapping structure of six high-quality projectors. Over the real remains of the Romanesque paintings, the paintings of the museum are projected, exactly in their original places, which becomes a truly augmented reality experience, but without mobile devices, for all visitors. Every half hour, a nine-minute audiovisual show dives into the past and represents the moment of the painting, eight hundred years ago, with the different stages and figures, and finishes with a simulation of the paintings complete as they were. For the creation of this show, all fragments of the original paintings, now in the Museum, were photographed, studied, and digitally restored. The missing parts were reconstructed by analyzing the remaining parts and the architectural and pictorial patterns of the ensemble. The process of the different layers of lines and colors of the original painting was rebuilt, too, for recreating the painting by brush effects. The music was composed and arranged using real sounds of the surroundings of the church and medieval instruments, digitally remastered.</p>
