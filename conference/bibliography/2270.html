<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>The ZKM is a new establishment whose consistent linkage of art with new media has a signal function for the 21st century. The center uniquely combines the fields of collection, research and presentation in the form of two museums, institutes for music and for visual media, a media library and a media theater The ZKM has practically ALL the medium and high end hardware and software means for sound and image creation, presentation and performance . Also some unusual devices such as a simulation platform, a motion controlled camera rig, and various virtual reality and spatialised audio systems. Interactive interfacing is also another area that is strongly supported. Our network technology is ATM (155Mb/sec), fast Ethernet (100Mb/sec) and normal Ethernet (10Mb/sec). The ZKM Institute for Visual Media offers artists-in-residence from all over the world an opportunity to investigate the most recent media technologies and create art-works of different kinds. To the public, ZKM offers an opportunity to share in this exciting process, to play and experiment with unprecedented possibilities. The &#39;Salon Digital&#39; is the museum&#39;s virtual wing and ZKM&#39;s window to the outside world. Visitors to the salon have full access to the Internet, and surfers on the Net are reciprocally invited to visit the ZKMI Media Museum via the same gateway. A regular program of events organized by visiting curators is foreseen; again, participation by Internet users will be welcomed.</p>
