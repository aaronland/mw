<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>The Museum Chileno de Arte Precolombino is currently working on a large Chilean prehistory and ethnography project that includes a website. One section of the site will be an extensive audiovisual archive with photographs and video and audio recordings. The main question in my demonstration is related to ethics and intellectual property rights. In my work as an archivist and researcher at the Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino for the past 20 years, I have created many audio and video recordings of Chile&#39;s native peoples. I would now like to make available footage material that I was allowed to record because of a relationship of friendship and trust that was built with the musicians over many years of collaboration. Do I have the right to upload these recordings and open them to the world?</p>
