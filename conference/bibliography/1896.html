<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>As part of an effort to shape the future of scholarly publishing, the Getty Foundation invited the Art Institute of Chicago and eight other museums to participate in a venture called the Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI). This project aims to create new platforms for digital publications that provide in-depth curatorial research and conservation science alongside richly illustrated content in a format that readers find engaging, manageable, and unobtrusive.</p>
<p>The very definition of an online scholarly publication suggests accessibility and functionalities beyond print-a complex and groundbreaking endeavor entailing many challenges and opportunities.  In envisioning our version of the online scholarly catalogue, the Art Institute of Chicago&#39;s goal was to create a publication that would embrace the exciting world of digital publishing without leaving behind the weight and authority naturally ascribed to the book format.</p>
<p>We will demonstrate the Art Institute of Chicago&#39;s first online scholarly catalogue entries, from the series <em>Paintings and Drawings by the Impressionist Circle in the Collection of the Art Institute of Chicago </em>launched in November 2011, including their rich high-resolution imagery, the &#39;Multilayer Interactive Image Viewer&#39; as well as citation and marginalia reader tools. For those interested in the publication&#39;s more technical end, we can also demonstrate the easy-to-use catalogue-authoring environment built in Drupal 7.</p>
