<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>The Community Discovered Project, <a target="_new" href="http://www.communitydisc.wst.esu3.k12.ne.us">www.communitydisc.wst.esu3.k12.ne.us</a>, in its fifth and final year, links technology and the arts with other subjects to transform the education of K-12 students. Using technology and the Internet, the Project&#39;s focus is to develop curriculum models of engaged student learning. Conducted by Westside Community Schools in Omaha, Nebraska, eight Nebraska school districts and five art museums participate in this curriculum development. Via the Internet, educators both nationally and internationally are able to access these resources and interact with other teachers and students. These resources have included virtual exhibitions with on-line curricula and interpretive materials, e-school sessions, teacher chat rooms, interactive activities using on-line images, a list-serve, and more. Administrators and teachers from participating school districts receive on-going training so that they may best utilize the Project&#39;s resources. Museum partners visit the school districts and are assisted by teachers in developing in-house and on-line curricula that are easily adapted into both the classroom and museum galleries. Museum partners include the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC; the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska; the Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery and Sculpture Garden in Lincoln, Nebraska; the Museum of Nebraska Art in Kearney, Nebraska; and the National Museum of Wildlife Art in Jackson Hole, Wyoming; all of whom provide a rich resource for educators to incorporate into their curricula.</p>
