<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>When we think of Responsive Design, a singular experience on various screen sizes is what most often comes to mind. However, it&#39;s equally important that interactives are designed to be responsive in regards to location, time, preference, &amp; skill. Using examples from several museums and related industries, this talk will inform participants on how they can more effectively work with staff and vendors to design sites, apps, touchscreens, and environments that better respond to patrons.</p>
<p>Location-based<br/>
The success of push notifications and apps like Foursquare show us the importance of geo-location. By creating experiences that cater to a visitor&#39;s location we not only improve wayfinding but also make sure guests don&#39;t miss out on a nearby friend or something of interest.</p>
<p>Time-based<br/>
When we think of how many visitors experience museums, we realize that patrons typically allow a certain amount of time. While this might be an hour or a day, the goal remains to provide them with an experience that leaves them wanting more. Time-based designs can help craft bespoke experiences for each guest and even help them coordinate transportation to and from the venue.   </p>
<p>Preference-based<br/>
Whether it&#39;s language preference, how we like to receive information, or even specific styles that we&#39;re drawn to, preference-based experiences help get the most out of a visit without having to dig through information that isn&#39;t of interest. While this concept is relatively new to museums, other industries from athletics to air travel allow us to make several decisions well before events.</p>
<p>Skill-based<br/>
One can look at a television remote to see the importance of &#34;skill-based&#34; design. While there is a portion of the population that uses every button, there are just as many that use only basic functions like power, volume, or channel. Technology and video game companies are now creating systems that allow users to select a skill level to provide a custom display without excess information.</p>
