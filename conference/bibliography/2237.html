<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>The paper will examine various ways in which a museum can develop compelling online exhibitions. The paper describes a novel manner of looking at museum exhibitions that can lead to the next generation of online exhibition design, based on the premises that an effective exhibition: is not an encyclopedia; it is a choreography of sight, sound, and thought. is alive and encourages exploration; it responds differently to different viewers. If a visitor does not interact with the material, the exhibition acts autonomously to bring an array of images and sounds to the viewer&#39;s attention. If the visitor explores, the exhibition responds accordingly. is dynamic. The very act of viewing the exhibition changes what is on display. Each time a person visits, he or she has a different experience. is communal. In the same way that a physical exhibition is a public experience, an effective online exhibition builds community. Visitors know that others are taking part in the exhibition and can choose to interact. These communications become part of the exhibition as it develops a life of its own. is a seamless environment that encourages exploration at a number of levels: visually, aurally, intellectually, and emotionally.</p>
