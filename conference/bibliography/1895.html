<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>building=yes [1] is a project started in 2010 to create stable and unique identifiers and a webpage for each of the 26 million (and counting) buildings in the OpenStreetMap [2] project.</p>
<p>Each building has an accurate geographic footprint associated with it as well as a nested list of place IDs (using the Where On Earth / GeoPlanet gazeteer). Although many of the buildings still have no meaning metadata this is<br/>
seen as a valuable opportunity to encourage increased participation and individual stewardship of one or more buildings.</p>
<p>This paper will discuss the motivation behind the project, it&#39;s technical implementation and shortcomings as well as future directions. It will also address the increasingly number and role of community-driven bespoke registries<br/>
of cultural artifacts and the fact the Internets make it possible for people to self-organize around a common interest, effectively collapsing the costs usually associated with production and distribution, and if communities of amateurs<br/>
don&#39;t feel like they have any avenues to participate in established projects, or institutions, then they can and will  just do it themselves.</p>
