<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>In 2011, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York implemented a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) solution, Salesforce, to help manage and track its vast member and donor population, past and present. Since its initial implementation, additional data from other Museum systems have been integrated into the CRM platform, such as a member’s retail purchase history, e-commerce online activity, and visitation history, thereby enabling the Museum to have a 360-degree view of every Museum member and donor. This view represents a holistic and multichannel perspective of a member’s lifetime online and on-site journey through all of the Museum’s offerings. This integrated CRM platform has enabled the Museum to provide more-informed customer service, retain and grow its member and donor population, increase engagement with its donors, and enhance its lobby operations through the use of mobile technologies. </p>
<p>In the summer of 2014, the Museum launched a new mobile application utilizing the integrated CRM data, with a goal of optimizing the member and visitor experience in the Museum lobby. This application has transformed the operations in the Museum’s lobby and beyond, offering new possibilities for membership renewals and conversions.</p>
<p>This paper and the subsequent presentation look at the technology and business challenges in implementing an integrated CRM platform. We will look at both the concepts and ideas that led to the Museum’s successes, and also those that did not produce the expected results. We will review upcoming plans for further changes to the CRM platform, such as tighter integration with the Museum’s MoMA.org website and simplifying the Museum&#39;s outreach for traveling exhibitions. Finally, we will describe how the Museum has moved a core operational system from a costly and cumbersome internal application to a scalable cloud-based solution, enabling more agile development and easier integration with current technologies.</p>
