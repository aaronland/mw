<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>We demonstrate a configurable web application that can be used by visitors with their mobile devices instantly, without prior installation. The application can be used by museums of any size.<br/>
The key feature of the application is its support for gamification, allowing designing and applying various types of game-based rules to stimulate visitors&#39; motivation and engagement, as well as reinforce educational effects of a visit.<br/>
All the application content, including museum branding, route plans, exhibition-related content and the system of gamification rules, can be easily changed by museum staff alone using the provided cloud-based Content Management System (CMS). The demonstrated application is provided by a non-profit network of museums using it, which is open to be joined by new museums, provided they will commit to share the costs of maintaining the server-side infrastructure. The ownership of all the content developed by the staff of museums for the application and maintained with the CMS stays with the respective museums and is not transferred to any third party.<br/>
The application has been developed within the framework of the BalticMuseums: Love IT! project co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund in the Interreg South Baltic Programme.</p>
