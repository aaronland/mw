<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>The combination of dynamic HTML tags, the possibilities of simple scripts in web pages, the ability to bind data to pages, and the needs of visitors for accessibility to electronic resources have conspired to produce a remarkably useful tool: SAMI. The Synchronized Accessible Media Interchange Format (SAMI) is intended as a way to provide closed captioning and audio description to multi-media materials. It does that. But, like so many tools developed to provide accessibility (ramps, curb cuts, volume controls in phones, comfortable spaces) the SAMI conventions turn out to be remarkably valuable for other purposes -- making simple multi-media presentations, providing multiple language support for your site, adding transcripts to video materials, and quite a bit more. The best thing about it is that while it uses some sophisticated web techniques, it is very easy to use. This session will offer enough of a look at the features that go into developing SAMI files so that you&#39;ll be able to make your own, some examples of swell tricks that can be done with SAMI when used with dynamic HTML, and some thoughts on an exciting new approach to presenting materials on the web. Files used during conference presentation are available online.</p>
