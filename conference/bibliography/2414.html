<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>This paper will examine recent initiatives to create original &#34;mini-sites&#34; of information and resources for use in K-12 classrooms. These &#34;galleries of information&#34; include cross-institutional collaborations with various arts and humanities organizations across the world. In particular, the paper will focus on an interactive site based on the life and music of Duke Ellington as well as on a mini-site celebrating the arts of Ireland through a &#34;virtual museum&#34; based on art works from private and public collections in the United States and Ireland. These online exhibits and sites were created specifically for educational use and embody certain aspects and attributes worth sharing with the broader arts community. Highlights will include: designing for a diverse audience with various technological capabilities; gathering and re-presenting original materials; and creating arts-integrated lesson plans and activities for young online audiences.</p>
