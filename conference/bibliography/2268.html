<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>&#34;Too often, the computer is used in the schools, as it is used in other social establishments, as a quick technological fix. It is used to paper over fundamental problems to create the illusion that they are being attacked.&#34; [Joesph Weizenbaum, Ph.D., Professor of Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in &#34;Computers and Education&#34;, BYTE (June 1984) vol. 9 no. 6, p 225 ] I wish to pose two series of fundamental philosophical questions in this paper. These arise from this statement about computers in education and I will attempt to apply them in examining the relationship between Museums and the Web. The first series deals with the application of this technology to the central mission of museums, &#34;to collect, to preserve and to educate&#34;. Many studies have shown that the introduction of Information Technologies (I.T.) has not significantly increased per capita efficiency of companies. In our rush to adopt computer-based communication technologies and restructure our institutions to make use them, do we run the risk of losing more than we might gain? What might be the long-term side effects for museums of &#34;being digital&#34;? The second series of questions are related to the first. In a different economic environment, would we have chosen the web as a primary communication vehicle? Museums have undergone a period of tremendous re-structuring and re-focusing over the last five years. Budget reductions, slashed staff, loss of audience have been widely experienced. In this period of turmoil we have, perhaps paradoxically, seen a huge growth in the use of computer-based information technologies in museums (at all levels of education for that matter). Has this money been well spent, or are we papering over the cracks? The bottom line question I will try to address is simple, with all this I.T. are we doing our job better or not?</p>
