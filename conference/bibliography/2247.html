<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>Three years are a small blip in the context of a museum grounded on the natural environment, social history and the fine arts. But for the World Wide Web, they compress several generations of fast change. What&#39;s the coming together of these meant for Te Papa - whose new building opening in February 1998 is the biggest national museum project under way anywhere in the world - and the largest single cultural investment ever made by a New Zealand government. There has been vigorous debate within Te Papa over what the website should be - who should drive it - how should it add value to corporate strategies - what it could mean for a museum whose founding statute set the objective of its being &#34;a forum for the nation&#34;. In the wider context, New Zealand has a reputation for fast uptake of new information technologies: its website has to successfully compete for attention with those of the other major institutions of national identity. For schools, the Web is now a mainstream knowledge access channel; there are competitors for supply of content, yet what richer source of content is there than the Museum&#39;s superb research-based collections? For the indigenous people, the Maori, internet technologies are giving real meaning to access to oral and visual information - there are hard issues here for how the Museum presents itself. The Conference is something of a case study of: one Museum building the Web into its change process; how intellectual property rights and revenue opportunities are affected leveraging the Web potential for interaction with all New Zealanders - a forum for the nation; how to ensure dynamic updating with cost-efficiency principles hyperlinks - the real key to museums, archives and libraries working together</p>
