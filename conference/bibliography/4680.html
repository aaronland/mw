<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>The detrimental effect that sophisticated ticket scalping software known as “ticket bots” have had on the arts and cultural markets has received significant media attention as of late due to skyrocketing online ticket prices for the widely popular musical Hamilton. </p>
<p>This paper will address the history of ticket scalping in America, provide an explanation of how ticket bot software works, discuss the negative impacts ticket bots have had on arts and cultural institutions, incorporate interviews and case studies from institutions and/or shows who have been significantly affected across various areas of their core business (including both Pittsburgh Ballet Theater and Ballet Austin&#39;s The Nutcracker, and the recent showstopper Hamilton), and analyze potential legislation and how it might alter the secondary ticket market as it currently stands.</p>
