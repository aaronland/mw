<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>BYOD, or Bring Your Own Device, is a growing rallying cry in business and educational organizations, encouraging or requiring employees and students to provide their own technology. Museums uniquely have two opportunities to apply this approach: one with their staff and the other with visitors. While much has been written in business regarding the IT strategies, policies, and protocols for BYOD implementation in managing employees&#39; devices, very little formal research exists regarding factors leading to successful BYOD museum-visitor programming. </p>
<p>In 2012, the Corning Museum of Glass (CMoG) broke ground for its new North Wing Contemporary galleries. Using the new North Wing as a testing ground, the museum began work on a campus-wide digital media strategy for interpretation and museum information management. A core component of this strategy is BYOD, connecting CMoG visitors at a personal level to a range of rich, interpretive content on their personal devices. Understanding there were a number of known and unknown obstacles, the museum developed a cohesive, cross-institutional approach to identify and address each challenge and assure the program&#39;s success. This paper provides an overview of preliminary research findings and practices being developed around visitor-focused BYOD at CMoG.</p>
