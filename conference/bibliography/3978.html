<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>In the spring of 2015, an advanced exhibition design class from New Mexico Highlands University&#39;s Media Arts &amp; Technology Department redesigned the visitor&#39;s center at Coronado Historic Site in Bernalillo, New Mexico. Kuaua Village was a first-contact site between the native population and the Spanish entrada that was moving up the Rio Grande valley from Mexico in 1540.<br/>
The redesign featured, among other updates, a new interactive &#34;Sim&#34; pueblo in which three-dimensional-printed pieces are placed on a responsive iPad to reveal information, animation, and clues to life in the ancient village.</p>
<p>That project was reenvisioned using the HP Sprout, a device designed to scan two- and three-dimensional objects and then add them to a library of usable objects on a touchscreen and projected mat. For this demo, we will show the HP Sprout detecting individual printed objects, which are then made responsive as physical or digital objects. By moving the prints on the mat, puzzle pieces are unlocked on the touchscreen, and animations of pueblo life are added to the projection. Information about life in the pueblo from architecture, construction materials, pottery traditions, and agriculture is revealed.</p>
