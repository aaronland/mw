<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>How can you make your museum an open and co-creative place?</p>
<p>How can you open your museum to enthusiastic teams of designers, hackers, makers, artists, specialists, creators of all sorts, other museum and free spirited people?</p>
<p>How can you invite them to co-create, in a timely fashion, and a conducive environment, new and inventive ways of visiting/using your museum?</p>
<p>How can you help visitors become users? How can you make your museum open, networked, and participative?</p>
<p>Museomix is an experiment to help you do all these things!</p>
<p>Over three consecutive days, participants design, co-create and test new ways to mediate exhibitions, and experience the museum.</p>
<p>On the third day, prototypes are implemented right in the exhibitions spaces, allowing visitors to test them.</p>
<p>The very first edition took place in Les Arts Décoratifs museum, Paris, in November 2011. The second was in Lyon in october 2012, in the Musée Gallo-Romain. In 2013, Museomix will take place in several places around the world (UK, Quebec, France...)</p>
