Are you one of &#34;those&#34; who takes great pleasure in dissecting processes--that multitude of steps used to get a Web project on line? Donald Goodes shares your fascination, and is interested in having you participate in the collective consideration of a methodology he is developing specifically for the design of cultural Web sites.
</p>
<p>
Goodes&#39; Cultural Design Methodology (CDM) was initially inspired by more technically-oriented methodologies, such as Relationship Management Methodology (RMM), used in the development of hypermedia applications. From these, CDM borrowed objectives concerning the optimization of process and the definition of a series of well-delineated steps. But CDM adds a parallel goal: the maximization of creative and conceptual input at all stages of development.
</p>
<p>
Goodes will explain the present iteration of CDM, and, in hopes of evolving it further, will open up an exchange inviting participants to share ideas and experiences concerning methodology.
</p>
<p>
Questions that may arise include: When does navigation design end and page design begin? How and when do user relations enter into the design process? What are the benchmarks signaling the completion of a processes?  How does one translate the values of the cultural world into methodology? How do parallel processes communicate?</p>
