<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>In the UK the opportunities of the WWW are being exploited in a “National Grid for Learning.” MDA and the Campaign for Museums are working together to ensure that museums play their part in this initiative. “The 24 Hour Museum” is a new project which will provide a gateway on the WWW to the web sites of museums in the UK and will eventually allow their collections databases to be searched on-line. This workshop will describe the project and its underlying philosophy in terms of the objectives of MDA and the Campaign for Museums, and the political and educational contexts into which it is being launched. The workshop will then discuss the technical issues that will need to be addressed and the progress of the project to date. There will be an opportunity for questions and discussion of some of the issues raised.</p>
