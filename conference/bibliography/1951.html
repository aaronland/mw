<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>Just as personal and collective memories imbue artifacts with significance, so it is with place. Launched in January 2010, <em>PhilaPlace</em> is a collaborative and interactive community-oriented Web site that connects stories to places across time throughout Philadelphia&#39;s neighborhoods, creating an enduring record of collective heritage. Through the integration of two open source solutions-Google Maps and Collective Access collections management system-<em>PhilaPlace</em> supports a rich feature set that facilitates an interpretive mosaic of historical records as well as stories, photos, and video shared by ordinary people of all backgrounds.</p>
<p>This paper focuses on the potential of current open-source technologies, advances in GIS mapping, and increased access to archival and community-curated content to situate and visualize the history of a place in innovative ways. The <em>PhilaPlace</em> platform affords a rich opportunity for closer inspection and evaluation as a potentially viable model and reproducible platform for broader application within the museum and historical center world (<em>AnyPlace</em>).</p>
<p>Our evaluation focuses on an iterative design review of not only the technological design solution but also the project methodology. How might the open-source solutions and institutional partnerships for <em>PhilaPlace</em> inform an <em>AnyPlace</em> approach to mapping and interpreting place-based historical narrative for neighborhoods in other towns and cities? Do evaluation results support the use of this methodology and platform as a reusable model, and what value does such a platform bring to the audiences who engage with it? Also included in our discussion are the lessons learned in developing <em>PhilaPlace</em>, in particular issues of sustainability, institutional capacity, and the changing pace of technological innovation.</p>
