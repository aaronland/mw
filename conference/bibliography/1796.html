<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>In 2013 the Salon Doré, an 18th-century French period room in the Legion of Honor, was completely de-installed to undergo a yearlong conservation project. Throughout the year, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco’s digital media interpretive fellow (made possible by a Kress Foundation grant) created a variety of digital content designed to document and interpret the work of museum conservators, architects, and curators. Videos, photography, 2- and 3D animations, and 3D printing projects were published on the Museums’ website and social media channels, and provided unprecedented digital access to the entire process. This paper focuses the creation of non-linear, engaging, and interactive digital storytelling that communicates the rich history of an 18th-century period room and addresses the challenges and opportunities involved in producing an immersive digital experience within (and which does not detract from) an architectural experience.</p>
