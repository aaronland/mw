<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>MultiMuseum is a multi-channel prototype, with different technological accesses. It has a mission: to open the museum to the public in an integrated way. It is an interactive, flexible and personalized tool, which allows the Museum to give information and services to cinema fans and to all potential visitors. The aim of the project is integrating three fundamental aspects: </p>
<ul>
<li> to widen the access to the Museum heritage; </li>
<li>to enrich the visitors experience both inside and outside the National Museum of Cinema; </li>
<li>to give knowledge personalized tools. </li>
</ul>
<p> MultiMuseum is a highly developed platform including applications commonly used on the web, expressively customized for the communicative needs of the Museum, and specific original software, like HyperFilm, which allows to insert images, videos, QTVR, HTML pages as hyper textual links connected to a main video. The prototype deals with three experimentation areas: </p>
<ul>
<li> the advanced Web channel, characterized by a strong graphic element, including not only the presentation of the Museum and of its charming dressing, but also of the collections, of the institutional activities and of the films planning of Cinema Massimo; </li>
<li> the PDA channel, conceived to implement the access to the contents, both inside and outside the Museum, by using handheld devices; </li>
<li> the Reseau channel, devoted to the wide band net (VDSL) created by Telecom Italia and Telecom Italia Lab. </li>
</ul>
