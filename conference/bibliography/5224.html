<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>The Endangered Archives Programme (EAP) contributes to the preservation of archival material that is in danger of destruction, neglect or physical deterioration worldwide.</p>
<p>Delivered by the British Library, London, and funded by Arcadia, a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin, EAP supports the preservation of important at-risk photographs, documents, manuscripts, and other items from around the world; it facilitates digital capture of these items, and shares over six million images online. The Programme has accomplished this through funding over 320 projects in 80 countries around the world.</p>
<p>The Endangered Archives Programme has been running for over ten years, initially with a mission to preserve, and more recently with an additional mission to digitize and share.</p>
<p>This paper reflects on the shifts in preservation and digitization, process, and emphasis over that time; explores what we have learned (and what we still donâ€™t know) about archiving in the digital age; and looks ahead to the digital archives of the future.</p>
<p>With the shift towards providing access online to the files digitized through the Endangered Archives Programme, we recently upgraded our Web presence, moving from a proprietary system to open-source technologies like Drupal and Solr, and new community-driven frameworks including the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF).</p>
<p>We will share key learnings from that process, including how we dealt with substantial amounts (over 200TB) of data and millions of images; how we managed the quality of that data; how we upgraded our systems and processes in line with best practice, including IIIF and Solr search; and how we did it all within an aggressive timeline, with eight weeks from initiating the project to launch.</p>
<p>Our learnings from the Programme as a whole and the recent redevelopment will be relevant, useful, and actionable for anyone working with archives, digital collections, preservation, or large amounts of data.</p>
