<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>The lobby is the first place a visitor experiences a museum. But quite often this space is confusing and intimidating in its effort to serve a multitude of purposes. At The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, the lobby has historically welcomed approximately 3 million visitors annually. In October 2019, MoMA, which has undergone a multi-year expansion project including closing its doors to the public in the final four months of construction, will re-open with 30% more gallery and public space. The average annual visitation is also expected to increase noticeably. This paper outlines the thought process and evolution of MoMA&#39;s new lobby as it tackled key problems such as creating a single space to serve a widely diverse visitor base; balancing the tension between serving as a space for art versus a space for commerce; using technology solutions to minimize friction at points of transaction such as at the ticketing area, at the coat check, in the retail stores, and at the scanning posts&#39; point of entry; optimizing queueing and manage crowds to ease visitors&#39; anxiety; and assisting visitors in wayfinding after they complete the transactional elements of their Museum journey.</p>
<p>This paper specifically focuses on the visitor experience in the lobby, and the making of MoMA&#39;s new lobby. Many assumptions were made in redesigning and transforming the lobby so that it is a space beyond simply commercial transactions, and so that art is fully integrated and a visitor is immersed in art from the moment they set foot inside. In addition to a deep dive of the aforementioned problems, and a description of how MoMA approached each, this paper will share results based on concrete data analytics and observations in its initial opening months. Where applicable, operational changes as a result of such data will also be shared.</p>
