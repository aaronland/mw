<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>The Global Gathering Place is a joint initiative between the Multicultural History Society of Ontario (MHSO), the Centre for Instructional Technology Development at the University of Toronto at Scarborough, and the Scarborough Board of Education. The primary goal of this project is to make available electronically the rich and diverse archival resources housed at the MHSO to students and teachers engaged in multicultural education and social studies. Using multimedia presentations of historical case studies, life histories, and cultural resources of the MHSO, the project will help teachers bring diversity alive in the classroom. The use of the collaborative tools of the World-Wide Web and classroom projects will help students and teachers create a classroom atmosphere in which local family, ethnic and immigration history can come together as Canadian history. Students are not only encouraged to use the resources but also contribute to the growing archive of living and shared histories. The project will be designed to achieve specific learning outcomes, and will provide opportunities for students to work together and learn from one another across institutional and cultural boundaries. Finally, the project also provides the opportunity for evaluating the effective means of integrating electronic resources and telecommunication tools into the curriculum.</p>
