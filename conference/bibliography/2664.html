<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>Despite the continuing attachment of galleries and museums to the single author, several factors create apertures for the exhibition of collaboratively created and participant-driven new media in the gallery world. Curators working with living artists are engaged in an inherently collaborative practice - effective exhibition expects an engaged relationship with the artists, their method of working, as well as their final works. Artists themselves work closely with each other, scientists and audiences, blurring lines of creative control. This paper explores the challenges of collaborative exchange and new media curatorial practices.</p>
