<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>Museums have dealt with the publication of images of their objects in print publications for nearly a century, by using fairly clear cut policies, regulations, and prices. The use of digital images of Museum objects on the Web in the past few years, has taken the museum business by complete surprise. This paper will examine the issues museums must consider when providing images and permissions for Web-based publications. It will also propose practical guidelines for image licensing in this medium. Definitions of types of Web publications, strategies for pricing based on models from the commercial world, methods for order fulfillment, and contract terms will be outlined. Also included will be a discussion about licensing images for the Web differs from CD licensing, as well as an analysis of the present and future administrative, financial, and mission-based implications that the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston is facing as an image provider.</p>
