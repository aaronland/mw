<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>The past years the Internet has undergone a transformation from being static and closed and very much about creating systems that connected computers, to being more dynamic and open-ended, and more about creating systems that connect human beings. This shift towards a more social, collective user generated Internet has been named Web 2.0. The current development on the Internet is also affecting the museums and their presence on-line. In cooperation with three art institutions we have developed a product called KuratorTool which is based on this new technology, where the user is acknowledged as a producer and distributor of knowledge. This paper will investigate how the museum as an institution and the traditional museum user will both change in a virtual world that is dominated by social technologies where the user is the creative part.</p>
