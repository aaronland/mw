<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>This paper begins by presenting and discussing the distinction between record-oriented and pattern-oriented search. Examples of record-oriented (or item-oriented) questions include: &#34;What (or how many, etc.) glass items made prior to 100 A.D. do we have in our collection?&#34; and &#34;How many paintings featuring dogs do we have that were painted during the 19th century, and who painted them?&#34;. Standard database systems are well suited to answering such questions, based on the data in, e.g., a collections management system. Examples of pattern-oriented questions include: &#34;How does the (apparent) production of glass objects vary over time between 400 B.C. and 100 A.D.?&#34; and &#34;What other animals are present in paintings with dogs (painted during the 19th century and in our collection)?&#34;. Standard database systems are not well suited to answering these sorts of questions (and pattern-oriented questions in general), even though the basic data is properly stored in them. To answer pattern-oriented questions it is the accepted solution to transform the underlying (relational) data to what is called the data cube or cross-tabulation form (there are other forms as well). We discuss how this can be done for non-numeric data, such as are found widely in museum collections and archives. Further we discuss and demonstrate two distinct, but related, approaches to exploring for patterns in such cross-tabulated museum data. The two approaches have been implemented as the prototype systems Homer and MOTC. (For pointers, see Kimbrough&#39;s home page, <a href="http://grace.wharton.upenn.edu/~sok/">http://grace.wharton.upenn.edu/~sok/</a>, or contact him directly.) We conclude by discussing initial experimental evidence indicating that these approaches are indeed effective in helping people find answers to their pattern-oriented questions of museum and archive collections.</p>
