<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>In 2018 the J. Paul Getty Trust embarked on a multi-year project to overhaul its vast and decentralized website with the aim to improve user experience (UX), reach a broader and more diverse global public, and more effectively present Getty as an organization. The project went beyond a visual redesign to address information architecture, UX strategy, a technical rebuild, and a content management system (CMS) replatform, as well as the creation of a new governance structure. Phase 1 of this work, in 2019, resulted in 12 &#34;front-door&#34; pages that established a new design direction and the outline of a new information architecture. One central goal of the work was to move from content &#34;blobs&#34; to structured content, separating data from presentation for sustainability and governance. Our demonstration and paper, authored by the content strategy leads, provides insights into our approach — still in its early stages at this writing — and the opportunities and challenges of approaching content as data.</p>
