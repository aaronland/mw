<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>In 2010 The Cleveland Museum of Art rolled out a brand new website, winning online acclaim and garnering numerous design awards based on a high-concept idea: while the museum’s galleries are closed during its $350 million building expansion, make its collections available online. Allow online visitors to explore virtually, getting lost in the world-class art. But although visually distinctive, the website was far from perfect: it couldn’t support the technology or communications goals of the museum going forward, because of its underlying, heavily customized CMS and its shallow information architecture..</p>
<p>To regain financial and developmental control of the museum website, Information Management and Technology Services (IMTS) managed the migration of the website from its heavily-customized legacy content management system (Sitecore CMS) to a flexible, open-source CMS (Drupal) that could be maintained and expanded in-house.</p>
<p>This paper explores the managerial and technical processes required to replace the website with a new one that looked the same, but delivered a better user experience.</p>
