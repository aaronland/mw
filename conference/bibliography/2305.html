<tr><td style="text-align: right;">Abstract:</td><td><p>Online art projects hold the potential of emergent behaviors, open public participation, and unanticipated results. Because of this spontaneous potential, one is confronted with dynamics that are different than those for exhibitions of pre-established objects. The curator&#39;s role extends beyond selection and presentation of pre-existing works, encompassing instead the guidance and supervision of ongoing events. The author speaks to several patterns that tend to emerge in both open and closed interactive systems. Drawing on examples from websites, museums, and MOO-spaces, emphasis is placed on alternatives that structure interactions in directed but flexible ways. The artist discusses programming and interface design as mechanisms for conducing particular creative behaviors, on-line discourses, etc. This paper will draw upon the artist&#39;s experiences with creating on-line interactive art. A concerted attempt will be made to bridge the technical and social discourses.</p>
