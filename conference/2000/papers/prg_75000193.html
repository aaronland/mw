      <p class="heading"><b>Contextual Links and Non-linear Narrative: A Virtual 
        Rashomon</b></p>
      <p class="author"><b>David Greenfield, Skirball Cultural Center, USA</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote> <b> </b> 
        <p align="JUSTIFY" class="small">The mission of the Skirball Cultural 
          Center is to celebrate and cultivate the links between American democratic 
          values and the Jewish heritage. Through our museum exhibitions and public 
          programming, the Center strives to deepen the understanding of the origins 
          of American families and their role in strengthening American society. 
          Currently the Center is redesigning its web site to transform it from 
          an electronic brochure to a more content-driven site. One feature being 
          developed relates to family histories and the immigrant experience. 
          To more fully portray the immigrant experience and to illustrate the 
          relationships between different communities, we are collaborating with 
          other cultural institutions to create a virtual &#34;Rashomon&#34; - to tell 
          similar narratives but from different voices. The method we are developing 
          involves creating contextual hyper-links within a non-linear narrative 
          that connects a partner institutionsí web site. Hyper-links generally 
          follow a linear model where a user enters a particular site, selects 
          a link to navigate within or to another web portal. We are creating 
          links with partner institutionsí sites that occur within the context 
          of the actual narrative. On our site for example, we tell the story 
          of a Russian Jewish family that immigrated to Los Angeles in the 1920&#39;s 
          and had neighbors who were Japanese immigrants. The Japanese American 
          National Museum web site tells the story of this Japanese family. Within 
          the narratives on the different sites, there are anecdotes and stories 
          about the interactions and relationships between the families. These 
          interactions provide the context for direct links between the individual 
          family stories that reside on the various partner web sites. There are 
          several goals for our virtual &#34;Rashomon&#34; project, including celebrating 
          positive attributes of the immigrant experience, promoting collaborations 
          between institutions and communities, developing technology that will 
          access and create on-the-fly content and utilizing the computer as a 
          creative tool in the storytelling and the narrative process.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>In Grandfatherís Virtual Kitchen</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Imagine this, you are sitting with your 
        family at the kitchen table after a big meal and discussing the family 
        history and legends. Grandfather, an immigrant, is entertaining everyone 
        with stories about his experiences as a greenhorn in this country where 
        the streets were supposed to be paved with gold, but in reality, people 
        were lucky if they were paved at all. At one point he says: &#34;Remember 
        that other family who lived across the street from us? They were from 
        another country from us, but my, how we had fun with them at their holiday 
        picnics. I wonder what happened to them?&#34; And then, at that moment, 
        you find yourself magically transported (or beamed) over to the kitchen 
        table of that family, where they are discussing their familyís stories 
        and how much they enjoyed celebrating a holiday with your grandfather. 
        What you have just experienced is an example of a contextual link in a 
        non-linear narrative. Although it is impossible to experience this in 
        real life/space, with research, thought and planning you can make these 
        excursions in the digital world. But before we make these journeys, we 
        must first define the concepts of non-linear narrative and define contextual 
        links. In some ways, the concept is easier than the answer. The short 
        description is that it is a method of telling multiple viewpoints of a 
        story across multiple web sites with multiple entrance portals. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>History of Non-linear Narrative</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Non-linear narrative is not really 
        a new idea, so it would be interesting to take a brief, subjective overview 
        of its history along with examples of how it appears in different media. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The first example of non-linear 
        narrative is text based: the Talmud, the Jewish books of law and commentaries. 
        The Talmud as a physical entity is a set of 63 volumes originally compiled 
        around 500 C.E. in Babylonia to preserve generations of analysis and discussion 
        by rabbis and scholars. It contains extra-legal and anecdotal material 
        relating to all aspects of life- such as dietary laws, marriage, divorce, 
        religious ritual and agricultural laws. Although at first glance the books 
        seem similar to an encyclopedia, they are far more complex. The breadth 
        and organization of Talmud is similar to random-access type memory organization 
        of the web. One of the reasons for this is that the Talmud contains one 
        of the primary functions of non-linear narrative ñ hypertext (a term invented 
        by Ted Nelson, a few short centuries after the Talmud was compiled). The 
        physical structure of a page of Talmud (Figure 1) facilitates a non-linear 
        process. It consists of a main text block in the center of the page surrounded 
        by several smaller text block in different font styles and sizes.</span></p>
      <p align="CENTER"><img src="greenfield.fig1.fix.jpg" width="350" height="270"/></p>
      <p align="CENTER"><b><i><span class="caption">Figure 1</span></i></b></p>
      <p align="CENTER"><span class="caption"><b><i>Detail of the first Page of 
        volume one, &#34;Benedictions&#34; of the Steinsaltz Edition of the 
        Babylonian Talmud.</i></b></span></p>
      <p align="CENTER"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The main text is located in the 
        center of the page and usually addresses a particular problem, dilemma 
        or question in the form of a story. Surrounding this block are comments 
        by different scholars and rabbis also written in the form of stories, 
        and comments that address the main text unit. Additionally, these side 
        comments often refer to text blocks and commentaries located in other 
        volumes of Talmud. A person studying Talmud does not simply pick up a 
        particular volume and read. It is necessary to jump from point to point, 
        page to page and often volume to volume to understand any one section.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Several centuries after Talmud was 
        compiled, the printing press was developed. After some fits and starts 
        pertaining to the use of this new machine, a form of narrative story was 
        developed called the novel. Early forms of novels were presented in a 
        linear manner. In her wonderful book <i>Hamlet on the Holodeck</i>, Janet 
        Murray describes an early exploration of non-linear form. She uses the 
        example from the 18<sup>th</sup> century novel <i>Tristram Shandy</i> 
        written by Laurence Stern in which the narrator: &#34;Öinserts black 
        pages, numbering chapters as if they have been re-arranged, claims to 
        have torn out certain pages and sends us back to reread certain chapters. 
        In short, he does everything he can to remind us of the physical form 
        of the book that we are reading&#34;. Although Stern came up with some 
        very interesting literary devices, the basic format of the book still 
        remains rooted in linear methodology. The reader turns page after page. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">This century also has its forms 
        of non-linear media, a recent example being the interactive-audience-participatory-theater-experience. 
        About 10 years ago I saw (or more realistically, participated in) a play 
        called <i>Tamara</i>. The play was performed in a large veteranís hall 
        in Hollywood that had been an old mansion and was furnished in a 1930ís 
        art deco manner. Upon entering the &#34;theater&#34; I was handed a 
        ticket designed as a passport and led into a large foyer cocktail party 
        where the servers were all members of the cast. The theme of the play 
        was about a group of actors, fascists, and anti-fascists, gathered in 
        a mansion in pre-WWII Italy. At a certain point, the cocktail party ended 
        and the play began as the actors shifted from servers into their roles. 
        We the audience (&#34;party guests&#34;) were divided into groups and 
        began to follow cast members around the mansion, up and down staircases, 
        through passages and in and out of rooms as they interacted with other 
        cast members, acting out separate, but connected plots. Although the audience 
        was encouraged to stay with one or two particular characters, we could 
        shift to other groups of actors if one particular story line looked more 
        interesting. The timing of the actors was amazing! Because of the complexity 
        of the story, it was virtually impossible to understand the complete story, 
        so each member of the audience was presented with just one small view. 
        Intermission was in the dining hall, and as we ate, we all exchanged information 
        to get a better picture of what was happening. Multiple attendance of 
        the play was encouraged by reduced ticket prices for each subsequent viewing. 
        I think the fourth or fifth visit was free. Although it was at times a 
        bit unbalancing trying to figure out what was happening, it was a fascinating, 
        entertaining and fun experience to participate in breaking the boundaries 
        of the medium.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The development of cinema has also 
        increased the exploration of non-linear narrative. Popular movies such 
        as <i>Back to the Future, Groundhog Day</i>, and the more obscure <i>Head</i> 
        (the 1968 movie by the Monkees), or the German film <i>Zentropa</i> play 
        with our sense of time and place. The audience is not a passive observer, 
        but must become an active participant to assemble the various plot threads 
        of narrative to a coherent story. In <i>Hamlet on the Holodeck</i>, Murray 
        writes about two significant terms necessary in the discussion of non-linear 
        narrative ñ&#34;multiform stories&#34; and &#34;active audience&#34;. 
        She defines &#34;multiform stories&#34; as &#34;Öwritten or dramatic 
        narrative that presents a single plot line in multiple versionsÖ&#34; 
        and &#34;active audience&#34; as the result of a &#34;Öwriter expands 
        the story to include multiple possibilities, the reader assumes a more 
        active role&#34;.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Kurosawaís cinematic masterpiece 
        <i>Rashomon</i> is a wonderful example of multiform stories&#34; to promote 
        an &#34;active audience&#34;. The story revolves around a large gate 
        in the middle of a forest in which two peasants are discussing an incident 
        involving a samurai, his wife and a bandit. Something took place in which 
        the samurai was killed, the bandit was arrested and the wife may or may 
        not have been raped. The story is told through multiple voices (including 
        the dead samurai as channeled by a medium!). The audience cannot sit by 
        and idly watch the film. It is necessary to pay close attention to detail 
        to attempt to discern the true facts. Because there is no concrete resolution 
        at the end of the film, the audience is left in a rather ambiguous position. 
        The beauty of this is that each member of the audience must come to his 
        or her own conclusion that satisfies his or her individual interpretation 
        of the events presented.</span></p>

      <p class="heading"><b>Introduction to Non-linear Theory</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">As much as these books, films and 
        theater explore non-linear narrative, utilizing devices such as the cinematic 
        flashback, they are limited by the individual strengths and weaknesses 
        of their particular media and can only be presented in a linear fashion 
        (page-after-page, scene-after-scene). There is though, one distinct idea 
        that connects all of the examples. In one manner or another they are all 
        procedural experiences. Although the conclusions may be gratifying, what 
        makes these examples compelling and interesting is their dynamic nature. 
        They are all about how you arrive rather then actually arriving. In their 
        on-line manual, <i>The Digital Cookbook</i>, Joe Lambert and Nina Mullen 
        describe this form of story telling as &#34;the journey&#34;. While 
        other forms of stories use the traditional literary devices to set a premise, 
        then to create tension as characters move along a path to achieve specific 
        goals (get the guy/girl, solve the crime and find the culprit, slay the 
        dragon, etc.), the goal of the journey is <i>the journey</i>. The experiences 
        and lessons learned are the central forces behind the journey. In some 
        ways, whether the hero/heroine achieves his/her goal is secondary to the 
        route that they pass through. This form of story telling can be unfulfilling 
        because of the lack of any concrete resolution, although this is really 
        not the case in the previously mentioned media (except for Talmud). Conversely, 
        the journey story can also be a compelling, exciting and even addictive 
        experience. The movie serials in the early days of cinema, or the soap 
        operas of today command huge audiences because of the fact that there 
        are no real conclusions. Characters come and go, adventures happen day 
        after day and the audience is continually drawn back to part of the process. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">At this point, the age of computer 
        and World Wide Web enter the picture. From the campfire, to stages, pages 
        and silver screen, storytelling has always reflected the primary media 
        of a specific time period, and the computer age is no different. Currently, 
        we are in the infant stages of investigating the results of the intersection 
        of form (digital content) and function (technology). There are several 
        specific elements that differentiate the medium of computers and Internet 
        from earlier media. The most important one is that this particular media 
        is incredibly dynamic both in terms of the development of technology and 
        how it is used. It is interesting to note that movies and books have an 
        <i>audience</i> but the world wide web and CD-ROMS have <i>users</i> and 
        that these users are active participants in choosing their own paths and 
        journeys (much like real life). This could lead non-linear stories to 
        be rather chaotic experiences. Ultimately, stories require a basic framework 
        and structure to be satisfying and compelling. A story properly planned 
        and executed will allow a user to travel along a dynamic path of a general 
        topic for exploration and adventure. Imagine being able to enter a story 
        and choose which character you wish to be the narrator, and then being 
        able to choose another character to experience the same adventure from 
        a different viewpoint, or to choose different charactersí paths and journeys 
        to the same incident or location. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The two technical elements that 
        allow for this kind of interaction are 1) the recognition that the computer 
        is an engine; and 2) the relational database. Simply put, every computer 
        on this planet can hold multiple databases. The computer, as an active 
        engine, can theoretically access these databases and publish real time 
        web pages that display discrete quantities of relevant content.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>How This All Fits Together</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Exploring family stories is not 
        new to the web, with many interesting examples. One interesting example 
        site is <i>My History is Americaís History</i>, a project of the NEH. 
        This educational program teaches people methods of gathering family stories 
        and then encourages them to post their favorite family stories on the 
        web. Another is Abbe Donís wonderful site called <i>Bubbeís Back Porch.</i> 
        This site has an area for a digital story bee along with requests for 
        submissions of individuals family stories and photos. Both of these examples 
        require active participation- gathering and posting information along 
        with surfing the site. Ultimately though, they are presented in a linear 
        web format. A visitor enters the site, explores one or more particular 
        stories within the site and then exits.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Our project is tentatively called, 
	<i>Grandfatherís Virtual Kitchen </i> because people tend to congregate 
	in the family kitchen and that is where some of the best stories are told. 
	We want to tell the stories of immigrant families and the relationships 
	that existed within different communities. Although immigrant groups have 
	naturally tended to reside together in neighborhoods, there has been one 
	unifying force among the different communities- they are all &#34;strangers 
	in a strange land&#34;. It would be false to say that there were no problems- 
	there are plenty of examples of the conflicts, stress and tensions that 
	existed (and still exist) between various communities. This is not the 
	purpose of <i>Grandfatherís Virtual Kitchen</i> Our purpose is to portray 
	the stories of immigrant families and how, over time, positive relationships 
	between different groups have developed. It is far more interesting and 
	relevant for us to illustrate examples of how communities can co-exist 
	with tolerance and mutual respect. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">A sentence found in our mission 
        statement sets the tone for <i>Grandfatherís Virtual Kitchen</i>: &#34;Just 
        as the American immigrant experience is different for each group and individual 
        arriving on these shores, the Skirball Cultural Center provides an unrivaled 
        rainbow of programs and opportunities to enrich each visitor.&#34; This 
        idea is manifested both in the core collection of the museum component 
        of the Skirball Center, which focuses on Jewish history (especially the 
        American Jewish experience) and with our various other programs, including 
        musicians, speakers, theater, dance (and more) that highlight and celebrate 
        cultures and communities from around the globe. Additionally, our education 
        department has been involved in some creative community projects such 
        as <i>Finding Family Stories. </i>This project was developed by the Japanese 
        American National Museum and was<i> </i>a collaboration with the Santa 
        Barbara Museum of Natural History, the Korean American Museum, Plaza de 
        la Raza and the Watts Towers Arts center. The goal of <i>Finding Family 
        Stories </i>was &#34;grounded in the belief that cultural institutions, 
        representing different ethnic communities, could learn from one another- 
        both organizationally and culturally- through the process of developing, 
        implementing and working on a project together&#34;. With a basic understanding 
        that no community or cultural institution operates in isolation, these 
        five institutions created a model that &#34;would not only reflect a 
        single cultural experience, but expand and open the doors to the experience 
        of others as well&#34;. The main activities of <i>Finding Family Stories 
        </i>were a series of collaborative workshops at partner institutions over 
        a three-year period, culminating in concurrent exhibitions at partner 
        institutions that highlighted &#34;contemporary artists of each community 
        who incorporated and interpreted family stories within their work.&#34;</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><i>Grandfather&#39;s Virtual Kitchen 
        </i>expands on the themes developed in <i>Finding Family Histories</i> 
        and begins to apply a non-linear narrative and contextual links theory 
        to practical applications. By using the Internet as the medium and the 
        web as the delivery platform, site visitors become active participants 
        in exploring the family stories and community interactions, rather than 
        simply being observers. As visitors to a particular site explore the stories, 
        photographs, video and sound clips of an individual family representing 
        a particular community, they will discover anecdotes about interactions 
        with families of other communities. These anecdotes provide the links 
        to the other families stories that are located at the partner institutionsí 
        web sites. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The collaborative process needed 
        in producing this project ñ to find partner institutions, develop content, 
        technology and links results in a process that is concurrent with the 
        goal- collaboration between communities.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>General Process</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">As with any other interactive project, 
        the process of creating <i>Grandfatherís Virtual Kitchen </i>is as non-linear 
        as the end product. Each issue, question and decision uncovers a new series 
        of issues and questions requiring a new series of decisions (a can of 
        virtual worms). The problem of the chicken-or-egg syndrome then arises: 
        what comes first? The answer to this question is: <i>the question</i>. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The answer to the question of what 
        comes first in creating a non-linear narrative is also relatively simple- 
        itís the idea. In our specific case, it is the creation of a virtual space 
        that allows visitors to actively explore discreet family stories along 
        with the interactions and relationships between members of different communities. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The decisions and production process 
        that follow this simple idea are not quite so simple. It is necessary 
        to first identify and enlist partner institutions, followed by determining 
        production teams and the infrastructure. With a core team together it 
        is possible to begin to define the scope of the project. With this done, 
        the actual production process begins. Part of the beauty of the dynamic 
        nature of the web is that a project such as this can be developed incrementally, 
        initially involving three or four partner institutions, expanding as the 
        narrative and are developed.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Partner Institutions, Teams and Infrastructure</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Collaboration is the order of the day, 
        so it is important to identify institutions and individuals that share 
        common goals and interests. It is not necessary for an institution to 
        confine itself to one particular niche. For example, although the Skirball 
        is a cultural center and museum, we do not need to limit our partners 
        only to other cultural museums. With a bit of imagination and creative 
        thinking, it is possible to expand collaborations to other types of institutions. 
        For example, if a member of our digital family is a scientist, we can 
        create a partnership with a science center/museum whose site has an area 
        that celebrates this individual&#39;s contribution to the scientific community. 
        Nor is it necessary to be confined to a single geographic area. Links 
        can be created with institutions across the country and world to show 
        the journeys of individual families. One possible scenario for us is to 
        begin our story with our virtual grandfatherís arrival to America with 
        a site/link to Ellis Island. Then, via links with museums and cultural 
        centers across America, we follow his path to Los Angeles.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Case Study- Overview</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">As previously discussed, there are 
        many issues that need to be examined when producing an interactive project. 
        Here are several examples of questions that we have encountered and how 
        they have currently been resolved.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">First, creating <i>Grandfatherís 
        Virtual Kitchen</i> is basically a three-part process: 1) research; 2) 
        gather content and media; and 3) production. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The first step of Part I is one 
        of the most crucial elements of the process. The partners decide between 
        two styles of story telling- the composite story or exclusively true story. 
        True stories are the most compelling, but research can be difficult and 
        cost prohibitive. For our prototype, we have decided to develop stories 
        closer to a model of historical fiction, taking stories from selected 
        primary sources and weaving them together to create a narrative that matches 
        our goal. For example, our virtual grandfather is a Russian Jewish immigrant 
        whom we shall call &#34;Ben&#34;. Ben had a dairy route with a horse 
        and wagon. One of his customers was a Japanese immigrant family whom we 
        shall call the &#34;Kurosawas&#34; and who owned a nursery. During World 
        War II, the Kurosawas had to leave their nursery when they were sent to 
        an internment camp in the California desert. The streets may not have 
        been paved of gold, but Benís heart was. He watched over the nursery and 
        returned the keys to the Kurosawas when they returned home after the war. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The events of this story are true, 
        but the composite is artificial. We have examples of righteous people 
        who assisted Japanese Americans during the war. We have the story of a 
        Jewish immigrant family who had a dairy wagon, Japanese customers and 
        a strong sense of ethics and justice. And we know about a Japanese American 
        family who owned a nursery, were sent to an internment camp and had a 
        neighbor who watched over their nursery while they were interred. What 
        is lacking is the direct link between these specific families. By creating 
        a composite of multiple family stories, based on true events we can illustrate 
        how people of different communities were able to assist each other during 
        times of adversity. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Composite stories based on historical 
        fiction can be powerful, but they require the site to have clear labels. 
        There are two additional components necessary to insure that the stories 
        retain their power and interest, and that visitors understand that they 
        are exploring historical composites. It is fundamental to have extensive 
        online bibliographies along with descriptive labels throughout the sites 
        informing visitors about the content </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Style and Content</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">One of the issues relating to the actual 
        design is whether or not each partner will use the same visual template. 
        We want to create an illusion of the experience of visiting peoplesí homes, 
        so specific graphics and designs are created by the individual partner 
        that best reflect the sensibility of the community. The key issue is that 
        there must be a thematic continuity to site content. This requires creating 
        a structural template to insure that each partnerís site contains the 
        essential to the creation of contextual links.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Technology</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Our first concern is to make this site 
        as accessible to both visitors and to partner institutions. It is an unfortunate 
        aspect of the non-profit world that not all institutions have the technology 
        or infrastructure to participate in this project. For this reason, we 
        have chosen to begin development with several local institutions that 
        have a basic level of technology, a presence on the web and are enthusiastic 
        about the idea. To keep storage requirements minimal the initial family 
        stories are relatively small, and the contextual links are limited. We 
        also decided to keep the design relatively simple to allow for a greater 
        number of visitors using older browsers and systems. As we develop content, 
        infrastructure and methodology, our stories and links will also grow, 
        as will the introduction of more sophisticated forms of media (video, 
        audio). Plans exist for outreach to other institutions that have entry 
        level technology to assist them with increasing the capabilities of their 
        systems and helping them develop a more solid web presence.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Future Growth</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal"><i><span class="normal">Grandfatherís 
        Virtual Kitchen</span></i> is being built in components. 
        This will optimize the ability to expand the stories as associations with 
        new partner institutions develop. Additionally, discussions have begun 
        about school outreach programs, so those students can research and create 
        their own family stories and links (between schools and other institutions).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">It is our 
        hope that <i>Grandfatherís Virtual Kitchen</i> will evolve along with 
        technology. In time, there will be web-casts about cultural events and 
        real-time discussions or moderated chat-rooms to share stories and ask 
        questions. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">We believe that the stories of families 
        and immigrants are a vital component of the American experience. These 
        stories teach real-life lessons about tolerance, understanding and respect 
        that can be applied to communities around the world. Additionally, the 
        method of contextual links and non-linear narrative provides a dynamic 
        mechanism for story telling that makes the user an active participant 
        in exploring. It is not necessary to worry about a virtual grandfather 
        in a virtual kitchen replacing a real grandfather in a real kitchen. It 
        is difficult, if not impossible to replace the spontaneity and vitality 
        of an actual storyteller. But, virtual grandfather can emulate the story-telling 
        experience in a manner that captures the essence of a story and experience. 
        By using the web to tell these stories, the visitor base increases exponentially 
        and the audience expands from the local to the global. The thousands or 
        millions of visitors will share in the journeys through cyberspace while 
        being entertained and educated about the uniqueness of individuals along 
        with the shared experiences of the communities.</p>
