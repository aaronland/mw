      <p class="heading"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The traditional educational process requires school 
	buildings, teachers, textbooks and students. The possibilities within 
	this traditional structure are well documented. Whether this process leads 
	to the most effective education has been subject to endless research and 
	debate. Non-traditional educational institutions such as libraries and 
	museums as well as extra-curricular groups like the Girl Scouts and Boy 
	Scouts have always supplemented traditional education by using more field-based, 
	experiential techniques. These non-traditional institutions have found 
	that many of their programs can be enriched or expanded by developing 
	a well-designed, customized Internet component. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Interactive Knowledge, an e-learning company based 
	in Charlotte has partnered with a number of local and national non-profit 
	organizations to create innovative programs that help meet their institutional 
	education goals. </span></p>

	these projects. </span></p>

      <p class="heading"><b>PROJECT DETAILS ñ Case Study 1: CraftingïNorthCarolina</b></p>
      <p><b><span class="normal">What is it?</span></b><span class="normal"> CraftingïNorthCarolina 
        is an interactive, multimedia web site designed for fourth graders studying 
        North Carolina history. This project focuses on the Mint Museum of Craft 
        + Designís collection of North Carolina crafts and art, using these materials 
        as a springboard for lessons in history. The web site combines video, 
        audio, photographs and a wide variety of interactive exercise. Students 
        use this site to better understand how utilitarian objects can tell the 
        story of how people lived.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>How was it developed?</b> ñ CraftingïNorthCarolina 
        is a large-scale web site that was developed over a two-year period. The 
        project began with a series of planning meetings convened by the Mint 
        Museum of Art&#39;s Education Department. The team included Mint curatorial 
        staff, web developers and elementary school social studies and art teachers. 
        This group drafted the instructional goals of the project and agreed on 
        the most important aspects of the 4<sup>th</sup> grade North Carolina 
        history curriculum that could be enhanced by an interactive web site. 
        Once the goals were set, the instructional design, content and graphic 
        look of the site were developed by the Museumís education staff and the 
        web developer. After the site was designed, it was tested in several classroom 
        before being rolled out to the state.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>What&#39;s included in the site?</b> ñ The Crafting.NorthCarolina 
        web site is organized into the following seven sections:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>1. Early North Carolina </b>ñ The arts and crafts 
        of North Carolina precede the arrival of white settlers. The Mint Museum 
        has collected ancient artifacts as well as the earliest art created by 
        travelers to the New World. This section of the web site is divided into 
        three areas. </span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Native Americans ñ A look at the crafts and cultures 
          of Native Americans who inhabited North Carolina before the arrival 
          of European settlers</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Explorers ñ Some of the early art generated as 
          part of the exploration of the New World</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Mapmakers ñ An introduction to the types and 
          variety of maps of North Carolina that were produced during the European 
          settlement of the region</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>2. 250 Years of Clay </b>ñ Crafts are defined 
        as useful objects that have been created with such care and precision 
        as to become works of art. This section of the web site follows the progression 
        of techniques and uses of pottery from 1750 through the present. Students 
        are introduced to four tour guides who demonstrate both the utilitarian 
        and aesthetic uses of pottery during four distinct eras:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">1750-1850: Pottery in Colonial NC </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">1860-1900: Pottery During and After the Civil 
          War </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">1900-1940: Hand Made vs. Machine Made </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">1940 ñ Today: Pottery as Art </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>3. Whatís the Use? </b>ñ This section concentrates 
        on the important uses of a wide variety of pottery and other craft objects 
        that have been replaced over the years by modern conveniences. This section 
        is organized into two interactive games:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">The Farmerís Kitchen ñ Students are asked to 
          match modern objects found in the kitchen with objects a farmerís family 
          would have used 200 years ago.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">ëRound the House ñ Students are asked to guess 
          the uses of fifteen very peculiar pottery items that have fallen out 
          of use in modern America</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>4. From the Land</b><i> </i>ñ One important reason 
        why North Carolina has always been home to artists and craftspeople is 
        the wealth of raw materials available to work with. This section looks 
        at the natural resources available to North Carolina artists and the products 
        that have been created from them. This very informative and interactive 
        activity asks students to find specific objects hidden in four collages 
        ñ one for each of the following materials: cotton, wood, clay, and animals.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>5. Making Pots </b>ñ North Carolina has a long 
        tradition of families who have passed their craft from one generation 
        to the next. In this section, students meet Travis Owen, a sixth grader 
        and sixth generation potter from Seagrove, North Carolina. Travis describes 
        (with video stills and audio) the eight basic steps of making a pot and 
        introduces the work of his family spanning back to the early 1800s.</span></p>
      <ol start="6">
        <li><span class="normal"><b>Letís Go! </b>ñ This section of the site allows 
          students to visit the studios of four</span></li>

        were like as 4<sup>th</sup> graders and how they became interested in 
        the arts. Students get a chance to look around the place and hear from 
        the artists what it is like to create art that has been purchased by institutions 
        such as the Smithsonian, the Renwick Gallery and the Mint Museum of Craft 
        + Design. Tour stops include:</span></p>

      <p><span class="normal"><b>7. Look @ Gallery</b> ñ Students are always inspired 
        by the arts and crafts they see while visiting museums and galleries. 
        Viewing and experiencing art brings about a desire to create art. This 
        section follows students who get their chance to learn more about art 
        from North Carolina artists and then make their own. Photo documentaries 
        follow craft-artists as they instruct students on how to make face jugs, 
        hand-built clay animals, and create environmental drawings. A gallery 
        of student work is included. Lessons plans for each experience are provided 
        in the teacher section of the site. </span></p>

      <p class="heading"><b>PROJECT DETAILS ñ Case Study 2: The African American 
        Album Vol. II</b></p>
      <p><b><span class="normal">What is it? </span></b><span class="normal">ñ 
        The African American Album, Vol. II is a multimedia showcase of photographs, 
        video footage, oral histories, music, archival newspaper articles, narratives, 
        and maps of areas razed by urban renewal. The program includes an extensive 
        timeline of events of both national and local significance; a series of 
        topics related to the African American communityís heritage; a detailed 
        exploration of a large neighborhood of homes, churches and businesses 
        that have disappeared due to urban renewal in the 60s and 70s; and a collection 
        of photographs spanning five decades of family life, work, celebrations 
        and faith.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>How was it developed?</b> ñ The web site began 
        as a CD-ROM project in 1996. The Public Library of Charlotte and Mecklenburg 
        Countyís (PLCMC) awarding-winning Virtual Library coordinated the project. 
        The Library hired a project director, contracted with a multimedia firm 
        and created a advisory committee of community leaders to oversee the project. 
        After months of research, planning and development the CD was released 
        in 1998. Due to the popularity of this program and the growing interest 
        by the PLCMC to develop web-based content, the Library requested the multimedia 
        firm that developed the CD create an identical version of the program 
        for its web site. The African American Album Vol. 2 (AAA Vol. 2) was developed 
        for the web over a 14 month period and completed in 1999. All of the content, 
        including the video and audio files are included in this very large web 
        site.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>What&#39;s included in the site?</b> ñ The content 
        in the AAA Vol. 2 is organized into the following four sections:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>1. Events </b>ñ <i>A timeline of the African 
        American community in Charlotte from the 1940s to the present.</i> Visitors 
        to this section first choose a decade from 1940 to the present. Dozens 
        of events are included in each of the decades. The events are represented 
        on the timeline with a caption and often with a thumbnail photograph. 
        Clicking on the thumbnail, brings up a new page with a larger version 
        of the photo and more information. Archival video and audio files are 
        used throughout this section. The timeline follows a number of local storylines 
        including the desegregation of Charlotte schools and the landmark Supreme 
        Court ruling that lead to busing students in order to integrate all local 
        schools.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>2. Places</b> ñ <i>A virtual reconstruction of 
        Brooklyn, a large African American neighborhood in downtown Charlotte 
        that was razed in the 1960s as part of the urban renewal movement.</i> 
        Brooklyn was the center of life for much of the African American community 
        in Charlotte from the 1800s until the 1960s. Hundreds of businesses and 
        families were forced to move to other parts of the city when urban renewal 
        caused the destruction of over 95% of all the buildings in a large area 
        a few blocks east of downtown. On the AAA Vol. 2 web site, the neighborhood 
        is carefully reconstructed using insurance maps, city directories and 
        hundreds of archival photographs. Additional information about Cherry, 
        an African American neighborhood that survived urban renewal, helps put 
        the loss of Brooklyn into perspective.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>3. Keepsakes </b>ñ <i>A collection of memorable 
        photographs of the African American community.</i> Visitors to this section 
        of the web site can choose from four distinct albums of photographs that 
        span six decades in Charlotte:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">&#34;Social Gatherings&#34; celebrates the 
          social clubs, weddings and business gatherings of the community.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">&#34;Community Life&#34; is a collection of 
          famous and ordinary people captured in the process of living their lives. 
          These photos range from portraits of janitors to professional athletes 
          and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">&#34;Portraits&#34; is organized as a portrait 
          gallery. Visitors can click on thumbnail portraits to see a full screen 
          version of the picture and background information on subject.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">&#34;The Stroudís Family Album&#34; is an outstanding 
          oral history featuring two leaders in the local community, Gerson and 
          Daisy Stroud. This section is divided into eight stories from their 
          lives. Visitors can hear the Strouds describe events from the WWII to 
          the present while viewing photographs from their family album.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>4. Heritage</b><i> ñ An in-depth look at several 
        of the most important institutions in the African American community.</i> 
        Visitors to this section of the web site can choose from four themes that 
        have played a important role in the development of the black community:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">&#34;Visit Charlotteís Churches&#34; is an 
          interactive treatment of an article titled, &#34;Rock of Ages&#34; 
          that was originally published in the <i>Charlotte Observer</i>. The 
          article is enhanced with dozens of archival photographs of local churches 
          and congregations.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">&#34;Experience the First Day of Desegregation&#34; 
          follows four African American children in September 1957 when they attempt 
          to attend previously all white schools. This dramatic section of the 
          web site includes photographs taken throughout that day and video footage 
          of one of the students, Dorothy Counts.</span></li>

          in this section are four short interviews in video format that feature 
          teachers and students remembering these schools.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">&#34;Explore Beatties Ford Road&#34; offers 
          an insider look at one of the most important areas for the community 
          following urban renewal. This section of the web site is based on a

      <p><b><span class="normal">What is it? </span></b><span class="normal">ñ 
        The Five Faiths Project is a multi year effort by the Education Department 
        of the Ackland Art Museum at the University of North Carolina at Chapel 
        Hill. The project combines original works of art from the museum&#39;s collection, 
        photographs, storytelling and community events to introduce information 
        about the world religions of Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity 
        and Islam. The goal of this project is to help people explore the diverse 
        religious communities that are present in North Carolina. The Five Faiths 
        Project web site offers a compelling look at five religious communities 
        in North Carolina from several different perspectives. This web site is 
        an interim step toward a much more expansive site that is being proposed 
        to public and private funding sources by the Ackland staff.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>How was it developed?</b> ñ The Five Faith Project 
        was begun by Ray Williams, Direction of Education at the Ackland Museum 
        of Art in 1996. The project hired nationally renowned photographer Wendy 
        Ewald to work with youth from five faith communities across NC. This resulted 
        in the 1999 Visions of Faith travelling exhibit. Storyteller Louise Kessel 
        worked with adults to gather and share stories from each faith community. 
        This resulted in several public performances and an audio-tape. In 1999 
        a multimedia development firm began working with the Ackland to design 
        a web site that could capture all the excitement of the project and allow 
        it to experienced by a larger audience. The web site plan has two phases. 
        Phase one resulted in a prototype site that offers a rich overview of 
        the Five Faiths project. Phase two is for a larger more complete educational 
        tool. Presently the Ackland&#39;s Development Department is using the prototype 
        site to secure private and public funding.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>What&#39;s included in the site?</b> ñ The phase 
        one prototype of the site contains a rich sampling of the components that

        Collaborative Web site</b></p>
      <p><b><span class="normal">What is it? </span></b><span class="normal">ñ 
        The Cultural Education Collaborative (CEC) is a non-profit organization 
        that supports the arts and science educational programming in Charlotte. 
        The organization is a funded partner of the Charlotte Arts and Science 
        council and works closely with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System. 
        This web site is their first attempt to use the Internet as a way to accomplish 
        the following:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Explain the CECís mission and purpose in the 
          arts and sciences community</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Introduce the 32 cultural organizations affiliated 
          with the CEC</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Provide up-to-date information on the arts and 
          science programming available through the CECís affiliates</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Offer on-line forms and instructions for applying 
          for five CEC sponsored grants.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Provide interactive guides for evaluating arts 
          and science programming in your school.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Describe professional development content for 
          both school and community based educators.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Offer a wide variety of resources including links 
          to other arts and science related sites (local and national), technical 
          help for grants and planning and information on North Carolina grade 
          level standards.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>How was it developed?</b> ñ The Cultural Education 
        Collaborative contacted a e-learning firm to help design a web site that 
        was more than a brochure. They wanted something that had real functionality 
        and provided an important service to the community. The resulting site 
        offers the public a database of program offering for children and youth, 
        on-line grant forms and guidelines for cultural organizations that tie 
        in with the organization&#39;s databases, resources and services for field 
        professionals. The multimedia firm is working with Anderson Consulting 
        who is providing an in-kind donation to develop one of the databases. 
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>What&#39;s included in the site?</b> The CEC web 
        site is made up of five major areas, including:</span></p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="normal"><b>About CEC </b>ñ A section that explains the 
          vision and mission of the CEC. This section will also contain press 
          releases and FAQS.</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>2. Cultural 411</b> ñ A database of arts, science, 
        and heritage organizations that provide educational programming</span></p>
      <p> <span class="normal"><b>3. Get Involved</b> ñ A searchable database 
        of hundreds of programs available to schools and to the public. Parents 
        and teachers can use this feature to pinpoint specific opportunities for 
        arts and sciences programs based on criteria such as the type of program 
        when the program takes place, the age level of the participants or whether 
        the program takes place inside or outside of a school facility.</span></p>
      <p> <span class="normal"><b>4. Services</b> ñ Information about funding, 
        evaluation, and professional development for field professionals </span></p>
      <p> <span class="normal"><b>5. Resources</b> ñ Information about consulting

      <p class="heading"><b>PROJECT DETAILS ñ Case Study 5: DigIt! web site</b></p>
      <p><b><span class="normal">What is it? </span></b><span class="normal">ñ 
        Dig-It! is an interactive exploration of pre-Columbian Latin American 
        cultures that introduces young learners to several facets of Aztec, Maya 
        and Inca life. The software uses text, audio, colorful graphics, animation 
        and digitized photographs of objects in the Mint Museum of Artís collection. 
        The product was originally developed to be distributed on diskette, but 
        is currently available for viewing on the web as a ShockWave file or it 
        can be downloaded for Macintosh or Windows operating systems. Dig-It! 
        can be used by students before or after visiting the Mint Museum to participate 
        in a class field trip. Now that Dig-It! is on the Mintís web site, the 
        program can be used by anyone interested in Pre-Columbian art or culture.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>How was it developed?</b> ñ The Education department 
        of the Mint Museum of Art contacted an e-learning firm to design a multimedia 
        piece that 5<sup>th</sup> grade class could use before attending a museum 
        tour. All 5<sup>th</sup> graders in Charlotte Mecklenburg tour the Mint&#39;s 
        pre-Columbian exhibit. The software is an integral part of the museum&#39;s 
        D.I.G.S. program (Deciphering and Investigating Great Societies) which 
        integrates the museum&#39;s collection into the 5<sup>th</sup> grade social 
        studies curriculum. The software was tested in 1996 and distributed on 
        diskettes to all the 5<sup>th</sup> grade classes in the school system. 
        The program has been so successful that it has been made available to 
        all elementary schools in NC. In 1999 the Mint decided to make DigIt! 
        part of it&#39;s on-line learning offerings and now provide a Shockwave and 
        downloadable version.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>What&#39;s included in the site?</b> ñ Dig-It! presents 
        its content in eight bite sized sections:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>1. Introduction</b> - The Introduction uses interactive 
        maps and timelines to allow the student to see when and where the Aztec, 
        Maya and Inca societies thrived. A current map of North, Central and South 
        America is also provided. A menu of seven additional activities is available 
        at the end of this section.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>2. Digging the Past ñ Archeology</b><i> </i>Students 
        are introduced to the field of archeology and presented with a broken 
        artifact (a 6<sup>th</sup> century incensario) that needs to be put back 
        together, named and cataloged.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>3. Dressed for Success: Ancient Clothing</b> 
        - Students read about the hand woven textiles of ancient Mesoamerica and 
        learn about pre-Columbian fashions by clicking on descriptions of clothing 
        worn by life-like statues.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>4. Whatís for Lunch?: Food-n-Drink </b><i>- </i>This 
        section investigates the diet of pre-Columbian cultures by interacting 
        with a menu in &#34;The A-Maize-ing Café.&#34; Students also 
        get to see and read about several work of art that were inspired by or 
        used to create the local cuisine.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>5. The Setting Sun: Jaguars - </b>This section 
        touches on the religious practices of these cultures and describes how 
        the jaguar was deified. Three works of art that use jaguar images are 
        featured.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>6. The Incredible Journey: Burial Practices - 
        </b>Students are introduced to burial practices and beliefs in this section 
        of Dig-It! By moving their mouse through a burial maze, students can uncover 
        buried treasure or run into thieves.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>7. Can We Talk?: Hieroglyphs</b> - This section 
        features the written language of the Maya. Glyphs are featured on a wide 
        variety of Mayan art. This section examines two plates that each tell 
        a story once you understand the language. Students use their mouse to 
        uncover clues and learn how to count using the Mayan system of numbers.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>8. Happy Ever After?: Review and Conclusion</b> 
        - This final section tests students understanding of the art and concepts 
        presented in Dig-It! There are two interactive games used to review the 
        content. Artifact Intelligence is a matching game in which students drag 
        photographs of art to their matching descriptions. Llena los Espacios 
        (Fill in the Blanks) is a critical thinking exercise that helps students 
        learn how these civilizations were destroyed.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">As you can see from these five case studies, the 
        Internet can help museums, schools, libraries, and other cultural organizations 
        achieve things that were impossible a few years ago. These include using 
        the Internet to: </span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Provide educational background and contemporary 
          connection to a museum&#39;s collection</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Promote exhibits and special projects</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Prepare students for museum tours</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Integrate the arts into the classroom</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Provide the community with information about 
          cultural offerings</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Provide teachers with lesson plans and information 
          on how to use technology in the classroom</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Enlighten the public on local heritage</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">The Internet has tremendous potential to help museums, 
        libraries, schools and other cultural organizations achieve their missions. 
        The web can provide assess to allow the public to interact and explore 
        new worlds and broaden personal horizons.</span></p>
