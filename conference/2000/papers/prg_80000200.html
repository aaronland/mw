      <p class="heading"><b>Can Your Web Site Go the Distance? Integrating the 
	Web to make distance learning programs go further</b></p>
      <p class="author"><b>David T. Schaller, Educational Web Adventures LLP and 
	Chris Tower, Bell Museum of Natural History, University of Minnesota, 
	USA</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
	<p class="small">How can museum distance-learning programs incorporate 
	  the Web into their programs? In recent years, the University of Minnesota 
	  Bell Museum of Natural History&#39;s Bell LIVE! program has used the Web 
	  both to enhance its program and increase its marketing efforts. By developing 
	  content-rich online resources and activities, such as eco-games, nature 
	  field guides, and discussion forums, Bell LIVE! attracts thousands of 
	  potential new subscribers to its Web site each month, while serving 
	  its educational mission. Bell LIVE!ís experience is relevant to museums 
	  as well, since its approachógiving Web visitors a tasty appetizer to 
	  lure them to the main courseócan serve as both marketing and outreach 
	  for exhibits and other programs.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">Distance-learning programs are becoming increasingly 
	common at museums. Not everyone can physically get to the museumómany 
	factors, including the cost of a field trip (always increasing), school 
	bus shortages, and time limitations all conspire to keep students away. 
	So museums must bring their educational message and programs to their 
	audience. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Distance learning programs share one key characteristic 
	with the Webóthey offer virtual experiences, since they are often presented 
	via television through interactive TV networks, satellite broadcasts and 
	teleconferencing. So the Web is well-suited to be integrated into these 
	programs and used as a distance delivery method in itself. This paper 
	will look at how the Web can be used to enhance and be integrated into 
	a distance learning program with dual goals: to further the educational 
	mission of the program, and to help market the program to new audiences.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">While our focus here is a distance-learning program, 
	we think these examples and lessons could easily be applied to museum 
	exhibits, since the goals are much the same--to give your Web visitors 
	a tasty appetizer in hopes of luring them to the main course, whether 
	it&#39;s the subscription program or an exhibit.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Bell LIVE! and educational outreach</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Bell LIVE! was developed to solve two educational 
	problems. First, science programs in upper elementary and middle schools 
	do not always have the tools to engage students in science that is relevant 
	and meaningful to their lives. Secondly, there is a lack of resources 
	for school field trips and an unequal distribution of who gets to visit 
	natural areas and science centers. Access to real research by scientists 
	is not always available to make the connection to this group of students 
	so that they can realize that science can be a viable option for a career. 
	Many middle school students lose interest in science at this time in their 
	lives due to the perception that science is hard and has no relevance 
	to their lives.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Minnesota IDEALS (<a href="http://www.umn.edu/bellmuse/mnideals">http://www.umn.edu/bellmuse/mnideals</a>) 
	at the Bell Museum of Natural History produces a curriculum and electronic 
	field trip called Bell LIVE! This program provides a solution to the above 
	problems. Through three hours of live satellite broadcasts, interactive 
	Internet components, and a comprehensive curriculum, Bell LIVE! links 
	schools and other organizations to places where discoveries are made and 
	real research takes place. It allows students the chance to participate 
	in live environmental studies that can make an impact on their lives and 
	future. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Bell LIVE! takes students and teachers on a live 
	science expedition. Along the way, students are able to apply what they 
	have learned in the classroom from a hands-on inquiry based curriculum 
	to a live scientific broadcast. During the live satellite broadcast, students 
	are able to interact with the researchers through live telephone calls, 
	e-mails, discussion boards and faxes. The students are able exchange data 
	and ask the researchers questions. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In the past few years, Bell LIVE! has turned to 
	the Web with a dual purpose: to extend and enhance its educational program, 
	and to help market the program to potential subscribers. In many ways, 
	we can kill two birdsóor rather, provide a healthy habitat for two speciesówith 
	one Web site. We&#39;re providing our audience of teachers and students with 
	high-quality, interactive educational programmingóand what better way 
	to attract new subscribers than by letting them experience that programming 
	first-hand? That&#39;s why we decided to keep the entire site free, rather 
	than restricting it to subscribers as many other distance-learning Web 
	sites do.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Enhancing Bell LIVE!s educational program with the 
	Web</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The primary goal was to create a Web site that complemented 
	the curriculum and broadcast while offering educational resources that 
	could only exist the Webóto offer things that would be impossible to offer 
	in any other medium. We didn&#39;t want to give away the storeóthe broadcast 
	and curriculumóbut we did want to give people a strong reason to go to 
	the Web site and enhance their educational experience.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">So we had several educational goals for the Web 
	site:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">1) Offer additional information resources about 
	the topic;</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">2) Give students a way to communicate with each 
	other, and with our</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">scientist researchers;</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">3) Create valid educational activities that were 
	interactive, in-depth and immersive.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">What did we develop to reach these goals? A set 
	of Web-based resources and activities that extends and enhances the educational 
	goals of each yearís broadcast. Our &#34;On the Prairie&#34; site (<a href="http://www.umn.edu/bellmuse/mnideals/prairie">http://www.umn.edu/bellmuse/mnideals/prairie</a>) 
	was launched last summer in conjunction with our 1999 program. We will 
	focus mainly on this site, although we will also examine our efforts in 
	the preceding year to show the evolution of our goals and methods.</span></p>
      <p><img src="schaller_fig1.gif" width="400" height="404"/></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><i>Figure 1: On the Prairie home page<br/>
	<a href="http://www.umn.edu/bellmuse/mnideals/prairie">http://www.umn.edu/bellmuse/mnideals/prairie</a></i></p>
      <p align="CENTER"></p>
      <p><span class="normal">&#34;On the Prairie&#34; offers a variety of resources 
	and activities designed to meet the above goals:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">1) Additional information resources. Although the 
	curriculum was 200 pages long, there were still many things we could not 
	include in it because of cost or the nature of the print medium itself. 
	For example, the curriculum examines Native American life on the prairie, 
	and we wanted to help students learn a bit about the Ojibwe language. 
	But a pronunciation guide is cumbersome for students. So we created an 
	audio pronunciation guide on the Webóclick on a word to hear it pronounced. 
	The Field Guide was something else we couldnít have done in the curriculumótoo 
	many pictures, too many pagesóbut on the Web it works well and, even better, 
	integrates nicely with the Build-A-Prairie game.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">2) Student interactionóstudent-to-student and student-to-researcher. 
	A key feature of Bell LIVE! is the opportunity for students to ask questions 
	of scientists during the live broadcast. We wanted to expand this interaction 
	in several ways:</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">allow students to communicate directly with other 
	  students around the country;</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">allow students to communicate with the scientists 
	  in additional settings</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">than the live broadcast;</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">allow students to ask us questions before and 
	  after the one-hour broadcast.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">Web technology is perfectly suited for these one-to-one 
	interactions. We developed a Water Quality Database, where students can 
	input data form their field studies and compare it with data from other 
	students around the country. Some classes hundreds of miles apart even 
	collaborated on their field studies, incorporating each otherís results 
	into their lessons.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">We rented a chat room for a month and held a series 
	of live chats with our researchers, giving students a more relaxed and 
	in-depth opportunity to talk with the scientists. Chat rooms are very 
	inexpensive to rent and easily modified to meet your specific needs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">We implemented a bulletin board forum so all students 
	ask their questions for weeks before and after the broadcast day, extending 
	the interactions into a month-long period. There are many types of bulletin 
	board programs, but most are cheap and easily set up.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">2) Online educational experiences. The Web has the 
	potential to be even more powerful and effective than television as an 
	educational medium. We wanted to start exploring and exploiting that capability 
	by creating online educational <i>experiences</i>, not just resources.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The power of the Web as an educational medium is 
	that it gives the user control over her experience. This has long been 
	exploited by hypertext linking, allowing users to navigate through the 
	material according to their interests. But the Web offers many greater 
	opportunities for active learning, through the use of simulations and 
	similar types of games that let users explore the subject, evaluate information 
	and images, and make decisions in order to accomplish a goal.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Our first attempt was for the 1998 program about 
	watersheds. We developed an ecosystem management game called The Watershed 
	Game. (<a href="http://www.umn.edu/bellmuse/mnideals/watershed/watershed2.html">http://www.umn.edu/bellmuse/mnideals/watershed/watershed2.html</a>) 
	This game asks students to choose the best management practices for a 
	range of situations and environments within a single watershed. The answers 
	are weighted, rather than being strictly right or wrong, to show the trade-offs 
	implicit in ecosystem. management. Student choices are scored, so the 
	game also serves as an evaluation tool for teachers. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Overall it worked pretty well, particularly in the 
	way it took advantage of the Web&#39;s capability to track individual users 
	choices. However, it didnít take advantage of the Webís other strengths 
	as immersive, interactive hypermedia. For one thing, it was at its core 
	simply a multiple-choice testóand it looked like it. We managed to photograph 
	or create an image for each management situation, but even so, the game 
	remains an illustrated multiple choice test. Students have no idea how 
	well theyíre doing until they finish each section, and thereís little 
	sense that this is an ongoing management simulation, a la SimCity.</span></p>

	<a href="http://www.umn.edu/bellmuse/mnideals/prairie/build">http://www.umn.edu/bellmuse/mnideals/prairie/build</a></i></p>
      <p><span class="normal">For the 1999 program about prairie ecology, we developed 
	another gameóBuild-a-Prairieóas part of the &#34;On the Prairie&#34; 
	Web site. (<i><a href="http://www.umn.edu/bellmuse/mnideals/prairie/build">http://www.umn.edu/bellmuse/mnideals/prairie/build</a></i>) 
	The goal for this game was to encourage students to learn about prairie 
	species and habitats. We decided to use a decision-making approach, like 
	the Watershed Game: The student takes on the challenge of restoring a 
	healthy prairie by choosing the best plants and animals. But we wanted 
	to do several key things differently:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">First, we wanted to create more of a goal-oriented 
	activity to give students something to do, something to accomplish. The 
	Web isnít naturally suited for true constructivist learning activities, 
	but we wanted students to have the sense that they were involved in a 
	scientific endeavoróin this case, the prairie restoration process. Hence 
	the title: Build-A-Prairie, and the structure of the game.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Second, rather than selecting one best answer out 
	of a choice of four or five, students must choose the four best prairie 
	species out of a set of six. This is far more complicated task, and much 
	less susceptible to guesswork, so most students refer to the integrated 
	Field Guide to the Prairie, where theyíll find the answers. While this 
	may seem like an easy shortcut, it actually accomplishes our goal - we 
	<i>wanted</i> them to browse the Field Guide, and the game gives them 
	a goal-oriented reason to do so. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">And third, we wanted this game to be much more rewarding 
	visually than the Watershed Game had been. We wanted to show students 
	the beauty of the prairieóespecially since itís one of the less appreciated 
	landscapes. To this end, we created beautiful and scientifically-accurate 
	animations for every step in the game. Choose the right combination of 
	plants and watch those plants grow up out of the ground. Choose the right 
	combination of birds and watch those birds fly and walk into the prairie. 
	These animations are simply feedback, but they help the student feel she 
	is part of the scene. And the illustrations are far more effective than 
	photographs in expressing the behavior and charm of prairie plants and 
	animals</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Of course, Build-A-Prairie has its weaknesses. Itís 
	still a form of multiple-choice test, rather than a true simulation revealing 
	a complex web of choices and consequences. Because students canít progress 
	in the game until they answer correctly, thereís no opportunity to let 
	the consequences of their choices play outóto watch the prairie overrun 
	by quack grass and Argentine ants, for example. We considered this option, 
	since it would create a richer and less linear experience for the students. 
	We decided against it for several reasons:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">1) By letting a series of poor choices stack up, 
	we couldnít offer step-by-step interpretation, so the gameís conclusion 
	would have to carry the burden of all the interpretation. Yet by the time 
	students have finished the game, they may not remember (or care) about 
	their choice of forbs or herps earlier.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">3) For better or worse, our priority was for students 
	to learn the contentóprairie plants and animalsórather than experiment 
	with ecosystem dynamics.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">2) A true simulation would make the game much more 
	complex, and we simply didnít have the budget for such an ambitious project 
	(in fact, we didnít have the budget for what we did do).</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Marketing Bell LIVE! with the Web site</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The future of Bell LIVE! depends on it becoming 
	more self-sustaining. The registrations of the satellite broadcast must 
	eventually cover at least fifty percent of the production costs. To achieve 
	this, we have to go beyond traditional marketing efforts, such as direct 
	mail, conference exhibits, face-to-face school presentations, trade publication 
	advertising, and distribution of informational videos. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Bell LIVE!ís educational target audience is fourth- 
	through eighth-grade students throughout the United States and Canada, 
	with a heavy concentration on our own backyard, Minnesota. Therefore, 
	our target audience is the teachers and administrators of these students. 
	This is, of course, a huge market to attract with a limited budget. But, 
	as businesses around the world have discovered, the web offers an economical 
	way to reach tens of thousands or more people. So by offering exciting 
	educational opportunities for teachers and students, we hope to attract 
	more attention to Bell LIVE!ís curriculum and broadcasts. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Bell LIVE!ís marketing approach has focused on three 
	areas; goodwill marketing, e-mail lists and partnerships.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Goodwill Marketing</b></p>
      <p class="normal">Our online eco-games (the Watershed Game and Build-a-Prairie) 
	as well as our ecosystem field guides, water quality databases, chat sessions 
	and other online activities are all quality products that relate to our 
	core product, the curriculum and broadcasts. We have attempted to leverage 
	the appeal of these resources to take advantage of &#34;goodwill&#34; 
	marketing. In the past year, the JASON Project, Yahooligans, CyberSurfari, 
	and 4Kids.com (a popular feature in the Sunday comics) have all linked 
	to our eco-games. These sites have driven a substantial number of visitors 
	to our eco-games, raising our profile among our potential subscribers.</p>
      <p class="normal"><img src="schaller_fig3.gif" width="400" height="288"/></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><i>Figure 3: Visitation to Key Pages of 
	Minnesota IDEALS Web site</i></p>
      <p><span class="normal">As Figure 3 indicates, the eco-games are tremendously 
	more popular than our Minnesota IDEALS web site. Fewer than 1000 people 
	have visited the Minnesota IDEALS home page each month, while up to 8000 
	people per month have visited our eco-games. The peaks occur during the 
	Bell LIVE! and JASON (a related, national program) broadcasts, when many 
	thousands of students are focused on the curriculum. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Last spring, when we realized the disparity between 
	visitation to the home page and the Watershed Game, we modified the Watershed 
	Game home page so it would serve as an introduction to Minnesota IDEALS 
	in general as well as the game itself. This page, now called the Eco-Games 
	Gateway, continues to grow in popularity. A key tactic was to keep the 
	URL the same when we revised that page, becauseóas is the nature of the 
	Webóonce a URL is out there, the number of links to it will increase month-by-month. 
	Itís far more effective to continue promoting an existing URL than try 
	to seed the Web with a brand-new URL. Since last fall, the Eco-Games Gateway 
	has featured both the Watershed Game and Build-A-Prairie, as well as an 
	introduction to Minnesota IDEALS in general. As you can see, visitation 
	to the Eco-Games Gateway shows no correlation to either JASON or Bell 
	LIVE! broadcast periods, indicating we are reaching new audiences through 
	that page. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">We also are marketing our program on the Web in 
	more active ways. Once users have found our site, we want to take advantage 
	of the opportunity show them what our program is all about. Since Bell 
	LIVE! is a satellite-based broadcast program, we have digitized short 
	video clips and promos from past and upcoming broadcasts and put them 
	on the site to give visitors a taste of our actual program. These digital 
	video clips will become increasingly important marketing tools, since 
	they give potential subscribers a good look at the very core of Bell LIVE!, 
	the live broadcast. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">While video will remain the core of our program, 
	we understand that, for many users, video over the Web is not an ideal 
	medium. We are developing alternate promotional experiences to complement 
	the promo video that we typically produce and mail out each year. As of 
	this writing, this alternate promo is in the early stages of development, 
	but we hope to show it at our conference session.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Email for Promotion and Communication</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Email is the killer app of the Internet, and we 
	employ it in several ways on our Web site. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">First, we have a &#34;Recommend-It&#34; page, 
	where users can easily send an email to several friends or colleagues 
	recommending the Web site. Once installed, this script offers an effortless 
	way to spread the word about our Web site and our program. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Second, we solicit ideas and suggestions from the 
	public for upcoming programs. We are currently soliciting suggestions 
	for our 2000 program, A Superior Adventure, and we also receive comments, 
	suggestions, and the occasional correction about past program content. 
	</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">We have found this feedback to very helpful in regards 
	to what we can do better or differently and suggestions for content.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Our most active form of traditional marketing is 
	through direct mailings of brochures. We purchase certain mailing lists 
	in an effort to target key educators. Although this has been effective 
	for us, it can be very costly and can result in a lot of wasted mailing. 
	To supplement this effort, weíve created a mailing list about upcoming 
	programs. Teachers who are genuinely interested in our program can easily 
	sign up for it from the Web site. We just recently established this tool, 
	but it is already building up speed with a few inquiries each week. We 
	expect the list will grow rapidly this spring when teachers begin planning 
	for next year</span>.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Partnerships</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Partnerships are extremely important to Bell LIVE! 
	The high-quality content for the curriculum, the broadcast, and the eco-games 
	comes from educators, organizations and scientists in partnership with 
	the Bell Museum. These partnering organizations also help market Bell 
	LIVE! by promoting the program through their own educational channels, 
	and by linking to our site. Partnerships have included groups such as 
	the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife 
	Service, The Nature Conservancy, the JASON Project, various colleges and 
	universities involved in our programs, and program funding institutions. 
	Our eco-games and other resources have increased the appeal and utility 
	of our site to these organizations. For example, the JASON Project linked 
	to our Watershed Game during their 1999 program, drawing thousands of 
	students and teachers to our site each month last winter. Since this is 
	our target audience, it was a perfect demonstration of the importance 
	of these eco-games to our marketing strategy. These teachers and students 
	certainly wouldnít have come to our site without the attraction of the 
	game.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In short, weíve found that we can satisfy two needs 
	very effectively by developing these educational Web sites. Our eco-games 
	have raised our national profile substantially and introduced our program 
	to tens of thousands of potential subscribers, while simultaneously furthering 
	our educational mission. We believe that this confluence of education 
	and marketing willóand shouldógrow and spread in the coming years as the 
	Web secures its place as a vital, dynamic medium between schools and museums.</span></p>
