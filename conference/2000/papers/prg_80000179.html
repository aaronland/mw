      <p class="heading"><b>Bringing the object to the viewer: Multimedia techniques 
        for the scientific study of art</b></p>
      <p class="heading"><b class="author">Michael Douma, Institute for Dynamic 
        Educational Advancement and Michael Henchman, Brandeis University, USA</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote> <b> </b> 
        <p><span class="small">Often, topics can be taught online that are unteachable 
          in other media. One such topic is materials science and art -- an increasingly 
          popular topic for art museum visitors. This is a visual subject, which 
          requires visual materials for teaching and learning. Books, articles, 
          slides, videos are often unavailable, inaccessible or in an unuseable 
          form, and the physical nature of museum objects generally precludes 
          side-by-side comparisons. </span></p>
        <p><span class="small">To identify the underdrawing of a painting, one 
          must be able to superimpose infrared and normal photographs of the painting. 
          To authenticate a particular Greek kouros, one has to be able to view 
          it from all angles for comparison with authentic kouroi. Pictures in 
          books, and discreet kouroi in different museums will not accomplish 
          that. The material must be made available in a useful form. </span></p>
        <p><span class="small">We are now completing a 1 1/2 year project (an 
          NSF sponsored partnership between Brandeis and the National Gallery 
          of Art), for an interactive web site about Bellini&#39;s Feast of the Gods. 
          This exhibit should be online in late January. </span></p>
        <p><span class="small">Our exhibit, Investigating Bellini&#39;s Feast of the 
          Gods, considers a single painting. Within the period 1514-29, it was 
          painted and overpainted three times. Scientific data are presented, 
          enabling the viewer to reconstruct interactively the various versions 
          and reasons for the overpaintings. The viewer discovers the chemistry 
          of the pigments and their degradation, how the scientific investigation 
          was performed and how to identify the various painters. Uniquely the 
          exhibit allows the viewer to manipulate imagesómagnifying, superimposing, 
          and comparing. The painting is examined in great detail.</span></p>
        <p><span class="small">Our paper will address the specific technologies 
          and pedagogical approaches which we have used that may have direct application 
          to other art-and-science web sites. For example, a common challenge 
          is to make one exhibit that is useful to many different audiences. It 
          is important not to lower the common denominator too low, or the exhibit 
          will be useless for all. This is easier to accomplish in an online exhibit 
          than in a physical one because whole sections on a site can be geared 
          toward more knowledgeable visitors without disrupting the experience 
          for others. Another approach -- which has been very successful for us 
          -- has been to limit the scope of our subject matter. By focussing on 
          depth rather than breadth, often experts and non-experts alike are able 
          to wholly follow a narrow topic without being overwhelmed with too many 
          academic concepts. We are thus able to keep the level of sophistication 
          quite high.</span></p>
        <p></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">Increasingly, new scientific techniques are being 
        applied to the scientific study of art. These deliver an <i>embarras de 
        richesse</i> but the data are only useful if they are accessible to the 
        individual evaluator. How can one interpret an X-radiograph of a painting 
        unless one can compare the two images directly, in a situation where both 
        magnification and contrast can be varied? The availability of digital 
        images and their ready transmission over the Internet has provided an 
        exciting solution to this problem. Today, with convenient access to the 
        primary data, each one of us can render individual judgements on the pressing 
        issues of the moment. No longer are we limited by the printed page and 
        by the information fed to us by the <i>cognoscenti</i>. Instead, we are 
        open to the widest possible range of input from a complete spectrum of 
        attitudes and vantage points.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This new horizon is revolutionizing teaching and 
        learning. Hitherto, the medium of instruction in this visual field has 
        been the slide. The slide is the degraded image of another degraded image 
        ó a figure in a book. Comparing a painting with its X-radiograph was then 
        a comparison between two doubly degraded images. It is difficult to evaluate 
        what can be accomplished thereby. Worse, the comparison is often only 
        a fleeting instant in a lecture, incapable of being recalled by the audience. 
        Comparison of singly degraded image within in a book, is subject to a 
        different limitation. One will be on one page; and the other, in general, 
        will be on another.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">We were brought face to face with this <i>impasse</i> 
        when teaching a course on the scientific aspects of art to students of 
        Fine Arts (art historians and studio artists) at Brandeis University. 
        We were delighted to be able to use, as a central case study for the course, 
        the remarkable restoration and investigation of the painting, dating from 
        1529, <i>The Feast of the Gods</i> from the National Gallery of Art in 
        Washington, D.C. For fifty years it had been known that this sensational 
        painting held beneath its surface evidence of an unusual complexity. But 
        it was only in the late eighties that investigative techniques became 
        sufficiently developed that the interior of the painting could be explored. 
        The ultimate success of the project, which took five years, was due to 
        the extraordinary skill of the two people responsible ó David Bull, head 
        of restoration at the NGA, and the late Joyce Plesters, head of conservation 
        science at the National Gallery, London. Based on three types of physical 
        evidence ó an X-radiograph, an infrared reflectograph and 22 paint cross 
        sections ó they were able to establish that <i>The Feast of the Gods</i> 
        had not one paint layer but three. They were then able to map the two 
        underlying layers, thereby revealing how the painting would have appeared 
        in 1514 and 1522 according to the two artists responsible, Giovanni Bellini 
        and Dosso Dossi, respectively.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This fascinating &#34;archaeological dig&#34; 
        has been documented extensively in a monograph published by the NGA and 
        in a delightful film made by the award-winning director David Sutherland. 
        While this ó the account, the interpretation and the background ó could 
        not have been of higher quality, it did not and could not provide us with 
        the evidence we needed to make the complete scientific case. We needed 
        to be able to superimpose the X-radiograph, the infrared reflectograph 
        and a detailed image of the picture. Whereas Bull and Plesters had had 
        continuing microscopic access to the picture, we did not. We therefore 
        required images which were almost as well defined as the picture itself. 
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">We not only needed the scientific data in great 
        detail, we needed it in a form for students to be able to use for their 
        own interpretations. Their need is to be able to manipulate the data at 
        will, to use the data first to formulate hypotheses and then again subsequently 
        to validate or invalidate them. We realized that Bull and Plestersí data 
        were only of use to us if it could be manipulated Ö and we were astonishingly 
        fortunate that David Bull supplied us with raw data which we could then 
        digitize.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In presenting the data in a form suitable for students 
        to interpret, the challenge has been, on the one hand, not to direct that 
        interpretation while, on the other, providing enough background ó about 
        the painting, the period, the structure of paintings, the technique of 
        painting and the scientific methods of investigation. More discussion 
        of this is given below. We were particularly concerned, as scientists, 
        to school our artist students in the types of (scientific) statements 
        which the data would allow us and in the types which the data would not. 
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Finally there was the question of the form in which 
	the digital data should be transmitted to our students and to other teachers 
	of other students. Three years ago, we were convinced that the proper 
	medium was the CD-ROM. We did not anticipate instant wealth but projected 
	an income sufficient to cover costs. At that time there were still publishers 
	marketing CD-ROMís of appropriate quality but in the subsequent three 
	years, that situation has changed. Moreover we now realize that we could 
	have never even recovered the necessary image licensing costs. It is now 
	therefore available at no cost on the internet &lt;<i><a href="http://www.webexhibits.org/feast">http://www.webexhibits.org/feast</a></i>&gt;.

      <p class="heading"><b>Specific techniques</b></p>
      <p class="normal">We have successfully utilized a number of techniques for 
        visualization that have direct application to many types of projects. 
        These techniques use well established internet multimedia techniques and 
        should be accessible to the vast majority of web visitors:</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>1. The spyglass</b></p>
      <p><b><span class="normal">Issue:</span></b><span class="normal"> How can 
        visitors compare multiple versions of the same image? </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>In the physical world:</b> In an actual museum 
        or laboratory, your visitors might lay the images side by side. They could 
        then compare the images as a whole. They also might view the images in 
        detail through a loupe, switching back and forth between comparable features 
        in each image. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>On the internet:</b> Images can be overlaid in 
        layers, and visitors can switch what layer they are viewing. Additionally, 
        we can put a &#34;hole&#34; in an image, revealing the image layer beneath 
        it. This creates an effect like a searchlight, or spyglass being moved 
        around the image, allowing details of each version to be directly compared. 
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Technical details:</b> Using Macromedia Shockwave. 
        1) Prepare images in an image editor (such as Photoshop), to be exactly 
        the same dimensions. You may need to rotate, resize, and skew your images. 
        To maximize sharpness, you should stretch oversize images, then downsample 
        to final size when you are through transforming them. 2) Using Shockwave, 
        create a one bit mask for each image, apply mask ink. 3) While the mousedown, 
        adjust the spyglass sprite loc, and move the mask regpoint the opposite 
        direction. 4) Export shockwave movie, with images dynamically imported.

      <p><b><span class="normal">Issue: </span></b><span class="normal">How can 
        you look at an image in great detail?</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>In the physical word:</b> A viewer will look 
        very closely, or use a magnifying glass. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>On the internet:</b> Small portions of the image 
        can be viewed in detail. The visitors can adjust their view vertically 
        and horizontally, zoom in and out, or click on a thumbnail image to re-center 
        their view. Often the visitor can see the image in greater detail than 
        they could in a museum, where they might not be able to reach all portions 
        of the image, for example, it is hard to see the top of a large painting 
        in detail. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Technical details:</b> Using server scripts or 
        JavaScript. 1) Divide image into hundreds of rectangles using Adobe ImageReady 
        to define equally spaced guides, and define slices based on guides. Choose, 
        perhaps, a 10x10 or 30x30 matrix. 2) Display the rectangles within an 
        html table. 3) You may either generate the page or frame via a server-side 
        script, or dynamically change the image.src with JavaScript. Use modular 
        arithmetic to calculate the frame numbers. 4) Re-center the image using 
        a simple input image. </span></p>

      <p><b><span class="normal">Issue:</span></b><span class="normal"> How can 
        you describe the many details of an image?</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>In the physical word:</b> In a museum, a curator 
        can give a tour, pointing to different portions of a painting, and describing 
        different aspects, such as artistic style, or the painting technique. 
        In a book, sometimes numbers are overlaid on an image, with descriptions 
        to be found in a table next to the image. The reader correlates the number 
        with the description. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>On the internet:</b> The image can be divided 
        into dozens or hundreds of invisible regions. When the visitor points 
        their cursor at a region, a description is displayed next to the cursor. 
        Thus, a mass of data is navigated. The visitor only sees the image and 
        one description at a time. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Technical details:</b> Using Macromedia Shockwave. 
        1) Create a false color version of the image with regions of flat color 
        overlaying the image. Anti-aliasing off 2) Reduce the image size be at 
        least 1:4 in each dimension. Nearest neighbor sampling. 3) Export the 
        image as raw format. 4) Place the raw file on the internet. 5) Load the 
        image as a text file with Shockwave, getNetText, into a global variable. 
        6) During mouseover, calculate the mouse position, relative to the sprite 
        image. Calculate corresponding pixel number, counting row by row. Divide 
        by 16 (1:4 x 1:4). 7) Determine integer value of corresponding character 
        in the text file. 8) Correspond the character to a table of descriptions, 
        using a case statement. 9) Place the description into a text member, and 
        position the sprite next to the cursor. </span></p>

      <p><b><span class="normal">Issue:</span></b><span class="normal"> How do 
        you identify what pigments were used in a painting?</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>In the physical world:</b> In a book, dozens 
        of numbers are printed over a painting, corresponding to tables of pigments 
        on another page. The reader flips back and forth between the image and 
        the data tables. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>On the internet: </b>The visitor views the painting, 
        and next to it are a number of colored pigment squares with the pigment 
        name and color. As they glide their cursor over the painting surface, 
        the pigment squares flicker on and off, depending on what pigments correspond 
        to the point just under the cursor. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Technical details:</b> Using Macromedia Shockwave. 
        1) Similar to item 3 above, except you will probably want to map only 
        about 5 pigments per image. Use transparent inks in PhotoShop to create 
        intersection regions. 2) Create a few raw files, as above, and concatenate 
        them into one file with a text editor (getNetText can only open one file 
        reliably). 3) Find characters, adding the offset of the number of chars 
        in the single raw file to extract data for each image. 4) Note that you 
        can reduce file sizes by using half bytes instead and bit math. </span></p>

      <p class="heading"><b>Conclusion &amp; future directions</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The above techniques have been very successful in 
        helping make vast amounts of visual data accessible to our visitors. Our 
        current research is focused on a related problem of condensing information 
        when the data is more quantitative. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">We are assembling an extensive database of pigment 
	usage data for several hundred paintings. How can this mass of data be 
	accessed? We are still working on solutions, but the goal is similar to 
	above: display only a small portion of the data at a time. Our primary 
	solution has been to extract &#34;slices&#34; from the database by performing 
	sophisticated statistical analyses that summarize, for example, the difference 
	between Monetís and van Goghís typical palette. Moreover, we find that 
	it is very instructive to have numerous &#34;predefined&#34; database 
	queries to answer questions like &#34;When was Cobalt Blue used?&#34; 
	by clicking one button. Our current work in this area may be viewed at
