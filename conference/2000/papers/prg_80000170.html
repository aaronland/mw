      <p class="heading"><b>Building the Next Generation Collaborative Museum 
        Shopping Site: Merging e-commerce, e-museums &amp; entrepreneurs</b></p>
      <p><b class="author">Chris Tellis, Antenna Audio, and Rebecca Reynolds Moore, 
        MuseumShop.com, Inc., USA</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="JUSTIFY" class="small">In March of 1999, MuseumShop.com and 
          Antenna Audio formed a new strategic partnership. The objective was 
          to leverage the product awareness of bricks and mortar museum shops 
          throughout the world into an innovative partnership between museums, 
          the leading museum e-retailer, and the leading audio tour provider. 
          On its first year anniversary together, the site has experienced dramatic 
          growth and achieved recognition by Gomez.com as a leading online gift-shopping 
          site. This paper examines the successes and failures of the initiative 
          and its impact on museums using the Web. How has the consumer market 
          and museum industry responded? How has the financial and interactive 
          community responded? The paper describes what synergies emerged from 
          the partnership and how interactive and public media is used to maximize 
          museums&#39; e-commerce initiatives. The authors will describe the overall 
          state of museum e-commerce in North America and Europe, what products 
          have been successful, which museums have benefited and for what reasons.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Museum Store GrowthÖa Brief History</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">At the inaugural Museums and the 
        Web Conference in 1997, museum leaders expressed concern that online exhibitions 
        would deter visitors from their physical museums. Three years later museums 
        accept the fact that their online exhibitions attract new visitors from 
        all corners of the world and help to build global recognition of their 
        physical exhibitions.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Today, museum leaders are now concerned 
        that they are missing out on the Internet commerce goldrush. The museum 
        world has historically experienced a strained relationship between exhibition 
        and merchandising initiatives and the Internet can exaggerate this rift. 
        Museum stores managers are notorious for being considered as the stepchild 
        of museum staff and are still viewed by curators and educators as &#34;money 
        changers on the steps of the temple of knowledge&#34;. Even purist museum 
        visitors often sniff at the &#34;inevitable&#34; retail stores positioned 
        at &#34;blockbuster showíí exits and the proliferation of Mondrian ties 
        and baseballs signed by Cezanne. The Internet can be used as a tool to 
        quell the conflict between curatorsí drive to educate and museum retailersí 
        drive to grow revenues by turning merchandising into educational outreach.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Turning Merchandising into Educational 
        Outreach</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Markets and commerce are a vital 
        part of public life. At their best, museum stores can serve as extensions 
        of exhibition spaces, whose educational and artistic inspiration can directly 
        influence purchases. Like museums, shops are public forums where people 
        mingle to exchange ideas and compare esthetic (albeit often materialistic) 
        values.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Consumersí desire to buy goods and 
        services can provide a gateway to the core mission of the parent institution, 
        beyond the simple purchase of an exhibition catalogue. Back in the 1970&#39;s 
        and 80&#39;s, the Museum of Modern Art in New York spread its &#34;brand&#34; around 
        the country by distributing it&#39;s products in upscale gift shops nationwide. 
        And newer museums, like MOMA in San Francisco, have placed their commercial 
        side on the street level and facade of the institution, so that shoppers 
        and cafe dwellers can slip right through the merchandising interface into 
        the core of the museum.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The goods and services museums provide 
        are more than simple revenue generators. In their best form, the products 
        are commercial ambassadors that project the museumís trademark into the 
        outside world, promoting the institution and suggesting the virtues of 
        a visit. In their worst form, &#34;museum-like&#34; products without 
        genuine connection to museumsí exhibits risk exploiting museums pristine 
        image and actually turn-off to visitors; possibly the greatest fear of 
        museums</span>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Commercial Partnership Prudence</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">For this reason museums are very 
        careful about the products they develop and the commercial partnerships 
        they form. Museumís commercial activities are eternally bound by the educational 
        mission and the purist aesthetics of each institution and it&#39;s target 
        audience. The Metropolitan Museum of Art would not allow a Burger King 
        franchise in its cafe, yet across Central Park, kids and adults delight 
        in consuming &#34;Dino Fries&#34; at the American Museum of Natural History. At 
        the same time, the AMNH will not sell a Buzz Lightyear doll in its Rose 
        Space Center.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">To help mediate this balancing act, 
        museums can form strategic partnerships with firms that have experience 
        straddling the for-profit and non-profit world and that understand the 
        sensitivities required to successfully market educational products and 
        information. The most successful partnerships shield museums from the 
        financial risk and capital investment necessary to develop large commercial 
        activities, while carefully leveraging the museumsí products and services 
        through collaborative initiatives.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>An E-Commerce Case Study</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">One example of a new form of strategic 
        partnership was launched by Antenna Audio and MuseumShop.com in 1999. 
        Antenna Audio is a fifteen year veteran of museum services, providing 
        audio tours for most of the world&#39;s major museums, including, the Vatican 
        the Louvre, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston 
        and the J. Paul Getty Museum of Art. MuseumShop.com is a two and a half 
        year old &#34;dot com start-up&#34;, and already is the largest provider 
        of online stores for museums, linking together the products of over forty 
        North American and the major European museums.</p>
      <p align="center" class="normal"><img src="Tellisfig1.jpg" width="400" height="283"/></p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The goal of this alliance was both to 
        combine the international sales force and museum network of Antenna with 
        the Internet and E-commerce expertise of MuseumShop.com, and to partner 
        with museums globally. The partnership was based on an understanding that 
        there would be restrictions on the products sold; only those products 
        developed or distributed by partner museums were to be displayed and sold 
        on the MuseumShop.com Web site. Similarly, all of Antenna&#39;s audio tours 
        are produced in direct collaboration with client museumsí educational 
        and curatorial departments.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Museum Reaction</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Although the joint venture is only nine 
        months old (an eternity in the Internet world), it is clear that this 
        product and content exclusivity is key to its success. The Internet projects 
        museums into a vastly larger potential audience than ever before, and 
        the partnerships developed in cyberspace are critical to assuring museum 
        buy-in. Museums reactions have been favorable to a Web site that combines 
        and leverages the product and content that has already been developed 
        by fellow museums in a complementary manner.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Consumer Reaction</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Consumer reaction has also been 
        favorable to the display of thousands of products and content from a consortium 
        of museums and products that have never before seen together; and in ways 
        that are not possible in click and mortar stores. This is a prime example 
        of how the Internet now is forcing museums to think in new entrepreneurial 
        ways about promotion and the relationship between and the collection and 
        the commercial products. The MuseumShop.com Web site provides consumers 
        with a gateway to museums in new and powerful way.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">MuseumShop.com attracts visitors 
	who are looking for gifts. Yet they have click-through potential to the 
	Museum in ways that would never be available to a Crate and Barrel shopper 
	who picks up a MOMA teakettle. This is where Antenna enters the equation. 
	In the last five years, random access players and digital audio have led 
	to the development thousands of audio messages linked to specific images. 
	With the museum approval, digital images and digital audio can now be 
	linked and distributed through a variety of different platforms, including 
	the Internet. MuseumShop.com was rated in Fall of 1999 by Gomez.com #1 
	in Online Resources and # 5 overall for their Internet Gift Store Scoreboard 
	&lt; <a href="http://www.gomez.com/">http://www.gomez.com</a>&gt; and in 
	February 2000 by Forbes.com as a Best of the Web in the Perfect Gifts 
	category <br/>
        &lt;<a href="http://www.forbesbest.com/">http://www.forbesbest.com</a>&gt;.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Financial &amp; Internet Community Reaction</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The financial and Internet community has 
        been enthusiastic about the partnershipís growth, in part projected by 
        press such as Internet.comís rating of MuseumShop.com as one of the Top 
        20 Internet Companies for 2000 <br/>
        &lt;<a href="http://boston.internet.com/views/article/0,1928,2011_299291,00.html">http://boston.internet.com/views/article/0,1928,2011_299291,00.html</a> 
        &gt;.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>How the E-Commerce Collaboration Works</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Every partner museum on MuseumShop.com 
        benefits from a custom home page or &#34;Microsite&#34; that provides 
        information and links to the museumís primary Web site. For those museums 
        that are interested, Antenna and MuseumShop.com display audio-visual highlights 
        of representative works from each museum&#39;s permanent collection. When

        the associated descriptive audio message. The visitor hears selected educational 
        audio clips about the images that are identical to the ones they would

      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Antenna and MuseumShop.com also produce 
        exhibition spotlights for museumsí temporary exhibitions. These mini-Web 
        experiences display sound and images often with introductions by the museum 
        Director or exhibition curator, along with information pages describing 
        the exhibition, links to ticketing, and selected thumbnail images, again 
        expandable by clicking through to bring up the image and hear the audio

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The net result is a simple-to-use 
        online multimedia experience that allows Web shoppers from around the 
        world to sample and consider a visit to the host museum. The exhibition 
        spotlight repurposes content, already developed and funded by the audio 
        tour programs, into an effective format that attracts visitors to the 
        site and informs them about the parent institution. The audiovisual productions 
        currently require a Flash 4 plugin and offer a link to download; today 
        Flash 4 is bundled on most 4.0 and higher browsers. The content programming 
        for each of the sites is financed by Antenna and MSC.com and is provided 
        free of charge to partner museums for use on their site. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The first online spotlight was designed 
        for the Bugatti exhibition at The Cleveland Museum of Art. Even though 
        the exhibit closed in October, the exhibition spotlight has been popular 
        and Clevelandís product sales were among the highest on the site during 
        the Christmas season. Antenna and MuseumShop.com are now producing exhibition 
        spotlights and features for the <i>Faces of Impressionism: Portraits from 
        American Collections </i>exhibition and its permanent collection, as well 
        as the permanent collection of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the 
        Whitney Museum of Art and several major European Museums (to be publicly 
        announced in March of 2000).</span></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Online Merchandising: A Different 
        Beast</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The new form of audiovisual merchandising 
        and cobranding on MuseumShop.com duplicates in the virtual world in way 
        that is similar to the proliferation of physical satellite stores within 
        and outside of museums. Yet it is important to emphasize that the transition 
        of physical retail stores onto the Internet is not seamless and requires 
        very different skill sets. The media frenzy over the success of the Internet 
        and the speed of its growth and metamorphasis has left many museums convinced 
        that they are missing out on a huge opportunity but baffled as to how 
        to develop an Internet strategy that does not compromise their mission.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">In their effort to quickly establish 
        an Internet strategy, most museums underestimate the true capital and 
        human resources required to build, manage, and market a sophisticated 
        online store. Few museums understand the extremely high expectations of 
        online customers (most expect next day delivery of orders and 7 out of 
        10 customers will contact the museum via phone or e-mail to inquire about 
        their order) . Few museums understand the complexity and cost of providing 
        superior shipping and customer service logistics on a large scale. And 
        even fewer museums understand or can respond to the flexibility of business 
        models required to survive in the Internet world. The entrepreneurial 
        structure of MuseumShop.com allows it to assess and adjust its business 
        model according to the changing Internet tide.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The objective is to build a site 
        that will allow armchair travelers to sample and shop from museums around 
        the world. In the highwire world of the Internet, after only two years, 
        MuseumShop.com is already a veteran. In the early fall of 1999 it closed 
        its first round of venture financing that enabled them to proactively 
        address several areas.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>E-Lessons Learned</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">One example of this was managing 
        e-commerce shipping logistics. Initially, all MuseumShop.com products 
        were &#34;dropped-shipped&#34; to customers directly by each museum 
        partner. As the volume of orders increased exponentially and as customers 
        increased their orders from multiple museums, customers began to experience 
        high shipping costs and inconsistent fulfillment across museums. Since 
        many museum partners did not have permanent staff to handle Web shipping 
        initiatives, the museums had a challenging time keeping up with the inevitable 
        holiday shipping influx. To address this, MuseumShop.com decided to manage 
        its own warehouse and fulfillment center. Now museum partnersí products 
        are shipped directly to the Ohio warehouse, which enables MuseumShop.com 
        to guarantee to customers same day shipping of orders received by 2pm 
        (EST) and next business day shipping of orders received after 2pm (EST). 
        This makes e-customers happy.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">In order to defray the costs of 
        bringing on new museums, MuseumShop.com initially charged an annual set-up/networking 
        fee that was prohibitive for some museums. This fee is now waived for 
        all museums with over 750,000 visitors annually, and reduced for all other 
        museums. All museums are eligible for exhibition previews and benefit 
        from MuseumShop.comís public relations and marketing initiatives.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Portal and Marketing Plays</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">All museum partners benefit from MuseumShop.comís 
        active marketing and positioning on the major shopping portals including 
        Yahoo! and Excite as well as through affiliate marketing programs powered 
        by LinkShare and other online bots. Additionally, partners benefit from 
        public relations and promotional initiatives.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>How Museums Participate &amp; Benefit</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The process of becoming a partner museum 
        is simple. MuseumShop.com either purchases products from the museum partner 
        at wholesale or consigns products from the museum partner giving the museum 
        partner a commission when the product sells. Most museums opt to sign 
        up for the wholesale relationship as it is no different from setting up 
        a bricks and mortar outlet. MuseumShop.com handles all aspects of the 
        production of the partnerís Microsite, all secure credit card transactions, 
        customer service via e-mail and phone support, and all refunds and credits. 
        This relationship makes it very easy for museums to participate and join 
        the ranks of the growing collaborative including 40+ museums across the 
        world.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Overcoming Resistance to the Collaborative Model</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Any resistance to joining the venture 
        primarily comes from museums that wish to go it alone or museums that 
        have not yet determined how they should participate in the e-commerce 
        world. Some museums fear that they may miss a cyberspace opportunity or 
        that MuseumShop.com will cannibalize their own online shopís sales. However 
        MuseumShop.com attracts a fundamentally different visitor from those visiting 
        a museumís own online store. As demonstrated by Jonathan Bowenís paper, 
        Time for Renovations: A Survey of Museum Web Sites, at last yearís Museum 
        and Web conference </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">&lt; <a href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw99/papers/bowen/bowen.html">http://www.archimuse.com/mw99/papers/bowen/bowen.html</a> 
        &gt; which measured visitors to museumsí Web sites and discovered that 
        the vast majority of visitors to museum Web sites seek museum collection 
        and exhibition, and schedule information, while only a fraction of a percent 
        of visitors click on the museumís store (The percentage of those that 
        purchased products was not measured). Visitors to a museumís Web site 
        may take a path from a Monet exhibit to a Monet scarf, but very rarely 
        start at the scarf itself. MuseumShop.comís objective is to attract the 
        visitor who is seeking a scarf to the Monet exhibition that inspired the 
        scarfís design on its partner museumís Web site; and simultaneously to 
        sell the Monet scarf. MuseumShop.com targets its marketing initiatives 
        to online shoppers seeking gifts with cultural significance. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>History Repeats Itself: Outsourcing Makes Sense</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Antenna Audioís experience in the early 
        days of audio tours is telling. Many of the major museums initially spent 
        significant resources attempting to set up their own audio tour divisions. 
        But the distractions and complications of not being thoroughly in the 
        audio tour business caused all of these ventures to eventually die. Like 
        the audio tour business, e-commerce is difficult and expensive to manage 
        on a large and sustainable scale. Millions of Web sites compete for visitor&#39;s 
        attention with the largest 10 sites comprising over 50% of Web traffic. 
        Single destination sites will have an extremely difficult time attracting 
        visitors and customers. Those e-commerce sites that survive will amalgamate 
        a critical mass of affiliated sites in order to defray the exorbitant 
        cost of financing the ever-changing technology, promotion, advertising, 
        and logistics needed to be successful. Museums will end up collaborating 
        with entities and outsourcing much of their e-commerce activities.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>E-Competition</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">New competitors to the museum Web industry 
        proliferate daily. There is a new outpouring of Web sites claiming to 
        be the next museum &#34;portal&#34; including museum.com; destinationblvd.com; 
        museumnetwork.com, and wwar.com, and even bricks and mortar retailers 
        like The Museum Company. Many of these sites have links to individual 
        museumís Web store pages. All that is required to create links to museum 
        Web sites and store fronts is basic html skills. Providing a single point 
        of ordering, customer service, and logistics for a consortium of museums 
        is far more complex. There are also a preponderance of art and poster 
        sites that are wooing museum merchandisers including art.com, barewalls.com, 
        posters.com, and ImageExchange.com; each with a different approach. Finally, 
        it has now become inexpensive for anyone to develop a store on Yahoo! 
        and benefit from the high volumes of traffic and reporting tools; but 
        in order to effectively sell products online, museums still need to invest 
        in Web designers and staff to continually update the site, manage inventory, 
        handle secure credit card transactions, provide real time customer service, 
        and ship individual products to each customer. The far greater challenge 
        is developing large scale museum partnerships that effectively merchandise 
        through educational outreach.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The Antenna/MuseumShop.com/museum partnership 
        is a unique business model that promotes the products of museums retail, 
        curatorial, and educational departments in a new collaborative model. 
        This model builds on the collective brands of all the participating museums 
        while providing new visitors and sales. This collaborative e-commerce 
        model is generating encouraging results that should provide valuable lessons 
        for museums that seek to expand their audience and revenue-generating 
        opportunities on the Web.</p>
