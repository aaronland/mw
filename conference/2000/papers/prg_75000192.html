      <p class="heading"><strong>Meta-centers: do they work and what might the 
        future hold ñ A case study of Australian Museums On-line.</strong></p>
      <p class="author">Kevin Sumption, Powerhouse Museum, Australia</p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote>
          
        <p align="JUSTIFY" class="small">The Australian Museums On-Line (AMOL) 
          project is six years old. During this time it has established a reputation 
          as both an innovative and highly popular, Internet-based gateway to 
          Australian museums and galleries. A recent study showed that from February 
          1998 to July 1999, AMOL received over two and a half million hits from 
          138,380 users, averaging out at more than 270 unique users a day. As 
          well as individual users AMOL has also attracted a growing number of 
          significant museum and gallery collections. But what have been the tangible 
          and quantifiable benefits of this use and representation? Has the AMOL 
          meta-center approach increased access to cultural resources and communications 
          tools, in ways that have meaningfully benefit both museum professionals 
          and the general public? The AMOL project team was mindful that it was 
          time such questions were answered. Particularly when the number of Australian 
          museums developing their own expensive OPACs grows and they begin to 
          question the usefulness of a meta-center approach. In an effort to examine 
          these issues and chart a way forward, AMOL commissioned the first of 
          two summative evaluations in 1999. In this paper I intend looking at 
          the results of the first quantitative evaluation and development of 
          the second qualitative evaluation, as well discuss a range of marketing, 
          promotional, educational and technological strategies the process has 
          spurred. </p>

      </blockquote>
        
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The &#39;consensual hallucination,&#39; imagined 
        by William Gibson is now a reality. Over 150 million people last year 
        used the internet. Far from being a mere teaching medium, the Internet 
        has evolved into a ubiquitous publishing, communication, design and research 
        tool beyond the bounds of any single government to control. Over and above 
        the 60,000 interacting networks that constitute the Internet, this epiphenomenon 
        cannot physically be perceived or meaningfully located in space or time. 
        In cultural terms the Internet is truly a place where disembodied souls 
        find freedom in a myriad of chat rooms, multi-user dimensions and news 
        groups (Wertheim, 1999). Last year over three million Australians partook 
        of this consensual hallucination and a further 3.9 million (ABS, 1999) 
        visited a museum. Although to date no single study has established a correlation 
        between museum visitation and Internet use, the Australian heritage sector 
        has reacted with nearly 25 percent of all private and public museums now 
        operating a website. In an effort to provide a gateway to these, as well 
        as information on Australian museums and their collections, Australian 
        Museums On Line was formed in 1995, the same year private access to the 
        Internet became widespread in Australia.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Australian Museums On Line (AMOL) 
        is a joint Commonwealth and State funded website that has established 
        a reputation, both nationally and internationally, as a highly innovative 
        gateway to Australian museums and galleries. Its mix of information products, 
        specially created for both museum workers and the public, gives the site 
        a wonderful eclecticism. Collection descriptions, contact details and 
        images of nearly 1100 Australian museums, sit alongside half a million 
        item level collection records, discussion forums and a variety of on-line 
        journals. Initially proposed by the Heritage Collection Council as an 
        electronic register of moveable cultural heritage material, the AMOL project 
        has attempted to keep pace with changing public and professional needs, 
        through a series of redesigns. In six years AMOL has undergone three major 
        redesigns, each of which has progressively thrown off the shackles of 
        a centralised information repository, and embraced the potential of the 
        meta-center. This metamorphosis has been gradual and not surprisingly 
        parallels that experienced by many museums, as they made the sometimes 
        perilous journey from collection to information centered institutions 
        in the 1990s.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The AMOL project emerged as a direct response 
        to the information explosion experienced by many Australian museums in 
        the nineties, as first collection records and interactives were digitised, 
        then finally the Internet was embraced. This rapid adoption of information 
        technology tools by some museums was inadvertently ëpushedí in Australia 
        by government moves towards greater fiscal self-sufficiency (Sumption, 
        1999). The introduction of admission charges by many Australian museums 
        in the early 1990s, required museums to more closely align themselves 
        with market forces. At the same time financial pressures to be more cost 
        effective ushered in a period of stringent appraisal of some of the museumsí 
        more costly functions, like collection care and management. So itís not 
        surprising that the 1990s witnessed a rapid up-take of computerised collection 
        management systems. The unanticipated effects of this technological assimilation 
        was the creation of a myriad of digital, text, graphic, photographic and 
        video databases. And whilst technological determinism and fiscal expediency 
        ëpushedí the process of digitisation in museums, the popular explosion 
        of the Internet after 1995 in Australia, provided the ëpullí to make these 
        resources publicly available. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The Internetís popularity in museums is 
        no accident and is just as much a consequence of museumsí new visitor 
        orientation, as it is technological appetite. Superficially its rapid 
        adoption suggests museums were from the outset caught up in the techno-evangelism 
        of the Infopreneurials and Digerati (Robotham,1996) This small select 
        group have for some years espoused a simple but persuasive rhetoric: the 
        Internet will change the way we live, work, play and even think; it will 
        deliver us from the routine of office work via telecommuting and unleash 
        us from the one dimensional interface of traditional educational mediums. 
        However on closer examination it is clear many first generation museum 
        websites, including AMOL, adopted a less ambitious brief, deciding instead 
        to use the medium to market the <i>real</i> museum and its <i>real </i>collections. 
      </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Three emerging meta-center typologies</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Consequently the vast majority of 
        first generation museum websites were conservative in both the presentation 
        and quantity of information they were willing to make public. What little 
        they did was invariably centralised, highly abridged and only browsable. 
        However in the last two years the technological and political landscape 
        has changed markedly, particularly here in Australia. A voter backlash 
        against the marginalisation of regional Australia prompted many governments 
        and museums to reinvigorate outreach programs. Consequently this decentralisation 
        impetus, together with the emergence of new metadata standards like Dublin 
        Core, spurred the development of more user-centred website typologies. 
        With its ability to create a more comprehensive information environment 
        via interoperable databases and known item or explanatory searching, the 
        meta-center model is now gradually being adopted in Australia, North American 
        and Europe. But because of cost and technical considerations, heritage 
        sector meta-centers are still rare, however even in these early stages 
        I have observed a number of typologies emerging.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Most common are what I term <i>institutional 
        meta-centers</i>. These are the websites of organisations like the Natural 
        History Museum (London), National Library of Australia and Australian 
        War Memorial. Characteristically each of these has extensive collection 
        holdings, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, or even millions. Importantly 
        each has over a number of years developed a close working relationship 
        with a vast research fraternity, for whom most provide in-house research 
        facilities. Consequently most of these <i>institutional meta-centers</i> 
        are in the process of adopting metadata solutions to create database driven 
        websites that will ultimately act as surrogates of corporeal research 
        centres.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Less common are <i>public meta-centres</i>. 
	These are the websites created for, or by, heritage sector advocacy, administrative, 
	coordinating or governance bodies. Institutions like the <a href="http://www.imls.gov/">Institute 
	of Museum and Library Services</a>, the <a href="http://www.aam-us.org/">American 
	Association of Museums</a> and the<a href="http://www.mda.org.uk/"> Museum 
	Documentation Association</a> (UK). These agencies fund and develop <i>public 
	meta-centers</i> like The 24 HourMuseum (<a href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/">www.24hourmuseum.org.uk</a>) 
	and American Strategies (<a href="http://www.americanstrategy.org/">www.americanstrategy.org</a>), 
	to increase public awareness of <i>real</i> museums, their exhibitions 
	and to a lesser extent collections. However these initiatives are still 
	extensively experimental and are primarily a response to the perceived 
	increased use of the web by the museum going public. Again as there are 
	few examples of this typology it is difficult to discern a definitive 
	set of characteristics. However one of the most advanced is the 24HourMuseum. 
	Designed as a public gateway to information on British museums, the sites 
	developers have used a sophisticated combination of e-zine format, heritage 
	trails, collection level and institutional contact databases, as well 
	as childrenís pages. The result is a fun, entertaining and informative 
	site with broad appeal. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The third emerging meta-center typology 
        I have identified is that of the <i>Professional meta-center</i>. Here 
        the term ëprofessionalí describes the primary audience for whom these 
        sites were designed. In the case of AMOL and CHIN, those working directly 
        in paid or unpaid heritage positions. This is not to suggest that <i>professional 
        meta-centers</i> are not public-friendly, however there is little doubt 
        that the information architecture, search format and content is intended 
        primarily for users from the heritage sector. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The establishment of organisations 
        like CIMI (the Consortium for the Computer Interchange of Museum Information) 
        in the early 1990s is testimony to the heritage sectorís awareness of 
        the inherit benefits of meta-centers and allied enabling metadata standards. 
        In the proceeding years projects like CIMIís Dublin Core metadata test 
        bed project, and more recently EMIN (European Museumsí Information Institute), 
        have all actively sought to develop standards for museums and galleries. 
        Along with organisations like CHIN (Canadian Heritage Information Network), 
        the MDA (Museum Documentation Association) and AHDS (Arts and Humanities 
        Data Service), AMOL has been an active participant in many of these projects. 
        More importantly AMOL, like CHIN, has also been an early adopter of recommendations 
        and in turn pioneered this, the most ambitious of meta-center typologies.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Meta-centers: Artefactual versus Interactive 
        Multimedia Simulacrum</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Whilst I acknowledge that each of 
        the three typologies deploys a wide range of products to service a diverse 
        clientele, they also have a remarkably similar way of describing and presenting 
        the activities of museums. In essence each typology is dominated by what 
        I refer to as an <i>artifactual</i> <i>simulacrum</i>. That is they characteristically 
        discuss museums, their collections and exhibitions, via images of artefacts 
        and item level descriptions. Even <i>public meta-centers</i> have adopted 
        this approach as a very ëpragmaticí way of developing online exhibitions. 
        Typical is the American Strategies, Northern Great Plains online story. 
        (<a href="http://www.americanstrategy.org/america/home1.html">http://www.americanstrategy.org/america/home1.html</a>). 
        Rather than a story with a complex narrative structure similar to that 
        of a book, exhibition or interactive multimedia (IMM), the exhibition 
        is made up of a discrete collection of 900 individual photographs and 
        descriptors. Its authors have neither sought to broadly contextualise 
        the set of images and descriptions, or even related one to another. Instead 
        the story has simply usurped the presentational structure of a database. 
        In so doing the story has avoided using contextual information systems 
        like interactive multimedia (IMM), audiovisuals, sub-theme labels etc.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">I believe this <i>artifactual</i> 
        <i>simulacrum </i>is a natural reaction to the political and museological 
        concerns of the last decade when for many simply making the contents of 
        one&#39;s often unseen storehouse visible was a priority. After all there 
        is little doubt that the web can release individual museums from the economic 
        and spatial constraints that limit both collecting and display in the 
        <i>real</i> world. Even in my own museum, the Powerhouse Museum, it is 
        estimated that as little as 3% of the total of 380,000 objects in the 
        collection are on display. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">However I believe that if the three 
        meta-center typologies are to keep pace with user expectations we need 
        to know that this <i>artifactual simulacrum</i> is indeed what both the 
        public and professional sector desire. This is a critical question because 
        we know that in the <i>real </i>museum, visitors are not content with 
        such a fractured and decontextualised approach. After all if visitors 
        and museum professionals were merely concerned with passively viewing 
        artefacts, then there would have been little need for the complex interpretive 
        and presentational techniques that have come to dominate today&#39;s modern 
        museum. It goes without saying then that if the heritage sector was committed 
        to using the web as an extension of contemporary practice as expressed 
        in current exhibition media, then meta-centers would equally be populated 
        by a plethora of dynamic interactive experiences, just like <i>real </i>museums. 
        In essence they would equally embrace a model based around the dynamic 
        and two-way potential of interactive multimedia (<i>interactive simulacrum</i>) 
        as they would the artefact.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">However this argument presupposes 
        that all meta-center users have the same needs as visitors to the <i>real 
        </i>museum. Whatís more it presupposes users are motivated to visit a 
        meta-center because it provides an experience analogous to the <i>real</i> 
        museum. However even if this motivation were true, we know that the social 
        and cognitive complexity involved with a visit to a <i>real</i> museum, 
        cannot in its entirety, be currently replicated on-line. As Falk and Dierking 
        observed when defining the parameters of an effective educational visit, 
        each is determined by the visitor&#39;s unique personal, physical and social 
        attributes and contexts. In turn each one of these attributes is mediated 
        by senses activated by the material reality of the visitor&#39;s social and 
        physical surroundings. Thus the direct correlation of <i>real</i> with 
        <i>virtual</i> experiences is questionable. But where does this leave 
        us? Without definitive feedback on user experiences it is hard to gauge 
        the effectiveness of current artefactual meta-center simulacrum. Thus 
        what we decided to do at AMOL, was conduct an evaluation that could help 
        us determine the effectiveness of our current approach.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>The need for a summative evaluation</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The adoption of a <i>meta-center</i> 
        approach by AMOL has been a slow process. After all as Neimanis and Geber 
        (1999) point out the journey from centralised information repository to 
        meta-center, involves constantly re-building the network of connections 
        among site components as well as communication relationships between these 
        resources and users. Since its launch in 1995 AMOL has not shirked this 
        responsibility, and has regularly rebuilt part or all of its architecture 
        in-line with changing technological, museological as well as user expectations. 
        An important milestone in this journey was the redesign and re-launch 
        of AMOL in late 1998. The redesign had four principle objectives:</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <ul>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
        </p><li><span class="normal">To streamline information into three sections; 
          </span></li>
        <p></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
        </p><li><span class="normal">To improve navigation and interface functionality; 
          </span></li>
        <p></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
        </p><li><span class="normal">To increase contextual information on the site 
          via a series of stories; </span></li>
        <p></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
        </p><li><span class="normal">To begin the implementation of Dublin Core metadata 
          standards. </span></li>
        <p></p>
      </ul>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">This redesign took two months and 
        eventually the AMOL site was re-launched in October 1998. Exactly nine 
        months later the On Line Working Party (OLWP), responsible for overseeing 
        AMOL, decided to initiate a summative evaluation. Critically the evaluation 
        was seen as a strategic means of exploring new directions for the coming 
        eighteen months, a critical time for the project for a variety of reasons. 
        Itís a period when the efficacy of the Heritage Collection Council (HCC) 
        and its projects, including AMOL, will be closely examined. To facilitate 
        informed discussion it was decided thereafter that we needed to access 
        performance data. Ideally this data needed to be of both a qualitative 
        and quantitative nature and as such a two-stage summative evaluation, 
        focusing on three areas was initiated:</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>1. Participation rates</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">To ascertain whether or not any of the 
        new features had encouraged new or repeat visitation we needed to measure 
        and compare the siteís usage prior to and after the re-design. In particular 
        we wished to examine the effectiveness of the more ëgraphicí interface 
        and new information architecture and whether or not they reduced user 
        frustration and fatigue.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>2. User profiles </b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">As <i>a professional meta-center</i> AMOL 
        had been principally conceived to service the needs of those working in 
        the Australian museum sector. So it was important to establish that this 
        group was actually using the site. Just as importantly we also needed 
        to know who else might. If as we suspected inbound international and interstate 
        tourists were regular users, or indeed students and educators, a summative 
        evaluation would also help us identify which AMOL resources they preferred. 
        This data would then allow us to examine the feasibility of supplementing 
        the site with additional education or tourist specific resources.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
      <p class="heading"><b>3. User experience </b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Detailed, qualitative information on program 
        satisfaction was also critical for the purpose of improving certain AMOL 
        services. We needed to be able to gauge the current level of satisfaction 
        with new programs like the Open Museum Journal and costly resources like 
        the contextual stories. There was also a need for information on program 
        quality; an issue which from time to time sparked heated debate on AMOLís 
        Listserve AMF (Australian Museums Forum).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><strong>Decoding the visitor</strong></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Whilst it has been relatively easy to 
        evaluate the success, or otherwise, of some of AMOLs non-web programs 
        via feedback from <i>AMF</i> subscribers and workshop and grant program 
        assessments, evaluation of the usage and effectiveness of the website 
        was more daunting. This is because of a lack of an appropriate, and methodologically 
        rigorous, model around which to formulate an evaluation. So we turned 
        to the <i>real </i>museum. Traditionally a summative evaluation of a museum 
        program involves the cross-referencing of visitor tracking studies with 
        focus group discussions, or visitor questionnaires. Likewise we decided 
        upon a two-stage model that used both <i>positivist</i> and <i>postpositivist</i> 
        approaches to collect and analyze data. The first, a <i>positivist</i> 
        approach, analysed statistical data gleaned over a seventeen-month period 
        from the log file reporter WebTrends. These log file tools allow for the 
        compilation of data sets that, when analysed, can aid in the development 
        of participation trend<i> </i>models built around<i> </i>country of origin, 
        referring site and active organisation statistics. Similarly these tools 
        can also provide important indicators of user experience<i>,</i> through 
        their logs of average time per session, entry points, top path and most 
        accessed directory data. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">These log file analysis tools are 
        <i>positivist</i> as they focus on the quantification of outcomes and 
        thus on measurable performance indicators, effectiveness and efficiency. 
        As Darrell Caulley (1992) reminds us, this kind of reporting of human 
        behaviour has an important function as it responds to the accountability 
        demands of people who expect quantitative and ëvalue-freeí information. 
        In this regard a <i>positivist</i> evaluation was deemed appropriate for 
        reporting back to AMOLís senior political managers, who require this kind 
        of quantitative information to make budgetary decisions or confirm overall 
        use/worthiness. This positivist study was carried out by the Powerhouse 
        Museumís in-house evaluation specialist Carol Scott and was completed 
        in October 1999.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The second stage of the evaluation 
        process is about to get underway. Instead of statistical data this <i>postpositivist</i> 
        evaluation will utilise an on-line questionnaire and voluntary tracking 
        study to elicit qualitative data. Unlike a <i>positivist</i> approach, 
        which tends to yield data of little worth to project managers like myself, 
        we hope this approach would glean important demographic details about 
        individual users such as gender, age, country of residence, type of work 
        etc. This kind of information is particularly useful in helping determine 
        future directions based on current project successes or failures. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Findings from stage I ñ participation 
        rates</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Not unexpectedly the statistical 
        analysis of WebTrends data demonstrated distinct fluctuations in AMOLís 
        use. Diminished use over the Christmas and other holiday periods pointed 
        to the seasonal nature of AMOL use. These findings also underscored the 
        fact that a significant proportion of AMOL users were in all probability 
        Australian museum professionals, many of whom took holidays over this 
        period. This summation is indeed backed up by additional WebTrends data 
        on top referring sites. Among the top 20 referring sites over the seventeen-month 
        period, cultural organisations made up over half, indicating that the 
        site is being used extensively by the heritage sector. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">There was irrefutable evidence that 
        overall there has been a pronounced increase in the number of hits on 
        the website since the introduction of the new design. From February 1998 
        to July 1999 the site received over two and a half million hits from 138,380 
        users. This averages out at more than 270 users a day, browsing/researching 
        for an average of around twelve and a half minutes. This compares to fewer 
        than 200 users per day spending around 9 minutes online before the redesign. 
        Further evidence of AMOLs growing popularity is the number of participants 
        in AMOLís discussion groups. When the current AMOL coordination unit took 
        over in 1998, only 115 people subscribed to the AMOL discussion group 
        <i>AMF</i>. <i>AMF</i> participation has now increased to 465 and a further 
        two discussion groups have been added: <i>electricmuse</i> and <i>Craft 
        Curator</i>.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Most interestingly AMF membership 
        is now drawn from eleven countries including Australia, the United States, 
        Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany. When the logs of user sessions 
        were examined it was found that these countries consistently account for 
        the top 5 or 6 user sessions. Most significantly the evaluation showed 
        a strong correlation between countries accessing AMOL, and those countries 
        that account for the majority of inbound tourists to Australia. With some 
        estimates of over 5,000,000 inbound tourists heading to Australia annually 
        by 2000, this correlation is hard to ignore. Especially when you consider 
        that despite some cultural aberrations, approximately 30% of all inbound 
        tourists visit a museum or gallery (Scott, 1995). This finding suggests 
        that there is a strong probability that AMOL is being used by tourists 
        to plan their itinerary.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The analysis of WebTrends data also 
        highlighted the success of the new intuitive hierarchical navigation scheme 
        and accompanying information architecture. One of the significant innovations 
        of the redesign was the restructuring of the site and its information 
        into three main streams: Museum Craft, Museum Guide and Open Collections. 
        Prior to this new architecture, the top 10 entry pages accounted for only 
        37.88% of the total user sessions. These figures suggested that users 
        were spending considerable time finding their way into and around the 
        site before arriving at their destination. However, since the re-design 
        the top 10 entry pages have gone up to an average of 71% of user sessions. 
        Thus we concluded that the division of information in three major categories, 
        was well received and an improvement on the previous architecture</span>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>User experience</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">As quickly as AMOL usage can fall 
        between 5% and 10% during holidays, it climbs between 15% and 20% whenever 
        we feature a high-profile event like the Pandora Expedition. The Pandora 
        Expedition (amol.org.au/pandora/pandora_index.asp) was one of the new 
        contextual stories designed to add value to collections and individual 
        objects and so far has been the most popular story with 35.64% of total 
        story top entry pages. Unlike the other 14 stories, The Pandora Expedition 
        was not only well publicised, but also exhibited two critical attributes 
        that captivated and sustained public interest: a subject matter that had 
        broad appeal, namely a maritime archaeological dive on an eighteenth century 
        wreck; and its deployment of interactive multimedia. Although the story 
        ultimately didnít deploy the full panoply of streaming media, it did allow 
        divers working on a boat 30 metres above the wreck to post photographs 
        of artefacts recovered to the website, as well as answer emails from AMOL 
        users. As such the Pandora Expedition tried as far as is currently possible, 
        to adhere to Andy Lippmanís criteria for truly interactive multimedia 
        (Ryder &amp; Wilson, 1996).</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">In recent times, critics like Andy 
        Lippman have often lamented the inherent lack of genuine interactivity 
        in contemporary IMM. As is the case with many closed, museum-based IMM, 
        the ability for museum visitors to create and customise their own content 
        is very limited. To avoid this and provide a genuinely engaging and appropriate 
        use of media like the web, Lippman has suggested we should attempt to 
        develop experiences that can accommodate:</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <dir> 
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">· <i>	Interruptability 
          - the ability of either participant to interrupt the other at any point.

        <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">· <i>	Graceful degradation 
          - the ability to set aside the unanswerable questions in a way that 
          does not halt the conversation. </i></span></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">· <i>	Limited look-ahead 
          - the quality that makes it impossible to predict the ultimate outcome

        <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">· <i>	No default - a quality 
          which allows the shape of a conversation to develop naturally, organically, 
          without a pre-planned path. </i></span></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">· <i>	The impression of 
          an infinite database - the quality of limitless choices and realistic 
          responses to any possible input. </i></span></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      </dir>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Although the Pandora Expedition 
        is but a single story amongst hundreds of AMOL resources, it is one of 
        the few to attempt to embrace Lippmanís criteria and so successfully exchange 
        the <i>artifactual </i>for the<i> interactive </i>simulacrum.<i> </i>Superficially 
        this exchange may seem of little consequence for the vast majority of 
        AMOLís current patronage, who at least in quantitative terms, seem largely 
        satisfied with the site. However I believe the lessons learnt from Pandora 
        are critical if the AMOL project is to not only attract new educational 
        and tourist users, but also maintain heritage users in future. By definition 
        the meta-center concept has evolved as a response to users desires for 
        more responsive, easy to find and authoritative information repositories. 
        But as the publicís appetite for multimedia experiences like streaming 
        audio and video grows, the types of information, as well as presentation 
        mechanisms employed by meta-centerís will likewise need to expand. As 
        such in the not too distant future meta-center developers will need to 
        consider ways and means of incorporating the vast as yet untapped museum 
        audiovisual and interactive holdings. Reassuringly this seems to already 
        be underway with CIMI currently investigating the feasibility of an XML 
        test bed project. In addition if tomorrowís meta-centers are to truly 
        embrace the <i>interactive simulacrum</i> they will also need to negotiate 
        the difficult shift from information provider to information broker. This 
        again is easier said than done. Where the current open architecture of 
        some affordance technologies like IRC, CuSeeMe and artificially intelligent 
        MUDs (multi user dimensions), makes this possible, large parts of the 
        heritage sector are still very reluctant to ëgive-upí or ëcompromise&#34; 
        authorial control! </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The major challenge will be to evolve 
	meta-center typologies to a point wherein imagery, objects text and speech 
	are more widely available. In addition we will need to look to encourage 
	the development of information composition, creation, editing and curatorial 
	tools that can genuinely customise information to meet the unique needs 
	of users. Admittedly we are still some way off achieving this utopian 
	meta-center, but perhaps in the not too distant future a visit to AMOL 
	might be a little more engaging.</span></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Imagine you have just clicked on 
        AMOLís new &#39;Living Museum search facility.&#39; Before beginning you enter 
        a few personal details onto a specially designed page: age, education, 
        interests, how many times you have visited the site previously etc. An 
        avatar then asks you what kind of resources you are seeking. You respond 
        by indicating an interest in indigenous music. Drawing upon AMOLís array 
        of textual, graphic and video databases you are then presented with a 
        number of potential stories. You select the <i>ngaramang bayumi </i>story, 
        which examines contemporary indigenous music and dance<i>. </i>Seconds 
        later a streaming video complete with embedded images, text and sound 
        appears. At any stage you can tunnel into the video, acquire individual 
        information sources, and then later on retrieve these as a newly constituted 
        and uniquely personal composite record. Importantly you are not alone 
        in this microworld, simultaneously a school student studying Aboriginal 
        land rites and a German tourist planning a holiday to Arnhem Land, are 
        present as animated avatars. Using IRC or speech synthesis software you 
        can converse with either. However you keep to yourself and instead are 
        drawn to a showcase wherein Tiwi Islander music and a spinning artefact 
        have been activated by your presence. As you move in close you notice 
        a headdress rotating and the Tiwi islander descant fades to a single voice 
        explaining the process of making the headdresses. The system has recalled 
        that on a previous visit you spent time exploring the construction of 
        African masks. Thus it determined that similarly you may be interested 
        in this specific sub-story. Moving along you notice some images of Tapa 
        cloths, which as you scroll over activate an avatar that recounts their 
        provenance. The avatarís voice and indeed actual Tapa cloth imagery have 
        all been supplied by a collector based in Phoenix, Arizona.</span></p>
