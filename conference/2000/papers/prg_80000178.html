      <p class="heading"><b>Lessons learned from WebExhibits.org: Practical suggestions 
        for good design</b></p>
      <p class="author"><b>Michael Douma, Institute for Dynamic Educational Advancement, 
        USA</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="small">What makes a good online exhibit? Good content, a narrative 
          theme, intuitive navigation, and inviting graphics. The online &#34;exhibit&#34; 
          has recently emerged as a highly successful motif ó favored over the 
          &#34;virtual museum,&#34; and &#34;online magazine&#34; ó and is 
          a vital component of any successful museum exhibit. But what, specifically, 
          makes them good? </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="heading"><b>Background</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">We have performed an extensive survey of current 
        online exhibits, and have identified many common qualities which make 
        them successful. Our efforts stem from development of the &#34;WebExhibits 
        Catalogue,&#34; &lt;<a href="http://www.webexhibits.org/">http://www.webexhibits.org</a>&gt; 
        a web portal that indexes high quality exhibits on the internet. Our catalogue 
        links directly to exhibits within other sites, on topics including arts, 
        sciences, and popular culture. We currently index over 650 exhibits and 
        estimate that our survey includes the majority of all substantive English 
        language exhibits. This index differs from other portals because it is 
        focused exclusively on illustrated exhibits, not just references. Some 
        of the exhibits are from large organizations like the National Gallery, 
        National Geographic or PBS, while others are from smaller, little-known 
        organizations. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">We find that visitors respond very favorably to 
        exhibits that offer a lot of narrative guidance judiciously mixed with 
        easy navigation. Advances in bandwidth and interactive capabilities like 
        JavaScript, Flash, streaming media, and DHTML, and database access allow 
        online exhibits to be highly interactive. Despite these, advances, however, 
        it is our experience that the most important quality of an exhibit (besides 
        content) is ease of navigation. Attention to content and organization 
        is more important than &#34;cool graphics,&#34; and certainly more important 
        than any animations or sounds. Visitors must immediately perceive the 
        conceptual structure of the exhibit: what is available, and where information 
        is located. Todayís web users are more likely to follow links if they 
        can anticipate exactly what a link will bring. </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Content</b></p>
      <p class="normal">The singular most important aspect of any exhibit is content 
        ó both textual and visual. Most any topic can be interesting with the 
        right approach. Consider, for example, why is your topic interesting? 
        How does it apply to the lives of your visitors? Often it is more interesting 
        <i>why</i> events occur than <i>what</i> actually happens. Provide some 
        connection to your visitorís everyday lives or knowledge. Visitors enjoy 
        details, esoteric facts, and analogies, as well as general explanations. 
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Writing style should be clear and casual, adding wit and 
        humor where possible, as in James Lilekís <i>Gallery of Forgettable Food 
        </i>&lt;<a href="http://www.lileks.com/institute/gallery">http://www.lileks.com/institute/gallery</a><i>&gt;</i>. 
        Where possible, you should have your text written by an expert in the 
        field; copy writers tend to by lightweight. For example, University of 
        Wisconsinís excellent <i>Why Files</i> series continually suffers because 
        the text is a bit shallow. Nevertheless, their jovial, casual tone lends 
        considerable interest, as in their exhibit on <i>Avalanches</i> &lt;<a href="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/105avalanche">whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/105avalanche</a><i>&gt;</i> 
        which includes sections like &#34;Canít get no support&#34; and &#34;Slide 
        with pride.&#34;</p>
      <p class="normal">Generally, depth of content is better than breadth. You 
        should provide some overview, and then rapidly focus in on the details 
        of a particular topic. Be sure to cover your topic deeply, exploring multiple 
        aspects. For example, Annenburg/CPBís <i>Cinema: How Are Hollywoodís Films 
        Made? </i>&lt;<a href="http://www.learner.org/exhibits/cinema">http://www.learner.org/exhibits/cinema</a><i>&gt;</i> 
        discusses many parts of the film making process including screenwriting, 
        directing, acting, and editing. </p>
      <p class="normal">It is also useful to include references and interesting 
        links, especially because your audience will often be students or classes, 
        who will want help getting started with further research. Note, that your 
        references and links sections should not be a major section. Links to 
        your bibliography should be a small text link at the bottom of every page. 
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Consider what kinds of views, both two and three dimensional 
        are interesting. What visual element of your topic will be particularly 
        captivating. Your visual content should be vital to your subject, with 
        robust captions that are meaningful, not perfunctory. If you are collecting 
        your images from a stock agency, you should attempt to combine substantive 
        portions of your text with the images so they seem fully integrated. A 
        good exhibit shares many qualities with a photo essay, like Time/Lifeís 
        <i>Country Doctor</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.pathfinder.com/Life/essay/country_doctor">http://www.pathfinder.com/Life/essay/country_doctor</a><i>&gt;</i>. 
      </p>
      <p class="normal">The importance of content is seen in exhibits that are 
        so interesting and well organized that they are successful despite their 
        poor aesthetic and lacking navigation. For example, Marshall Brainís <i>How 
        Stuff Works</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/question137.htm">http://www.howstuffworks.com/question137.htm</a>&gt; 
        and University of Missouri-Kansas Cityís <i>Famous American Trials</i> 
        &lt;<a href="http://www.umkc.edu/famoustrials">http://www.umkc.edu/famoustrials</a>&gt; 
        both contain a wealth of well organized information. </p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Overall structure and approach</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The designerís objective is to educate and entertain, 
        thus creating a memorable experience that leaves the visitor with a new 
        understanding or a new outlook. There many approaches to presenting information, 
        often an unusual approach is the best. Just as a professor has to consider 
        the best approach to teach a topic, so too should you consider your approach. 
        Do you want to focus on case studies? Ask the visitor rhetorical questions? 
        (never make questions mandatory) Explain broad concepts first? Or divide 
        the topic into many narrow slices? </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">There are many elements that you can bring into 
        your organization, and it is often good to design your exhibit so it can 
        be navigated several different ways. By utilizing the flexible organizational 
        possibilities with web design, you can differentiate your exhibit from 
        the corporeal world of textbooks and museums. Use analogies as much as 
        possible. Concentrate creative use of web technology on the most difficult 
        part of your topic for your audience to make the topic more meaningful.</span></p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Organize by conceptual topic.</b> In the Metropolitanís 
        <i>George Washington Crossing the Delaware</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/gw/el_gw.htm">http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/gw/el_gw.htm</a>&gt; 
        the visitor examines various aspects of the painting, such as perspective, 
        color, and motion. In the American Institute of Physicsí <i>Einstein: 
        Image and Impact</i> &lt;<i>http://www.aip.org/history/einstein&gt;</i> 
        parts of Einsteinís live are divided into comprehensive parts based on 
        conceptual topics, not chronology. They clearly lists the topics of the 
        front page. Another example is Annenburg/CPBís <i>Garbage</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.learner.org/exhibits/garbage/intro.html">http://www.learner.org/exhibits/garbage/intro.html</a>&gt; 
        which took a seemingly large area of information, such as garbage, and 
        organized it into specific topics that help the user to become interested 
        in the exhibit. The topics are specific and their names are descriptive 
        of what they represent. The front page has a good navigation and a good 
        introduction. The content of the exhibit is interesting and well organized. 
        The information is presented in the problem solution form, making the 
        user to want to keep reading about the exhibit.</p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Organize by chronology.</b> Sometimes an exhibit is 
        best told in chronological sequence, with a timeline as the main navigation. 
        In Mouseworksí <i>Visible Embryo</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.visembryo.com/baby">http://www.visembryo.com/baby</a>&gt; 
        the stages of embryonic development are organized in sequence. </p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Organize by question/answer.</b> An exhibit can focus 
        on narrow questions. The Metropolitanís <i>A Look at Chinese Paintings</i> 
        &lt;<a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/chinese/html_pages/elegant3.htm">http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/chinese/html_pages/elegant3.htm</a>&gt; 
        asks a series of thought-provoking questions, such as &#34;Why didn&#39;t 
        the artist use any color in this painting?&#34; Another example of questions 
        and answers is our <i>Calendars through the Ages</i> &lt;<a href="http://webexhibits.com/calendars/week.html">webexhibits.com/calendars/week.html</a>&gt; 
        which has been very successful despite the visual paucity and lacking 
        narration. Note, that you should not ask mandatory questions that require 
        a correct answer, like a quiz. Visitors prefer to browse your exhibit 
        and pose their own questions. </p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Organize by physical piece</b>. A natural organization 
        for physical topics it to address each piece, with a break-down diagram 
        for navigation. This is expertly achieved in National Geographicís <i>New 
        York Underground</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.org/nyunderground/docs/nymain.html">http://www.nationalgeographic.org/nyunderground/docs/nymain.html</a>&gt; 
        which explains all the pipes and tunnels beneath the streets of the city. 
        PBS also had a similar approach with <i>Kaboom</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/kaboom/anatomy.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/kaboom/anatomy.html</a>&gt; 
        which explained the anatomy and history of fireworks. The user can click 
        on the diagram that represents the concept in general, to learn about 
        specific parts of the topic.</p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Organize by first-person account</b>. National Geographicís 
        <i>The Underground Railroad</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/features/99/railroad">http://www.nationalgeographic.com/features/99/railroad</a><i>&gt;</i> 
        tells the story of slave escaping from the South during the last century. 
        Instead of simply arranging the facts in a text format, as textbook would, 
        the exhibit personalizes the subject by submerging the viewer into an 
        experience of a slave by making the user make the decisions that the run-away 
        slaves also had to make. The exhibit has a component of education and 
        entertainment in it. It elegantly inserts facts and information about 
        historical figures into a narrative of a run-away slave.</p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Organize hierarchically.</b> Start simple and get more 
        complicated. For example, if you are explaining how a complex device works, 
        start by explaining the basic principles and theory that govern the workings 
        of the device. Give examples of similar, but simpler devices. Provide 
        background information whenever possible. </p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Organize by pigeon hole</b>. Present numerous little 
        facts, and let the visitor synthesize them in their own mind. University 
        of Pennsylvaniaís <i>Wine</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.upenn.edu/museum/Wine/wineegypt.html">http://www.upenn.edu/museum/Wine/wineegypt.html</a>&gt; 
        makes extensive use of small sidebars that help the casual visitor to 
        quickly learn a few facts about the history of wine. </p>
      <p class="normal">Regardless of your approach, it is important to maintain 
        a narrative thread that maintains continuity in the presentation of information. 
        We will continually emphasize this need in this paper. The subtopics should 
        flow from one to another. You are making an <i>exhibit</i> not an <i>encyclopedia</i>. 
        The difference is that an exhibit has a flow. An encyclopedia is merely 
        cross-referenced information. The text and concepts should have narrative 
        direction, and the navigation must reinforce this direction with linear 
        links. We see the need for linear direction in the Hermitageís site &lt;<a href="http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_3_1.html">http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_3_1.html</a>&gt; 
        which has outstanding content and world-class (IBM) development, but no 
        continuity. Their pages are all dead ends. Their clean and simple layout 
        lacks excitement or narrative momentum, and does not &#34;pull the user&#34; 
        though the exhibit. Thus we see that mere organization is not enough, 
        narrative is needed too. </p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Know your audience</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">You must know and keep in mind the audience for 
        whom the exhibit is designed. Although your internet audience typically 
        varies from elementary school classes to undergraduates to grandmothers, 
        it is often best to keep one primary audience in mind, with respect to 
        your <i>tone</i>. Your visitors will be able to adjust to your approach 
        and use those portions of your exhibit that most interest them. You do 
        not want to mix jovial, dramatic, youthful and scholarly writing styles 
        within your exhibit. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">On the other hand, if you have a diverse audience, 
        you should have wide variety of <i>content</i> to help all potential visitors. 
        Realize that some visitors are not familiar with the subject at all, while 
        others may be much more advanced in the subject, and will be looking for 
        sophisticated information. When designing a exhibit for a diverse audience, 
        make sure: 1) your writing style is clear and understandable to the general 
        audience; 2) there is at least one sub page that gives an introduction 
        about the subject for the novice user; 3) the page has good descriptions 
        of its sub pages, so that a user can jump to their appropriate level, 
        instead of scrolling through the pages that may be too simple or sophisticated 
        for his/her level of knowledge. </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Evaluation</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The best exhibit designs result from extensive experience 
        and evaluative testing. You should design your exhibits using your own 
        intuition, while keeping your audience foremost in mind. During development, 
        you should test your exhibit on real audiences. If possible, you may want 
        to retain the services of a professional evaluator. It is often considered 
        reasonable to spend 5-20% of your budget on evaluation. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">A sophisticated evaluation model might include a 
        survey study. During each study, pre- and post-usage surveys can be administered 
        to sample audience, such as a college-level class. Responses to the surveys 
        can be analyzed to assess changes in visitorsí interests, attitudes, and 
        knowledge of your topic, as a consequence of using your exhibit. Additionally, 
        a focus-group study for each exhibit will inform our understanding about 
        your usersí impressions of exhibit content, navigation schemes, and the 
        exhibitís presentation design. Researchers will look for patterns in quantitative 
        and qualitative data they collect, and can propose working hypotheses 
        to explain the effective and ineffective aspects of each exhibit. Credibility 
        of findings can be established through triangulation of methods. Both 
        descriptive and explanatory findings should be noted.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Of course, you can do informal testing as well on 
        your friends, family, and colleagues. It is vital to watch them use your 
        exhibit to discover where your exhibit is inefficient. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">There are several questions you will want to ask 
        yourself. Some starting points include the following:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal"><i>Action</i> ó Does the exhibit stimulate your 
          visitorís interest in the subject? </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal"><i>Appeal</i> ó Is the exhibit interesting and 
          entertaining? Is the content important and informative? </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal"><i>Comprehensibility</i> ó Do users understand 
          the information presented and its implications?</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal"><i>Credibility</i> ó Do users see the exhibitís 
          content as believable and accurate?</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal"><i>Learning Outcomes</i> ó Do users acquire knowledge 
          and information about your topic that they wouldnít be likely to obtain 
          in any other manner? Do users attempt to apply the information acquired 
          from your exhibit to other settings? </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal"><i>Personal Relevance</i> ó Do users relate the 
          exhibitís content and features to what they have experienced in their 
          lives and personal interests?</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal"><i>Usability</i> ó Are the exhibitís features 
          and interface accessible, responsive, and accommodating to different 
          learning, usage, and navigation styles?	</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">Note, that we do not advocate design by committee, 
        nor by focus groups ó in fact, an idiosyncratic design can be much more 
        interesting to visitors. Nevertheless, you <i>should</i> test your exhibit 
        to make sure all portions of it work as you intend. </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Be multidisciplinary </b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Where possible, multidisciplinary approaches are 
        both interesting and highly valuable. In our society today, our educational 
        system produces scientists who have little familiarity with the humanities, 
        and non-scientists with little understanding of scienceñthus perpetuating 
        what C.P. Snow characterized, 40 years ago, as &#34;The Two Cultures.&#34; 
        It need not be that way, and it wasnít 200 years ago. Goethe, recognized 
        today for his genius as a man of letters, himself considered his scientific 
        work ó his theory of colors ó to be his major workÖand indeed he devoted 
        20 years of his life to it. It was about that time that a major division 
        between the arts and sciences began. As the Industrial Revolution brought 
        about an explosion of new knowledge, it became impossible for a single 
        individual to be knowledgeable about everything.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Multimedia techniques can teach highly visual subjects, 
        such as art, more effectively than they have ever been taught. This can 
        be disseminated to enormous audiences over the Internet. In these important 
        respects, the goals of interdisciplinary learning may be better realized 
        online than in the classroom. Multimedia helps tackle many sides of an 
        issue: Human drama. Art. Natural History. Music. Scientific examination.</span></p>
      <p class="normal">Most topics have interesting facets that touch on different 
        disciplines, and visitors are generally responsive to topics that bridge 
        the disciplines. The Exploratoriumís <i>Life along the Faultline</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/faultline">http://www.exploratorium.edu/faultline</a><i>&gt;</i> 
        touches on human drama, actual details of individual quakes, as well as 
        general scientific earthquake information. One of our exhibits, <i>Investigating 
        Belliniís Feast of the Gods</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.webexhibits.org/feast">http://www.webexhibits.org/feast</a><i>&gt;</i> 
        combines art historical information about Renaissance paintings with scientific 
        examination of X-ray and infrared images. </p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Look and feel</b></p>
      <p class="normal">There are an infinite possibilities for exhibit design, 
        which is not the focus of this paper. Generally, however, try to be different. 
        Keep in mind that regardless of your <i>look</i>, you should maintain 
        consistency in your visual design, particularly with your navigational 
        elements. Explore the possibilities of positive and negative space, background 
        images, vibrant or subdued color schemes, symmetrical and asymmetrical 
        layouts, and so on. </p>
      <p class="normal">There are many online and print sources for design ideas. 
        Notable sources include <i>picks</i> by Project Cool &lt;<a href="http://www.projectcool.com/sightings">http://www.projectcool.com/sightings</a><i>&gt;</i> 
        and Communication Arts &lt;<a href="http://www.commarts.com/interactive/index.html?/interactive/sow_archive.html">http://www.commarts.com/interactive/index.html?/interactive/sow_archive.html</a>&gt;.</p>
      <p class="normal">In general, good web design benefits from good use of 
        negative or white space. Open space works well in Clarke Robinsonís <i>In 
        transit</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/~intransit1/home/home_frm.html">http://www.geocities.com/~intransit1/home/home_frm.html</a>&gt; 
        with monochromatic palette in his photo essay of people on the bus in 
        San Francisco. Nonvisual topics also benefit from white space, as in Lisa 
        Kingís AllTold &lt;<a href="http://www.alltold.com/">http://www.alltold.com</a>&gt; 
        exhibit of stories. Vivid colors and clear layout make Edamuraís brief 
        <i>Green Tea of Shizuoko</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.edamura.com/">http://www.edamura.com</a>&gt; 
        appealing. </p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Usability</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">How easy is your exhibit to use? Is it responsive 
        and easy to navigate? Can visually impaired visitors read your text? Does 
        your exhibit work for all typical computer configurations?</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Readability is centered on your fonts and colors. 
        Text should be dark, or visitors can not print your pages. Moreover, dark 
        text on light backgrounds is generally more readable than light on dark. 
        Maintain a high contrast ratio with your text, as visitors have dramatically 
        different gamma settings on their monitors, and varying visual acuity. 
        Text must be large enough to read, and be legible on all platforms. The 
        following combinations work well: <i>Serif:</i> Georgia, Times New Roman, 
        Times, serif. <i>Sans-serif:</i> Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, 
        SunSans-Regular.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Your exhibit must load fast, for both broadband 
        and modem visitors. All images should have height and width tags. Break 
        tables where possible, especially after the top banner/header, so the 
        browser can render the top of the page while loading the rest of the HTML. 
        Optimize all images aggressively. Be sure that Flash/Shockwave sections 
        are offered with sufficient load time warnings and plug-in requirement 
        notification. Make pages with plug-ins gracefully backward compatible. 
        Highly popular exhibit should host static content with providers like 
        Akamai, especially during exhibit launches, and accelerate DNS lookups 
        to local servers. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">All pages should have some sort of instruction of 
        what to do (e.g., &#34;click a painting for info&#34;) unless it is 
        incredibly obvious. You visitors should not have to figure out each page, 
        and wonder what to do. You want to avoid visitor frustration and assure 
        that they view all your content with giving up. </span></p>
      <p class="normal">Image rollovers provide valuable user feedback and visual 
        appeal, but you must never prevent your user from clicking while loading 
        a rollover image. There are two solutions: 1) Preload your rollovers by 
        creating an instance of an image object by setting a variable to <i>new 
        Image()</i>. 2) Use the sophisticated JavaScript scripts used by Adobe 
        GoLive which allow a user to click a hyperlinked image while a rollover 
        image is loading. Use MouseOvers for user feedback or minimizing screen 
        clutter. As in Intelís <i>Bill Viola</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.artmuseum.net/viola2/norealhtml/content/fr_videotapes_dhtml.html">http://www.artmuseum.net/viola2/norealhtml/content/fr_videotapes_dhtml.html</a>&gt; 
        where rolling the cursor over an image displays its caption, and elsewhere 
        &lt;<a href="http://www.artmuseum.net/viola2/norealhtml/content/fr_indepth.html">http://www.artmuseum.net/viola2/norealhtml/content/fr_indepth.html</a>&gt; 
        for displaying subsections.</p>
      <p><span class="normal">It must be obvious to your visitor what is hyperlinked 
        and clickable. If using image maps, you may want to underline the links. 
        If using cascading style sheets to <i>not</i> underline hyperlinks, make 
        sure they are an obviously different color. If using graphical buttons, 
        some sort of visual accentuation is still needed, labels alone are insufficient. 
        Forms of accentuation include: separating the labels from each other (e.g., 
        with lines or borders); accompanying them with some bullet-like graphics 
        (often of triangular shape) or icons; and making the buttons appear bulged 
        or raised above the surface. It is even okay to occasionally say &#34;click 
        a section above.&#34; </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">If you use animation in your design, make sure the 
        animation looks like animation, and does not resemble your user interface 
        cues like mouseOvers. We anticipate that the throbbing buttons in Appleís 
        forthcoming OS X will become more commonplace over the next year. </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Technical/development features</b></p>
      <p class="normal">The internet is more than a distribution tool. The possibilities 
        for interactive multimedia and database driven exhibits are increasing 
        rapidly, and allow unique possibilities to touching your visitors. </p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Magnification.</b> Allow visitors to magnify most of 
        your images. Put a small magnifying glass icon at the bottom edge of an 
        image with a phrase like &#34;Click to enlarge.&#34; Write that message 
        within the image, rahter than as ascii, to avoid confusion with non-graphical 
        browsers. It is nice to put images in a new pop-up a new window, sized 
        to the image. (Set the href to javascript: rather than using an onClick 
        to avoid browser incompatibilities with early version 4 browsers.) You 
        can keep the window on top (in your body tag, set the onblur to self.focus) 
        so visitors do not loose it. IN new windows, keep the menu bar full, and 
        include a &#34;close window&#34; link at the bottom. Discoveryís <i>Captain 
        Kid</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.discovery.com/exp/madagascar/captainkidd/bio1.html">http://www.discovery.com/exp/madagascar/captainkidd/bio1.html</a>&gt; 
        has a nice magnification icon.</p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Image navigation.</b> Consider a robust image viewing 
	system for paintings or photographs that allows the visitor to view many 
	images and magnify them. Opera Primaziale Pisanaís Leaning Tower of Pisa 
	&lt;<a href="http://torre.duomo.pisa.it/index_eng.html">torre.duomo.pisa.it/index_eng.html</a>&gt; 
	includes a navigable collection of thousands of views of the tower for 
	scholarly or casual examination. The Hermitageís <i>Zoom Gallery</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/07/hm7_8.html">http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/07/hm7_8.html</a>&gt; 
	uses a Java applet to let visitors zoom in on any region of a picture 
	close enough to examine each careful brushstroke. We are developing a 
	similar technology &lt;<a href="http://www.webexhibits.org/feast">http://www.webexhibits.org/feast</a><i>&gt;</i> 
	based on JavaScript and DHTML that will similarly allow visitors to zoom 
	into Belliniís <i>Feast of the Gods</i> and pan around as if it were an 
	online map. </p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Temporal models.</b> Explain temporal phenomenon through 
        embedded movies or animated gifs. Jim Williamsí <i>Electric Ballerina 
        </i>&lt;<a href="http://www.novia.net/~jlw/electric/electric.html">http://www.novia.net/~jlw/electric/electric.html</a>&gt; 
        has wire-frame animations to illustrate ballet steps and movements. Depending 
        on the topic, you may also use time-lapse photography. Sometimes, discrete 
        images are better related by morphing between frames for smooth transitions. 
        Where appropriate, live and archived web cams can also be interesting 
        because they seem particularly &#34;real&#34; to visitors, as in the 
        National Museum of Natural Historyís <i>Butterfly Cams</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/butterflies/cams.html">http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/butterflies/cams.html</a>&gt;. 
        If you include video, use at least two methods, such as QuickTime and 
        RealVideo, plus high and low bandwidth streams. </p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Multi-dimensional models.</b> Explain multi-dimensional 
        issues with models. Visitors can experience three dimensions by using 
        virtual reality through QuickTimeVR, or animated &#34;fly by&#34; movies. 
        Parametric models, such as a weather balloon enlarging as it rises, are 
        very well explained by letting the visitor interact with a Shockwave/Flash 
        movie. See Edward Tufteís book series on displaying information visually 
        for inspiration. </p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Audio.</b> Often, audio will enhance your exhibit, 
        or is an integral element, for musical topics. Images, sounds, animation 
        and video help the viewer to perceive the subject from different angles. 
        They make the exhibit much more interesting and useful than a textbook. 
        If using audio, you must always have a means of turning off the audio. 
        Therefore embedded midi or wavs are much less desirable than streaming 
        audio with user controls like RealAudio or Quicktime. Note that if you 
        use long audio loops (e.g., in Flash), you should signal when the loop 
        is over so that users know it is good time to continue. </p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Search capability.</b> If your exhibit contains well 
        over 50 pages, you may benefit from search capabilities, with a robust 
        natural language capable, relevant ranking and boolean aware search. Leading 
        packages for small sites include Thunderstone, Webglimpse, SWISH-E, MondoSearch, 
        PLWeb, and Phantom. Search engines for large sites, over 100,000 pages, 
        require a significant financial investment for installation and ongoing 
        maintenance. Leaders include AltaVista Search, Ultraseek, Verity, FAST 
        Search, Webinator, Excalibur Retrievalware, along with the free open-source 
        engines ht://Dig, PLWeb and Isearch and Microsoft Site Server. If you 
        index pdf files, try to add the file size to the search results listing 
        to warn visitors that the file is a much larger download than an HTML 
        file.</p>
      <p class="normal"><b>DHTML.</b> Dynamic HTML can be remarkable powerful 
        for creating interactivity and narrative without plug-ins. For example, 
        the National Gallery of Artís <i>Manet, The Railway</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.nga.gov/feature/manet/intro.htm">http://www.nga.gov/feature/manet/intro.htm</a>&gt; 
        dissects Manetís painting into pieces by superimposing versions of the 
        picture to accentual different portions of the scene. </p>
      <p class="heading"><b>A meaningful home page</b></p>
      <p class="normal">Your home page should have meaningful content and context, 
        not just a mood setting splash screen. The home page should include several 
        sentences introducing the topic, with navigational links to your subtopics 
        that match the type links used elsewhere in your exhibit. </p>
      <p class="normal">The home page should clearly state the purpose and context 
        of the exhibit, if it is not immediately obvious, and give an indication 
        of the depth to which the exhibit explores your topic. In Howard Hughes 
        Medical Instituteís <i>Seeing, Hearing, and Smelling the World</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.hhmi.org/senses">http://www.hhmi.org/senses</a><i>&gt;</i> 
        the visitor immediately knows what will be available in the exhibit. It 
        is supplied with a graphic that attracts the userís attention. The exhibit 
        is broken down into comprehensive parts with brief descriptions. Careís 
        <i>Madagascar Virtual Field Trip</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.care.org/virtual_trip/madagascar">http://www.care.org/virtual_trip/madagascar</a>&gt; 
        clearly introduces their exhibit with an excellent home page that introduces 
        the story, navigation, and feel of the exhibit. </p>
      <p class="normal">Do not ask visitors to choose a version of your exhibit, 
        depending on their browser, it is a fumbling way to start. Instead use 
        backward compatible JavaScript, or CGI variable to automatically detect 
        the browser type. Macromedia AfterShock provides elegant backward compatible 
        code for Flash/Shockwave. If people have a newer technology installed, 
        use it, and place a link on the bottom of the page, such as &#34;Disable 
        Flash animation.&#34;</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Navigation</b></p>
      <p class="normal">How will your visitorís navigate your exhibit? We recommend 
        <i>combining</i> elements of three paradigms: linear, nonlinear, and hierarchical. 
      </p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Linear navigation</b> allows the visitor to follow 
        a conceptual thread throughout your exhibit by using some combination 
        of &#34;next&#34; and &#34;previous,&#34; or simply &#34;continue&#34; 
        links. It is helpful to also say where the link is going, for example 
        &#34;Continue: learn more about Monetís cataracts.&#34; Compare how 
        much more interesting an exhibit is with linear navigation: In the National 
        Gallery of Artís <i>Alfred Stieglitz</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.nga.gov/feature/stieglitz/asmain.htm">http://www.nga.gov/feature/stieglitz/asmain.htm</a>&gt;, 
        their layout is lovely, but the visitor has to choose what links to click 
        to navigate. On the other hand, their <i>Manet, The Railway</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.nga.gov/feature/manet/intro.htm">http://www.nga.gov/feature/manet/intro.htm</a>&gt; 
        the exhibit immediately places the user at the beginning of a linear story, 
        with nonlinear navigation in the top left corner. Another example from 
        American Museum of Natural Historyís <i>Epidemic: The World of Infectious 
        Disease</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/epidemic">http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/epidemic</a><i>&gt;</i> 
        uses the word &#34;continue&#34; in combination with an iconized arrow 
        providing an ideal combination. Again, the need for linear direction is 
        clearly seen in Britannicaís voluminous <i>Normandy</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.normandy.eb.com/">http://www.normandy.eb.com</a>&gt; 
        which has vast content, but no overall narrative. If you are careful, 
        if may also be successful to have more than one narrative thread weave 
        throughout your site, with different themes, such as &#34;history&#34; 
        and &#34;biographies.&#34;</p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Nonlinear navigation</b> is the hallmark of the word 
        wide web ó it is the ability to jump from page to page in a manner impossible 
        in the corporeal world of everyday life. Nonlinear navigation facilitates 
        casual and impulsive browsing, and is efficient for cross-referencing. 
        The need for nonlinear navigation is acutely seen in Women of the Westís 
        <i>There Are No Renters Here</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.wowmuseum.org/gallery/sod/sod0.html">http://www.wowmuseum.org/gallery/sod/sod0.html</a>&gt; 
        photo essay. Their layout is very similar to the National Gallery exhibit 
        above, but their lack of hyperlinks and section headings constrains the 
        visitor. Successful nonlinear navigation is used by Discoveryís <i>Humpbacks 
        of Madagascar </i>&lt;<a href="http://www.discovery.com/exp/humpbacks/humpbacks.html">http://www.discovery.com/exp/humpbacks/humpbacks.html</a>&gt; 
        where section heads are always present. Another helpful device is the 
        JavaScript enhanced URL pop-up menu. Pop-up menus should display a &#34;Go&#34; 
        button on non-JavaScript browsers. Good exhibits liberally fill the text 
        with many cross-referencing hyperlinks, and frame the exhibit with consistent 
        section headings. </p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Hierarchical navigation</b> is the presentation of 
        a navigational tree, or layered history of the visitorís current location 
        in your exhibit. An example being: &#34;Home &gt; Paintings &gt; Renaissance 
        &gt; Bellini&#34; at the top of each page which allow the visitor to 
        move <i>backward</i>. Another common approach is simply to make all section 
        headings visible at all time, as in National Geographicís <i>Coffee</i> 
        &lt;<a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/coffee/ax">http://www.nationalgeographic.com/coffee/ax</a><i>&gt;</i> 
        where the section heading is noted in red, allowing the visitor to move 
        <i>laterally</i> to other subsections. New hierarchical navigations are 
        becoming possible that represent the entire document structure to be quickly 
        navigated using DHTML. Hierarchical navigation both shows the visitor 
        <i>where they are</i>, and helps them go to <i>other pages</i>. </p>
      <p class="normal">It is important that your visitor always know where they 
        are. In you have a navigational banner, you should clearly mark the section 
        visitors are in. The navigation should not be hidden, rather you should 
        choose a navigation that is intertwined with the organization, that way 
        the navigation is also providing a conceptual context. In Joseph Mooreís 
        <i>The first 9 months </i>&lt;<a href="http://www.pregnancycalendar.com/first9months">http://www.pregnancycalendar.com/first9months</a><i>&gt;</i> 
        there are interesting animations and screen transitions, but the central 
        visual theme are numerals representing each phase in a babyís development, 
        and the navigation in a central design element (exhibit requires Flash). 
        Likewise, in Howard Shatzís photography exhibit &lt;<a href="http://www.pdn-pix.com/legends7/gallery2_1.html">http://www.pdn-pix.com/legends7/gallery2_1.html</a><i>&gt;</i> 
        thumbnails for each photograph are assembled as a collage, and are visual 
        focus on the page. Corbisí <i>Ansel Adams</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.corbis.com/anseladams/gallery">http://www.corbis.com/anseladams/gallery</a>&gt; 
        effectively uses frames and rollovers for navigation. </p>
      <p class="normal">Another very useful technique is to note the number of 
	pages in a section, with links to each page in text, and the current page 
	number noted some way. PBSís <i>American Photography</i>, &lt;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/ktca/americanphotography/features/digital_essay.html">http://www.pbs.org/ktca/americanphotography/features/digital_essay.html</a>&gt; 
	has pretty little numbers in boxes, which are elegant and effective. University 
	of Wisconsinís <i>Why Files</i> &lt;<a href="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/081art_sci/">whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/081art_sci/</a>&gt; 
	places &#34;There are 1 2 3 4 5 6 pages in this feature.&#34; on the 
	bottom of each page. Kodakís <i>Digital Innovators</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.kodak.com/go/innovators">http://www.kodak.com/go/innovators</a>&gt; 
	uses unnumbered little squares for navigation. </p>
      <p class="normal">There are some topics which are performance art, wherein 
        the presentation of the content is more interesting than the actual information. 
        In this case, authors generally wish to diverge dramatically from normal 
        navigational paradigms, but they maintain a narrative theme, and usually 
        have instructions on the screen, like &#34;click the heart.&#34; Interesting 
        examples are found in Bennetonís <i>Colors</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.benetton.com/colors">http://www.benetton.com/colors</a><i>&gt;</i>. 
        Rarely, navigational oddities can help convey your message, as in United 
        States Holocaust Memorial Museumís <i>Hidden History of the Kovno Ghetto</i> 
        &lt;<a href="http://www.ushmm.org/kovno/main.htm">http://www.ushmm.org/kovno/main.htm</a>&gt; 
        where hiding the navigation reinforces their message about the &#34;hidden&#34; 
        history. Occasionally, totally new navigational schemes are acceptable, 
        if you design it with the userís needs in mind. Recent navigational oddities 
        include Bård Edlundís home page &lt;<a href="http://www.edlundart.com/">http://www.edlundart.com</a>&gt; 
        in February 2000 (it changes often) who achieves a simple elegance with 
        animated gifs that accentuation his navigational elements. </p>
      <p class="normal">Do not apply corporeal metaphors from &#34;physical museums&#34; 
        to your design. Virtual museum tours are rarely interesting. It is confusing 
        to label your sections as &#34;room 1&#34; &#34;room 2&#34; &#34;information 
        kiosk&#34; etc. Rather, use names like &#34;Early Impressionists&#34; 
        &#34;Late Impressionists&#34; and &#34;Help.&#34;</p>
      <p><b class="heading">Icons</b></p>
      <p class="normal">Judicious use of icons can be helpful parts of your navigational 
        scheme. As discussed above, an arrow icon can help a &#34;continue&#34; 
        link considerably, augmenting the meaning in a nonverbal way. Similarly, 
        a magnifying glass helps a &#34;zoom&#34; link, and the now ubiquitous 
        &#34;shopping cart&#34; icon is helpful. If you are spawning new windows 
        for help screen or magnifying images, an icon made of overlapping squares 
        is quite effective to indicate that a new window will appear. Icons are 
        not useful when they are unfamiliar, however, and you should not rely 
        on unusual icons for navigation. There are very few icons that are wholly 
        obvious. Generally text labels are better.</p>
      <p class="normal">Icons should be used when the visual clue <i>augments</i> 
        the textual message. For example, a department store might pair a tuxedo 
        icon with the word &#34;menís wear&#34; to suggests formal attire. Likewise, 
        Cooper-Hewittís <i>Design for Daily Life</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.si.edu/ndm/dfl/daily/start.htm">http://www.si.edu/ndm/dfl/daily/start.htm</a>&gt; 
        used photographs as icons, and the pairing of an embroidered silk vest 
        with the words &#34;dress&#34; instantly conveys that the section is 
        be about highly formal dress for 18th century gentlemen. </p>
      <p class="normal">Examples of useless icons include Chemistry Societyís 
        Networkís <i>Visual Interpretations of the Table of Elements</i>, with 
        an incomprehensible navigation page &lt;<a href="http://www.chemsoc.org/viselements/pages/page3.html">http://www.chemsoc.org/viselements/pages/page3.html</a>&gt; 
        which practically hides the exhibitís core attraction of novel views of 
        the periodic table extruded as landscapes &lt;<a href="http://www.chemsoc.org/viselements/pages/mass_view2.html">http://www.chemsoc.org/viselements/pages/mass_view2.html</a>&gt;. 
        Other examples of meaningless icons in otherwise outstanding exhibits 
        include PBSís <i>The Greeks</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/htmlver/index.html">http://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/htmlver/index.html</a>&gt;, 
        National Geographicís <i>Millennium</i> &lt;<a href="http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/2000/index.cfm">magma.nationalgeographic.com/2000/index.cfm</a>&gt;, 
        and nonobvious next/previous arrows the French Cultural Ministryís <i>Chauvet-Pont-d&#39;arc 
        Cave </i>&lt;<a href="http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/arcnat/chauvet/en/album.htm">http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/arcnat/chauvet/en/album.htm</a>&gt;. 
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Sometimes icons are needed. In American Museum of Natural 
        Historyís <i>Siberian Expedition: Wrangel Island </i>&lt;<a href="http://www.amnh.org/science/expeditions/siberia/objectbody.html">http://www.amnh.org/science/expeditions/siberia/objectbody.html</a>&gt; 
        they have an enlargable map, with the phrase &#34;Click on map to see 
        detail&#34; which is unintuitive in context, and would be much better 
        replaced with an icon. </p>
      <p class="heading"><b>The user likes to interact and to be in control </b></p>
      <p class="normal">Visitors should be able to anticipate where a link where 
        lead, and have an immediate sense of the type of content it will provide. 
        This way, visitors are not disappointed and they are more likely to explore. 
      </p>
      <p class="normal">Exhibits should be designed so that the user can easily 
        navigate between different topics of the homepage. Even though a web page 
        may have a suggested path that the user should follow while exploring 
        the exhibit, ultimately it should be the user who decides which links 
        to go to first and last. The traveling between the sub pages should be 
        easy. Do now spawn your content into a new specially sized window, it 
        is annoying, as in Kodakís <i>American Mile Markers</i> &lt;<a href="http://www.kodak.com/go/onTheRoad" class="normal">http://www.kodak.com/go/onTheRoad</a>&gt;. 
        Within-page anchors are confusing because the visitor is expecting a new 
        page, and may wonder why they are on the same page still. </p>
      <p class="normal">Interactive games and quizzes testing the userís progress 
        in exploring the subject area are sometimes desirable, assuming that the 
        games and the quizzes are optional for the users. Some users might become 
        quite annoyed if they are forced to play games and quizzes, and may never 
        come back to the exhibit.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Small niceties</b></p>
      <p class="normal">There are several nice touches you can add to your exhibit 
        ó similar to adding &#34;cup-holders&#34; to a new automobileñto enhance 
        visitorsí experience. </p>
      <p><b><span class="normal">External links</span></b><span class="normal"> 
        should be clearly identified so that people know they will go to another 
        exhibit. This is a particularly important to differentiate within-exhibit 
        cross references from referrals to other exhibits. If you use an external-link 
        cgi to track referrals, do<i> not</i> display a legal notice.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Make favicon.ico files</b> in your root directory 
        so that IE users who bookmark your exhibit get a pretty custom bookmark 
        icon. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Add desktop pictures</b> that visitors can place 
        on their desktop with large, interesting images from the exhibit. Choose 
        pictures that will work well when covered with many icons and windows. 
        Images should be offered as jpegs in two sizes: 800 x 600, and 1024 x 
        768. This is a useful way to leave a lasting memory for your visitors, 
        and to reinforce the &#34;brand&#34; of your organization. If you choose 
        to write your organizationís name or exhibit on the desktop picture, we 
        recommend you use subtle transparent typography. </span></p>
      <p><b><span class="normal">Use shortcut URLs</span></b><span class="normal"> 
        to access your exhibit. For example, visitors can reach Kodakís exhibits 
        by typing, for example &lt;<a href="http://www.kodak.com/go/ontheroad">http://www.kodak.com/go/ontheroad</a>&gt; 
        which immediately redirects the visitor to &lt;<a href="http://www.kodak.com/US/en/corp/features/onTheRoad/home/index.shtml">http://www.kodak.com/US/en/corp/features/onTheRoad/home/index.shtml</a>&gt;. 
        This is particularly useful if you are using an internal proxy and rewriting 
        module on your web server to map remote servers into the local namespace, 
        and you need to have long URLs.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Page URLs</b> or the main exhibit URL should 
        be at the bottom of each page, so that visitors can return to your exhibit 
        by using a hard copy. You can write that shortcut on the bottom of each 
        page so if people print the exhibit, they can come back easily.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>The &lt;<i>Title</i>&gt;</b> should be useful 
        both in search engines and when people look at their bookmarks or back/history 
        button. Note that to avoid spamming, search engines increasingly weight 
        title matches, so they are more important than a few years ago. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>JavaScript enhance</b> all URL pop-up menus. 
        If JavaScript is enabled, do <i>not </i>display a &#34;Go&#34; button. 
        </span></p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Include a thorough bibliography and links</b>. An annotated 
        bibliography is desired, and if permissible, links straight to a bookstore 
        like Amazon (or multiple bookstores) is convenient both for purchasing 
        books, and for accessing book information like ISBN numbers for libraries. 
        If there is useful information on the internet, a links page is always 
        useful, especially for classes which will use your exhibit as part of 
        their research. It is best to have detailed descriptions of the exhibits 
        you link to, so visitors know the quality of the exhibits and what sort 
        of information they will provide. Suggested style for your description 
        may be found at our exhibit, the WebExhibits Catalogue &lt;<a href="http://www.webexhibits.org/">http://www.webexhibits.org</a>&gt;.</p>
      <p><b><span class="normal">Create a mailing list</span></b><span class="normal"> 
        to notify visitors of future exhibits you produce. Two leading packages 
        are ListServ and Lyris, we particularly like the automatic unsubscribe 
        abilities of Lyris. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Localize</b> your content in a few different 
        languages, such as English, Spanish, and French, using templates with 
        php/Zend or jsp to allow ready interchange of text, while keeping your 
        images and layout the same. </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>HTML coding approaches</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Given the great diversity in screen sizes, a liquid 
        layout that adjusts to the window size is desirable. Fixed width layouts 
        should not be set too wide. Also, be sure the right side of the screen 
        is attractive. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Frames are generally disliked by users because they 
        are slow to load, near impossible to bookmark (or be indexed by search 
        engines), and they are rarely sized correctly for smaller-than-average 
        and large-than-average screens. If you must use frames for scrolling content 
        within the browser window, strongly consider rebuilding the entire frameset 
        with a target=&#34;_top&#34; for most pages so that bookmarks will function. 
        Although the pages will load slower this way, bookmarks will work. </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p class="normal">The suggestions presented in this paper are based on our 
        observation of thousands of online exhibits, and reflect the state of 
        the art in early 2000. In the coming years, we expect both wireless internet 
        and broadband to spread widely. Soon, the majority of your visitors will 
        have full screen streaming video and CD-quality surround sound. When traveling, 
        your visitors will frequently use portable &#34;WAP&#34; devices with 
        low resolution screens. Technologies for serving broadband and wireless 
        content are already readily available and should be used soon. By looking 
        forward with your application design, you can create exhibits that function 
        well for modem, broadband, and wireless users, thus bringing memorable 
        and engaging information to ever widening audiences. </p>
