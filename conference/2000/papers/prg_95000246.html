      <p class="heading">Heritage, Classrooms and the World Wide Web: A Teacher 
        Educator&#39;s Perspective on the Gateway to Learning Materials Project</p>
      <p class="author"><b>John Myers, Ontario Institute for Studies in Education 
        of the University of Toronto, Canada</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote> <b> </b> 
        <p class="small">Teachers are busy people and the demands on their time 
          will only increase with new curriculum projects in many jurisdictions. 
          In addition the profession is changing as the generation of teachers 
          hired in the 60s and early 1970s is being replaced by new teachers with 
          new skills. While the use of information technology seems to be just 
          one more thing teachers have to cope with, the coming generation of 
          teachers may be in a good position to fulfill the possibilities offered 
          by IT. As an educator and consumer of technology, my collaboration with 
          this project illustrates possibilities for teachers to:</p>
        <p class="small">ï keep current with IT in general</p>
        <p class="small">ï develop links with museums and heritage sites at a 
          local, provincial and national level</p>
        <p class="small">I will provide feedback from teacher candidates at OISE/UT 
          who have examined the CHIN and related sites.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="normal">Schools seem to be awash in technology, or at least talk 
        about it. For example, <i>Educational Leadership, </i> the flagship magazine 
        of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development is a major 
        opinion-shaper in schools in the U.S. and Canada. with a readership of 
        about 170 000 (Henson, 1999). It regularly features technology as a major 
        theme (April, 1994; Oct. 1995; Nov. 1996; Nov. 1997; Feb. 1999, Oct., 
        1999).</p>
      <p class="normal">Most of the national U.S. education magazines like <i>Educational 
        Leadership</i> and <i>Phi Delta Kappan, </i> magazines<i> </i> from which 
        we in Canada get many of our notions about trends to follow, have regular 
        sections on information technology.</p>
      <p class="normal">The buzz about new technologies is getting even louder. 
        The same <i>Educational Leadership</i> plans to focus on information technology 
        in not one but two issues in the 2000-2001 school years (October and December).</p>
      <p class="normal">Furthermore, the focus on technology influences discussions 
        on other important school-related issues. For example, something as traditional 
        as &#34;literacy&#34; is being redefined to take into account the need 
        to use information technology effectively Walker, 1999; Rafferty, 1999; 
        O&#39;Grady, 1999). The Canadian-based Gateway to Learning Materials Project 
        is part of this technological tide.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>The Busy World of Teachers</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Teachers are busy people. Every day, in every class, 
        a teacher makes hundreds of decisions as s/he juggles curriculum content, 
        classroom questions, student activities and classroom management so that 
        thirty students or so can </span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">develop positive attitudes and perceptions about 
          learning, themselves their classmates and teachers</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">acquire new knowledge and organize it so that 
          it integrates with what they already know and can do</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">extend and refine such knowledge using simple 
          skills such as comparison, classification, induction and deduction, 
          abstracting, error analysis and the like</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">apply their knowledge in meaningful ways such 
          as problem-solving, decision-making, investigating and experimenting</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">develop sound habits of mind such as flexible 
          thinking, perseverance, suspension of judgement and critical thinking 
          (Marzano, 1992).</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">Helping students attain this wide range of outcomes 
        is further complicated by the diversity existing among the learners in 
        every class. Students differ in so many ways. In addition to &#34;cognitive 
        capacity&#34;, they differ in background and experience, language fluency, 
        motivation, learning style, and interests. While such diversity is seen 
        as a good in Canadaís bilingual and multiethnic society, it does challenge 
        teachers as they try to &#34;teach to each&#34;.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Teachers have to make their hundreds of classroom 
        decisions immediately. They are aware that students will respond in unpredictable 
        ways to any of these decisions. Such responses are quite public. All the 
        classroom is a stage and teachers and students play a variety of roles 
        during that performance we call a lesson.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">These complexities are not necessarily a recipe 
        for disaster. They do represent, however, the way things are in classes. 
        Unlike other professionals, teachers have to work with batches of students 
        and have little choice over their schedules or workload.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">When we ignore such classroom realities in our zeal 
        for meaningful educational change, we risk failure in our efforts. My 
        boss, Michael Fullan, Dean at OISE/ UT, has made a career out of documenting 
        how the history of educational change has too often been a history of 
        failure (Fullan, 1991). This pattern is a long-standing feature of schools 
        in North America (see Cuban &amp; Tyack, 1995, Sarason, 1993).</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Current calls for rigor, restructuring, standards 
        and accountability in schools have been made before. Perhaps history repeats 
        itself because we donít get it right the first time. School reform repeats 
        itself every decade or so. Most changes skip over the waters and never 
        get to the deep powerful currents that shape school and classroom life. 
        Classrooms are much more stable than their defenders or critics imagine!</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Let me offer an example of change denied relevant 
        to this conference. I have two television sets mounted in the walls of 
        my classroom at OISE/ UT (Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of 
        the University of Toronto). They have been there gathering dust ever since 
        I was a teacher-candidate thirty years ago. In the early 1970s educational 
        TV was seen as the great panacea for what ails students. So, in order 
        to be on the cutting change of this inevitable change, the university 
        installed televisions in many of its classrooms, since they represented 
        the future.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">&#34;No more teachers, no more books, now that 
        TV has us hooked.&#34;</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The future never works out the way you think. Remember 
        the paperless office and the four-day week? Earlier generations had the 
        death of movies and radio to consider when television was invented.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Will information technology go the same way as those 
        television sets in my classroom?</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Perhaps. If nuclear weaponry was the mythic icon 
        of the last age, the internet is the mythic icon now. There is something 
        about the advocates of ebooks, on-line banking, virtual classrooms, and 
        the world wide web that make teachers roll their eyes. Experienced teachers 
        have seen all this before. Lots of initial money, &#34;gurus&#34;, who 
        are long on promise and short on delivery, are soon doing the conference 
        circuit. When problems arise in implementation, and they do even with 
        good ideas, we donít have the support to work through them, for weíre 
        on to the next fad. Does anyone really believe that spending millions 
        of dollars on computers will instantly turn a classroom full of Bart Simpsons 
        into literate, numerate, civil, knowledgeable human beings?</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">&#34;On the eighth day we went on-line and lo! 
        they can read.&#34;</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">But then again, perhaps information technology is 
        here to stay. The cold war is over. South Africa has shed apartheid, money 
        no longer grows on trees but comes out of walls via the ATM . So much 
        of what we take for granted in this new century was science fiction in 
        the last. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Is IT science fiction, reality, or soon to be relegated 
        to the &#34;dustbin of history&#34; to quote Karl Marx, a figure we 
        donít talk much about any more.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Using IT in Social Studies: Pitfalls and Possibilities</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Most of the teachers I work with in Ontario and 
        in other parts of Canada are history, geography and social studies teachers. 
        While it is dangerous to make too much of anecdotal evidence, I believe 
        that social studies teachers have been slower to consider the merits of 
        information technology than teachers in other areas of the curriculum. 
        I note that my teacher-candidates see very few examples of classroom work 
        directly involving on-line information technology, though they see lots 
        of evidence of student research based on the web. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Recently two anthologies of research and practice 
        in social studies education in Canada have been published (Case and Clark, 
        1997; Wright and Sears, 1997). The combined 61 chapters written by forty 
        of the leading social studies teachers and scholars in the country represent 
        the current state-of-the-art in the field. Yet there is only one chapter 
        focusing on the use of IT in the social studies classroom. Unhappily, 
        it is not mine.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The one exception, Susan Gibsonís &#34;Integrating 
        Computer Technology in Social Studies: Pitfalls and Possibilities&#34; 
        (Gibson, 1997) presents, in my view, a realistic view of the issues for 
        teachers. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Among the possibilities she sees in computer technology 
        are:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">enhanced learner motivation through novelty and 
          excitement which is not wearing off as the technology changes from stand-alone 
          PCs and MACS to the internet</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">increased access to information so that students 
          learn how to manage as well as acquire new knowledge at blistering speed</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">perceived authenticity by students as they get 
          a view of the wider world previously only possible through travel and 
          use a technology they believe to be a component of their adult work 
          life</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">increased individualization as the internet offers 
          data in a variety of ways in an almost infinite number of forms which 
          students can access and manipulate at their own pace</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">expanded interactions since IT is an active medium, 
          in contrast to the passivity of TV</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">opportunities for collaboration as computers 
          reshape classrooms into workshops and away from mini-lecture halls</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">expanded representation of ideas through multimedia</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">increased productivity in developing products, 
          including written and multimedia work.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">Among the pitfalls she sees are:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">mindless fact gathering and downloading of information 
          from the net without attention to issues of bias, accuracy and quality 
          control</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">poor curriculum coverage killed the promise of 
          educational television; while the amount of ready information on the 
          world wide web is vast, there is concern that it will distort the curriculum 
          as the curriculum changes to fit the ready-made resources on various 
          web sites</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">reduced reading development is a worry since 
          much of the on-line information is pictorial in form</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">diminished writing skills as students cut and 
          paste information into &#34;polished-looking&#34; first drafts and 
          resist the need to refine their work</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">neglected research skills as students take the 
          easy way out, clicking and pointing instead of planning and thinking</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">need for critical thinking so that students not 
          fall into the trap of accepting the information as the &#34;truth&#34; 
          or assuming that information equals deep understanding</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">absence of real life experience since a virtual 
          environment is not the same thing as a real-life environment</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">reduced direct interaction is also a concern 
          as students on-line are physically separated from each other; we donít 
          need to go to the tragedy of Columbine high school to recognize the 
          dangers of social isolation among adolescents in a frenetic world.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">Yet since the mid-ninetiesóthat sounds so distantóthings 
        have changed rapidly.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">There is been a flurry of useful work from the U.S. 
        which canít help but interest us (for example see <i>Surfing Social Studies 
        </i> (Braun and Risinger (1999) for a sample of ideas). Our national journal, 
        <i>Canadian Social Studies</i>, now has a regular column The provincial 
        bodies have followed suit. Recently these subject councils have joined 
        to establish a national web site, something unthinkable even a few years 
        ago *.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">But we have seen this before, teachers who have 
        been around the block will say. This too shall pass.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Will it?</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Changing Teachers, Changing Times</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">It seems to me that there are a couple of developments 
        which suggest that IT is here to stay. The investments in money and time 
        by all sectors of the society, both in the public and private sectors, 
        seem overwhelming and while we can shape the direction we canít stop the 
        train any more than the Luddites halted Britain move to industrialize 
        in the early 1800s..</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">I also look at my teacher-candidates. Six years 
        ago, very few had any experience in computer technology compared to student-teachers 
        in math and science. So I introduced them to email conferencing, word 
        processing, data management and search techniques. Now almost all of them 
        are &#34;fluent&#34;. They can teach the skills to those few who need 
        them. This includes me on occasion. I have assignments on-line. These 
        &#34;rookies&#34; are going out into schools in which <b>they</b> are 
        the experts. For example, Jennifer went to her new position as a history 
        teacher in a Toronto school and became the director for the computer programming 
        course in one year because most of the veteran teachers lacked her skills 
        and knowledge.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">And teachers in Ontario are now being hired in droves. 
        In the next few years there will be a huge turnover as the baby-boomers 
        retire: to be replaced by teachers with a new set of skills (McIntyre, 
        1998). The new ones are not technophobes. These changes in teacher demographics 
        in Ontario are happening in parts of the United States and will soon occur 
        in the remaining states and provinces.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">A state of shortage also applies to the new leaders 
        in the system (McIntyre, 1999). For example, I teach a course for teachers 
        who want &#34;specialist&#34; qualifications: qualifications needed 
        to become school administrators. The major work of the course has teachers 
        identify an issue of concern in their classes and conduct classroom research 
        based on their issue. Next to literacy, computer technology is the most 
        important issue according to these future leaders.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Itís quite interesting to read what these future 
        leaders say as it provides insight into their thinking and perhaps offers 
        a few clues into future directions for those of us who see a brighter 
        world for museum education because of the promise of technology. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">For example, some history and social studies teachers 
        are also teacher-librarians. Some of these people are quick to see the 
        possibilities and the pitfalls (Hutchison, DiGambattista and Vella, 1998: 
        Locke and Roberts, 1998). Among the issues they have identified through 
        their reviews of the literature and their own experiences in four secondary 
        schools outside of Toronto include</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">keeping up with the hardware and software in 
          an area of shrinking budgets and increasing demands on staff</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">the need for professional development opportunities 
          for &#34;technophobes&#34; so that teachers and students can make 
          the most productive use of information technology</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">providing sufficient access for all students 
          when library resource centres are finding it difficult to stay open 
          during school hours as funding gets cut back</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">security and safety issues arising from the work 
          of hackers and the potential of student to use the technology inappropriately 
          </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">Nevertheless, information technology is here to 
        stay they believe and they need to find ways to work with it.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">History teachers without a background in information 
        technology or library science seem quite unsure. For example, Bye (1999) 
        perceived a lack of interest among social studies teachers and supervisors 
        in information technology in his urban school district. But by working 
        with students who were interested in IT and who viewed it as a learning 
        tool, he overcame a strong personal cynicism that he held at the beginning 
        of his project.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Campanelli (2000) reviewed much of the literature 
        and watched her students and colleagues. In addition to reinforcing the 
        pitfalls and possibilities Susan Gibson raised (op. cit.), she identified 
        a few of her own based on the Ontario context. These included the following. 
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">First, references to information technology coming 
        from the Ministry of Education were considered &#34;hype&#34;, in part 
        because the minister had no background in education and during his short 
        tenure was very unpopular with teachers. Secondly, the sites never seemed 
        to match the expectations of the new curriculum, resulting in some teacher 
        frustration. Thirdly, she identified issues around access and connectivity. 
        For example, the of speed of downloading became an issue because it seemed 
        to her that the better the site, the longer you had to wait. Surfing the 
        net was a fourth issues since it seemed to take excessive time. An finally, 
        once students found good site,s the work they downloaded was not understood.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"> Donevan (2000) examined the work of Campanelli, 
        Bye, Locke and others as he worked with two grade ten and one grade eleven 
        history class. His grade eleven students completed a survey and raised 
        issues similar to those raised by Campanelli; namely,</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">the lack of speed on school computers</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">the time wasted surfing for good sites and putting 
          up with poor ones (several students complained whenever they accidentally 
          hit a pornographic site)</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">the level of hype from the media about the importance 
          of computers and the internet in general for their future careers.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">When Donevan observed his grade ten classes he noted 
        how they would rush to the machines in the library (those that were working) 
        and engage in what might be called &#34;thoughtless enjoyment&#34;. 
        They would delightfully download information and forget the planning sequence 
        they had been introduced to in class for organizing their work and their 
        thinking. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">His conclusions were not positive. He saw three 
        important issues: The first concern was his perception of student over 
        reliance on IT to do their work and their thinking for them. In the lower 
        secondary grades, they had the view that if it&#39;s on the web it must be 
        good (a carry-over from typical student views of information in text books)</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The second issue was his studentsí inability to 
        research effectively. For too many of his grade tens, research equalled 
        &#34;point&#34;, &#34;click&#34;, and &#34;download&#34;.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">His third issue brings us back to our dilemma about 
        the impact of technology; namely, if it is here to stay, how does the 
        teacher work with his/her students?</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">My teachers working in the Specialist courses were 
        both interested in and alarmed by what they saw when students went on-line. 
        Yet they continue to look for on-line possibilities for productive student 
        work, unlike more veteran teachers whom it was thought would not get involved 
        in the first place.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">So with a massive influx of new teachers and new 
        leaders, both possessing skills and dispositions towards maximizing the 
        possibilities of information technology, this change has a much greater 
        chance of sticking, despite the concerns.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The need for using the web may be reinforced by 
        the changes in curriculum happening in all parts of Canada: paralleling 
        similar reform efforts in the U.S. With new topics and the usual lag-time 
        before traditional resources such as textbooks catch up with the demand, 
        teachers are searching the web. In my curriculum area, museums and heritage 
        sites have always been important, as field trip sites and places for student 
        independent research. Developments in information technology may increase 
        and deepen connections among these groups as new teachers looks for new 
        resources and new ways of introducing these to their increasingly sophisticated 
        (at least in some levels) students. Where does the Gateway to Learning 
        Materials project fit?</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Gateway to Learning Materials Project </b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">I have spent a great deal of time presenting a context 
        for my role in the Project. The tone so far seems pessimistic. While that 
        is not my intent, I want us to be cautious. Given the history of educational 
        change, I feel that we should not underestimate the challenge of meaningful 
        change. In the previous section I expressed optimism, hidden among the 
        negative perceptions, that the time and circumstances have come together 
        for us to make some meaningful changes, provided we are mindful of the 
        pitfalls as well as the possibilities.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">My colleagues have already described the Project 
        from their perspectives. They have described how students and teachers 
        have come to use the CHIN and related sites for a variety of purposes 
        across the curriculum. They have noted how we have learned from each other 
        and from related efforts in on-line distributed environments: from Schoolnet, 
        GEM, Alberta Heritage On-line, la Musée McCord and others. They 
        have identified many of the important issues for teachers and students. 
        Here are some examples:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">The development of controlled vocabulary seems 
          so simple until you realize that educational terms change from province 
          to province and sometimes from year to year. In Ontario the term &#34;objectives&#34; 
          has changed to &#34;outcomes&#34; to &#34;expectations&#34; in less 
          than five years. Soon we may use &#34;results&#34; or some other word.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Access to IT is an issue for many heritage sites 
          and museums and still is for many schools. With several platforms being 
          used and different hardware of varying amounts of sophistication, memory 
          and on-line capabilities, it is a challenge to design a site accessible 
          to all potential clients. I still have teacher-candidates who do not 
          own a computer. There are still schools in Ontario that are not on-line. 
          And of course, students in a class will vary in their skills in IT and 
          their access to up-to-date hardware and software.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Funding is always an issue in the public sector, 
          even with the volunteer work of dedicated professionals. While love 
          makes the world go round, someone has to pay for the trip.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="heading"><b>How Has the Project Influenced Me?</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In addition to working with some extremely talented 
        people dans les deux langues officielles du Canada, I have been reminded 
        of the importance of collaboration and the power of teams with a diversity 
        of talents, the fact that the educational and heritage communities have 
        so much to offer each other. It was a little more than a year ago when 
        some of us met for the one and only time prior to this conference. We 
        were at another conference. Giving the Past A Future, held in Montreal 
        January 29-31, 1999 and sponsored by a number of organizations interested 
        in history including the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada and 
        the CRB Foundation. The web site &lt;&lt;http://www.historymatters.com&gt;&gt; 
        contains papers from the conference. This was the first time that people 
        from schools, the academic and heritage communities had really met. The 
        gaps in perceptions were great. Being involved in this project has been 
        an education for me.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">As Adriana has noted at the conclusion of her paper, 
        assessment is a key issue. In that regard I have a group of teacher-candidates 
        who will, by the time this paper is presented, have done some assessment 
        of the CHIN and related sites using criteria such as accessibility and 
        curriculum fit. I trust that they will offer some useful feedback for 
        the next stage of our project.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>A Final? Thought</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Am I optimistic that heritage, classrooms, and the 
        world wide web can have a glorious future together? Let me answer that 
        with a famous line from movie history. After all the chaos of the final 
        scenes and the uncertainty of their futures, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) turns 
        to Captain Renault (Claude Rains) and says &#34;Louis, I think this is the 
        beginning of a beautiful friendship.&#34;.</span></p>
