      <blockquote class="small"> 
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many virtual worlds available on the web provide reconstructions 
          of urban environments – either real or imaginary. Still, they do not 
          exploit the temporal dimension, i.e., they do not enable users to change 
          the time context as exploration proceeds and to dynamically adapt the 
          virtual environment to different temporal frames. We support this kind 
          of experience, which we call <i>3D temporal navigation, </i>in a web 
          site under construction at Politecnico di Milano called &#34;Milan 
          along the centuries&#34;. This site provides multiple, 3D representations 
          of Milan in different periods of its history. According to time selections 
          and &#34;movements&#34; of the user in the virtual world, these representations 
          can dynamically evolve along two dimensions: the space, while user navigation 
          proceeds in the virtual city, and the time, when user changes the current 
          temporal context. The paper discusses the concept of 3D temporal navigation 
          and its integration with 2D &#34;standard&#34; web browsing, reports 
          examples from &#34;Milan along the centuries&#34;, and introduces 
          the general software architecture of the system. </p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>1. Introduction </b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Can you imagine how a contemporary 
        city was many centuries ago, say, in the Renaissance, or in the Baroque 
        period? Did you ever desire to explore it not only as it is now, but also 
        as it was in the past, in the meantime getting historical, social, architectural 
        explanations of what you are seeing while you proceed in your exploration? 
        </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The web site &#34;Milan along the 
        centuries&#34;, under development at Politecnico di Milano, allows users 
        to try this experience in a virtual world on the WWW. Our system integrates 
        a number of 3D virtual reconstructions of the urban structures of a city 
        (e.g., streets, squares, buildings, parks, etc.), each one representing 
        Milan in a different period of time. Users can not only navigate each 
        virtual space, e.g., &#34;walking&#34; along a street or getting into 
        a building of the virtual town in a given period. At any point, users 
        can experiment a kind of &#34;Zemeckis’ Back to the Future&#34; (Zemeckis 
        1985) effect: moving back or forth in the time, they find themselves in 
        the same place but in a different century, which they can virtually explore. 
        This original form of interaction with virtual worlds, which we call <i>3D 
        temporal navigation</i>, exploits two dimensions of virtuality: the virtual 
        <i>space</i>, reconstructed via 3D graphics, and the virtual <i>time</i>, 
        achieved by the possibility of switching among different temporal frameworks. 
        </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">In &#34;Milan along the centuries&#34;, 
        3D temporal navigation is smoothly integrated with 2D temporal navigation. 
        At any point of space and time (i.e., in any spatial context in any time 
        period), users can jump into a &#34;traditional&#34; 2D information 
        space - a conventional web site - and explore, by means of standard web 
        navigation, textual or multimedia web pages concerning what they are currently 
        exploring. In the 2D space, users can visit information related to different 
        town areas, switch the time context, or contextually return to the 3D 
        representation. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The idea of the overall approach 
        is depicted in figure 1. The three axes of the diagram refer to the possible 
        navigation dimensions: in the 3D space, in the 2D space, and along the 
        time (T). For each time period, e.g. ‘500, ‘200, etc., there are 3D reconstructions 
        of the town, related to 2D descriptions (a set of inter-linked HTML pages 
        of a conventional web site). </span></p>

        navigation</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">To implement 3D and 2D temporal 
        navigation in &#34;Milan along the centuries&#34;, we have defined a 
        general software architecture, which can be used to implement temporal 
        navigation for any urban context, once 2D and 3D contents are provided 
        in the appropriate format. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The rest of this paper will first 
        discuss more precisely the user interaction paradigms for 3D and 2D temporal 
        navigation, using examples from &#34;Milan along the centuries&#34; 
        web site. Then we will outline the general software architecture underlying 
        the system and mention the line of our future work. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>2. User interaction in 3D Temporal 
        Navigation</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">In conventional web navigation, 
        user exploration of a web site usually starts from an entry point (e.g., 
        the &#34;home page&#34;) or from a page selected by some search mechanism, 
        and proceeds by selecting the available links connecting to the various 
        pages of the site. In 3D or 2D temporal navigation, user have a number 
        of additional choices, corresponding to the three navigational dimensions: 
        along the 2D space, along the 3D space, and along the time. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">In principle, one may start by selecting 
        a starting point in each of these three dimensions. Still, in &#34;Milano 
        along the centuries&#34; the first choice offered to the user is temporal, 
        i.e., he or she must first select the time period of interest, and then 
        choose the town zone. Since Milan has radically evolved and expanded along 
        the centuries, the notion of &#34;town zone&#34; depends on the time 
        period, have different granularity depending on the time, and therefore 
        the sets of space representations of Milan in different time periods are 
        not totally &#34;isomorphic&#34; (i.e., not all the possible combinations 
        &#34;town area-time period&#34; make sense). In the thirteen century, 
        for example, only the central area existed (around the Duomo square), 
        and the town zones available in that period are sub-zones of the central 
        area. On the contrary, contemporary Milan includes many other areas among 
        which users can make their first selection. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Once users have made their temporal 
        choice, they are presented with a 2-dimensional city map (we have tried 
        to use historical maps of Milan for each time period, as shown in figure 
        2). From here, users can either identify a starting point for navigation, 
        or select a sub-area when available. </span></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">By default, the virtual exploration 
        of a selected place starts in the 3D world, but the switch to the 2D world 
        may be invoked at any time. In this section, we discuss 3D navigation, 
        while 2D navigation is introduced in the following section. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">There are two paradigms (&#34;modes&#34;) 
        of virtual navigation in the 3D environment, named &#34;<i>walk</i>&#34; 
        and &#34;<i>fly</i>&#34;. The &#34;walk&#34; mode mimics the conventional 
        way humans explore a real town – by walking along the streets. During 
        a &#34;walk&#34;, the town is progressively disclosed to the user eyes 
        along a bottom-up perspective. As exploration proceeds, monuments and 
        buildings are progressively shown, and an increasing level of detail as 
        the user moves closer (with the cursor) towards the corresponding objects 
        in the virtual environment. Users can penetrate (some) buildings and explore 
        them inside, or proceed along the street. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The &#34;fly&#34; mode mimics 
        the way we perceive a town from an aircraft and provides an aerial, top-down 
        perspective of the town: users are allowed to fly over the town and to 
        view streets and buildings from the sky. The system supports a smooth 
        transition from &#34;fly&#34; to &#34;walk&#34; mode (and viceversa): 
        by moving the cursor, users can fly horizontally and vertically, progressively 
        focusing their view of a place up to street level, or progressively taking-off 
        and enlarging their view. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Two space representations are active 
        during navigation (in both modes): the virtual 3D environment currently 
        explored by the user, and the space context, i.e., the 2D map from which 
        navigation has started. Both representations dynamically evolve as navigation 
        proceeds. The 2D map highlights the changing position of the user in the 
        area, and the 3D world changes as discussed above. Users can maintain 
        both contexts simultaneously visible on the screen (&#34;dual context 
        view&#34;), as shown in figure 3, or zoom the 3D view up to the full 
        screen size (&#34;zoom view&#34;), as shown in figure 4 and figure 5 
        (both figures refer to &#34;walk&#34; mode). </span></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">During navigation, also the temporal context 
        remains active, as indicated by the time bar on the bottom of the screen. 
        At any point in space, users can select a different time period and experiment 
        the &#34;Zemeckis’ Back to the Future&#34; effect: if the representation 
        of the current space context is available for the chosen period, they 
        are &#34;projected&#34; into a 3D virtual world in which the town is 
        re-constructed as it (presumably) was in that time, and they can continue 
        navigation from the same space position. If no urban structure existed 
        for the current place in the selected period, users find themselves in 
        the middle of &#34;nowhere&#34; - a green land with nothing around. 
        They can try to &#34;return to town&#34; by either navigating the desert 
        3D space in some direction, or by accessing the (historical) map of the 
        town which corresponds to the current period, selecting a new entry point 
        in space. </p>

        exploring. The 2D world is a conventional web site which presents multimedia 
        content related to monuments, buildings, streets, squares of Milan – not 
        only existing now, but also in the past. It also include information about 
        the history of a place and its architectural aspects, about the historical 
        and social context in which it was built, about anecdotal events, curiosities, 
        and relevant personages related to it. An example of 2D web page in &#34;Milan 
        along the centuries&#34; is shown in figure 6. </p>

        presented in an historical perspective and has multiple contents associated

        Similarly to what happens in the 3D space, the temporal context is always 
        active during 2D navigation, to allow users change the temporal perspective 
        of an object description. The navigation in the space dimension is achieved 
        by providing links from an object to the objects that are (or were) physically 
        close to it. At any point, users can switch to the 3D world, and find 
        themselves embedded in a virtual reconstruction of the place in which 
        the object they are visiting is (or were) located. </span></p>

        3D and 2D temporal navigation in &#34;Milan along the centuries&#34; 
        is depicted in figure 7. It provides a general, flexible implementation 
        framework, which allows developers to reuse the modules developed for 
        our specific case study and to easily adapt them in order to implement 
        temporal navigation in any urban context, once the representations of 
        2D and 3D objects are provided in an appropriate format.</p>

        is that both the 2D and 3D environments are generated <i>dynamically</i> 
        as user navigation proceeds. The main modules of the architecture are: 
        </span></p>
      <ul>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
        </p><li><span class="normal">the <i>user interface</i></span></li>

        <p></p>
      </ul>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The user interface is the channel 
        through which users interact with the 2D and the 3D worlds. Its purpose 
        is to display 2D objects (web pages) and 3D representations of the current 
        spatial context, to intercept user requests (link selection, movements 
        in the 3D space, change of temporal context), and to pass them to the 
        appropriate engine. The 2D interface that visualizes 2D pages and accepts 
        user-generated events is based on a standard Web Browser. To visualize 
        the 3D VRML objects and to intercept user movements in the 3D space, the 
        user interface uses Cosmo Player or World Viewer (both work well). </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Based on the user requests sent 
        by the user interface, the generation <i>engines</i> retrieve the appropriate 
        contents from the data bases, and aggregate them to generate the 2D or 
        3D representation that are then displayed by the 2D and 3D viewers. The 
        communication layer among the user interface and the engines, and between 
        the two engines, has been implemented with CORBA, and, in particular, 
        the events generated and sent by the 2D world to the 3D world are managed 
        by the EAI (External Authoring interface) (Lewandowski, 1998). </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The 2D Web pages are dynamically 
        generated by the <i>ASP engine </i>(Active Server Pages Site, 1999), which 
        imports information elements from the 2D database (selected according 
        to the current user position in the 2D space, the current temporal context, 
        and the current link selection), and aggregates them according to the 
        structural relationships stored in the 2D data base. The 2D data base 
        stores all the information needed to build the web pages: 2D content elements 
        - maps, texts, images, sounds and videos, and the structural relationships 
        among different source elements that define which elements must be aggregated 
        together in the different pages. The database also provides developers 
        with a user friendly interface to allow them to insert, modify, or cancel 
        information elements and as well as the structural relationships them.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The 3D engine creates the 3D VRML 
        representations of the city as user exploration proceeds. It calculates 
        the user position, identify the 3D objects - streets, palaces, churches, 
        fountains, etc. – that must be visualized in the current context, and 
        defines how they must be placed in the 3D world, generating the portion 
        of the city which is relevant for the current user perspective, either 
        in &#34;walk&#34; or &#34;fly&#34; mode, in the current temporal context. 
        To identify how the reconstructions of urban elements must be placed in 
        the 3D space, the VRML engine exploits a set of <i>spatial relations </i>among 
        3D objects, which define the dependencies between the different space 
        contexts and different objects within each context. The 3D database stores 
        the basic 3D VRML objects and their space relationships, and also provides 
        developers with a user friendly interface to allow them to insert, modify, 
        or cancel objects as well as their spatial relationships.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The objects in the 3D data base 
        are typed according to their urban role: Buildings (e.g., houses, palaces, 
        villas, industrial building,…), Church (churches, abbeys, cathedrals,…) 
        and Miscellaneous, which collects all other urban elements, such as trees, 
        fountains, streets, walls, and similar. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The objects are also organized in 
        two categories, depending on their role in the generation process: Special 
        Objects and Support Objects. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Special Objects are the urban elements 
        which has a particular historical or architectural relevance, and therefore 
        characterize each particular portion of the city in a given period. Special 
        Objects are active, in the sense that they can users can perform a number 
        of operations on them. Special Objects can be zoomed- in/zoomed-out, or 
        explored inside (when this operation makes sense). They also include anchors 
        to reach the Web pages in the 2D world which describes the details of 
        each object. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Support Objects are used to fill 
        the virtual space around Special Objects, i.e., of creating the urban 
        context for them. Support Objects are &#34;generic&#34;, anonymous urban 
        elements, such as generic houses, trees, grasses, streets, and similar; 
        they have no special relevance from a cultural perspective but, like the 
        generic building blocks of a Lego, they are needed to complete the virtual 
        reconstruction of a space context. As such, Support Objects are often 
        repeated in the visualization of a space environment. Furthermore, Support 
        Objects are static, i.e., users cannot interact with them, and the designer 
        cannot modify them.</span></p>

      <p class="heading"><b>5. Conclusions and Future Work </b></p>
     
      
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">This paper has discussed the concept 
        of multiple space temporal navigation, i.e., virtual exploration in a 
        3-dimension or 2-dimension information space that explicitly takes into 
        account the notion of history and time, and allows user to modify the 
        temporal context of what they are seeing, as well as the space dimension 
        in which they are navigating. We have also proposed a general software 
        architecture that allows developer to build, in a modular way, 3D and 
        2D information spaces integrated with temporal navigation. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The main application domain we acknowledge 
        for temporal navigation is in the virtual reconstruction of historical 
        towns, since the proposed approach discloses the possibility, for the 
        user, of experimenting the virtual exploration of a urban context along 
        multiple historical perspectives. In particular, we are applying the proposed 
        approach to a web application that concerns Milan along the centuries, 
        where we provide multiple reconstructions of the town in different periods 
        which can be navigated in a conventional 2D world as well as in a virtual, 
        dynamically created 3D space. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Still, temporal navigation can be 
        applied to any cultural domain in which the content has a strong historical, 
        or, and, more generically, temporal dimension. Even the objects presented 
        in a virtual museum, for example, can be presented in along multiple temporal 
        and space perspectives: as they appear now in the museum, and in the space 
        and temporal contexts in which they has been originally conceived (e.g., 
        a church, a private house) or used during their time life. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Our future work will proceed in 
        two main directions. On the one hand, we are completing the &#34;Milan 
        along the centuries&#34; application, to include a larger set of urban 
        contexts (so far, limited to the central area) and to enrich the set of 
        2D information associated to them. On the other hand, we are working to 
        extent the interactivity of the system, by supporting a <i>cooperative 
        </i>way ( <em>Billinghurst, 1994</em>) of 2D and 3D temporal navigation. 
        In the current approach, user interacts with the system individually, 
        as a lonely activity on the net, since no mechanisms is provided to visit 
        a 2D-3D temporal navigation environment together with other users. We 
        are investigating the possibility of applying the WebTalk technology for 
        cooperative access of the web (Barbieri, 1999) to temporal navigation, 
        in order to allow multiple users to simultaneously access a 2D-3D information 
        space and to navigate in group, rather than individually, along multiple 
        space and temporal perspectives. </span></p>
