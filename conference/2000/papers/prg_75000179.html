      <p class="heading"><b>General Introduction</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Richmond, The American International University 
	in London &lt;<a href="http://www.richmond.ac.uk/">http://www.richmond.ac.uk</a>&gt; 
	(RAIUL) was founded in 1972 as a not for profit professional and liberal 
	studies university. Based principally on two London campuses with study 
	centres in Florence, Italy and Shizuoka, Japan, it has a student cohort 
	from over a hundred countries. RAIULíS curriculum currently covers seventeen 
	majors and twenty-nine minors; it adheres to the standard American four-year 
	format with progression through credit accumulation. The University awards 
	BA and BS degrees, in addition to a Masters in Business Administration 
	and a MA in Art History. Its undergraduate programs recently became the 
	first of any international university to be dual accredited by the Open 
	University (OU) in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Middle States Commission 
	for Higher Education and Instruction in Delaware, United States (USA).</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The module discussed in this paper, &#34;Museums 
	and Galleries: The Cultures of Display&#34;, forms an integral part of 
	the art history program at Junior level in the Humanities Department at 
	RAIUL. Although not a compulsory requirement for the art history degree, 
	this module offers students the combination of theoretical knowledge of 
	the museum and art market world together with practice. This offers insight 
	into the world of professional art historical application post university 
	study. It is a semester in length, runs twice a year and is an introduction 
	to museum and art market studies. Throughout the semester students examine 
	aspects of what has, in recent years, become known as &#34;the culture industry&#34;. 
	The focus of the module is visual culture and specifically upon the purpose, 
	role and practice of museums and galleries and the role and practice of 
	art dealers and collectors, commercial art galleries and of the auction 
	houses. It is structured as two interweaving strands. The first of these 
	consists of a weekly lecture series designed to acquaint students with 
	some of the current issues in museum and art world studies, such as: </span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">the nature and purpose of the museum in contemporary 
	  society; cultural property and the ethics of collecting; the notion 
	  of national heritage; </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">the role of the museum within education; art 
	  world crime; the philosophy, ethics and practice of conservation and 
	  restoration, funding and the economics of cultural institutions; museum 
	  management and governance; the role of the art dealer and commercial 
	  art galleries; the role and operating practice of the auction houses. 
	  </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">The second strand consists of a series of visits 
	to museums and other art institutions, both to sample the various categories 
	of museum and to provide the opportunity to study how, on a practical 
	level, museums deal with the various aspects. We consider such topics 
	as: </span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">how museums balance their public service role 
	  with scholarship and research;</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">the use of buildings and facilities; adapting 
	  old buildings to current notions of display;</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">the use of new technology; </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">museum access and the provision of facilities 
	  for the handicapped visitor; security and the protection of art;</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">how museums &#34;interpret&#34; their collections, museum 
	  and exhibition design;</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">collateral money-generating enterprises. </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">The two tracks interweave to provide a theoretical 
	understanding of a number of major issues and the opportunity for students 
	to study at first hand some of the ways in which art institutions confront 
	these issues in practice. Discussion is an important part of this course 
	and students are expected to verbalise their thoughts and perceptions 
	and to develop a critical response to the material under consideration.</span></p>
      <p class="normal"><span class="normal">In fall 1999, twenty-four students 
	completed the module, twenty of whom were female. During spring 2000, 
	forty-one students are enrolled on the module and thirty are female. Typically 
	95% of these students are participating on a study abroad programme and 
	have chosen to spend a semester or academic year studying at RAIUL away 
	from their main university in the US.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Rational</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p><span class="normal">To date, this is the only art history online module 
	available on RAIULís Intranet (Campus Wide Information Service or ëCWISí). 
	We specifically selected this module to provide insight into the following:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><i>1. How does an online resource module encourage 
	student-centred learning?</i></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Eighteen months ago, when we started development 
	of the online module, the framework and content of &#34;Museums and Galleries&#34; 
	were being modified for the art history accreditation submission for the 
	OU. There was an awareness of the need for greater integration of teaching 
	and information technology with the aim of developing more student-centred 
	learning, for example, in the Dearing Report (Dearing 1997). In addition, 
	many of the galleries and museums visited during the module have an extensive 
	web-presence. This provided the opportunity to incorporate meaningful 
	external hyperlinks which we hoped would encourage the students to take 
	more charge of their learning, through accessing materials and following 
	hyperlinks (autonomous learning).</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><i>2. How will students react to an online module 
	presence?</i></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In earlier iterations of the module, many of the 
	students had demonstrated a high level of Information Technology (IT) 
	competence and high expectations for the use of Learning Technologies 
	(LTs) within the curriculum. Much of the student cohort is from US universities 
	where, in the main, LTs are more widespread than in a typical UK university. 
	However, given our understanding of student competence in IT, we wanted 
	to evaluate how students reacted to our online module.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">3. <i>How can an online resource module help faculty?</i></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Faculty expectation at RAIUL, in the main, reflects 
	those reported by Littlejohn and Cameron (1999) believing that teaching 
	and learning will be via centralised resources accessed by C &amp; IT 
	with an increased emphasis on distance and open learning. However, in 
	stark contrast, there is tremendous reluctance to launch into the development 
	of online modules with the increasing demands on faculty time coupled 
	with the belief that online module development is extremely time-consuming 
	</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The class size for &#34;Museums and Galleries&#34; 
	has increased with a corresponding growth in the day-to-day administration. 
	Students have sixteen visits to galleries and museums throughout the London 
	area. Prior to the online module development, each week students were 
	provided with hard copy handouts of maps, directions and basic information. 
	This would take, on average:</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">four hours per week in preparation by the lecturer</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">ten minutes each week in the lecture to distribute</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">and students would invariably lose these handouts. 
	Therefore, we wanted to ascertain if the development of the online module 
	could relieve the high administrative burden of the module and if there 
	were significant time overheads for faculty in the development of an online 
	module.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><i>4. Is an online module suitable for a subject 
	such as art history?</i></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The development of the module was seen by many of 
	the RAIUL art history department as being a prototype for the kinds of 
	use of this technology within the discipline area. We were most concerned 
	that the online module reflected the subject matter and was mindful of 
	the visually-literate audience. We consciously wanted to develop an online 
	learning presence that contains a sense of aesthetic awareness reflecting 
	the subject. </span></p>
      <p><i><span class="normal">5. What are the resource implications for a small 
	liberal arts university, such as RAIUL in deploying LTs such as online 
	module?</span></i></p>
      <p><span class="normal">We wanted to explore:</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">The amount of training required for a member 
	  of faculty with average-level of IT skills to develop an online module. 
	  Also, we wanted to explore the possibilities of the Internet for teaching 
	  and learning, as Littlejohn and Cameron (1999) state, &#34;Working 
	  effectively within an integrated online learning environment requires 
	  the development not only of practical IT skills, but also of pedagogical 
	  skills.&#34; </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">The impact on the support services including 
	  IT, the audio-visual services and the library to support online module 
	  development.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">Many American universities are attempting to find 
	a model that will effectively support the deployment of large-scale LTs. 
	At EDUCOM 98, Christoph, Culp, Kerns, Koffenberger and Kumar (1998) presented 
	a number of possible models to support the growing use of LTs within their 
	respective institutions. Culp described the centre for instructional technologies 
	at the University of Texas at Austin. This helped faculty with multimedia 
	production, instructional design and in their technical skills. In comparison, 
	at George Washington, there was a more phased approach: in the initial 
	stages supporting full-time faculty to develop LTs and then gradually 
	using these early adapters to support other faculty in experimenting with 
	LTs. By the development of this online module, we wished to explore the 
	type of support required for faculty at RAIUL in developing an online 
	module and to advise senior management on the way forward to support large-scale 
	development of LTs.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><b>METHODOLOGY</b></span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Both of the writers are engaged in a self-reflective, 
	critical enquiry, which could probably fall under the title of ëaction 
	researchí As Kemmis and McTaggart (1998) state,</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">&#34;the linking of the terms ëactioní and ëresearchí 
	highlights the essential feature of the approach (action research): trying 
	out ideas in practice as a means of improvement and as a means of increasing 
	knowledge about the curriculum, teaching and learning.&#34; </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Another essential element of action research is 
	the collaborative: involving colleagues so they may benefit from the research. 
	A strong element of the project was dissemination to:</span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">our art history colleagues</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">all members of RAIUL </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">those within the wider educational community. 
	  </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">The immediate impact of this approach is change. 
	The online module is constantly changing and has a major overhaul at the

      <p><span class="normal">This started as a set of links to useful, relevant

	did not wish students to become so complacent as to ignore the mass of

	journals and other more traditional academic resources. This section has 
	since developed to include links to online lists of museum personnel email

      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="normal">At the beginning of each iteration, faculty demonstrate 
	the online module to students. Faculty expectation of student usage is 
	clearly defined - students should make full use of the appropriate online 
	pages and explore the museumís web site in detail prior to each visit. 
	The faculty also explain the rationale for the online module. For example, 
	students are told that we wish to use to the full the time in the museums 
	and galleries to explore specific issues as opposed to administration 
	details. Hence all information about the visits are online. We also explain 
	that we want to help them develop critiquing skills for assessing websites 
	and develop student autonomy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>3. Student and Faculty Reaction to 
	the Online Module (after the first iteration)</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p><span class="normal">As we have already stated, action research links 
	action and research. After each iteration, we spoke with students and 
	faculty and the online module began to take on a life of its own. Following 
	the initial iteration of the project, much time was spent correcting inconsistencies 
	that had crept into the online module during the semester. Most of these 
	were due to the speed and short notice with which changes were often enacted. 
	Some additions simply meant modifying existing pages of the site or creating 
	links to other items already published on RAIULís CWIS.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The majority of the students were happy with the 
	level of access, content and communication offered to them by the site 
	and welcomed its continued development. Issues were raised by the students 
	that resulted in some rethinking and organisation of the online module. 
	Subsequent developments were made which included:</span></p>
      <p><i><span class="normal">1</span></i><span class="normal">. <i>Additional 
	information about assignments </i> </span></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Students particularly requested this. Notification 
	of assignments are given during the lecture sessions but specifics are 
	only available online. For example, the design project in which students 
	have to propose their ideas for the redesign, interior decoration, display 
	methodology, lighting, security and public information given in the Islamic 
	room at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Their understanding of the conventions 
	employed throughout the institutions visited, combined with their own 
	imagination for redevelopment in sympathy with the artefacts form the 
	basis of the methodology in this assessment component. In this instance 
	the information is presented in the form of a competition entry brief 
	that all students are invited to enter, as &#34;designers sympathetic 
	to current concepts of room redesign&#34; (see image seven).</span></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><i>2. Faculty Contact Details </i></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">A large percentage of students wanted faculty contact 
	details, office hours, and email. Therefore, links were created to faculty 
	profiles on the CWIS and the provision of email links from the default 
	page. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Other additions were made after our discussions

      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <ul>
	<p align="JUSTIFY"> 
	</p><li><i><span class="normal">A &#34;Museum of the Week&#34;</span></i></li>

      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">This is a hyperlink to the site of a gallery or 
	a museum that we do not visit, a museum-related body or a specific site

      <p><span class="normal">We had specifically included this area to broaden 
	the horizons of interest for our many study-abroad students on the module 
	who can simultaneously expand their knowledge of museums and enjoyment 
	of London this way. At the end of the second iteration, 44% of students 
	reported having visited two or more of these institutions after visiting

	RAIULís Library for student and faculty use.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>The Second Iteration</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">After the second iteration, we again interviewed 
	students and faculty. Most of the changes required some more ëfine tuningí 
	but there were two significant new features</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><i>The Conversion of the Extensive Research Bibliography</i></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Compiled over the last ten years this bibliography 
	aims to be an extensive listing of conventional printed source material 
	applicable to the content of the module and the requirements of the final 
	research paper. Currently it lists over three thousand books, scholarly 
	articles, newspaper items and other sources, such as press releases, Government 
	commissioned enquiries into museums policies, procedures and funding initiatives 
	from many countries (UK, USA, France, Germany and Italy) and specialist 
	interest papers on topics including latest updates on conservation and 
	restoration techniques.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Originally presented in hard copy, this was converted 
	into HTML and was linked from the default page. It may be searched by 
	authorís family name or general subject area, for example, art crime, 
	curators, or new museum design. Whilst this delivers greater flexibility 
	and transparency of use for the student, this does create greater maintenance 
	issues.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><i>The Development of a Study Skillsí Section</i></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Most academics are concerned about studentsí generic 
	study skills but given the highly multinational mix and large proportion 
	of study abroad students at RAIUL, it was felt that this was an area requiring 
	special emphasis to implement standard University-wide guidelines. There 
	are links to other sections on the CWIS including &#34;Writing across 
	the Curriculum&#34;( a supplementary study skills program run under the 
	direction of the University Writing Co-ordinator, to promote good academic 
	writing practice within the RAIUL community.) and a RAIUL Library generated 
	guide to MLA citation system. In addition, there is information on other 
	library and research resources on arts and museology in London that is 
	available to RAIUL students.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This also related to our studentsí usage of the 
	Internet Resources page; students quickly assumed that because faculty 
	had listed websites on the page, they therefore had faculty approval as 
	sources to be (often quite heavily) used in researching the major paper 
	for the module. It took students sometime to realise that this was not 
	the case. Although the information linked to, might be of a sound nature, 
	it was not always the most authoritative source available, and the Internet 
	was not to replace the traditional skills of library-based research carried 
	out through books, journals and periodicals. Therefore, as part of the 
	study skillsí section, we also include a link to the online tutorial, 
	Internet Detective &lt;<a href="http://www.sosig.ac.uk/desire/internet-detective.html">http://www.sosig.ac.uk/desire/internet-detective.html</a>&gt;, 
	formulated at the University of Leeds, UK. The aim of this tutorial is 
	to give the user the skills required to evaluate the reliability and standard 
	of information contained on Internet sites. Completion of this tutorial 
	is something we recommend to all students during the first two weeks of 
	the semester. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Preliminary Findings</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p><span class="normal">We are now approaching the end of the third iteration 
	of our online module and we return to our initial thoughts at the onset 
	of this piece of action research.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><i>How does an online resource module encourage 
	student-centred learning?</i></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">During the first iteration, we began to observe 
	students being more proactive and responsible in their approach to finding 
	materials and information through the online module. They had visited 
	galleries that were included in ëMuseum of the Weekí and actively sought 
	other websites that they were quick to inform us about and asked to be 
	included on the online module.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Unfortunately during the first iteration this positive 
	approach was not always reflected in quality of work as students had not 
	developed critiquing skills of online sources. The development of the 
	study skillsí section we hope has begun to address this issue.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><i>How will students react to an online module presence?</i></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Some of the art history faculty were anxious about 
	student reaction to an online module and level of IT competency. Throughout 
	all the iterations, most of the students showed average and above level 
	of IT competency ñ often exceeding our own! The majority of the students 
	in all three iterations was very positive about the online module and 
	in the questionnaire asked for it to be continued. One or two had some 
	initial reluctance but when our rationale was explained, they gradually 
	ëacceptedí the online module. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><i>How can an online resource module help faculty?</i></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">As stated in the introduction, there is much faculty 
	concern about the time taken to develop an online module. During and after 
	each iteration, significant changes were made to the module, reflecting 
	our methodology of action research. For example, in fall 1999 the default 
	page had to be changed to remove the link to the Museum of the Moving 
	Image information page, due to the museumís closure. This took at least 
	a dayís work and several more in subsequent broken links. In addition, 
	the online module became almost an extension of oneís psyche and would 
	draw one in to tinker relentlessly. For example, mid-way through the semester, 
	we suddenly had to develop a ëprevious museums of the weekí area. We estimate 
	that the development of an online module took approximately twenty times 
	as long as to prepare for as a traditionally taught module.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">However, the online module did make significant 
	reduction in the administration overheads. Perhaps most significantly 
	it constantly challenged the faculty in their approach and educational 
	rationale to the teaching of the module. Students would make numerous 
	suggestions about the online module and this would result in us reflecting 
	in the content and delivery of the module. For example, there were many 
	requests for online placement of lecture notes and past final exams. We 
	decided not to provide these as we feel these could essentially be detrimental 
	to the development of good study skills and academic practice: the essential 
	functions of university education.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><i>Is an online module suitable for a subject such 
	as art history?</i></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Our experience of developing this module for online 
	use, in comparison with that of other American institutions, has pointed 
	out that indeed the online module provision format can be of great benefit 
	to the discipline of art history. Whilst many institutions have sought 
	to incorporate web based technology into teaching practice (Costache, 
	1998), to our knowledge few institutions have sought to develop such encompassing 
	projects regarding museology.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><i>5. What are the resource implications for a small 
	liberal arts university, such as RAIUL in deploying LTs such as online 
	module?</i></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Over 300 hours have so far been expended on the 
	development of this one project. It has had an significant impact on all 
	of the support services; this will need to be considered if similar and 
	more extensive online modules are to be developed and maintained. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Many of our initial teething problems were connected 
	to the process of publishing to the CWIS and this is a good example of 
	ensuring that procedures are in situ before launching into such a project. 
	IT and AV Services had little time to organise a standard publishing process 
	Therefore, in the first iteration there were problems and delays in updating 
	the content of the site: changes to the online module could be enacted 
	only by the Web Development Officer in IT and not individual faculty. 
	</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">It became very clear in the early stages of the 
	project that extensive and continued staff training is required in two 
	specific arenas:</span></p>
      <p> 
      </p><ul>
	<li><span class="normal">IT technical training</span></li>
	<p> 
	</p><li><span class="normal">Staff development in using C &amp; IT to improve 
	  teaching and learning</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">In line with all other CWIS web publishing, the 
	software used to generate and maintain the module was centred on <i>Microsoft 
	FrontPage</i>. It is commonly used throughout RAIUL because it does not 
	assume any prior knowledge of HTML or other programming languages. The 
	user does not to learn HTML to generate web pages. It was hoped that once 
	IT &amp; AV Services had assisted faculty in generating the initial site, 
	it would then be possible after minimal training for individual faculty 
	members to maintain their own course sites. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">However, after the initial stages, it became apparent 
	that technical support would be required on a semi-regular basis. Unfortunately 
	FrontPage has a number of idiosyncrasies and often IT and AV Services 
	is required to advise faculty on these. In addition, for such an online 
	visual presence, image generation is fundamental. IT and AV Services helped 
	in the production of all the central images especially on the default 
	page. The images were generated in Adobe PhotoShop, which is a non-trivial 
	package, and this service is always required in the generation of any 
	significant online module of this type. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The Dearing Report (1997) recommended 
	that faculty should develop learning and teaching strategies which focus 
	on the promotion of student learning. As the online presence was fine-tuned, 
	the faculty would call upon the services of the learning technology advisor 
	as a ësounding boardí ñ discussing the best way forward to enhance the 
	online module. This continued throughout all the iterations.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Proposals For The Way Forward</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p><span class="normal">There has been a certain amount of interest expressed 
	by colleagues at other UK universities who run parallel Museum Studies 
	modules in the possibilities of collaboration. One area might be to explore 
	the possibility for computer conferencing between the students of multiple 
	institutions towards a mutual furthering of understanding museums and 
	associated issues. Exactly how we as faculty might wish to direct this 
	venture has yet to be decided.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">An ideal area for collaboration in the way forward 
	and expansion of this project would be for us as an institution to work 
	alongside the educational department of one or more museums. Examples 
	of this might be the COMPASS project under development at the British 
	Museum (Loverance, 1998) or the 24-Hour Museum Curriculum Navigator &lt;<a href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/">http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk</a>&gt; 
	in which student and faculty evaluation of the ongoing developments might 
	seek to contribute to the educational goals of the final project outcomes 
	in both cases. However, despite past serious attempts to establish such 
	working relationships, no projects have so far been forthcoming. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In terms of additional learning support materials 
	provided for this module, a set of thirteen CD-ROMs covering major world 
	collections was recently purchased, and is available for student use on 
	a short term loan basis. These CD-ROMs are published by the Spanish publishing 
	house linked to <i>La Vangardia</i> newspaper in Barcelona, Spain. The 
	written material is in Spanish, but it has been evaluated as being a useful 
	and applicable resource for our student cohort considering that many Americans 
	learn Spanish as a preferential second language, and also the advanced 
	level of Spanish tuition within RAIULís Modern Languages Program. Online 
	guides to this set, similar to those provided for the other CD-ROMs on 
	the CWIS, will be developed. The wide and varied world art content of 
	this set also reflects the multicultural ethos of RAIULs educational mission, 
	and clearly demonstrates how LTs can serve this aim.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The other major development we wish to see in the 
	area of learning support materials provision is the acquisition of the 
	full CD-ROM archive of <i>The Art Newspaper</i>, since publication began 
	in 1983. <i>The Art Newspaper</i> is, for our purposes, the single most 
	authoritative source covering the latest developments and news within 
	the broad spread of topics, events politics and economics which impinge 
	upon the art world encompassed by the module. The coverage is international, 
	being published in joint co-operations involving the U.K., Italy and the 
	USA. The single major advantage that the CD-ROM version offers over either 
	the printed or web-based based &lt;<a href="http://www.theartnewspaper.co.uk/">http://www.theartnewspaper.co.uk/</a>&gt; 
	alternatives is that it allows students the ability to sequentially track 
	the development of an issue (for example, a development in art law, such 
	as <i>droit de suite</i>, or critical debate surrounding the effects of 
	restoration with regard to the Sistine Chapel). Whilst printed copy versions 
	can be searched by hand, this is a time consuming process, the CD-ROM 
	version eases this process, thereby encouraging initial student involvement 
	to further their research objectives. CD-ROM updates to the archive are 
	produced at five-yearly intervals, therefore requiring only modest and 
	sporadic financial outlay on behalf of the institution to maintain the 
	resource.</span></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Over the past eighteen months, we 
	have seen institutional web sites develop at an alarming rate, most with 
	greater imagination of display and content than in our online module. 
	In some instances, this has happened to such an extent that for our purposes 
	some, such as <i>The Wallace Collection &lt;</i><a href="http://www.wallace-collection.org.uk/">http://www.wallace-collection.org.uk</a>&gt; 
	now are valuable resources in their own right as revision or aide-memoire 
	tools for students following visits too. This has had inevitable consequences 
	in altering the manner in and frequency with which students use the CWIS 
	site, as their access point for museums on the web. These developments 
	we could not have foreseen, nor the extended use of the CWIS site prior 
	to examination periods, as has been noted in ad hoc observations by faculty 
	of students.</span></p>
