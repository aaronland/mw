      <p class="author"><b>Nenette Luarca, Anna Rochester, and Craig Cunningham, 
	University of Chicago, USA</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote> <b> </b> 
	<p class="small">This paper describes a collaboration among the University 
	  of Chicago, the Chicago Public Schools, and several Chicago area museums 
	  to develop Web based curriculum materials utilizing the resources from 
	  multiple museums. This project, funded by the Chicago Public Schools, 
	  aims to create high-quality engaging interdisciplinary learning activities 
	  for the children of Chicago. The project is it in its initial year, 
	  and is still working on the first set of three modules: Communications, 
	  Transportation, and Astro-mythology. Because our results are still pending, 
	  this paper focuses on the process of developing our collaboration and 
	  some of the principles by which we are operating. The presentation at 
	  the Museums and the Web 2000 Conference will also include demonstrations 
	  of modules under production.</p>

      <p class="small"><b class="heading">Introduction </b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Chicago WebDocent (CWD ) brings together educational 
	institutions in the city of Chicago with the goal of producing high-quality 
	Web-based curriculum for the public schools. In this, its pilot year, 
	CWD is striving to maximize Chicagoís cultural resources by bringing some 
	of them into the classroom. This partnership is made up of the University 
	of Chicago, Chicago Public Schools, the Adler Planetarium, the Field Museum 
	of Natural History, the Museum of Science and Industry, and the Oriental 
	Institute Museum at the University of Chicago. Representatives from the 
	various institutions are developing interdisciplinary curriculum modules 
	on the topics of Communication, Transportation, and the relationship between 
	Astronomy and Mythology. Although the project is in its beginning stages, 
	the lessons and procedures we have learned, along with the relationships 
	that have been formed, will enable the future production of educational 
	materials geared for the cluster of Chicago Public Schools in the neighborhoods 
	su rrounding the University.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This paper will discuss the timeline and process 
	of creating these curriculum modules, highlighting the truly collaboratory 
	nature of the project at all levels, and discuss the lessons we have learned 
	during this first year. The presentation at the Museums and the Web 2000 
	Conference will also include a demonstration of the modules in their preliminary 
	stages. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The Chicago WebDocent is a project of the Chicago 
	Public Schools/University of Chicago Internet Project. CUIP&#39;s main focus 
	is on making computers and the Web accessible to a cluster of twenty-nine 
	south-side Chicago Public Schools. CUIP also devotes much of its resources 
	to teacher training. It runs a summer Web Institute for Teachers, that 
	teaches K-12 educators how to build curriculum modules utilizing resources 
	available on the Web. ((For more information about CUIP, see <a href="http://cuip.uchicago.edu/cuip">http://cuip.uchicago.edu/cuip</a>. 
	For more information about WIT, see <a href="http://cuip.uchicago.edu/wit">http://cuip.uchicago.edu/wit</a>.) 
	Although this training and the modules produced by teachers have increased 
	the use of the Internet in CUIP schools, teachers rarely have the time 
	necessary to produce high-quality curriculum modules during the academic 
	year. Similarly, while museums are increasingly creating Web-based curriculum 
	materials, these materials are often limited by the scope of the museums&#39; 
	collections or expertise. In order to expand the reach of the museums 
	and ensure that the educational materials are usable by teachers, we proposed 
	a collaboration among the University, the CUIP schools, and several Chicago-area 
	museums in April of 1999. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Funded for an initial pilot period by the Chicago 
	Public Schools, the CWD involves three CUIP staff members, nine CPS teachers 
	from all levels and subject areas (all from the CUIP cluster of 29 schools), 
	and representatives from the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum, the 
	Field Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Science and Industry (MSI), 
	and the Oriental Institute Museum at the University of Chicago (OI). (We 
	are currently involved in discussions with the Chicago Historical Society 
	to join as a fifth museum partner.) The CUIP staff members, with expertise 
	in curriculum, museum education, and Web design, are working closely with 
	the teachers and the museum representatives to write the content for the 
	modules, which will contain engaged learning activities and will utilize 
	multiple resources (images, information, data) from the museum collections. 
	</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">For museum administrators, an exciting aspect of 
	this project is its promise to bring the museum collections to a wider 
	audience. While many Chicago area students visit the museums with their 
	schools, not all of them do. For some, this is an issue of funding for 
	field trips; for others, it has more to do with the sheer distance between 
	the school and the museums. Even when schools do plan trips to the museums, 
	the museumsí collections have not always been well-integrated into formal 
	classroom instruction. CWD dramatically expands the potential audience 
	for the collections, not only in local schools but also nationally and 
	internationally. Therefore, the concept was quickly embraced by upper-level 
	administrators at several Chicago museums. </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>The Steering Committee</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In the fall of 1999, a meeting was held at the MSI 
	to organize the collaboration. The roles and responsibilities of the museums 
	were outlined and contact personnel assigned from each museum. The contact 
	people were seen as key to the planning and implementation of the project 
	in that they would provide access to and information about museum resources, 
	as well as review web page drafts. Typically, the museum representatives 
	were appointed by the head of the museum education department. For example, 
	Kathleen Burke, director of education at MSI, invited Julie Blue, Manger 
	of Curriculum and Professional Development in the Education Department, 
	to play a key role. Carole Krucoff, head of education at OI, enlisted 
	Anna Rochester, School and Teacher Services Coordinator. Julie and Anna 
	develop curriculum guides for teachers, typically in print format, and 
	conduct training sessions for teachers; thus they were the obvious contact 
	personnel from the museumsí point of view. Scott Beveridge, MSI&#39;s Webmaster, 
	is another contact person. Other museum educators involved are Chris Molzahn 
	from department of ecology and conservation at the Field Museum, and Michael 
	Childs from the Adler Planetarium. The museum representatives, along with 
	the three CUIP staff members, form the Steering Committee of the project. 
	The Steering Committee meets monthly to develop principles and procedures.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">From the start, museum educators saw the advantages 
	of collaborating on this project; however, they were also wary of a facile 
	technological panacea. During one of the first meetings of the steering 
	committee, Scott Beveridge (MSI) emphasized that a guiding question in 
	the collaboration should be &#34;What do we want to add to the world of the 
	student?&#34; rather than &#34;What do we want to put on the web site?&#34; Other 
	thoughts expressed included how to take advantage of the Web&#39;s capacity 
	to deliver a product that differs from curricula delivered in traditional 
	formats such as paper. Some thoughts arose around inspiring the students 
	to explore the world and find something they are passionate about. Many 
	museum personnel have stories about visitors seeing the authentic objects 
	for the first time and feeling a sense of being &#34;wowed,&#34; or about how 
	a visit to the museum sparked a lifelong fascination with a given field 
	of study. These stories and others caused some members of the Steering 
	Committee to raise questions about our project: </span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal">Should this project aim to inspire the student 
	  in the way that the museums sometimes do? </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">How will the Web modules give the students the 
	  tools and opportunities that will allow them to fulfill their interests? 
	  </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">Can the museums&#39; special role in providing the 
	  &#34;wow factor&#34; be preserved when objects are presented on the web? </span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">Will these modules provide teachers with effective 
	  resources and teaching strategies for the classroom? How will teachers 
	  incorporate them into what they&#39;re already doing?</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">How should the Web-based modules be designed 
	  so that their use is seen as a complement to, rather than replacement 
	  of, museum visits?</span></li>
	<li><span class="normal">Can we design the modules to be experimental 
	  in a way that allows students to explore careers, areas of study, roles 
	  and possibilities for their own future? </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">These preliminary discussions and questions guided 
	the formation of the structure of CWD and its eventual goals. Since each 
	museum has well-developed teacher outreach programs, the museum representatives 
	drew on their previous experiences while simultaneously breaking new ground. 
	The museum educators recognized how dependent they were on teacher involvement 
	during the creation of outreach programs at their institutions. For example, 
	the teacher outreach program at the Oriental Institute Museum operated 
	for five years with CPS teachers to successfully develop sixth-grade curriculum 
	materials on the ancient world. But to make the OI/CPS partnership work 
	required constant consultation with the teachers, and attention to their 
	concerns, interests and pressures. This true collaboration took many years 
	to develop and the outcomes were effective and useful teacher guides. 
	CWD was fortunate to be building upon already-formed relationships between 
	the University and the neighborhood schools, and also benefited from several 
	prior collaborations between individual CUIP teachers and participating 
	museums.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Several lessons are emerging from the museum perspective 
	as the collaboration moves forward. It is clear that the technology is 
	present to promote museum collections to a much wider audience of students 
	and teachers. Because of longstanding earlier collaborations, there has 
	been good will between the museums and the CPS, to take advantage of this 
	technology. It must be admitted that both museum staff and teachers are 
	cautious about getting the balance of content over &#34;flash&#34; right. 
	Students need to find the Web-based material compelling, so that when 
	visiting the sites, kids will be engaged enough to stay and genuinely 
	learn from them. Teachers need material from which they can build curricula, 
	and they are less interested in &#34;edutainment&#34; that distracts from the 
	intellectual core of their own missions. Museum educators want to promote 
	their collections to a wider audience, but not in a way that lessens the 
	impact of their collection, or makes it less likely that people will physically 
	visit it. While we believe it is possible to get this balance right, it 
	will require ongoing thoughtful engagement with all members of the collaborative 
	team.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>CUIP Staff</b></p>
      <p class="normal">At the University level, the Chicago WebDocent team members 
	are university employees, and serve as mediators between the museums and 
	teachers as well as primary content authors. The three staff members, 
	Craig Cunningham, Nenette Luarca, and Mitchell Marks, were all associated 
	with CUIP before the inception of CWD, and it has proved most beneficial 
	that the initial groundwork has been done by people familiar with the 
	CUIP mission and neighborhood. Craig, Nenette, and Mitch have experience 
	in curriculum development, museum education, and web design, respectively. 
	Given the limited resources and time that constrain the project, each 
	CUIP staff member has been key. Nenette, the Museum and School Liaison, 
	has met throughout the project with each participating teacher and museum 
	representative. These informal, individualized meetings gave participants 
	a chance to voice expectations, clarify their roles, and formulate some 
	clearer ideas about the purpose of the projects. These meetings typically 
	happened at the representativesí museums or in the teachersí classrooms. 
	As the only full-time participant in CWD, Nenette acts as the mediator 
	between the different institutions and people. Museum staff members and 
	teachers are busy with their respective programs and duties, and in order 
	to maximize productivity, the CUIP staff guides the museum educators and 
	teachers towards effective use of their time on the project.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>The Curriculum Committee</b></p>
      <p class="normal">The main role of the teachers on the CWD Curriculum Committee 
	is to initiate the topics of the modules, and ensure their usability and 
	relevance to the Chicago Academic Standards and Frameworks. (For access 
	to these Standards, see <a href="http://www.cps.k12.il.us/Instruction/CAS">http://www.cps.k12.il.us/Instruction/CAS</a>). 
	Choosing motivated and qualified teachers was extremely important to the 
	success of the project. We spent nearly two months inviting nominations 
	from the participating museums and from CUIP, looking for teachers with 
	moderate to high levels of computer and web literacy along with enthusiasm 
	for and a commitment to teaching. We also looked for a range of grade 
	levels and subject areas, and considered prior interactions with museums 
	on curriculum development a big advantage. Teachers who had previously 
	participated in the Web Institute for Teachers summer program at the University 
	were especially desirable. Nine teachers (three from the primary grade 
	level, three upper-elementary/middle school teachers, and three high school 
	teachers) from CUIP schools were invited to participate, and all nine 
	accepted. (The teachers are paid $20 per hour, for up to ten hours of 
	work a month, including monthly meetings of the Curriculum Committee.)</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Progress So Far</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The initial meeting of the museum representatives 
	and teachers in October of 1999 consisted of acquainting the teachers 
	with the resources of the museums and the timeline of the project. A set 
	of goals and a process for attaining those goals was finalized during 
	November of 1999:</span></p>

	<ol>
	  <li><span class="normal">The project&#39;s overall goal would be to develop 
	    three or four Web-based, (or more accurately, &#34;web-enhanced&#34;) interdisciplinary 
	    curriculum modules. By &#34;curriculum&#34; we mean a &#34;plan for a sustained 
	    process of teaching and learning&#34; (Pratt, 1994, p. 5). &#34;Web-enhanced&#34; 
	    curricula are plans that incorporate the World Wide Web for at least 
	    a portion of learning activities and resources (Kahn, 1997). A curriculum 
	    &#34;module&#34; is set of teaching and learning activities related to a single 
	    topic, or theme, and designed to be undertaken as a unit.</span></li>
	  <li><span class="normal">Each curriculum module would be developed following 
	    a process taught in CUIP&#39;s Web Institute for Teachers. The process 
	    emphasizes curriculum planning, and includes the development of a 
	    detailed &#34;curriculum guide&#34; as a blueprint for the development of 
	    a &#34;curriculum web&#34; to support the given curriculum. (See Cunningham 
	    et al., 2000.) The guide includes the following elements: </span></li>
	  <ol type="a">
	    <li><span class="normal">Introduction </span></li>
	    <li><span class="normal">Aim</span></li>
	    <li><span class="normal">Rationale </span></li>
	    <li><span class="normal">Audience </span></li>
	    <li><span class="normal">Pre-requisites</span></li>
	    <li><span class="normal">Description of Subject Matter</span></li>
	    <li><span class="normal">Materials</span></li>
	    <li><span class="normal">Goals and Objectives </span></li>
	    <li><span class="normal">Instructional Plan </span></li>
	    <li><span class="normal">Plan for Assessment and Evaluation</span></li>
	  </ol>
	  <p><span class="normal">(Current drafts of the curriculum guides for 
	    the three modules are available by visiting <a href="http://cuip.uchicago.edu/cwd/modules">http://cuip.uchicago.edu/cwd/modules</a>. 
	    During the development phase, the draft modules are password protected. 
	    You may use username=guest and password=arsenic to view the modules.) 
	    </span></p>
	  <li><span class="normal">Teachers would initiate the subject matter 
	    for the modules based on their needs and the deficiencies that they 
	    see in existing curriculum. We decided that our modules should not 
	    reproduce curriculum that already exists on the Web, but should be 
	    uniquely suited to CUIP students while utilizing the resources available 
	    in multiple participating museums.</span></li>
	  <li><span class="normal">The full Curriculum Committee would eventually 
	    be broken down into topic groups, or sub-committees, based on interest 
	    or grade level. Each subcommittee would concentrate its efforts on 
	    one module.</span></li>
	  <li><span class="normal">Each module should be flexible and easily adaptable 
	    to different grade and learning levels since many students in the 
	    CUIP schools are below grade level in some disciplines. The resources 
	    should be accessible in different ways depending on the user. The 
	    idea here is that once a resource is digitized and placed in a structured 
	    database on the CUIP server, it can be accessed in multiple contexts 
	    within multiple modules.</span></li>
	</ol>
      <p><span class="normal">In order to achieve these goals, the teachers needed 
	to become familiar with each museum and its resources in order to formulate 
	potential subject matter. The teachers did some &#34;homework&#34; involving searching 
	the Web for existing curriculum materials and looking at the standards 
	they had to address with their students, while keeping the museum partnersí 
	resources in mind. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The Curriculum Committee reconvened in December 
	with ideas for topics. At this meeting, it was decided that the group 
	would concentrate on creating three modules because of limited time and 
	resources. A set of criteria were developed for deciding on the topics 
	for these three modules.: </span></p>
      <ol type="a">
	<ol type="a">
	  <li><span class="normal">How much material is already out on the Web 
	    regarding the topic? Would creating a module on this topic duplicate 
	    existing resources? </span></li>
	  <li><span class="normal">Would this topic make use of more than one 
	    museumís resources? </span></li>
	  <li><span class="normal">Is this topic approachable from different grade 
	    and ability levels? Would the module and subject matter be easily 
	    adaptable to different learners?</span></li>
	  <li><span class="normal">Is the subject area specific enough, so that 
	    it is fairly easy to decide what should be covered and what should 
	    not? (We&#39;re not completely sure we&#39;ve applied this criteria very well 
	    in the general topic areas we have decided upon. See below.)</span></li>
	  <li><span class="normal">How widely usable would the module be within 
	    CUIP schools and classrooms? </span></li>
	  <li><span class="normal">Does the topic address Chicago Academic Standards 
	    and frameworks?</span></li>
	  <li><span class="normal">Is the topic conducive to engaged learning 
	    activities? (Specific criteria for &#34;engaged learning&#34; are available 
	    in Jones et al. 1994).</span></li>
	  <li><span class="normal">Does the subject lend itself to activities 
	    that utilize the Web, as well activities that take the students beyond 
	    the Web, into the museums, community, and larger physical world?</span> 
	</li></ol>
</ol>
	  
	    <p><span class="normal">The Curriculum Committee utilized these 
		criteria to select three topics: Communication, Transportation, 
		and Astronomy/Mythology. Initial statements of &#34;Aim&#34; were drafted 
		for each of these modules. These &#34;Aims&#34; indicate the primary educational 
		goal and audience:</span></p>

		<ul>
		  <li><span class="normal">Communications: <i>This curriculum 
		    module enables Pre-K through 6th grade students to analyze 
		    how various forms of communication affect individual, social, 
		    cultural, and technological change, and how these factors 
		    have in turn affected the development of communication.</i> 
		    (This module will be developed initially for 6<sup>th</sup> 
		    grade, which is the usual time for Chicago Public School students 
		    to study ancient civilizations. The module will use ancient 
		    Egypt as one example of a society greatly influenced by advances 
		    in communication. Once the 6<sup>th</sup> grade version is 
		    complete, the module will be modified to suit younger audiences.)</span></li>
		  <li><span class="normal">Transportation: <i>The Transportation 
		    Module will guide K-6 students through the historical progression 
		    of various modes of transport, encouraging students to analyze 
		    the connections between transportation and the development 
		    and expansion of civilizations and cultures. Special emphasis 
		    will be placed on the role of transportation in the growth 
		    of Chicago.</i> (The history of Chicago is normally taught 
		    in the 3<sup>rd</sup> grade, and the Transportation module 
		    will be initially designed for that level, and then later 
		    modified for both older and younger students. Our selection 
		    of this topic led more urgency to our desire to include the 
		    Chicago Historical Society as a fifth museum partner.)</span> 
		  </li>
		  <li><span class="normal">Astro-Mythology: <i>The purpose of 
		    this module is for High School Students to explore the relationship 
		    between astronomy and the mythologies of various cultures, 
		    with special emphasis on the use of mythology to explain astronomical 
		    observation.</i> (We expect this module to be utilized by 
		    both high school language arts teachers teaching mythology 
		    and by earth science and physics teachers teaching astronomy. 
		    We recognize the heavy departmentalization of the high school 
		    curriculum as a potential barrier to wide use of this module.)</span></li>
		</ul>
	      <p><span class="normal">Once these topics were selected, field trips 
	      were planned for each subcommittee of teachers to visit the relevant 
	      museums, in order to meet with curators and exhibition designers, 
	      tour both public collections and artifacts not currently on view, 
	      and make initial selections of resources to be included in the modules. 
	      This task has been more difficult that it might have been if the 
	      topics had been more specific. &#34;Transportation,&#34; for example, seems 
	      to include a lot more than it excludes, and choosing the specific 
	      learning activities and resources from MSI&#39;s vast &#34;Transportation 
	      Zone,&#34; for example, has proven difficult.</span> </p>
	    <p><span class="normal">As the curriculum committee worked to choose 
	      broad topic areas and then to select specific resources from the 
	      participating museums that could be incorporated into each module, 
	      Mitch Marks, the CWD Technical Coordinator, was working on the technical 
	      infrastructure for the eventual CWD web site. He examined a number 
	      of different &#34;looks and feels&#34; and developed a framework for storing 
	      and accessing digitized images. Together with a local art teacher 
	      with experience in web design, Mitch and Craig choose a general 
	      color scheme and background design, planned the entryway, and began 
	      to sketch out both the file structure and metaphorical architecture 
	      of the site.</span></p>
	    <p><span class="normal">Mitch also researched and selected some of 
	      the underlying technologies to be used on the CWD site. Information 
	      about the many images we expect to include will be contained in 
	      a mySQL database, accessed through ZOPE, a web-oriented object database 
	      implemented in Python, an interpreted, compilable scripting language. 
	      Each item will include information about its history, significance, 
	      and current location; students and teachers will be able to choose 
	      how much of this information to see. Mitch developed a prototype 
	      curriculum module by taking one of the modules developed in the 
	      Web Institute for Teachers and &#34;retrofitting&#34; it to these specifications, 
	      so that Craig, Nenette, and other participants could get a sense 
	      for how this implementation would work.</span></p>
	    <p class="normal">In addition to planning the eventual web site, Mitch 
	      has also worked to ensure ongoing communication among all participants 
	      in the project. A set of mailing lists were established to keep 
	      the larger group and certain sub-groups in touch between meetings. 
	      After each meeting, detailed minutes are sent out to the general 
	      list. There is also a Curriculum Committee mailing list that is 
	      used to inform teachers of meetings, as well as acting as a discussion 
	      forum for sites people may have seen that they would like the larger 
	      group to view. The CWD organizational web site, at <a href="http://cuip.uchicago.edu/cwd">http://cuip.uchicago.edu/cwd</a>, 
	      is a center for information about the project for both participants 
	      and outside parties that are interested in the initiative. There, 
	      one can find contact names, lists of participants, the project timeline, 
	      agendas and minutes from past meetings, information on the mailing 
	      lists, and a growing list of museum-related links.</p>
	    <p class="heading"><b>The Project&#39;s Future</b></p>
	    <p><span class="normal">As CWD moves into its second phaseócurriculum 
	      developmentówe find ourselves in uncharted waters. Never before 
	      have these museums agreed to pool their resources for common educational 
	      aims. Each museum has its own administrative structure and procedures 
	      for gaining access to its collections, so the museum representatives 
	      are key in identifying proper procedures and key people. Some of 
	      the collections are already digitized and formatted for inclusion 
	      into the curriculum modules, however, other objects need to be photographed 
	      and scanned before they can be included in any web site. As of this 
	      writing (February 2000), CWD is in the process of identifying the 
	      resources that will be needed, and this is a learning process for 
	      both museum educators and the CUIP staff. Issues of copyright will 
	      inevitably arise, and by April, we will be able to more accurately 
	      address our experience with them. </span></p>
	    <p><span class="normal">Our goal is to have the Communications module 
	      drafted by the end of March, so that we can use it to demonstrate 
	      the value of our collaboration to prospective funders of the project. 
	      The other modules will be drafted by April or May. We will field-test 
	      each module in the classrooms of members of the Curriculum Committee, 
	      make any changes that seem necessary, and then recruit other CUIP 
	      teachers for a more formal evaluation of the modules either in late 
	      spring or during the next academic year. After the curriculum has 
	      been tested in classrooms, teacher feedback and evaluation will 
	      be vital to improving the usability and content of the sites. Criteria 
	      for evaluation of the entire project include considering the projectís 
	      productivity given the resources, whether or not something new and 
	      unique is being done, the effectiveness of the current number of 
	      created curriculum modules and the scope of subject matter. </span></p>
	    <p><span class="normal">The Chicago Public Schools is interested in 
	      CWD because of the potential for the project to develop high quality, 
	      engaging, educative learning activities for its students. The eventual 
	      goal is to make these modules accessible to all CPS schools by including 
	      them in CPS&#39;s &#34;Infusion Exchange,&#34; a highly-sophisticated tool for 
	      CPS teachers to create, share, and access curriculum modules via 
	      the web. CPS sees Infusion Exchange as its primary technique for 
	      both delivering curriculum and for supporting teacher development 
	      of curriculum, so as to increase the infusion of technology into 
	      the curriculum in multiple schools. (More information about Infusion 
	      Exchange and CPS&#39;s Technology Infusion Planning Process can be found 
	      at <a href="http://dewey.cps.k12.il.us/">http://dewey.cps.k12.il.us</a>.)</span></p>
	    <p class="heading"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
	    <p class="normal">CWD started out more slowly than most of us thought 
	      it would. However, the time that it has taken to establish relationships 
	      among the museums, teachers, and university staff has been very 
	      worthwhile. Since this project is unique in many ways, in this first 
	      year, we have allowed ourselves the time to figure out the projectís 
	      development process.</p>
	    <p class="normal">All of the participants value the collaborative 
	      relationships that have been formed through CWD, and would like 
	      these partnerships to continually expand their outreach to CUIP 
	      schools and beyond. By the springtime, we should have a better idea 
	      of the lessons learned from this project along the way and its status 
	      for the future. We are hopeful that this initiative can serve as 
	      a model for other museum-school-university partnerships. </p>
