      <p align="left" class="heading"><b>Selling More Without Selling Out: Museum 
        Merchandising That Supports a Museumís Mission</b></p>
      <p class="author"><b>Dean Johnson, MuseumCompany.com, USA</b></p>
      <p align="center" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
       <blockquote>
          
        <p class="small">This paper discusses how a museum can partner with an 
          established commercial entity to use more effectively the Internet to 
          reach the museumís constituency, establish a professional Internet presence, 
          increase merchandise sales, simplify museum gift shop operations, and 
          more proficiently use scarce capital resources.</p>
          
        <p class="small">Museums have Internet sites that range from modest translations 
          of their brochures to award-winning multimedia presentations. However, 
          Internet funding and the talent to develop Web sites are both scarce. 
          Partnering with an established, reputable commercial entity to develop 
          a professional Internet presence while simultaneously enjoying the benefits 
          of increased cyber gift shop traffic is a powerful combination. This 
          concept is made even more attractive because it can be done at no additional 
          cost to the museum and will result in substantial cost savings.</p>
          
        <p class="small">In summary, such a partnership can (i) achieve better 
          member outreach through a professional Internet presence and analysis 
          of member purchasing behavior, (ii) dramatically improve onsite and 
          Internet museum shop operations by reducing onsite inventory, providing 
          additional Internet product opportunities and offering one-stop fulfillment, 
          and (iv) reduce the financial commitment to shop inventory while developing 
          additional revenue sources.</p>
      
       </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal">For those of you who have only recently begun to 
	research, correspond, and shop online, perhaps the most annoying thing 
	about Web culture is that it frequently advertises itself as a <b><i>first 
	</i></b> in all areas. Listening to some people talk, you might get the 
	impression that only now are art and technology exploring the benefits 
	of partnering with each other for mutual advantage. But the wedding of 
	art and technology is, of course, not as recent a development as one might 
	suspect. Consider this: in the final years of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, 
	Louis Comfort Tiffany joined forces with Thomas Edison to create a design 
	for the first moving picture theater. Thanks to both Tiffanyís impeccable 
	sense of craftsmanship and Edisonís genius for invention, the silver screen 
	has changed world culture beyond even <b><i>their </i></b> wildest dreams.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In many ways, then, the partnering of art and technology 
        in the realm of cyberspace is more accurately a continuation of this rich 
        tradition. The major portion of my talk today is aimed at examining the 
        potential, that is, the <b><i>future</i></b> of what such a partnering 
        can mean for museums and e-commerce. But in order to understand such a 
        unionóand certainly in order to realize its full potentialóitís important 
        to note the larger historical context in which art and technology have 
        helped to create some of the most innovative, surprising, andówe hopeóengaging 
        aspects of the Information culture. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">My purpose here is to present to you some of the 
        tangible, proven ways in which e-commerce and museums can continue this 
        tradition of interplay. I will focus specifically on how Web retailers 
        and museums such as those that are represented here at the conference 
        can do business thatís not only mutually profitable, but that also honors 
        the missions and constituencies of all parties involved, which is what 
        I mean with my title, &#34;Selling more without selling out.&#34; When 
        we know more of what our present options are, the decisions we make about 
        the future become all the more exciting.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">All hyperbole aside, the growth of Internet traffic 
	is astounding, escalating as it does every few months. And with it comes 
	huge increases in e-commerce. Recent industry reports put online consumer 
	spending during the &#39;99 holiday season at nearly <b><i>four times</i></b> 
	the rate of the previous year. Why? At the risk of oversimplification, 
	itís this: as the processes behind e-commerce continue to be refined, 
	consumers feel more confident about online spending because they are seeing 
	much wider, more appealing selections of products and services, they see 
	content-rich sites that present up-to-the minute information about a wide 
	spectrum of topics and issues, and, finally, they receive faster, more 
	attentive customer service than ever before on the Web.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Yet, for the all the progress being made to reach 
        their various constituencies on the Web, many groups working <b><i>alone</i></b> 
        do not have adequate resources or time to devote to establishing a professional 
        Internet presence. For museums in particular, the challenges are unique 
        and must be recognized as such. Typically, retailers of computers, digital 
        cameras, and other technology products amass various brands, run specials, 
        and blast hundreds or perhaps thousands of other sites with their banner 
        and &#34;pop-up&#34; ads in hopes of driving revenue. But if museums 
        were to adopt similar strategies, they would stand to alienate their members. 
        Generally speaking, museums seek to raise public awareness of art and 
        artifacts, stimulate interest in events, and collaborate with a variety 
        of other groups to enrich community life. How and where does e-commerce 
        fit with this kind of mission?</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Lest my message be misconstrued, though, let me 
        clarify one point: I have nothing against purveyors of technology hardware. 
        Thanks to their presence on the Web, I was able to purchase the laptop 
        on which I wrote and revised this paper. Furthermore, the company I represent 
        relies on the latest digital technology to produce crisp, state-of-the-art 
        imaging for the products we feature on our site. But the technology products 
        did not attract me because they were exclusives made by a computer artisan 
        or because they were faithful reproductions of older, more famous computers 
        or cameras. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">As I said earlier, museums face unique challenges 
        in reaching their audiences, disseminating information in a timely, cost-effective 
        way, increasing merchandise sales, simplifying museum gift operations, 
        and using often scarce capital resources more efficiently. These goals, 
        of course, apply equally to the worlds of the Internet and traditional 
        brick-and-mortar stores. Yet the speed and ever-increasing traffic on 
        the Web up the ante even more. That museums trade in product is hardly 
        news to any of you, but what it takes for them to sell effectively online 
        and to use the Internet to its fullest has not been an easy path to pursue. 
        Some museums have Internet sites that range from modest translations of 
        their brochures to award-winning multimedia presentations. But by and 
        large, museums do not have limitless resources for developing software 
        programs, hiring costly outside web design firms, or creating scale economies 
        in fulfillment, promotion, and merchandising. And why should they? As 
        any successful organization knows, if you over-extend, losing sight of 
        your mission and what you do well, then you stand to lose everything. 
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This is where the concept of partnering art and 
        technology becomes not simply an interesting approach but one of <b><i>vital 
        importance</i></b> to museums of all kinds. In collaboration with an established, 
        reputable commercial entity, museums can work much more effectively to 
        create a professional Internet presence, enlarge their member outreach, 
        and enjoy the benefits of increased Web gift shop traffic. Museums that 
        forge such alliances excel because they now have the resources to pursue 
        more expansive goals while not losing their focus on what they do best. 
        Rather than devoting limited humanpower and funds to managing Web merchandising, 
        partnered museums now have access to the resources of an e-commerce entity 
        whose business it is to develop sophisticated software, hire designers, 
        and present valuable content in a format that complements the museumís 
        mission. Working closely with its museum partner, the online entity can 
        provide the kind of professional, full-time Web management that heretofore 
        has been beyond the financial reach of most museums. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Another area in which partnered museums stand to 
        reap significant gains is in the management of their merchandising operations. 
        Since merchandising <i>per se</i> is usually an auxiliary activity to 
        the museumís main mission, the issues of product development, product 
        selection, cross-selling, and up-selling only complicate the task of generating 
        revenue. But for the e-commerce partner with dedicated merchandisers, 
        these activities are second nature. They can maximize the potential of 
        existing product lines and develop innovative<b>,</b> exciting products. 
        An additional benefit is that the costs for such development are amortized 
        over a larger number of units and can be used as part of a revenue-sharing 
        agreement between the partners. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Product development, however, is only part of the 
        value that the e-commerce partner brings to bear on the collaborative 
        venture with a museum. Beyond the basics of merchandising is the process 
        of <b><i>data mining</i></b>, an activity that yields important insights 
        into member purchasing patterns and helps both partners to discern opportunities 
        for future promotion and community building. Through data mining, museums 
        can identify not simply the products but also the kinds of content that 
        engages their members. Data mining helps museum fill in the broad strokes 
        with nuanced information about their constituencyís needs and interests. 
        Thanks to the speed and efficiency of their e-commerce partner, a museum 
        can respond more quickly and accurately than ever before to those whom 
        they serve.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Yet no matter how quickly technology allows museums 
        to respond to their members, they face yet another challenge that can 
        easilyóand, I believe, erroneouslyóbe dismissed as just a fact of museum 
        life, <b><i>which is</i></b> that only a minute segment of the museum 
        store market is able to achieve any scale economies. Here again is where 
        an e-commerce partner can prove indispensable. The joint venture between 
        a museum and online merchant can yield economies and additional customer 
        service that are not otherwise possible, namely, through carefully trained 
        telephone support, gift wrapping and shipping, receipt retention, and 
        effective cross-selling and up-selling techniques. After all, the greater 
        the volume, the better the buying <b><i>and</i></b> the more successful 
        the selling opportunities.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">As I mentioned earlier, one of the reasons that 
        online shopping increases so dramatically every few months is the vast 
        improvement weíve seen in product fulfillment and customer service. Thereís 
        something about the &#34;click&#34; of the mouse that inspires in Web 
        shoppers a greater demand for speed. The museums that make a graceful 
        leap from brick-and-mortar retail to that of the Internet acknowledge 
        this fact and respond accordingly. By partnering with an e-commerce company 
        that has perfected the <b><i>art</i></b> of fulfillment and post-sale 
        operations, a museum stands a far greater chance of not merely satisfying 
        those demands but of building great consumer loyalty. Iíd like to note, 
        I donít use that word &#34;art&#34; flippantly. Having an efficient 
        fulfillment and customer service operation is equal parts inspiration 
        and technique: an online retailer that processes orders quickly, anticipates 
        customersí needs, lets them know <b><i>when</i></b> their orders have 
        shipped, and provides knowledgeable, trained service personnel is at once 
        as perfectly orchestrated as a Frank Lloyd Wright art glass window and 
        as fully realized as a Vermeer face. Itís truly a sight to behold. The 
        brilliance lies in the details: a system that automatically acknowledges 
        individual orders down to the item level, automatic e-mail shipping notification 
        with tracking information included, simplified and streamlined return 
        process, and customer service anytime, day or night. For museums that 
        want to flourish on the Web, the lesson is clear: they stand to benefit 
        enormously from using an infrastructure thatís built and managed by a 
        seasoned e-commerce partner. And by offering one-stop fulfillment, the 
        e-commerce entity helps to reduce the museumís financial commitment to 
        shop inventory even as it develops additional revenue streams. Once again, 
        it makes sense to let each partner do what it does best.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In terms of marketing and advertising as well, partnerships 
	make imminent sense. Vital to every museumís mission is the task of making 
	its collection better known to the public. By partnering with a commercial 
	entity, it can secure greater exposure for its unique products. As a number 
	of online retailers already know, brand matters as much on the Web as 
	in more traditional venues. Consumers respond very favorably to recognized 
	brands, and museums that make branding one of their primary online initiatives 
	will generate greater traffic and public awareness of their mission, holdings, 
	events, and product line. Experienced in the lingo of Internet branding, 
	an e-commerce entity can work closely with its museum partner to develop 
	strategies for communicating brand and bringing its power to bear on all 
	aspects of the museumís online retail activities. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Whatís more, content links generate increased traffic 
        at levels that would be virtually impossible under any alternative, non-cyber 
        arrangement. But content links arenít the only technique thatís proven 
        to work online. EDMs, or electronic direct mailings, allow museums to 
        communicate directly with their members at a fraction of the cost of traditional 
        promotional pieces, catalogs, and gift shops flyers. People tend to visit 
        brick-and-mortar shops when they attend an exhibition or other museum 
        event, and some of them will undoubtedly browse the catalogs when they 
        arrive in the mail. But through such Internet marketing methods as EDMs, 
        a museumís <b><i>full</i></b> collection of products can be made available 
        for all purchasing occasions online to millions of customers in an appealing, 
        yet less costly, format. The more products that are offered, the more 
        likely the site will become a favorite destination for museum patrons 
        and gift-givers with refined tastes. Rather than being accessible to the 
        customer only during hours of operation or when print mailings go out, 
        museum take their place among membersí favorite online spots, the sites 
        they bookmark for frequent visits.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">At this point, some of you may be thinking, &#34;Thatís 
        all well and good. But arenít EDMs little more than junk e-mail? And by 
        subjecting your members to such mailings, arenít you guilty of spamming?&#34; 
        For the record, spamming is no good. For some denizens of the Internet, 
        itís a minor annoyance; for others itís a form of harassment. The kind 
        of EDM campaign that I advocate is far different. Itís an outgrowth of 
        the so-called &#34;permission-based&#34; model of marketing that begins 
        with the premise that itís best to give members a chance to indicate what, 
        if any, news about events, products, and promotions that they wish to 
        receive andójust as importantlyóto provide them with the opportunity in 
        each mailing to opt out of, or unscribe to, future announcements. Unlike 
        spamming, which offers no freedom of choice and no protection from future 
        invasions of privacy, permission-based EDM marketing hinges on members 
        choosing to be in the loop, as it were, with their favorite museums. So 
        rather than being subjected to promotional e-mails that arrive arbitrarily 
        and clutter the userís in-box, members have a direct hand in determining 
        whether or not they are contacted at all. But permission-based marketing 
        is not simply a yes-no proposition.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Using the data mining resources available through 
        an established e-commerce partner, museums can target their message, contacting 
        segments of their memberships. Only those members who have indicated an 
        interest in learning about special promotions of, say, statuary or apparel 
        receive notices. At the same time, EDMs allow museums to target their 
        dissemination of rich content. For example, by working with their online 
        partner to identify members through data mining, museums can distribute 
        a calendar of events for the next month, six months, or yearócomplete 
        with multimedia features that enhance the &#34;look and feel&#34; of 
        the site. Museums can also notify members in advance of an online article 
        that spotlights a particular artist or exhibit if these members have indicated 
        that they have an interest in learning more about certain subjects. In 
        using an e-commerce partnerís resources to promote their mission, museums 
        can create multi-faceted, visually appealing sites where members go and 
        browse, much as they do in the brick-and-mortar spaces.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Believe me when I say, itís imperative that museums 
        pay more than lip service to the concept of community building on their 
        Web sites. If a museum seeks to maximize retail profits but ignores the 
        issue of cultivating a sense of community on their site, they put their 
        entire mission in peril. To neglect members is to risking alienating them, 
        which can have devastating results for any Internet group, no matter what 
        its mission. The ways in which a museum can achieve this goal are, however, 
        not nearly as complex as you might think. An e-commerce partner can provide 
        a museum with the necessary technological muscle to make use of such common-sense 
        tools as e-mail lists, discussion groups, and other forms of targeted, 
        instantaneous communication that have proven to be very effective methods 
        of creating a Web community. Let me rephrase that: they are effective<b><i> 
        and essential.</i></b> Indeed, building e-mail lists, discussion groups, 
        and interest areas are no longer mere accessories on a flashy site but, 
        rather, are a necessary component of the give-and-take between museums 
        and their online constituencies. Targeted contact with members increase 
        the so-called &#34;stickiness&#34; of the site, that is, the qualities 
        that make it an appealing place to go <b><i>and</i></b> increase the length 
        of the average visit.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Working in concert with an e-partner, museums can 
        very effectively build and retain their membership bases, and they can 
        do so without huge outlays of capital. All of this is not to say, however, 
        that I recommend that museums abandon all traditional methods of member 
        outreach; rather, I advocate taking something of a holistic approach by 
        incorporating the core competencies of an e-commerce partner into an overall 
        program that suits the mission of the individual museum. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">As museums increase their Internet exposure and 
        maximize their promotional opportunities through such community-building 
        tools as EDMs and discussion groups, they see increased funds for product 
        development, which brings my presentation full circle. Indeed, itís the 
        shape that most accurately represents the nature of a partnership between 
        a museum and an e-commerce group. Professional Web management, dedicated 
        merchandising, expanded resources for product development, the reduction 
        of shop inventory through one-stop fulfillment, trained telephone sales 
        and customer service, permission-based marketing, and the use of community-building 
        contentóthese arenít disparate services that have no real effect upon 
        one another. Instead, theyíre pieces of the infinitely engaging puzzle 
        of how to use the Internet to your advantage. And this puzzle is quite 
        solvable. Through partnership with a well-conceived, smartly managed online 
        company that has a proven infrastructure, the pieces fit together rather 
        nicely to form a picture of forward-thinking groups working in concert.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">As I see it, the real value of partnership between 
	museums and e-commerce is more than mere strength in numbers. The best 
	online partnerships are those that are ground-breaking, not simply for 
	noveltyís sake, but because the medium itselfóthe Internetódemands it. 
	And the power that comes from combining the expertise, resources, and 
	vision of the respective members can be absolutely astonishing. To sell 
	more is to sell out? Quite to the contrary. Letís not sell ourselves short. 
	If the joint venture between Louis Tiffany and Thomas Edison were any 
	indication of where art and technology can take us, weíd be fools not 
	to accept the challenge.</span></p>
