      </p><p align="center" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b> </p>

      <blockquote class="small"> 

        <p>The Art Museum Image Consortium (AMICO) made a library of digital multimedia 

          documentation of more than 50,000 works of art available under subscription 

          to educational institutions in 1999. In so doing, it forged a new model 

          of how museums and the educational sector might together create and 

          sustain multimedia digital libraries, respecting copyright and making 

          rich content available at an acceptablecost. In this paper, we examine 

          AMICO&#39;s experience to analyze the common challenges that must be faced 

          by any digital library construction project. A digital cultural heritage 

          resource will be built on the collections of numerous repositories - 

          why would these institutions want to collaborate and how can the persuaded 

          to continue to work together? It will digitize only a fraction of the 

          possible material within its scope (especially in its first few years) 

          - how will collection development decisions be made? It will represent 

          existing content in digital form - what standards will it impose? It 

          will create a copyright protected product and typically use copyright 

          protected material - how will it acquire and protect intellectual property? 

          It will be created in order to be used - what delivery systems will 

          be deployed to provide access and by whom/for whom will they be operated? 

          Such a resource will cost a great deal, especially when considered over 

          many years - how can funding be sustained, who will pay for it and how 

          will the funds be used?

      <p class="heading"><b>Introduction</b> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">Despite recent digital developments, most human creations 

        are physical artifacts and the greater part of our knowledge is still 

        recorded only in analog form. But as museums involved in web site creation 

        and online information delivery know very well, we are at the beginning 

        of an age of digital and virtual culture. Yet socio-economic and technical 

        models for construction and delivery of collections of digital materials 

        ­ digital libraries ­ are all still experimental. Today we see 

        commercial, governmental and not-for-profit entities all trying to be 

        significant players in the delivery of quality, persistent online information. 

        The fundamental questions all such organizations must answer are the same. 

        Launching AMICO, a not-for-profit consortium of repositories holding works 

        of art, has revealed some basic issues that must be addressed in the design 

        of any digital library initiative The specific choices AMICO has made, 

        and how they relate to the matrix of options facing any collection &#39;going 

        digital&#39; are best understood in the context of an analysis of the policy 

        options. </span> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">The Art Museum Image Consortium was formed in September 

        1997 as an independent not-for-profit membership organization of institutions 

        with collections of art. AMICO Members are collaborating to enable educational 

        use of museum multimedia documentation; specifically, they are created 

        a digital library, the AMICO Library<span class="small"><sup>TM</sup>,</span> 

        from their collective resources. They have decided to collaborate to do 

        something no single institution could do on its own, provide a comprehensive 

        service to the educational community. The experience of AMICO as a consortium, 

        of the individual institutions who are its members and users, and of the 

        organizations who are its subscribers and distributors serves as a case 

        study of the issues involved in building multimedia digital libraries. 

        In constructing networked cultural heritage resources AMICO is creating 

        new products and processes. These new activities require new methods and 

        strategies. Together AMICO members are facing social, economic, legal 

        and technical challenges, as they strive to bring their collections together 

        into a coherent and useful educational resource. As well as integrating 

        data, however, we&#39;ve realized that we&#39;re integrating people, institutions, 

        and systems. </span> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">AMICO was founded to encourage broad use of museum 

        collections in digital form. Such collections need to be persistent and 

        searchable. While most museums now have a web site, the function of these 

        sites varies from institution to institution; with few exceptions, they 

        are not designed to be collection catalogs. Most museum sites change content 

        regularly to attract visitors to new museum exhibits or programs. Even 

        when museums have decided to keep a substantial core of collections information 

        available, it is difficult for users with a research objective to search 

        across these online resources, which understandably have a very institutional 

        focus. Technically, most quality museum content that can be viewed on<i> 

        </i>the web, isn&#39;t really on the web at all; it resides in databases that 

        are linked to the web rather than in static html pages. As a consequence, 

        standard search engines are most unlikely to reveal these richness. The 

        value of a single source for quality museum content was demonstrated in 

        the experimental Museum Educational Site Licensing Project (MESL) and 

        the institutions which founded AMICO turned that lesson into a permanent 

        program (Getty, 1998a&amp;b). </span> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">AMICO also has roots in the need to efficiently 

        administer educational licenses. Museums contain works that are under 

        copyright, they hold copyrighted photographs of works in their collections, 

        and they create intellectual property in publications, interpretive programs, 

        sound, video, and databases. Museums also negotiate with (and often pay) 

        artists and artists estates for rights to reproduce works still under 

        copyright. In a stringent funding climate, museums are wise to want to 

        protect their own assets. They must manage the rights they license to 

        others to ensure that they are able to leverage their investment in the 

        creation of images and information about their collections. But museum 

        licensing can become a cost center rather than a profit center when serving 

        the educational community. The specter of wanting to dramatically increase 

        educational use of digital resources while having to grant rights (often 

        without fees) on a work by work, use by use, teacher by teacher, course 

        by course, basis was enough to spur museum administrators to examine methods 

        of more efficiently administering licenses collectively. Efficient administration 

        also benefits users, for they are not supporting multiple transaction 

        costs. </span> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p class="normal">Museums are not equipped to support digital library services: 

        24x7 help desks and huge digital content delivery infrastructures are 

        incidental to the museum&#39;s mission. AMICO members felt that other institutions, 

        which are in the business of distributing digital content to a variety 

        of educational institutions, could best develop both the services and 

        the necessary interfaces and tools for effective use of multimedia documentation 

        of works of art. 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p class="normal">AMICO Members also wanted to create a forum in which they 

        could exchange information and learn from each other about the technologies 

        and techniques employed in the digitization of collections documentation. 

        Building links among the museum professional staff who were creating museum 

        multimedia resources ensured that the solutions being developed were not 

        reached in isolation, and encouraged a more standards-based and integrative 

        approach to technology strategy. Sharing information also leveraged institutional 

        areas of expertise. Reaching out collectively to the users of museum digital 

        documentation was also appealing. As a consortium we could build links 

        to user communities and learn from them and their use of our collections. 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p class="normal">AMICO&#39;s Members faced challenges that all creators of 

        multi-institutional information resources encounter. These can be characterized 

        as:

      </p><p class="heading"><b>Building Community and Defining Roles</b> 

      </p><p align="left" class="normal"><span class="normal">There are many organizational 

        and individual players involved in the social system that enables the 

        creation, delivery and use of a digital library resource. In AMICO&#39;s case, 

        member institutions create the </span>digital multimedia documentation 

        without additional funding from AMICO or income tied to AMICO use. AMICO 

        staff compile, validate and enhance the data, and pass the compiled Library 

        on to distributors of networked information resources; they operate on 

        income from members and subscribers. Distributors integrate the AMICO 

        Library into their service provision networks, provide access to it, and 

        support subscribers; their value added services need to be supported by 

        their clientele. Subscribing institutions coordinate access for their 

        users, and support their use, possibly by integrating sub-sets of the 

        Library into local systems; this (new) resource competes with other resources 

        for institutional funds. Individual users both search the entire Library 

        online, and integrate selections into their own teaching and research 

        environments. Each of the participants in this chain depends on the actions 

        of the one before, to meet the needs of those who are in turn relying 

        on them. Figure I<b> </b>diagrams these relationships.

      <p><span class="normal">The Art Museum Image Consortium was founded by 22 

        institutions in the fall of 1997 after a six-month, self-funded planning 

        exercise. Membership in the consortium is open and growing. There are 

        now over 30 members in North America. New members are welcome, and we 

        are actively pursuing collaboration with European institutions. One measure 

        of success of any such consortium is its continued ability sustain original 

        membership and to attract new members. </span> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p class="normal"><span class="normal">Membership in AMICO has both benefits 

        and responsibilities. Members support AMICO&#39;s activities through paying 

        annual dues, scaled to their own budget, that range from $2,500 - $5,000. 

        They contribute catalog records, images, texts, and multimedia files regularly 

        to the Library (in annual increments). In return, AMICO Members gain access 

        to the entire AMICO Library under a museum license (AMICO 1999b), for 

        use in their educational programs, in galleries, their reference library, 

        curatorial research, and other museum activities. They also profit from 

        the technical expertise and assistance of the central staff of the Consortium 

        and attend the AMICO annual meeting. They govern the organization and 

        participate in its Working Committees ­ Editorial, Technical, Rights, 

        and Users. This participation is itself a major benefit as it serves to 

        develop staff expertise in an area in which all of the members can benefit 

        from each other&#39;s experience. Maintaining a commitment of staff in member 

        institutions through building professional and personal </span> relations 

        is crucial to such enterprises. Membership activities are facilitated 

        though a password-protected web site, and a series of topically focussed 

        mailing lists.

      </p><h6 class="heading"> <b>Central Staff</b> </h6>

      <p><span class="normal">In theory, compilations of distributed resources 

        could be created through implementation of common standards, but in practice 

        digital resources, even in mature areas such as union lists of library 

        holdings (Coyle 2000) require central staff. The central staff of AMICO 

        (now approximately 6 and growing to 8 FTE professionals) assists members 

        in the digitization and documentation of their collections, and helps 

        them make their contributions to the AMICO Library. In addition to compiling 

        the resource, AMICO staff provides advice, training and support on an 

        as-needed basis, and also develops specifications and best practices that 

        serve the needs of all members. </span> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">The management of the legal agreements that provide 

        the foundation for AMICO is also the responsibility of its staff. Any 

        multi-institutional consortium is built on such legal agreements and needs 

        to be open to their evolution over time. Each AMICO member signs both 

        a Membership Agreement, providing AMICO with a license to use its digital 

        documentation, and a Museum License, providing the Member with the right 

        to use the full AMICO Library (AMICO, 1999a,b). AMICO also manages agreements 

        with Distributors, who provide the Library to end users, and with Subscribers, 

        who sign license agreements appropriate to their circumstances (AMICO, 

        1999b-e). AMICO staff has also negotiated a consortium-wide agreement 

        with the Artists Rights Society (ARS) to facilitate the clearance of rights 

        associated with modern and contemporary works that remain under copyright. 

        AMICO administers this agreement and the associated royalty payments on 

        behalf of its members which relieves them of what otherwise would be a 

        significant administrative burden and extra costs. </span> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">AMICO compiles each Member&#39;s contribution into the 

        AMICO Library, verifying data formats and vocabulary to ensure consistency. 

        To do this, central staff built a series of software tools (a Contribution 

        Management System) which include functionality such as online editing, 

        term lists, biographical files and term occurrence reports, that help 

        the museums to more consistently edit their own data. AMICO staff also 

        enhance indexing and construct and apply authority files to add terminology 

        that will further enable access for the end user. Image and multimedia 

        files are validated, and record structures and links checked before the 

        assembled digital library is transferred to Distributors. </span> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><h6 class="heading"> <b>AMICO Distributors</b> </h6>

      <p><span class="normal">There are many different user communities interested 

        in access to networked cultural heritage. AMICO recognized at least three 

        fundamentally different audiences based on the academic level, sophistication 

        and age of the users, the political jurisdictions and geographical locations 

        of the subscribers, and the language of the interface.- Rather than assume 

        that we would be able to create distribution systems that catered to all 

        these diverse needs AMICO has contracted with established network information 

        providers to delivery the AMICO Library to their constituencies. Each 

        distributor integrates the AMICO Library into their systems, and provides 

        access through an interface that meets their clients needs. It is, therefore, 

        possible to gain access to the AMICO Library through a number of distinct 

        service providers: The Research Libraries Group (RLG) offers an academic 

        and research focused application. A state-wide consortium in Ohio (OhioLink) 

        has developed a delivery to higher education and will be experimenting 

        with K-12 delivery in the coming year. The California Digital Library 

        of the University of California is exploring more user- focused interfaces 

        for their multi-campus system. Other distributors are being approached 

        for primary and secondary school users, public library users and users 

        in other countries. This strategy enables distinct communities to encounter 

        the AMICO Library in environments they already know, integrated with other 

        data which adds value for their purposes, and with tools that provide 

        for their needs. Our key goal is to have users encounter the AMICO Library 

        content when and where they are searching for information. </span>

        of the member museums&#39; collections, and provides a facility to comment 

        on particular works. The Thumbnail catalog also contains work-level links 

        to the Rights and Reproductions office of the each museum, so that those

      </p><p class="normal">The first full application delivering the AMICO Library 

        was developed by the Research Libraries Group (RLG ­ http//www.rlg.org) 

        a not-for-profit membership association of libraries and research institutions. 

        RLG offers bibliographic services, and a series of online resources in 

        the humanities, including abstracting and indexing services, archival 

        resources, and a developing cultural resources service. Integrating the 

        AMICO Library within the RLG environment offered a number of advantages 

        for existing RLG users. First, the interface was familiar: if you could 

        use one of RLG&#39;s other files in Eureka, you could use the AMICO Library. 

        The RLG Eureka application provides users with the full data in the AMICO 

        Library, in a number of different views that will seem familiar to users 

        of image databases. Search results are presented in list form, accompanied 

        by a small thumbnail image. A click on any image, opens the full record 

        for that work. Clicking on the image in the catalog record opens the full 

        image (at one of two pre-defined resolutions). Users may also order the 

        TIFF images through RLG to be delivered offline. Figures 3 and 4 show 

        this dialog.

      <p> <span class="normal"><b>Subscribers</b></span> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">Educational institutions subscribe to the AMICO 

        Library on behalf of their user communities. Universities, colleges, schools, 

        libraries, museums, and galleries are all potential subscribers, and pay 

        an annual license fee for unlimited access to a growing library. Each 

        user community receives access under a license tailored to their needs. 

        (AMICO 1999e) Development of these license agreements has taken several 

        years ­ terms for them were originally developed in discussions in 

        the Museum Site Licensing Project (MESL) and adapted through experience 

        in the AMICO University Testbed Project ­ and represents yet another 

        benefit that AMICO has been able to deliver to its members. The license 

        agreement specifies who can use the AMICO Library (such as faculty, staff, 

        students, researchers, walk-in users and distance education students) 

        and what uses they can make of the content (non-commercial educational 

        uses, including presentations, papers, theses, lectures, and integration 

        into in local systems, if they are access controlled). </span> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">No AMICO license allows publication, web or other 

        redistribution or commercial use of works in the AMICO Library because 

        these rights need to be granted directly by each rights holder AMICO has 

        provided a shortcut approach to obtaining publication rights by including 

        the link to each members Rights and Reproduction Office. We ask that institutions 

        have a policy on access to electronic resources in place, that includes 

        appropriate measures for sanctioning infringing users, in order to balance 

        the decision not to include technological controls on access beyond user 

        authentication. </span> 

      </p><p class="heading"><b>Selecting Content</b> 

      </p><p class="normal">Collections development for networked cultural heritage 

        will remain a challenge for some years. The size and scope of the problem 

        ­ collections comprising millions of works are not uncommon ­ 

        requires any solution to be incremental. At about 55,000 works there are 

        more gaps in the AMICO Library than there are strong points ­ more 

        holes than cheese ­ and opinion differs as to the appropriate strategy 

        for collection development. In theory, a consortium could &#34;pull&#34; 

        content from its members by requesting specific works, but as a voluntary 

        organization that does not fund the activities of its members AMICO treads 

        a fine line when it recommends strategies for collection development. 

        Since AMICO Members contribute content that they digitize themselves, 

        it is most likely that the majority of the works chosen for each year&#39;s 

        edition will be those that reflect members priorities. This &#34;push&#34; 

        strategy has some unsuspected advantages ­ content currently being 

        used by the museums not accidentally intersects with the interests of 

        the users: new acquisitions, loans, temporary or loan exhibitions, permanent 

        collection gallery reinstallations, and published works are all those 

        in the public eye. In addition, content being used by the museums in any 

        given year will have the best documentation and the best photography. 

        Push from the repositories is also a more efficient strategy for collections 

        development. Digital documentation (indeed even museum photography) does 

        not already exist for much of a museum collection. Often significant research 

        is required in order to document collections. If other priorities are 

        driving digitization, photography and research, it is most efficient to 

        use the resulting record to build collaboratively constructed resources. 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p class="normal">Strategies to construct content by &#34;pulling&#34; 

        what users request or editors suggest, is complicated by the differences 

        in opinions between different users as to what constitutes critical mass 

        or desirable content. In focus group studies conducted by AMICO in 1999, 

        we found tensions between users who want breadth of coverage, and many 

        representative works, and those who want depth of coverage, many images 

        of a particular work along with detailed documentation and accompanying 

        multimedia. We found some potential users wanted works that they were 

        familiar with while others thought it would be more valuable to have obscure 

        works and works from hard to get to collections. In short, the expectations 

        and desires of digital library users will color their perception of networked 

        cultural heritage resources. Collectively they will not seek the same 

        content, for the same purposes. AMICO has accepted that the AMICO Library 

        will grow over time. Vehicles to facilitate communication between users 

        and AMICO Members to identify pockets of broadly useful content may be 

        a way forward. 

      </p><p class="heading"><b>Defining Documentation</b> 

      </p><p class="normal">Of course the question about what content to include and 

        how to obtain it does not end with which works should be included. Indeed, 

        choices about content only begin with the identification of which works 

        will be included in the digital resource. The more significant choices 

        are what documentation of each work to include. AMICO is not a slide library 

        ­its value resides in the textual descriptions and other documentation 

        about the work, not just in an images of it. As the range of multimedia 

        about each work in the library increases (sound files, movies, structured 

        texts) and the depth of each of these files increases, the decisions about 

        content multiply. One important consideration is that the content itself 

        will be regularly updated, for technical reasons as well as because the 

        knowledge available about a given work expands. Content itself must be 

        sustainable and extensible. Ideally it will be sufficiently granular to 

        support a variety of views and sufficiently interoperable to connect to 

        other resources. Some of the goals conflict with others. 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p class="normal">The data model developed by any digital library project 

        will be critical to its success. But this is not a simple matter of adopting 

        an appropriate standard, because as of yet the museum community and the 

        digital library metadata community are without standard record architectures. 

        If the data model of the digital compilation requires each institution 

        to re-create its existing documentation, significant costs will be incurred 

        and technical problems encountered that will be barriers to content acquisition. 

        In some relatively small, focussed, and discipline driven projects ­ 

        such as the Beowulf project (University of Kentucky http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/eBeowulf/guide.htm) 

        or the Rossetti Archive (University of Virginia http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/rossetti/)­ 

        it may be possible for scholarly participants to significantly enhance 

        each item of documentation to make it conform to a new standard. But broader 

        collections will find institutions cannot afford to participate in numerous 

        digital library compilations if each requires different data from what 

        they normally make for themselves and different from that of each other 

        project in which they are involved. The AMICO model has several levels 

        of granularity and few mandatory fields. It does not typically require 

        any new data to be created, but its extensible record architecture creates 

        a relatively rich connection between text, multimedia and computer file 

        documentation 

      </p><p align="left"> 

      </p><p class="normal" align="left">A work in the AMICO library is documented 

        by at least three logically and physically separate parts, diagrammed 

        in Figure 5. The first is the <i>catalog record</i> that describes the 

        work of art itself, recording a wide variety of fielded textual information, 

        including its physical description, the circumstances of its creation, 

        information about its creator, past history, provenance, social and artistic 

        context, and providing access points for these details. The AMICO Data 

        Specification (AMICO 1999f) outlines the field structure and format of 

        the catalog record. It was constructed to use data categories defined 

        by the Categories for Description of Works of Art (CDWA, 1995).

      <p> 

      </p><p class="normal">Each catalog record must be accompanied by at least one 

        digital image of the work of art, providing critical visual evidence. 

        This image has been defined as a <i>minimum</i> of 1024 x 768 pixels in 

        24-bit color at 72 dpi. The minimum was set based on current display technology 

        and Internet transfer speeds. Members are, however, encouraged to contribute 

        images of much higher quality, and the Library includes files that range 

        in size up to approximately 30 MB. These files come to AMICO as uncompressed 

        TIFF files, and are subsequently sized and sampled for distribution, with 

        the full images available should a user request them. 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">AMICO Works may also be documented by other associated 

        images, showing details of the work, or views in different lighting conditions 

        (such as x-rays, or raking light views). &#34;Records&#34; may also 

        include linked multimedia files, such as QuickTime videos (with or without 

        sound), sound files from an audio tour including a narration about the 

        work, and extended texts (in SGML, XML, PDF or other format) ranging from 

        condition reports, to catalog entries to articles published about the 

        work. All these linked files may be submitted in any registered MIME type, 

        according to the AMICO Multimedia File Specification. </span> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">Each digital object ­ MIME Type linked to a 

        catalog record ­ is itself documented by a text metadata record, 

        providing information about its creation, physical and technical dependencies, 

        rights and restrictions and relationships. These multimedia metadata records 

        are essential to managing and interpreting the digital objects both in 

        the compilation of the library and over time, as they provide essential 

        data that is extrinsic to the physical file format itself. The content 

        of Multimedia Metadata records can be found in the AMICO Data Specification 

        (AMICO 1999f). </span> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p class="normal">In the library community, the economics of copy cataloging 

        motivated the adoption of shared standards for bibliographic records. 

        The artifact-based cultural world is without widely accepted and implemented 

        standards for documenting works of art and artifacts because the uniqueness 

        of the objects of study has, until now, denied any economic benefits in 

        sharing their cataloging. Sharing cataloging of digital surrogates could, 

        in theory, change this and lead to greater acceptance of description standards. 

        But even if standards were universally accepted, cultural objects are 

        not self-describing (they lack title pages and ISBNs created by publishers). 

        Since one can rarely catalog the interesting aspects of most cultural 

        objects simply with information from the artifact itself, any two descriptions 

        of the same item will differ. In addition, descriptions will differ as 

        a reflection of the nature of the repository which holds them and their 

        potential users. A local history collection may hold a mass-produced object, 

        collected and cataloged because it was owned by the town&#39;s founder. A 

        work of art may offer little evidence about where and when it was created, 

        and its significance may be where it was installed, or who commissioned 

        it, as much as who painted it. In addition, opinions about cultural artifacts 

        often differ, and descriptive systems need to accommodate both uncertainty 

        and conflict in cultural information if they are to reflect the basic 

        requirements of humanistic discourse. 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p class="normal">How digital collections represent knowledge is critical 

        to their utility and authenticity. In the cultural arena, simply adhering 

        to &#34;standards&#34; isn&#39;t adequate to ensure good documentation. 

        <i>How </i>standards are implemented is crucial. AMICO has developed a 

        number of strategies to implement community-based recommendations such 

        as the <i>Categories for the Description of Works of Art</i>. For example, 

        the AMICO Data Specification separates display data from access data. 

        This makes it possible for us to respect the nuance of the curator&#39;s prose, 

        while providing predictable indexing of its content. Editorial consistency 

        can be improved through shared authority files and indexing rules, but 

        not all institutions are able to implement recommendations to the same 

        level. So AMICO has developed a set of field-level parsing routines that 

        index textual descriptions of dates (such as circa 1876), and some full 

        text strings (such as artists names). Where possible, we do this in conjunction 

        with existing external reference files, such as the <i>Art and Architecture 

        Thesaurus</i> and the <i>Union List of Artists Names </i>(ULAN)<i>. </i><br/>

        <br/>

        But these files are not comprehensive, so processes must be put in place 

        to extend them with the new data found in AMICO Library contributions. 

        For example, over 30% of the names in the 1999 edition of the AMICO Library 

        were not found in ULAN. Over the coming years there is a need for collaboration 

        among organizations creating networked cultural heritage information to 

        articulate guidelines for the application of existing documentation standards, 

        to develop means for articulating best practices, and to define them when 

        necessary. 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">There are also issues in documenting complex multimedia 

        objects that are only now being addressed in fora such as the MPEG 7 discussions. 

        As creators of complex information objects we are in serious need of formats 

        that enable us to describe and maintain sophisticated document structures. 

        Until complex document descriptions in a language such as RDF are widely 

        deployable, we will have to be vigilant in the maintenance of the links 

        between our various multi-part digital information objects. </span> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">Significantly, the cultural and humanities communities 

        are just beginning to consider the issues involved in cross-resource discovery 

        and information use. It is still very difficult to move across collections, 

        and to link from original materials to other resources such as abstracting 

        and indexing services, or full texts online in resources such as JSTOR. 

        Most often in our digital collections we mimic the physical arrangement 

        of document storage rather than enabling the intellectual re-organization 

        of knowledge construction. </span> 

      </p><p class="heading"><b>Specifying Technology</b> 

      </p><p class="normal">The digital library is a hybrid systems environment, where 

        information moves with great rapidity between and among technological 

        and communications systems. Systems integration becomes a great challenge. 

        Within the AMICO framework: 

      </p><p> 

      </p><ul>

        <li> <span class="normal">M<span class="normal">embers c</span>ollections 

          data has been created for and resides collections management systems, 

          image capture and management systems, audio systems, video systems for 

          film, videotape and digital delivery, multimedia authoring systems whose 

          content in delivered to in-gallery interpretive environments and to 

          online/web-based systems and editorial/publication production systems. 

          </span> </li>

      </ul>

      <p> 

      <span class="normal"> 

      </span></p><ul>

        <li>AMICO itself has a central contribution management system which validates 

          image, text and multimedia adherence to AMICO specifications, file format 

          verification tools, and member and distributor support systems. </li>

      </ul>

       

      <p> 

      <span class="normal"> 

      </span></p><ul>

        <li>AMICO&#39;s distributors have database management, indexing and retrieval 

          systems, user authentication systems, and information delivery interfaces 

          and tools. </li>

      </ul>

       

      <p> 

      <span class="normal"> 

      </span></p><ul>

        <li>Subscribers have local on-campus systems, including online public 

          access catalogs, local image and database resources, course web pages, 

          and other teaching and testing tools, and <span class="normal">Users 

          themselves have a range of analytical, research and study systems. </span> 

        </li>

      </ul>

       

      <p> 

      </p><p class="normal">The information about works in cultural heritage collections 

        delivered over networks must move freely between and among these systems; 

        cultural heritage information is integrated into systems throughout organizations, 

        each of which supports specific functions. Shared and widely, consistently 

        deployed standards are essential to preserve the integrity of information 

        at a technical and a logical level during these transportations and transformations. 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">Multimedia file formats and structures are the most 

        vulnerable at the moment, and the most challenging, because they remain 

        un-standardized. The verification and maintenance of links within and 

        among complex objects relies in part on consistent and unique resource 

        naming and the establishment of a means of persistent identification. 

        But consistent information capture and description standards are just 

        as critical for the creation of digital cultural heritage information 

        with integrity. Without them, we can&#39;t expect comparable results across 

        collections. </span> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">Cultural heritage institutions must also address 

        the twin requirements of user authentication and resource authenticity. 

        Authentication is a matter of maintaining systems security, and managing 

        access and use permissions. Authenticity requires the maintenance of trust 

        in the digital environment and in a particular digital representation 

        of knowledge (Bearman &amp; Trant, 1998). Regardless of how secure a system 

        is, if you can&#39;t trust, or interpret the information that it contains, 

        it&#39;s utility is greatly compromised. </span> 

      </p><p class="heading"> <b>Intellectual Property Issues</b> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">Consistent intellectual property terms and conditions, 

        that enable a wide range of educational and scholarly purposes, are critical 

        to the creation of viable and useful networked cultural heritage resources. 

        Frameworks are required that provide for the distinct needs of different 

        kinds of communities, and that recognize the varying levels of risk inherent 

        in particular uses. </span> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">Many creative works are under copyright, and we 

        need to find ways to ensure that history and scholarship do not stop with 

        the public domain. It is possible to craft agreements that work for copyright 

        holders while respecting the economic realities of education, as AMICO&#39;s 

        agreement with ARS has shown. But the way forward is not denying these 

        rights, for that will only result in intransigence on the part of the 

        rights holder. Instead, we must negotiate away from fixed per-work fees 

        that impede the construction of large collections, towards more flexible 

        frameworks that respect the changing realities of digital publishing, 

        and varying kinds of digital uses </span> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">There are many ways to protect intellectual property 

        in the networked environment, and we have to be careful that we are not 

        impeding use through protection. For example, some types of &#39;watermarking&#39; 

        interfere with digital images in such a way as to make them useless for 

        certain kinds of analysis (Bissel et.al., 2000). Closed distribution systems 

        prevent the incorporation of digital content into new creative or analytical 

        environments. A range of social, legal, and technological protections 

        are going to be required to support the variety of users and uses of cultural 

        content in the years to come. </span> 

      </p><p class="heading"><b>Understanding Users</b> 

      </p><p class="normal">Digital resources are created for their end-users, but 

        until they have been made and distributed, we can only imagine (and hope) 

        who these users might be. In reports from participants after the University 

        Testbed Project which AMICO conducted in 1998-1999 (AMICO 1999g), AMICO 

        members were delighted to learn that the users of the AMICO Library came 

        from a wide range of academic departments and disciplines. Creative faculty 

        and students integrated cultural content throughout the curriculum. As 

        might have been expected, strong use was made in Art History departments, 

        as images were projected in class, used in student assignments and assigned 

        for in-depth study. Art Studio students also used the Library as a resource, 

        browsing it for works that represented particular concepts and using them 

        as inspiration for their own work. One of our goals in structuring access 

        to the AMICO Library institutionally was to encourage new and unexpected 

        uses by non-traditional users. In a Cultural History course taught by 

        Professor Marc O&#39;Connor at Boston College, works from the AMICO Library 

        provided visual context for text and music, as Dürer&#39;s <i>Large Passion</i> 

        series of prints was show along with J.S. Bach&#39;s St. Matthew Passion, 

        and Martin Luther&#39;s <i>Freedom of a Christian</i>. (see Figure 8). In 

        Technical studies works from the AMICO Library challenged students in 

        image database courses and in a School of Printing.

      </p><p> 

      </p><p class="normal">One lesson of the Testbed experience of relevance to any 

        networked cultural heritage digital resource is that teachers need help 

        in imagining how to use new resources, and time to adapt their teaching 

        and research methods to new media, in addition to upgraded facilities 

        in classrooms and software tools provided by Academic Computing centers. 

        Changing educational methods does not follow directly and inexorably from 

        publishing digital libraries.

      </p><p class="normal"> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p class="normal">As the preceding description of AMICO Library creation, 

        distribution, and use shows, there are many players in this system. Each 

        of these stakeholders is struggling with similar issues about the content 

        of the Library, its documentation, the technology used to create, distribute 

        and use it, the intellectual property framework, and economics of networked 

        information distribution. These players are also engaged in community 

        building, discovering areas of models act as inhibitors of the widespread 

        use of cultural information that we wanted to enable. Rather, we&#39;re looking 

        at the costs, benefits, and investments made by all participants, and 

        trying to create a balanced system, that enables participation by all. 

        As a not-for-profit organization, AMICO has a set of fixed costs that 

        it has to recover for the compilation and distribution of the Library. 

        These do not increase in direct proportion to the overall number of users. 

        Rather, as is the case with much digital information, the first copy costs 

        are substantial, and subsequent users represent a modest cost increment. 

        So the more subscribers there are to the AMICO Library, the lower the 

        cost is to each one. 

      </p><p class="heading"><b>Conclusions</b> 

      </p><p class="normal">AMICO&#39;s success to date has been based on its ability 

        to craft a successful collaboration built on a shared educational mission 

        and the recognition that what AMICO is trying to do could not be accomplished 

        by any member acting alone. Throughout our planning and first years of 

        operation we&#39;ve strived to create open and consistent terms for participants. 

        Each member and subscriber signs a common, public, formula-based agreement: 

        there are no special deals. We&#39;ve used the web to foster open, multi-way 

        communications between and amongst members and subscribers. All AMICO 

        specifications are public, and we&#39;ve avoided using proprietary technologies. 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">Collaboration has enabled the members of AMICO to 

        share both the risks and the benefits of ground-breaking work enabling 

        access to museum multimedia. By sharing their past successes (and failures) 

        and making some future decisions in concert, individual members of the 

        consortium can leverage the knowledge of others. Together, all members 

        are raising their level of expertise and awareness. </span> 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p><span class="normal">This climate of collaboration benefits AMICO members, 

        as they have access to a wide range of support on technical, economic, 

        legal, and organizational issues. It enables the activities of AMICO, 

        ensuring that we can create a useful and viable AMICO Library. It enables 

        our distributors to incorporate a new stream of previously unavailable 

        content into their electronic resource offerings. It provides subscribers 

        with unprecedented access to the collections of member museums, and it 

        enables users to common interest amongst previously disconnected and different 

        groups. </span> 

      </p><p class="heading"><b>Sustaining Economics</b> 

      </p><p class="normal">Creating quality digital cultural heritage is expensive. 

        The richness and complexity of the information that managed in cultural 

        collections adds to the pressure on our already stretched economic systems. 

        Enabling long-term access requires attention to self-supporting economic 

        structures when projects are designed. We must be realistic about funding 

        sources. Often grants get projects started but few sources are available 

        to support on-going operational requirements, AMICO was designed to be 

        a self-supporting not-for-profit, that operates without dependence upon 

        grant funding for its core activities. 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p class="normal">There are costs and benefits throughout the information 

        creation and use chain. Our goal was to find a balance, where all institutional 

        participants have a financial stake. Within the AMICO model, no money 

        is returned to members for their participation in the consortium. Members 

        dues and subscription fees support the new costs involved in the collation 

        and distribution of the AMICO Library. Where possible AMICO leverages 

        members&#39; contributions and encourages members, distributors, and subscribers 

        to develop tools to enable use of the Library and to add value to it. 

        (This is allowed by all the AMICO Licenses). 

      </p><p> 

      </p><p class="normal">Key in our financial model is the principle that access 

        remains free at the point of use. Pay per view build their knowledge of 

        the objects in our care. Most critically, collaboration in AMICO has ensured 

        that together we can create a strong place for culture in the digital 

        library of the future.
