      <p class="heading"><b>Web Sponsorships: How Museums and Private Companies 
	Can Play Together in a New Playground</b></p>
      <p class="author"><b>Giuliano Gaia</b>, <b>Museo Nazionale della Scienza 
	e della Tecnica &#34;Leonardo da Vinci, Italy</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
	<p align="JUSTIFY" class="small">One of the things that make the web exciting 
	  for museums is that setting up virtual exhibitions is so easy. You donít 
	  need much money, nor do you need to alter the physical structure of 
	  your museum in any way. This fact is going to change the way museums 
	  and private companies collaborate: you donít need &#34;heavy&#34; 
	  sponsorships to make your ideas come true. Moreover, new kinds of sponsorships 
	  are coming to life. Private firms can give you money, but not money 
	  only: they can give you visibility on their websites; they can give 
	  you graphic artists or programmers you could never afford; they can 
	  host your pages on powerful servers with fast connections. Now that 
	  the Internet is booming all over Europe and private companies have started 
	  investing more money on their web operations, web sponsorships are growing 
	  in importance, and getting companiesí attention is becoming easier for 
	  a museum. Web sponsorships can also be important as a first step in 
	  establishing collaboration; positive results can lead to sponsorships 
	  for the real museums. On the other hand, you have to take web operations 
	  very seriously, in order to make your sponsors happy. The Milan Science 
	  Museum web staff has been setting up this kind of sponsorship since 
	  the earliest days of the website; some of them have proved successful, 
	  while others have produced little or no results. By presenting some 
	  of these case-histories, we hope to provide other museums ideas for 
	  their own web-based sponsored operations.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <b class="heading">The Milan Science Museum Website</b> 
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Why should a Museum open a website, 
	and invest in it a relevant fraction of its budget and of the energy of 
	its staff? We at the Milan Science Museum have found four main answers 
	to these basic questions:</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><b>To get new audiences </b>A website 
	can reach new categories of people, who are either physically far away, 
	or out of the usual target of Museum initiatives. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><b>To help the visit</b> The website 
	is intended as a tool to prepare for the visit to the actual museum, in 
	order to understand better the importance of the objects and to give the 
	visitor the possibility to prepare his own itinerary according to his 
	tastes and interests. Itineraries are a necessity when visiting a 40,000 
	square meter museum with sections varying from Leonardo to clocks, from 
	ships to trains, from bicycles to aeroplanes.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><b>To experiment with the Virtual 
	Museum</b> By trying different kinds of &#34;virtual exhibitions&#34; we want 
	to investigate the fascinating problem of the relationship between the 
	museum, the audience, the real objects and their representations. Experimenting 
	with the Virtual Museum will teach us something about the deep nature 
	of the real museum.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><b>To enjoy ourselves</b>: Enjoyment 
	is a part not to be forgotten when deciding whether or not start an activity. 
	The web is amusing; you can use your imagination, experiment with many 
	kind of different things, and have an intense feedback from your visitors.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The third point, the virtual museum, 
	is perhaps the most important, and influences also the way we consider 
	web sponsorships. Our Home Page was recently changed in order to emphasise 
	this crucial point. In the centre of the new Home Page there is the image 
	of one of the XVI century cloisters of the Museum, divided in two parts: 
	the one on the left has links to all the sections and pages regarding 
	the <i>Real Museum</i>, its activities and its collections; the other 
	one, on the right, represents the same cloister in a wireframe version, 
	and is linked to all the sections of the website composing the <i>Virtual 
	Museum</i>. </span></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="gaia_fig1.jpg" width="400" height="219"/></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><b><i>fig. 1 - The Home Page of the Museum 
	Web Site <a href="http://www.museoscienza.org/">http://www.museoscienza.org</a></i></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">In our vision the website should 
	do on the Net what the real Museum does in the real world: conservation 
	and communication. A few examples of our &#34;virtual&#34; initiatives will clarify 
	what we intend by using the word &#34;conservation&#34; in the Net context: </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><b>Links</b> To link a website from 
	a Museum is saying that that website is valuable on a certain subject 
	among thousands of others on the same subject. The Museum acts as a sort 
	of &#34;certifying institution&#34; of the interest of the content of websites. 
	In this sense we conserve: we try to make the most relevant websites emerge 
	from the big ocean of the Net.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><b>Special sections</b> On the Italian 
	part of our website there are a dozen special sections treating various 
	subjects, from computer history to naval weapons technology. The content 
	of some sections was not created by the Museum, but found on the Net and 
	hosted in mirror on the Museum website, or, as in the case of the beautiful 
	Atlas of Cyberspaces ( <a href="http://www.cybergeography.com/">www.cybergeography.org</a> 
	), translated from English. We intend this mirroring as a valorisation 
	of valuable websites, in a way stronger than the normal link. Hosting 
	in mirror is also a good way to open new sections of the website with 
	a frequency impossible to maintain if we had to produce all the content 
	ourselves.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><b>3D experiments</b> One of the 
	most innovative parts of the website is Virtual Leonardo, an experimental 
	co-operative 3D environment allowing visitors to explore a virtual world. 
	Like in a real world situation, a visitor can see where the other visitors 
	are currently located, where they are going, and what they are doing. 
	Visitors can interact with 3D objects, sharing the experience of the interaction 
	with other visitors and &#34;talking&#34; with them through a chat window. (Paolini 
	et al. 1999) Experimenting with new forms of communications is part of 
	the mission of a science museum. A science museum should be not only a 
	place to show the history of science, but also new possibilities for the 
	future; the same should happen on its website. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">This focus on the website as a virtual 
	museum has led to an important consequence: that we see our website as 
	an autonomous entity. This autonomy reflects also in the internal organisation 
	of the museum: the webmaster now interacts directly with the director 
	and does not answer to the Exhibitions Dept. or to the Communication Dept.; 
	during the year 2000 a specific department will be created, the &#34;Virtual 
	Museum Department&#34;.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">As an autonomous entity with an 
	autonomous cultural activity, we try to have autonomous relationships 
	with private companies, since we believe that in the play of sponsorships 
	we are different players from the real museum, and that the playground 
	is different too.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>A different playground: a &#34;light&#34; playground</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The Milan Science Museum usually 
	operates as a classic museum in two different communication spaces, both 
	of them &#34;heavy&#34;: </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><b>the &#34;real&#34; space</b> <b>(in most 
	cases the museum itself, or outside spaces like schools)</b>, in which 
	you can communicate directly with the public, with collections, temporary 
	exhibitions, interactive laboratories, special events, etc. Operations 
	in this space are &#34;heavy&#34;: events are slow and difficult to 
	create, and much effort is needed, even economic, to make ideas become 
	true. Every initiative has to be planned in advance and suffers from many 
	limitations of space, cost, reachable audienceÖ</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><b>the media space</b> <b>(TV, newspapers, 
	etc.)</b> this kind of space seems to be light, since it&#39;s so ephemeral 
	and does not involve any physical operation; but due to the high cost 
	of the media space, it becomes heavy too. In fact you have to invest of 
	money to produce your own TV program or magazine, or you have to invest 
	much large amounts of time to get the volatile attention of journalists. 
	The consequence is that even in this space ideas are usually difficult 
	to realise.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The web space is much different. 
	It is a light space, in many ways. Costs are low, compared to usual media 
	space; things are easy and fast to set up. Audience is light: you can 
	talk with your site visitors without mediation (differently than in most 
	of the media space), but they can leave your website with a single click, 
	while getting out of the physical museum is not so easy. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">This new kind of playground also 
	generates different players: in Italy most museums are seen to be very 
	rigid institutions, tied with bureaucracy; marketing or communication 
	practices which are very common in countries like USA or UK are only now 
	starting to arise. Also philosophically Italian museums are usually focused 
	more on conservation than on communication.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">On the contrary, virtual museums 
	can be much faster than their real counterparts; thereís no bureaucracy 
	and little costs (web operations are affordable also for low-budgeted 
	museum). In other words, the web is a place where the distance between 
	idea and reality can be much thinner than in the real world. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">This is good for private companies, 
	who have often been frustrated by the slow pace typical of museums. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">There is also another thing: the 
	web is a very competitive field, in which different web sites and portals 
	have to face fierce fighting to attract visitors. We know that we have 
	one very valuable thing to offer: content. Content is king in getting 
	audience (Harden 1999). Besides, we have an image of seriousness and independence, 
	that is attractive for a company to be linked to. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Different kinds of sponsorships</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Even in this different playground, main 
	rules governing the sponsorship are the same as in the real world. You 
	have to ask yourself: &#34;What do I need?&#34; and then &#34;What can I offer?&#34;</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>We needed:</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Technical support (hosting, hardware 
	and software for developing the website)</span></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Telecom Italia: an example of &#34;multi-level&#34; 
	sponsorship</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Telecom Italia, the most important 
	Italian telecommunications company, covers many of our technical needs, 
	as well as some promotional aspects. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Telecom Italia offered us:</span></p>
      <ul>
	<p align="JUSTIFY"> 
	</p><li><span class="normal">web hosting for our website</span></li>
	<p></p>
	<p align="JUSTIFY">

	<p></p>
      </ul>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">We could then define this as a multi-level 
	sponsorship, in two senses: it is not only centred on the website, but 
	also on the Internet lab, and it covers both technical and promotional 
	aspects.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">We will now detail more the four 
	aspects of the Telecom Italia sponsorship:</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Web hosting</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Today you can get web space with 
	your domain at very low cost, and for a Museum is very easy to get it 
	for free, just by offering a little banner on its homepage. In fact we 
	were already on a free web hosting with our registered domain museoscienza.org 
	with a small Milanese provider; we had direct FTP access to our pages 
	for update. Telecom Italia offered us a worse situation, because we would 
	not be able to have a direct FTP connection any more due to internal rules 
	of the provider, and had to use complicated procedures to have our updates 
	online. In fact we decided to accept this hosting for two main reasons, 
	which are valid for many technical sponsorships:</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Telecom Italia was going to become 
	the only provider for the Museum, since it offered for free the ADSL connection 
	of the Internet lab and some dial-up connections for the offices, so we 
	had to give them the website hosting too. In fact the website is becoming 
	an important help to sponsorships regarding the real museum: promising 
	advertising on our website is something which is being done more and more 
	by Museum officials during sponsorship negotiations.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">In a sponsorship the &#34;quality&#34; of 
	a sponsor is an important factor. Our previous provider was a small provider, 
	while Telecom Italia is the biggest and most important provider in Italy. 
	Being sponsored by Telecom Italia means being an important website, and 
	that was a valuable image advantage for us.</span></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="gaia_fig2.jpg" width="320" height="240"/></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><b><i>Fig. 2: The Internet Lab </i></b></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Internet lab connection</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The existence of the Internet lab 
	was an important factor in obtaining sponsorships for the website. The 
	Internet lab is a room with twelve Personal Computers connected to the 
	Internet where students can learn how to surf the net, how to use a search_engine, 
	and other basic aspects of the Internet. During weekends the Internet 
	lab offers free access to museum visitors. The Internet lab, opened in 
	March 1999, has had considerable success, both among students and the 
	general public (foreign visitors are very pleased by the possibility of 
	using e-mail). In fact the Internet lab played an important role in obtaining 
	sponsorships for the website since it provided our sponsors a point of 
	visibility inside the museum. Moreover, the public of the Internet lab 
	consists largely of schools, one of the most important target for potential 
	sponsors. Telecom Italia provided an ADSL connection for the lab; this 
	was good for promotional purposes, because it set up the Internet lab 
	as a technology showcase (the ADSL connection was not used in Italy yet), 
	and this gained the lab much attention from technical magazines.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">We would also like to experiment 
	with another kind of web sponsorship using our Internet lab. During lessons 
	we make students visit certain websites; this means that these websites 
	receive a substantial number of visits from a perfectly defined group 
	of people; every advertiser&#39;s dream. We do not want to &#34;sell&#34; our students, 
	but would like to use this to convince large, popular websites (such as 
	music websites) to create some educational pages aimed specifically at 
	our students. </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Promotional Events: CD-ROMs and conference</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Promotion of a website also includes outside-of-the-Net 
	events and initiatives. Telecom Italia has financed two of these: the 
	making of 100.000 CD-ROMs with the website for free distribution to museum 
	visitors, and a conference at the Museum to present the website and the 
	Internet lab to the press. This last move was important to get media attention, 
	since many journalists still need a physical event to point their attention 
	to a website.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Martin Mystère: a pure &#34;web&#34; 
	sponsorship</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Martin Mystère is a well-known 
	Italian comic character, who investigates mysteries beyond the limits 
	of official science, such as UFO&#39;s or the Bermuda Triangle. Martin Mystère 
	appeared to be an interesting partner for a web-based operation with the 
	Museum because of its popularity among young people 20 to 30 years old, 
	a category which usually is not interested in our normal Museum activities. 
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="gaia_fig3.jpg" width="400" height="286"/></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><b><i>Fig.3 The Sea Legends website <a href="http://www.bvzm.com/misteri/">http://www.bvzm.com/misteri/</a></i></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Sea legends such as phantoms or 
	ill-fated ships were a good subject for a website with Martin Mystère: 
	theyíre fascinating and pose interesting scientific problems, such as 
	the effective dimensions of sea monsters like giant squids. Moreover, 
	in the Museum we have a huge section of naval history, with a whole 62 
	meter long sailing ship, in front of which it is easy to let yourself 
	dream of the Flying Dutchman. We wrote some texts and then obtained from 
	the editor of two books about sea legends the permission to use images 
	from the books as part of a link-exchange agreement between the two websites. 
	Then we contacted the agency who designed the official site of Martin 
	Mystère proposing this agreement to them: we were to supply the 
	content, they were to create the pages and to ask the owners for the permission 
	to use the image of Martin Mystère. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The problem of who to contact first 
	when proposing a partnership is a difficult one. When you haven&#39;t had 
	any previous contact, you usually have two possibilities: contacting the 
	owner of the website directly, or the web-agency which is creating it. 
	Both solutions have advantages and disadvantages. Contact with the owners 
	is more direct but often difficult to get; contacting the web-agency can 
	have two advantages: getting this link to the owners, and gaining the 
	web-agency as an ally, if they feel you&#39;re offering them a way to make 
	some extra money on the website. On the other hand, if they&#39;re not interested 
	in the project, they can freeze the whole project (we have experienced 
	this).</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">In the Martin Mystère case 
	the contact via the agency worked well and the author gave permission 
	to use his character and to host the pages on Martin Mystère&#39;s 
	official site. This hosting was an important part of the operation, since 
	it allowed us to have a visible presence on a large website. In fact, 
	we are trying to make our website borders less and less defined; opening 
	as many as possible pages with our content and our logo on important websites 
	all around the Net. Our final goal is to transform the Museum website 
	into something spreading like a galaxy, according to the open nature of 
	the Net. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The resulting website is visible 
	at<a href="http://www.bvzm.com/misteri"> <u>http://www.bvzm.com/misteri</u>/</a> 
	it consists of 14 legends and an entire comic which is readable on the 
	net thanks to Flash technology. Certainly it is a small website, but it 
	is a good example of a &#34;light&#34; sponsorship, with a plurality of sponsors 
	and no money exchange involved, since everyone agreed to work for free 
	(even the web-agency), something made possible only by the low cost of 
	web-based operations. The absence of money exchange sped up all the operations 
	considerably, since sponsors are usually more willing to give away services 
	than money.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Apogeo: a &#34;content&#34; sponsor</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Apogeo is the most important publisher 
	of computer books in Italy. It has recently opened a website with news 
	and articles about IT, and is trying to re-define itself from &#34;technical 
	publisher&#34; to a larger &#34;IT culture publisher&#34;. We contacted them in December 
	1999 with a proposal, consisting of three points:</p>
      <b></b> 
      <p align="CENTER"><img src="gaia_fig4.jpg" width="400" height="326"/></p>
      <p align="CENTER"><i><b><span class="caption">Fig.4 The Home page of</span></b></i><span class="caption"><i> 
	<b>Apogeonline <a href="http://www.apogeonline.com/">http://www.apogeonline.com</a></b></i></span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><b><span class="normal">Books</span></b><span class="normal">: 
	Apogeo provided the Internet lab with a small IT library with their books, 
	free copies of &#34;Internet for Dummies&#34; book and T-shirts for students visiting 
	the lab and discounted books to be sold in the Museum bookshop.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><b>Conferences</b>: Apogeo and the 
	Museum were to organise conferences at the Museum on IT subjects with 
	the participation of some of their authors, who are well-known in Italy. 
	</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><b>Website</b>: Apogeo was very 
	interested in starting a co-operation between its online review, <i>Apogeonline</i>, 
	and the Museum website. In this case the interesting fact for us was that 
	Apogeonline could offer not only communication, but content too. Their 
	authors could well create valuable pages about the IT subjects. We proposed 
	to them some pages about the development of the personal and home computers 
	during the Eighties, from the Commodore 64 to the IBM PC. The pages would 
	be hosted on their website with the Museum logo, like in the Martin Mystère 
	website. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">In this case, what emerges once 
	again is the importance of a two-level proposal: to a publisher which 
	has two main fields of action, real and online, we offered two different 
	operational level: the real level, with the Internet lab and the bookshop, 
	and the web-level, with the co-operation between the two websites.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Web Portals: &#34;communication&#34; sponsorships</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Gaining visibility on the Net is 
	one of the most difficult and important things to do for an important 
	website (Streten 1999). In getting new visitors&#39; attention web portals 
	like Yahoo! are very important. In our Museum we had already experienced 
	their importance as audience-raisers. During 1998 and 1999 every time 
	Virgilio (<a href="http://www.virgilio.it/">www.virgilio.it</a>) or Yahoo! 
	Italia (<a href="http://www.yahoo.it/">www.yahoo.it</a>), two of the most 
	important Italian web portals, put our website on their Homepage we saw 
	spectacular peaks in our access counters (Gaia 1999). </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Basing ourselves on this fact, in 
	January 2000 we decided to try a web sponsorship with one of these web 
	portals. The idea was to propose a section on the web portal to which 
	the Museum would have supplied content. Content is what web portals desperately 
	search for, in their effort to overwhelm each other in terms of audience. 
	In Italy there are 7-8 big portals fighting each other in what seems to 
	be a win-or-die situation ñ experts think no more than three generalist 
	web portals will survive. Every portal is backed by a different &#34;real&#34; 
	Italian company (such as the car maker Fiat) or by big international portals 
	such as Lycos and Yahoo!. Each one of this backing companies is pouring 
	tens of millions of dollars in its own portal, hoping that it will become 
	&#34;The&#34; portal. This quite Darwinian scenario seemed suitable 
	to us for trying to get the best visibility we could. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Deciding what web portal would fit 
	most has been a difficult decision. Portals are similar but have slight 
	differences in terms of editorial profile, target, etc. At last we decided 
	to contact the most &#34;cultural&#34; ones, i.e. the most content-oriented 
	and the most high-profiled, thinking that our content would fit better 
	in such a context. As for the content, it had to be suitable for our customer. 
	It had to be:</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <ul>
	<p align="JUSTIFY"> 
	</p><li><span class="normal">of broad interest; web portals are broad-casting 
	  websites</span></li>
	<p></p>
	<p align="JUSTIFY"> 
	</p><li><span class="normal">dividable in many little sections, to publish 
	  with a pre-fixed frequency; web portals are oriented towards continuous 
	  updating to have people returning to their websites. Their communication 
	  model is the brief news more than the long dossier. </span></li>
	<p></p>
	<p align="JUSTIFY"> 
	</p><li><span class="normal">&#34;Light&#34;: in language, in length, in 
	  bytes.</span></li>
	<p></p>
      </ul>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The Leonardo section of our website 
	looked the most suitable; it is composed of more than 100 pages, each 
	one describing a different invention. Our proposal to the web portal would 
	have been to publish every day a different machine: &#34;The Invention 
	of the Day&#34;. A problem arose before we could submit the proposal 
	to the two web portals we identified: the text of the pages was too difficult 
	to understand for the large audience of a web portal, so we had to re-write 
	all the pages, and thatís not an easy thing to do in a always under-manned 
	and under-budgeted institution like a museum. That slowed down the developing 
	of the project, which we hope to have online by summer 2000. In fact, 
	it taught us that sometimes &#34;suitable content is King&#34;. </span></p>
