      <p class="heading"><b>Integrating a Web Component into the Classroom</b></p>
      <p class="author"><b>Donna Gesualdo, New Museum of Contemporary Art, USA</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
<blockquote>
          
        <p class="small">The New Museum of Contemporary Artís <i>Visible Knowledge 
          Program </i>Web site is both dynamic and interactive. Complementing 
          the Education departmentís outreach efforts to high school students, 
          the site provides a forum for educators, artists, students and museum 
          staff to share ideas, engage in dialogue and work towards &#34;real&#34; 
          and Web-based projects in both the physical and online Classrooms. As 
          with any new application of a traditional practice, there is a need 
          for the creators and participants to reevaluate and modify the original 
          vision.</p>
        </blockquote>
      <p class="heading"><b>The New Museum&#39;s Mission</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The mission of the New Museum of Contemporary Art 
        is to advance innovative art and artistic practice as a vital social force 
        through its exhibitions, programs and organizational structure. Primary 
        to the Museumís purpose are education and public outreach, original scholarship, 
        and critical investigation of the museumís role and function.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">One of the unique features of the New Museum is 
        that it holds no permanent collection. As is evident in the mission summary, 
        people are the resources, making the exchange of ideas more dynamic.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Education Department</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">To understand the role of the Education Department 
        within the New Museum, it is important to mention the following projects 
        which it supports and maintains: public programs; internship program, 
        high school and advanced; <i>Contemporary Art and Multicultural Education 
        </i>guide (Routledge, 1996); Security and Admissions program; and the 
        Visible Knowledge Program. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Due to the museum&#39;s philosophy that education should 
        permeate all aspects of its activities, the Education Department collaborates 
        with many of the other departments. One major contribution is interpretation, 
        in both wall text and brochures, which is shared with the Curatorial department, 
        as well as some of the programming and planning of academic events, such 
        as panel discussions. Planning of special events and social activities 
        is done in conjunction with the Marketing and PR department.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Many of the Education departmentís key objectives 
        have been fulfilled by the creation of vkp.org and its incorporation in 
        the already established Visible Knowledge Program. Following are some 
        of the shared goals:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">to reach and support high school educators worldwide 
          and give them a space for sharing their knowledge</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">to provide a forum for the discussion of art 
          education practices and theories</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">to facilitate the use of contemporary art to 
          teach core subjects as well as current social and political issues (i.e., 
          replication of the Visible Knowledge Program)</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">to showcase studentsí work and offer them an 
          opportunity to exchange ideas with their peers electronically</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="heading"><b>Visible Knowledge Program</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The Education department at the New Museum of Contemporary 
        Art has been working with alternative high schools and at-risk students 
        in the New York area since 1984 as part of the Visible Knowledge Program 
        (VKP). Pairing artist-instructors with classroom teachers on a semester 
        or year-long basis, the Education department provides professional development 
        and technological support to VKP participants collaborating on the integration 
        of contemporary art with core high school curricula (Social Studies, English, 
        Science) and the development of online Classrooms and Studios. In liaison 
        with museum staff, the teachers and artist-instructors develop and teach 
        weekly lessons that explore the connections between contemporary art practice 
        and current cultural and social issues introduced in the different subject 
        areas.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Two years ago, the Education department, with the 
        support of the teachers and artists, introduced a third component to the 
        program, an exhibition-related theme. The intent of adding the third factor 
        to the curriculum is to integrate the school program more closely into 
        the museumís programming and vice versa. It is also a wonderful incentive 
        for both the teaching artist and the students to have their work shown 
        alongside &#34;professional&#34; artists in a high profile museum.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In the beginning of the summer, the Education staff 
        meets with VKP participants to choose an upcoming New Museum exhibition 
        that both coincides with the end of the school year and deals with a suitable 
        theme. Though not mandatory, it is strongly recommended that the artist/teacher 
        pair considers and ties in the topic of the show when planning the lessons 
        and the final project. For example, last yearís school collaborations 
        were based on the museumís<i> The Time of Our Lives</i> show, which was 
        about aging and the issues and stereotypes that surround the aging process. 
        The VKP participants were asked to address the aging topic in their classes 
        in an interdisciplinary manner. One clever response to this challenge 
        was from a Chemistry class that designed an installation representing 
        a bone molecule afflicted by osteoporosis. An Environmental Studies class 
        compared the aging body to the aging city and made outlines of their own 
        bodies but filled them in with the characteristics of a city. This year 
        the classes are working with the <i>Picturing the Modern Amazon</i> exhibition, 
        which deals with hypermuscular women and their representation. Those artist/teacher 
        pairs that feel the topics of strong women, gender issues or the story 
        of the mythical Amazon society tie in well with their subject area are 
        incorporating this theme into the VKP curriculum.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>vkp.org</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Launched in March 1999, the Visible Knowledge Program 
        Web site (<a href="http://www.vkp.org/">www.vkp.org</a>) uses cold fusion 
        programming to provide an interactive and continually expanding resource 
        and work space for educators, artists and students. The site complements 
        the practical in-class learning experience by providing a cyber learning 
        environment consisting of four areas ñ Classrooms, Studios, Galleries 
        and a Library. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"> The <b>Gallery</b> area includes VKP online exhibitions, 
	with work by students, artist-instructors and New Museum exhibitions, 
	as well as resource images from the curriculum units. For example, the 
	gallery displays student work from a VKP collaboration that was featured 
	in the Summer 1999 exhibition at the New Museum,<i> </i><a href="http://www.vkp.org/gallery.cfm?kid=3"><i>The 
	Time of Our Lives</i></a>.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In the <b>Classroom</b> area, teachers and artist-instructors 
        in the VKP have established online spaces (cyber-classrooms) where they 
        create projects as part of the regular classroom collaborations. In the 
        Class Showcase, they may post recommended readings, upload their studentsí 
        art and writing projects, post class assignments and upload lesson plans 
        in progress. On their Virtual Bookshelves, they may submit links to other 
        Web sites, which are immediately indexed in the Library. In the Forum 
        section of the Classroom, they may respond to users&#39; comments and communicate 
        with other Classrooms on the site. Both the Classrooms and the Curriculum 
        Units are linked to Forums where visitors and registered users may participate 
        in dialogue and offer feedback on the lesson plans and posted work.<b> 
        </b>Visitors to the site may browse the Classrooms, and interested educators 
        are encouraged to contact the Web administrator to open their own Classrooms 
        on the VKP Web site.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">All students, educators, and artists participating 
        in the VKP may create their own Web-pages in the <b>Studio</b> section 
        of the site. They may post personal statements, cite urls for project-related 
        Web research on a Virtual Bookshelf, participate in Classroom discussion 
        Forums, upload images and hand in assignments. </span></p>
      <p class="normal">All materials available for downloading from the site 
        are accessible through the Library area. Included are curriculum units, 
        arts education related resources and information on the VKP program and 
        collaborating schools. The Library also contains the urls for selected 
        arts and media organizations as well as the Web documents that VKP artists, 
        students, and educators have added to their Virtual Bookshelves. </p>
      <p><span class="normal">When the site was first launched, the Education 
        staff was so eager for Web activity that there was a &#34;hands-off&#34; approach 
        as to how the site should be used to enhance the program. Participants&#39; 
        contributions were allowed to organically develop, irrelevant of &#34;quality.&#34; 
        After the first semester of use (Spring &#39;99), it was clear that standards 
        and requirements had to be prescribed. Teachers and artists felt neither 
        obligated nor compelled to use the site in the classroom and those who 
        did, developed no criteria as to what was uploaded or for how studentsí 
        online work was to be evaluated.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">During that summer, the department worked on a set 
        of guidelines for use of the Classroom and Studio areas and suggestions 
        for an appropriate way to integrate the site into the school curriculum. 
        It was also determined that as the site grows, editing decisions will 
        need to be made. Because the database is constantly expanding, it is up 
        to the administrator to archive many of the older Classrooms and Studios 
        or delete irrelevant documents, so as not to overwhelm viewers or the 
        server. How does the site administrator choose what remains and what is 
        removed? At the moment, editing decisions are left to the discretion of 
        the administrator and the rest of the Education staff; there may be a 
        need in the future, however, to implement an official set of criteria 
        for objectivity and consistency.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Obstacles to success</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The site is still in its first full academic year 
        and the activity online consists only of the teachers, artists and students 
        from the schools with which the museum has established collaborative programs. 
        Despite the requisite of mandatory Web participation, the use of the site 
        among VKP participants has been sporadic. The challenge the department 
        has faced during this past year, and is still facing, is how to fully 
        incorporate the site into the classroom learning process and curriculum 
        and then how to organically extend it to accommodate the needs and accentuate 
        the talents of each unique group of students. In this section, I will 
        outline the difficulties encountered in trying to incorporate a Web-based 
        program into the &#34;real&#34; classroom.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">To begin, teachers and artists who had little to 
        no experience with technology were somewhat resistant to the new Web component. 
        In addition to technophobia, most of the teachers claimed to already be 
        overburdened by Board of Education requirements and New York State Standards. 
        Consequently, they geared their curricula and focused much of their class 
        time on improving Regents scores and there wasnít much time left for what 
        was perceived as &#34;extra&#34; work. Many of the teachers have not 
        been getting support from school administration, either financially or 
        otherwise; the principal is sometimes unaware of VKPís presence in the 
        school. They donít get paid by the schools to come to extra meetings and 
        professional development workshops and therefore do not make the time 
        or effort to attend them. Due to chronic absenteeism, professional development 
        workshops were cancelled this year.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">On top of the teachersí issues, the transient student 
        population in the alternative school system makes it very difficult for 
        any consistency in a long-term project. The artist-instructors get frustrated, 
        as the students in the class often change from one week to the next. The 
        collaborating schools are usually selected for their flexibility in scheduling; 
        longer class periods are better suited for the VKP. However, some schools 
        change their schedules mid-year or mid-term and a VKP class might decrease 
        from double periods equaling an hour and a half to a class of only forty-five 
        minutes.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">One of the major obstacles to the vkp.org component 
        is the poor and outdated technology in the schools. Often, the schools 
        have computer equipment but are not online or have older versions of browsers 
        and prohibitively slow systems. In some schools, the server crashes constantly, 
        which is extremely frustrating to the students and administrator. There 
        have even been incidents of vandalism in the schools, in which the computers 
        have been disabled. Due to the interactive nature of the site, the Board 
        of Educationís restrictions on student email accounts limits one of the 
        most outstanding features of the site. In one participating school, all 
        the computers in the lab share the same IP address and therefore make 
        it impossible for more than one student to be logged onto the site at 
        a time. It also eliminates the possibility of group chats online. As if 
        these impediments werenít enough of a deterrent, the schools are rarely 
        provided with a technology support staff; so there is no help for the 
        students or teachers within the school.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Finally, neither the Visible Knowledge Program nor 
        vkp.org receive very much support in terms of funding from the museum 
        for new development or maintenance. The site is particularly ambitious 
        and needs money to maintain its position on the &#34;edge&#34;, but 
        these educational components are, unfortunately, not a priority for the 
        institution and, consequently, get a very small percent of the monies 
        they are granted.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Increasing online activity</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The measures taken to generate more interest in 
        and activity on the site have been great but, by no means, exhausted. 
        The site administrator continually looks for new search engines and directories 
        to which to add the url. There is also a long list of online journals 
        and people in the technology or art education fields to whom press releases 
        and emails have been sent; this should be done continually.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Besides electronic promotion, it is important for 
        the Web administrator to make frequent visits to the schools and offer 
        technical support for the sites. Making &#34;school calls&#34; certainly 
        pays off by keeping the confusion and frustration levels of participants 
        down. If users feel there is someone they can call anytime and who will 
        provide them with a prompt response, they will be much more likely to 
        try new things and feel comfortable about it. When it is not feasible 
        to go out to the schools, frequent emails and phone calls will maintain 
        the nurturing relationship established with the participants. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">As mentioned, the overall activity on the site has 
        been poor, but the biggest problem area is the bulletin boards or Forums. 
        After an initial lack of valuable responses in this section of the site, 
        the department decided to create a structure that facilitated more regular 
        and evocative discussion in the Forums. In response to this need, time 
        was planned into the professional development meetings for teachers, artists 
        and museum staff to engage in Forum discussions online and respond to 
        comments and questions from browsers and other participants. As the year 
        continued, though, professional development was eliminated, which made 
        it nearly impossible to engage all the participants in a simultaneous 
        dialogue. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In addition to training and supporting the adults, 
        the site administrator also goes into the schools to do a training session 
        with the students on how to open and maintain their individual Studios. 
        If the school is not online, the students are encouraged to go to the 
        museum, where the administrator can work with them on the computers in 
        the education seminar room. It was also our hope that time would be allotted 
        during the class period for students in one classroom to respond to feedback 
        from students in another, so that there was continual communication among 
        the youths. This happened to a much lesser degree than planned. Due to 
        the above noted technology issues, it was impossible to get the whole 
        class online together. So, we turned to a resource that we could rely 
        upon, our high school interns. High school interns are appointed from 
        all the collaborating schools and act as liaisons between the museum and 
        the &#34;real&#34; classroom. They are also trained on the Web site so they may 
        offer technical support to their class when the administrator is unavailable 
        to make school visits. Because there is an interested core of adolescents 
        dedicated to the mission of the Education department, we appeal to them 
        to make postings to the Forums, both in response to their work at the 
        museum and in response to their fellow students work online.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Another helpful practice is running and analyzing 
        Web statistics. Tracking such data as user sessions, unique user number 
        and average length of time spent on the site or various pages, helps to 
        determine what areas of the site are being used the most, which pages 
        need to be revised and what periods are the busiest. A quarterly report 
        is generated by the Web administrator to monitor the activity on the site. 
        So far, we&#39;ve been able to assess that the activity on the site jumped 
        dramatically from the end of summer to September and then decreased a 
        bit again in October, which coincides with the beginning of the school 
        year when many educators are researching and preparing for the semester 
        ahead. </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Suggestions for smooth integration and sustainability</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Sustained participation in a collaboration, both 
        online and in the classroom, begins with the motivation of its members. 
        The following is a list of questions that were used to initiate discussion 
        among participants:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">What ways can you incorporate and be open to 
          team-teaching practices?</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">How will you share authority in the classroom 
          and present the team-teaching paradigm to students?</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">How will you leave room in the curriculum/lesson 
          plans for a 50% contribution by the artist?</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">How will you work the artist visit into the rest 
          of the weekís plans (pre-visit and post-visit transitions)?</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">How will you prepare/assist the artist with bureaucratic 
          procedures of the school and internal administrative policies (e.g., 
          release forms, class trips, procuring of a/v equipment,Ö)?</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">How much of the class grade will reflect VKP-related 
          work (and evaluation method)?</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">How will vkp.org be implemented into the program 
          and the Web-based components evaluated?</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">In addition to discussion, frequent visits to the 
        sites and continual contact with participants via email and in one on 
        one meetings encourages open communication and keeps museum staff aware 
        of potential conflicts.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Most important to the success of a program is that 
        the classroom teacher be convinced it will enhance the class, that there 
        will be benefits to the students and that it will incorporate state requirements. 
        They need to know that the program will not be adding work to their hectic 
        schedule and detracting from what they need to cover in class. Also, the 
        teachers will feel more confident trying something new and different if 
        they have the support of the principal. It is sometimes difficult to maintain 
        contact with the school administrator after the initial discussion of 
        the program. New Museum staff have to be quite persistent in this area; 
        they have even been known to &#34;stalk&#34; principals at their schools 
        in order to utilize those few moments between classes. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Regarding the integration of the Web component, 
        both artists and teachers are required to attend a training session with 
        the site administrator before the start of the school year. During this 
        session, they learn how to use the site and access and maintain the areas 
        for which they are responsible: Classrooms and Studios. The museum has 
        no binding contracts with the teachers, so it is left to the participating 
        schools&#39; to reimburse their teachers for time spent in professional development 
        and training workshops. Because this is rare, many teachers do not make 
        it to the sessions. In these cases, the Web administrator offers to go 
        out to the school and work with the teacher on site to make accommodate 
        them as much as possible. As for the artists with whom the museum does 
        have contracts, there are very specific requirements that must be met 
        as outlined in their agreements, like the monthly submission of lesson 
        plans and updating of online Classrooms.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">It is imperative to create firm and concrete guidelines 
        and standards for participants so they know what to expect and what is 
        expected of them, as far as their role in the integration of the Web component. 
        There are no perfect and universal solutions for effectively using a Web 
        component in the classroom so that it meets the needs of both the teacher 
        and the students, but following is an example of guidelines we presented 
        at the first professional development workshop in August:</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Web Site Guidelines</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>For those with Internet access at school:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <b> </b> 
        <li><span class="normal">a two hour training session should be scheduled 
          with the Web administrator by<b> September 3</b></span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">students need to be trained on use of site by 
          <b>September 30</b></span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">release forms for Web materials must be signed 
          by all participants by <b>September 30</b></span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">each collaboration pair is required to open a 
          classroom online by <b>October 1</b></span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">artists are required to open a studio by <b>October 
          1</b></span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">initial images and text (for classroom showcase) 
          and bookshelf items must be uploaded by <b>October 15</b> (by teacher 
          or artist)</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">classroom must be updated at least once a month 
          with new images and text</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">all students should open a studio by <b>October 
          15</b> and update it at least once a month with new text (and possibly 
          new images)</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">teachers, artists and students are encouraged 
          to participate in online Forums </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">all lesson plans and resources must be submitted 
          at the end of each month to the Curator of Education (to later be included 
          on VKP site)</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">A similar list was created for those schools without 
        Internet access. By setting concrete dates and objectives, it is easier 
        for the participants to be held accountable for their part of the collaboration. 
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Beyond technology training, the use of the Web site 
        and its integration into the Visible Knowledge Program<i> </i>has been 
        addressed at professional development meetings. Though these have been 
        cancelled this year, time will have to be scheduled at the beginning of 
        the school year to discuss ways of including the site into the curricula 
        and ideas for new media and Web-based projects. Of course, as with any 
        addition to a class lesson, standards and measures of evaluation must 
        be considered and employed to assess the technology-based work. Teachers 
        need to decide, with the help of artists and staff, how much of the class 
        grade the technology and art aspects constitute and how much class time 
        is devoted to these components.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">As always, critical, constructive and continual 
        feedback is needed for the progress of any endeavor, new or well-established. 
        It has been difficult getting people to respond to our online survey. 
        It is embedded deep in the Curriculum area and has, consequently, been 
        overlooked by many visitors to the site. The inappropriateness of its 
        placement has been recognized and it will be changed to a more prominent 
        location on the site. However, we have received encouraging feedback, 
        such as that from Ellen Kirshbaum, Director of Arts Education for Alternative 
        High Schools on the New York City Board of Education:</span></p>
   <blockquote>
        <p class="normal">Expanding the New Museumís VKP program online is an 
	  exciting development that will provide teachers and students everywhere 
	  with immediate and direct access to the resources they need to integrate 
	  visual literacy into all disciplines. <u><a href="http://www.vkp.org/">www.vkp.org</a></u> 
	  gives teachers and students the tools to incorporate visual art into 
	  their core curriculum, mold the program to suit their individual needs, 
	  and make a difference in their own classrooms. The New Museum has always 
	  been on the cutting edge in its willingness to create meaningful collaborations 
	  with alternative superintendency. This is one more step into the future.</p>
   </blockquote>
      <p class="heading"><b>Conclusion </b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The long-term objective of the museum is to have 
        an international network of educators using the site as a work space and 
        sounding board for current museum and art education practices. The New 
        Museum aims to promote replication of the Visible Knowledge Program, either 
        in its existing form or in modified versions appropriate to particular 
        learning institutions. With classroom teachers and museum educators worldwide 
        participating in this dialogue, schools without art programs and museums 
        with few educational resources will benefit from the fruits of the VKPís 
        collaborative efforts. To that end, the site strongly encourages feedback 
        about the program, lesson plans and pedagogical philosophy of the Education 
        department, as well as undergoing a rigorous evaluation process. The education 
        staff acknowledges that the continued success of the Web site depends 
        on dedicated participation by all members of the program and its benefit 
        to the students. After a full academic year with the Web site functioning 
        and integrated into the VKP, the staff will now begin to assess its effectiveness 
        and future potential, and address the question: How does one assess the 
        value of a Web component to participants? This sounds like a good topic 
        for next yearís conference.</span></p>
