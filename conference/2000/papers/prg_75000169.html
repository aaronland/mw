      <p class="heading"><b>Thinking: Aesthetics, Architecture and Ambience</b></p>
      <p class="author"><b>Donald Goodes, National Filmboard of Canada, Canada</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote> <b> </b> 
        <p class="small">This talk strays as far as possible from e-commerce to 
          raise a more heady and creative discussion around hypermedia design. 
          Here is a series of notes on the foundations of Goodesí proven design 
          methodologyóa methodology which he qualifies as &#34;cultural&#34; 
          rather than &#34;commercial&#34; in its conception. Informed by ten 
          years of critical writing on contemporary art, Goodesí approach to design 
          is decidedly conceptual and heavy on the analysis of information and 
          visual language, while always keeping in sight seduction and beauty. 
          The three &#34;A&#34;s of virtual exhibition and Web site design, 
          Aesthetics, Architecture and Ambience, are evoked more than explained. 
          They are the raw materials with which meaning is created in hypermedia.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="heading"><b>Ego</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Here is the point that I have arrived at in my thinking 
	about hypermedia design.<b> </b>Putting down these notes on my process 
	gives me a chance to stop and think about a process that developed in 
	the heat and confusion of endless deadlines. Two themes surface, one is, 
	&#34;what makes cultural Web design different than commercial/corporate 
	design?&#34; the other is, &#34;Is design ultimately a means for create 
	meanings? Cuzí itís not just pretty pictures&#34;</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">You will note the absence of a linear argument and 
        stated conclusions. Instead, here are a collection of ideas which, taken 
        together, reveal something of my vision of hypermedia design. Like a good 
        Web site, the effect is accumulative; it is all put together in the mind, 
        requiring intuition as much as reason.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Not surprisingly, perhaps, forfeiting the imperative 
        to convince you of anything, saying &#34;screw it&#34; to all those 
        things I learned about writing essays, permits breadth of though; many 
        traps that limit thinking are narrowly avoided.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Web design has taught me many lessons, one of the 
        most significant is to consider all as process. A process has steps that 
        one must pass through in order to arrive at that which one imagines to 
        be the desired state (your ideals). In other words, the ideal of arriving 
        at perfection in one leap of genius may not only result in burnout, but 
        limits your future to the present. Process. Process. Process is the answer.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>The three &#34;A&#34;s</b></p>
      <p class="normal">Architecture, Aesthetics and Ambience are the Web designerís 
        stock and trade. I am unable to describe how much importance I accord 
        to these three guides.</p>
      <p class="normal">We design the intelligent and stimulating flow of information 
        through solid architecture, creative navigation and appropriate design. 
        We work the aesthetics of screen layouts, formal composition, color, light, 
        space, fonts, all the visual elements for their evocative potential as 
        well as their inherent symbolism to create an ambience for the information 
        embedded in the architecture. We create context for content. Then we set 
        the contexts in relation to one another. We design transitions that move 
        us from one screen to the next. We deploy content in time and space. Everything 
        we do falls into the realm of meaning. Our work is to create a meaningful 
        experience in the navigation window.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>The Whole</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">At several moments, when building a hypermedia application, 
        such as a Web site or virtual exhibition, you are called upon to imagine 
        the whole.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">It is impossible to do this imagining in one step.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">There is too much to imagine: like, what is the 
        content to be presented, how will this content be organized, how will 
        it be given form, how will all the nodes of information relate to one 
        another within a conceptual architecture, how will they relate in a navigation 
        architecture, how will the nodes be laid out differently to make them 
        interesting?</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Here are some imaginings at different stages:</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Contentís identified. IMAGINE what you could 
          give to users.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Objectives are set. IMAGINE loosely what the 
          site might be.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Audience identified. IMAGINE how the site might 
          entice users.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Visions of editorial and artistic directors are 
          aligned. IMAGINE how content will be deployed.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Metaphors are considered. IMAGINE how everything 
          will hold together conceptually.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Architectureís mapped. IMAGINE all the parts 
          in their place.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Technical specs and design principals are written. 
          IMAGINE the technologies that are going to be deployed.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Paper scripts are written. IMAGINE all the words 
          and paragraphs and pages.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Storyboards are drawn. IMAGINE what all the pages 
          will look like.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Graphics are produced. IMAGINE even more what 
          the pages will look like.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Pages coded. Sound and films integrated. IMAGINE 
          how you could have done it better.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">Everyone must articulate their imaginings as things 
        progress, and carry out their work rigorously, for all builds and evolves 
        from what came before.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Our Methodology</b></p>
      <p class="normal">When I work on a Web project, I come with a methodology--a 
        series of steps for designing hypermedia applications.</p>
      <p class="normal">I never studied hypermedia design. But, cognitive lessons 
        learned from ten years of critical writing on contemporary visual art 
        came in handy. And, I learned a lot just by working with others. We never 
        stopped to talk about the process we just did it. We were in the field, 
        making sites, working with stimulating and knowledgeable collaborators. 
        I am thinking here especially of my partner Anne Marie Léger, and 
        the folks with whom I worked on <i>Haida Spirits of the Sea</i>: Keith 
        Paddington, Ingrid Hein and Bruno Schmidt of Slant Productions, exhibition 
        curators Nathalie McFarland and Lucille Bell, and project coordinator 
        Jennifer Baird.</p>
      <p><span class="normal">I always thought of our working method as being 
        rather artisan like, hand made, if you will--which, by the way, I think 
        was a good thing.</span></p>
      <p> 
      </p><ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Establish objectives</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Decide on the breadth of the content</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Evolve solid site architecture</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Work with curators to edit scripts; make them 
          suitable for the Web</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Create flow charts</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Establish design principals, metaphors and navigation</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Create storyboards</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Present storyboards for feedback</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Work feedback into storyboards</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Create beta versions and final versions of the 
          application</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">The End.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><b>Thought</b></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">My advice. In the process of Web design be as abstract 
        as possible.</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Internet navigation is abstract and demands abstract 
          thinking.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Interpretation of content is abstract and demands 
          abstract thinking.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Show respect these things with abstract thought.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Consider the content you wish to put on line 
          from every conceptual angle you can get your mind on. </span></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">This is not an invitation to ignore your content.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Donít loose touch with the content. This would 
          be a disaster.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Abstract thinking is anchored in the content.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">But, let yourself take tangents.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Itís a dance.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">You move back and forth.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Go out far.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Then come back in to the core.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Think using the structures of the Internet. Think 
          abstractly and conceptually.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Be generous with your mind and use your intuition.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="heading"><b>Know this</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Recently, came across theoretical writings on hypermedia 
        design methodology. I am indebted to my colleague, Rabah Djanati for introducing 
        me to this stimulating body of thought: Relationship Management Methodology 
        (RMM) and Scenario-Based Object-Oriented Methodology for Developing Hypermedia 
        Information Systems.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">I donít pretend to yet fully understand these, so 
        I wonít attempt to explain them. I flag them to designers who wish to 
        incorporate into their work more complex visioning tools and a more refined 
        process. Also, you will find that they aid in better understanding of 
        how back end concerns (i.e. server and database) and front end concerns 
        (i.e. look and feel, design metaphors, navigation and page design, and 
        media integration) can become part of the same integrated process.</span></p>

      <p><span class="normal">Mistake (1)</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The first error that I notice happening all the 
        time: the content people, curators, experts or chief editors have their 
        whole script written and revised within an inch of its life without having 
        given a thought to the fact that they werenít writing a book but a hypermedia 
        application.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Solution (1)</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">As soon as content is identified, begin the discussion 
        about how it might best be written up and organized to make it happen 
        on the Web. Consider preliminary navigation options right away. This is 
        the first step in imagining your site. Donít blow it.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Error (2)</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Mistake (2)</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This is the second error I notice happening all 
        the time: print publications are used as models, not a metaphors, but 
        models for web sites. Encyclopedias, or worse magazines abound on the 
        web.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Web design can mine these print models for metaphors, 
        which can be mixed up with other metaphors in interesting ways to make 
        a hypermedia application. But it serves no one to faithfully replicate 
        these forms on the Web. </span></p>
      <p class="heading">Solution</p>
      <p><span class="normal">At risk of being obvious, realize that the Web does 
        not benefit from the same physicality of a print publication--that is, 
        no pages to be held and turned in oneís hands. Thus, it canít be structured 
        in the same way. Well it can, but thatís obviously a huge loss. Model 
        your hypermedia application using the complexities of hypermedia.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Revel in the fact that the Web isnít subject to 
        the same power abuses that perpetuate the restricting conventions so present 
        in print publication. Donít cater to transposed conventions. They donít 
        even exist. Just go crazy.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Architecture</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Donít ever loose your users unless itís intentional. 
        Chaos is a good thing, when it is intentional.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Donít frustrate users. Be consistent where you need 
        to be consistent. People come to your site to have an experience and/or 
        to find something they want. Donít let bad information design get in their 
        way, unless you want it to.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Rosenfeld &amp; Morville in their 1998 textbook 
        <i>Information Architecture for the World Wide Web</i> (p.11-13) define 
        the job of the information architect as including:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">clarification of the mission and vision of the 
          site</span></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">determining what content and functionality the 
          site will contain</span></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">defining systems of organization, navigation, 
          and labeling, and ways of searching the site--in other words, establish 
          how users will find information and at the limit interpret it</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">deciding how change and growth will be accommodated 
          over time</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">Structure architecture rigorously. It is the syntax 
        of your site.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The machineís limits are boundless; computers and 
        networks can take in and give out enormous quantities of information. 
        The stop is in the human organism and its social orders. Flesh and bone 
        and human consciousness can only offer so much concentration, there are 
        cognitive limits. Respect these things.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Once the syntax is under control, however, once 
        the architecture is solid, then the human organism can take in more. Meaningful 
        statements can be uttered. Variety is welcome and understood. Tangents 
        and random events can surprise, delight, stimulate and seduce. All fits 
        into a larger plan, the siteís architecture.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Celebrate architecture design, sweat over it, get 
        into it and use it to the maximum to create potentially meaningful experiences.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Designing Relationships</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Another way to see architecture is as relationships. 
        Envisioning and articulating relationships between the different components 
        of a Web site is one of the most challenging tasks confronting those creating 
        hypermedia applications.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Here is the task then:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">articulatE the nature of the different components 
        of the application (texts, images, media, applications, navigation, design 
        elements, etc.). Define their character as best you can, in abstract and 
        concrete terms.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">ANALYSE the optimum articulation of these components, 
        how they might best be put in relation to one another</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">CREATE the content and build architecture so they 
        articulate the relationships between nodes of information.</span></p>
      <p class="normal">With simple Web sites, designing relationships can come 
        almost without thinking. For a complex cultural sites it is a different 
        story. A clear vision of the ensemble, how the different parts will exist 
        in relation to one another is imperative.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Vision</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Web design can do without a lot, money, great technical 
        knowledge and good compression, but it cannot do without vision. Design 
        Vision, Editorial Vision, and Technical Vision. I donít know why I have 
        to say this, but I do. I have seen projects floundering so often without 
        one. Without a vision intelligent decision making cannot begin.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">What ever it is in this great soup of human uttering 
        throughout time that you want to put on-line, look deep and figure out 
        WHY!?!?! Your Web site presents your knowledge and passions. It is what 
        you want to give away. Write your vision.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Design Shine</b></p>
      <p class="normal">Web design is an articulate response to the siteís content. 
        The goal is to create a context (architecture, aesthetic, and ambience) 
        in which the content SHINES. When making design decisions, you must always 
        consult with the content. It all has to make sense.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>What is a Design Metaphor?</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The METAPHOR is a guiding image used to put together 
        content in a Web site. It is a reference point, like the Vision, for making 
        coherent decisions concerning a siteís aesthetics, its architecture, its 
        navigation and ultimately its content, as well as for establishing relationships 
        between different parts of a site.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The metaphor can be a concrete image or it can be 
        very abstract. The Web itself has developed a pervasive self-referential 
        abstract metaphor that might be called the &#34;Corporate Web Site Metaphor&#34;: 
        top and side navigation, the integral basics of what HTML has to offer. 
        This metaphor adapts so well to presenting commercial content. As for 
        cultural sites, avoid it. It belongs to a world with which we do not share 
        values and objectives.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Here is an example of an abstract metaphor that 
        I developed for a Web site on Canadian History for the NFB where I work. 
        It is a site which plans to be very large, developed over a four year 
        period. </span></p>
      <dir> 
        <p><span class="normal">I would ask you to think very abstractly here. 
          The objective not being to recreate the metaphor literally, but rather 
          to use it as a structure for articulating a complex emotive/intellectual 
          experience in time and cyber space.</span></p>
        <p><span class="normal">Okay, pretend you are on a trip, a voyage, maybe 
          to a different country or to a town near where you live. Imagine doing 
          a bunch of things on your trip. Be inclusive in the type of experiences 
          you imagine: some are exciting, others slow you down and are contemplative, 
          and others you find just dull and you move on quickly. Some experiences 
          are didactic, some are artistic, others are entertaining, and some are 
          even functional. At times you wander aimlessly, following your whims, 
          other times you are lead along a predetermined itinerary. What makes 
          a &#34;good&#34; trip is the ensemble of these experiences.</span></p>
        <p><span class="normal">So, here might be one scenario: You will have 
          walked through the back alleys from the bus depot to get to a multiplex 
          movie theatre, you talk to the stranger sitting beside you before the 
          film begins, the film is not to your liking so you change cinemas and 
          find one you do like. After the show, you walk towards the edge of town, 
          to a park and sit in the moonlight by the water, whereupon you discover 
          the ruins of an old factory site that you explore. Graffiti artists 
          have painted the walls with impressive murals. You take pictures then 
          return to your hotel to send an email home about your trip. </span></p>
        <p><span class="normal">I reiterate that the Look and Feel Metaphor has 
          no aspirations towards representing space and time in a Cartesian, one-point-perspective 
          way. Itís not intended as a recreation of a world. The goal is to mine 
          the image of life experience on a voyage <u>for its evocative potential</u> 
          and NOT as a 3-D representation. The L&amp;F Metaphor dictates that 
          when moving from one section to another in the hypermedia application, 
          there is a different feel, a different atmosphere, a different drama, 
          a different sense of possibilities.</span></p>
        <p><span class="normal">Ultimately, the look-and-feel metaphor proposes 
          a conceptual parallel between life experience and the very notion of 
          history (events/people/places/signification in time/context past) as 
          well as the process of acquiring historic knowledge.</span></p>
        <p><span class="normal">Because the metaphor is abstract, it remains adaptable, 
          permitting very different content to be articulated within it. Itís 
          a metaphor which encourages/permits sensitivity to the visual and text 
          content of the site. Yet, at the same time, it is able to let the Web 
          design pursue tangents to create strong juxtapositions with the text 
          and visual content.</span></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><span class="normal">Donít be a slave to the dictates of the siteís 
          design metaphor, but rather use it to articulate decisions around. For 
          example, the metaphor can be contradicted in a specific place if this 
          contributes to the optimum articulation of the siteís content. Once 
          a main metaphor is clearly established, secondary metaphors can comfortably 
          be introduced into a web site.</span></p>
        <p><span class="normal">Please note that one metaphor is not considered 
          BETTER than another but one is probably more APPROPRIATE than is another.</span></p>

      <p class="heading"><b>Dream Team</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Now, if I had the choice between, a Web designer 
        who has done graphic design or done HTML</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">for sites numbers 1 to 373 of the corporate variety, 
        AND one who reads contemporary fictionthe selection is a snap decision.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">For cultural web sites, hire generalists.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Everyone should display cultural interests and knowledge.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Designers must possess talent and technical knowledge 
        (the more HTML they know the betterÖthey donít have to write Pearl scripts 
        or other programs, but have to know that they exist and that they can 
        be manipulated).</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Give Web designers who have talent and drive a stimulating 
        environment, and full team support, and they will create to the edges 
        of their technical knowledge and artistic abilities. Designing at the 
        edge of technical and aesthetic limits is what cultural Web designers 
        must be qualified to do.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">For cultural web sites, hire generalists.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Commercial Web design favors specialists, because 
        their design process is generally based on a production line. Graphic 
        designers create graphics, which are cut up and put in HTML tables by 
        coders. Methodology isnít important, production is.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Web Designer 1 has design talent, heís got a good 
        eye. He wants to write science fiction, and likes alternative music. Heís 
        able to quickly learn technical things he doesnít know . He has a sense 
        of irony and social criticism. His personal Web site has a lot of smart 
        and cool ideas. His code is solid.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Web Designer 2 has design talent, she is an artist, 
        with a sensibility with respect to textures. Sheís a computer graphic 
        designer for web sites, who can always come up with interesting solutions. 
        She is the Photoshop queen. She has confidence, can problem solve and 
        can concentrate. She doesnít hand code, but knows HTML.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Web Designer 3 has design talent, he is a graphic 
        artist, really, just out of school. His personal projects show that he 
        is hip to new breakthroughs in technologies and visual design. Heís ambitious 
        in his work. His portfolio shows that he is able to do problem solve. 
        He has energy.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">HTML coder 1 went to university in literary studies 
        before taking a variety of courses in programming. She has a solid theoretical 
        understanding of W3 HTML standards. She doesnít have design talent, but 
        values good design and likes a challenge. She has great research skills.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Programmer 1 knows his languages, Pearl, Java, etc, 
        etcÖ He has incredible research skills. He understands the beauty of code, 
        its aesthetics and thus is able to use it creatively. He is generous with 
        his knowledge. He likes problem solving and will go at it until he finds 
        a solution.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The foundations of my production dream team.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Resize Challenge</b></p>
      <p class="normal">I always try to design with people who believe that designs 
        must be resizableÖthey will look good at 800x600 and wonít be stuck in 
        the corner at 1024x768. Scalability is a challenge, but a nice one.</p>
      <p class="normal">The trend is away from resizable designs. The present 
        standard is to create fixed-size graphics, cut them into little pieces 
        and throwing the totality in a table. For the sake of integrated process 
        and true design, cultural Web sites should attempt to buck this trend 
        and become involved in higher level design.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Analysis</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">One of the foundations of design work is the constant 
        articulation of design decisions within the team--the analysis of ones 
        own and others work.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">When you come together with your team (or your sounding 
        board), everyone is called upon to articulate their analysis of design 
        materials. As the process advances, more and more ideas are brought into 
        the analysis. They can be concrete design ideas, color, light, layout, 
        they can be the editorial and artistic Visions, or audience profiles. 
        There are all kinds of things that can be used as points of reference 
        for the design. Points of reference are established and decisions are 
        made. As much as possible, visual ideas should be put on the screen, concepts 
        and principals put on paper .</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">At its worst, design analysis sessions can overwhelm, 
        degrading into a random expression of subjective reactions. &#34;I like 
        that color!&#34; &#34;No, I like this background.&#34; To avoid this, 
        always work backwards, asking, &#34;Why do you like it?&#34;--does the 
        response support the design objectives established previously? Does it 
        establish a new design principal for the site? How does it relate to the 
        siteís visions and its metaphors.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In other words, all analysis builds on previous 
        analysis.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Time/Alone</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">When designing you need time alone to concentrate, 
        because there are usually so many things to keep in mind at once. And 
        there are so many decisions to be made.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Work alone and in groups, in doses.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Design takes time. Anticipate this. Itís a creative 
        process. A journey of trial and error.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In any Web site, there is much to assimilate, and 
        this takes time. Donít be surprised.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">If you want good design, cut your Designers slack, 
        give them the time to assimilate, and then to develop sound navigational 
        design and compelling visuals.</span></p>

        that is, drawing up what the pages will look like. For me this is the 
        most significant imagining stage for the designers. I seek a tool that 
        will permit us to work and evolve page layout and navigation design in 
        an instantaneous and fluid visual display. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Corel Xara is my tool of preference (in conjunction

      <p><span class="normal">This little known vector tool is the most fluid

      <p class="heading"><b>Imitation over Innovation</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">It always takes me aback, when I hear the word &#34;Modern&#34;, 
        while sitting around a boardroom table, looking at designs or talking 
        about a Web site to be. &#34;We want something different, something that 
        will stand out, something Modern,&#34; a director might say.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The &#34;quest for the new&#34; ultimately is 
        a confused driving impulse for contemporary creators and contemporary 
        designers. It puts you in the wrong headspace. Why? Because, we just lived 
        through more than a hundred years of constant claims of innovation. New 
        doesnít really mean New anymore. There are multitudes of modern currents, 
        many of which possess a long and venerable history. Itís best to consider 
        oneself in this lineage rather than being somehow magically above it.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">After hearing a talk by art historian Mark Cheetham, 
        I am more inspired with an idea that lost credibility with the rise of 
        Modernism, IMITATION. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Imitation is not copying. The later is what it says 
        it is, a copy of a single work.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Imitation, on the other hand, is a tool for creative 
        problem solving. When we surf the Web, we get ideas, seeing things we 
        like and donít likeÖ A designer absorbs the essence of this body of work, 
        not a particular work. You assimilate other peoplesí design sensibilities 
        and you make them your own. In this way you achieve new levels of creative 
        potential. Seek to synthesize and create. Donít bother seeking to create 
        something new.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Controlling</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Control is an issue that keeps coming up when you 
        are making hypermedia applications, especially with cultural institutions. 
        Actually, control is often only implied. Itís behind false-ringing but 
        familiar expressions like, &#34;We want to give users choices.&#34; 
        or &#34;This is an interactive site, where users make their own decisions 
        on the outcome&#34; All of us like the idea of relinquishing control 
        to the user; it seems soÖcontemporary! But letís be honest about two things.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">1. Political Control</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The PRIMARY objective of a cultural Web site, especially 
        an institutional one, is seldom to push the idea of giving users choices. 
        The true intention is more often to present a body of information that 
        someone has identified as significant. Putting it online is a kind of 
        proof of this importance. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">As for choices, the choice given, for example, is 
        which masterpiece from the collection you can see.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">So, most producers or institutions are not willing 
        to REALLY loosen up control of their content. They donít want to radically 
        offer maximum freedom of exploration for their users--e.g. showing the 
        worst shit in their collection if users want to see it. My God! What would 
        that do to the reputation of the institution.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">2. Design Control</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Control is what Web designers do. It is of a 
          different order.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">We control the experience.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">We make decisions on what the experience will 
          be.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">We give choices that make sense together, that 
          are pleasant, that are intriguing, that are stimulating, that might 
          mean something to the user.</span></li>

      <p><span class="normal">Often Designersí Control issues are in conflict 
        with Political Control issues. Designers GOOD, institutions BAD. :-)</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Movement Forward</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">How do I keep the design work moving forward in 
        an environment that attempts to maximize creative potential, is based 
        on analysis, seeks to be abstract?</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Deadlines. Yes, that helps.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Also, change the focus regularly. When you get bogged 
        down on one aspect of the site, whether it be navigation design, information 
        architecture or page composition, shift your focus to another level of 
        navigation design, a new page composition, go surfing the Web and comeback 
        a fresh or add a new element.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Keep putting things down, things that are only imagined 
        in your head, put them on the screen.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Try things that you donít think are possible.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">This helps in keeping moving forward.</span></p>
      <p class="normal"><b>Ethical Implications</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Cultural institutions, and cultural producers, because 
        of the present ebb and flow of social forces find themselves confronted 
        my the ethical obligation to explore mental models, to be creative when 
        producing hypermedia applications, to think and act using cultural models.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Why? Because, since the 1980ís, the push to adopt 
        a corporate model has been absorbed by museums, cultural periodicals and 
        publishers, arts councils, and other cultural institution. The language 
        and values of business are integrated even into the consciousness of artists 
        and academics themselves. This change is made.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The Web medium, as much as any other, is fueled 
        by corporate and commercial interests. It is a frenzy, as governments 
        try to secure the future of e-commerce to ensure that their perceived 
        hopes of perpetuating economic growth and privilege in the first world. 
        The pressures are great to step into place in the global economy. It is 
        undeniable, then, that the pressures to think corporate are felt right 
        down to the act of modeling a virtual exhibition. It is insipid.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">If the cultural sector does not design with the 
        intent of deploying its own cultural models, it will relinquish control 
        of its own sector to the commercial interest, which rule so many aspects 
        of contemporary life already. What does this mean?</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Take your inspiration from contemporary literature, 
        visual art, dance, etc. and not from corporate models.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Our foundations are the history of knowledge, aesthetics, 
        systems, philosophy, analysis...</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Take your cues from the margins, whether they are 
        from the realm of popular culture or highbrow culture.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Be inclusive and complex in your thinking.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">As much as possible hire artists to create for your 
        hypermedia applications: written scripts, visuals, sound scapes, HTML, 
        navigation design, animationsÖ All cultural web sites should include original 
        work by contemporary artists.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Build hybrids. Take chances that people whose raison 
        díêtre is to make $$$ canít take.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">It is the opposite of fundamentalism.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Push oneís ability to think in my Body and Mind.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Embrace complexity, doubt and ambiguity.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Better yet, articulate complexity, doubt and ambiguity.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Jam on complexity, doubt and ambiguity.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Put minds together to attain a collective expansion 
        of creative potential.</span></p>
