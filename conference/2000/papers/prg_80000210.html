      <p class="author">Philip Getchell and Debra LaKind Manager, Museum of Fine 
        Arts, Boston, USA </p>
      <p align="center" class="heading">Abstract</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="abstract">The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston is proud of our efforts 
	  to develop an e-commerce Web site to complement our existing Web site 
	  and our retail/catalog business. Our institution&#39;s operating budget 
	  relies heavily on the success of this income-producing division, and 
	  the move onto the Web promises to strengthen our financial position 
	  by offering another channel for new and existing Museum customers to 
	  support us. Looking back, our first 18 months in the Web business have 
	  been an unequivocal success, with huge profitable and political success. 
	</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">While our first attempt at 
	selling online was, of course, as simple as a few posters listed on our 
	web site, with an 800 number, to solicit orders to our existing operation, 
	it slowly grew into a more integrated part of the existing sales operation. 
	As our institution&#39;s technological sophistication progressed, so did the 
	drive to build a more refined extension of our business. Interestingly 
	enough, however, our first big push toward building a real Web store, 
	was driven not by our retail wing, but by our need to streamline our wholesale 
	operation. </span></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">So, as we continued to feature 
	product related to our collection on our public Web sites, we developed 
	a simple business-to-business site for use by our approved wholesale clientele. 
	This decision to first develop apparently &#34;less important&#34; site was purely 
	financial. Fact is, these 7000, mostly &#34;Mom &amp; Pop&#34; operations are 
	buying very few items at a time, but were demanding a large amount of 
	our resources. Not only were we spending an inordinate amount of time 
	on the phone for a relatively small amount of income, we were printing 
	and sending them each a large, full-color, catalog - specifically produced 
	for them. The design, printing, and distribution of this catalog were 
	very expensive ($60,000) and time consuming. In an effort to save time 
	and money, we needed put it on the Web. It was November, our holiday catalog 
	was in the mail, and the next big project was the 1999 wholesale catalog. 
	If we were going to do it on the Web instead, we needed to do it quickly.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">The remarkably short time to 
	develop this forced us to consider Yahoo! Store. Their model of providing 
	service to an existing commerce application proved a great fit for us. 
	We looked at what we knew we were fairly good at; we had product, copy, 
	images, an fax-capable order processing center, and a great deal with 
	our existing bank. The learning curve was not too steep, and the initial 
	implementation time was incredibly short. As we mapped out our key steps, 
	we were delighted to learn how easy our building of a simple store would 
	be. All we really needed to skip the printing of this paper catalog was 
	to upload the collateral we had already produced, and input some shipping 
	rates, do some simple formatting of pre-defined templates, and we were, 
	quite literally, in business. What we originally though might be huge 
	hassles proved very easy. One issue was the need for this to be an exclusive 
	wholesale-only Web site (pricing info was in there, for all browsers to 
	see), but password-protection was already part of the Yahoo! Store application. 
	There were disappointments, of course. Especially with the look and feel 
	of the very plain format templates provided in the application. But, this 
	initially was to be a tool for other business, not for the Museum-going 
	public. So we just chose some colors and made the best of it. Other more 
	fundamental shortcomings with their system were also identified, but were 
	of very little consequence during this initial implementation. For instance, 
	while Systems-integration, particularly for real-time inventory and credit-card 
	transaction may represent the &#34;holy-grail&#34; of this endeavor, we did not 
	really need to do these things right now. That is, they might be nice, 
	but they seem really difficult and expensive. As we learned how easy it 
	would be to build this wholesale site, we came to the realization that 
	it may not be such a stretch to make a retail site at the same time. The 
	product was EXACTLY the same inventory. The retail store would have different 
	prices, and would not be password-protected, but otherwise a replica of 
	the Wholesale site. It seemed like a no-brainer. And it worked. In fact, 
	Yahoo! wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. They originally approached us wanting 
	to add a prestigious institution to their new Yahoo! shopping community, 
	and really were not very excited about us wanting to just do a little 
	&#34;hidden&#34; store for businesses. After all, their model was to draw &#34;anchor 
	stores&#34; to their major Yahoo! Shopping categories, to generate high traffic. 
	So, while did not want our Wholesale site to be mentioned in this new 
	shopping directory, it quickly figured as a large benefit to be promoted 
	as the featured merchant in our category. So, it was decided; we would 
	build and launch both sites, almost simultaneously! We quickly revisited 
	our goals, and made sure we not making any huge mistakes in taking the 
	Wholesale site and duplicating it for the retail business. Not surprisingly 
	there were a many things not addressed, that we would have liked to solve, 
	but we decided they were too tough for the first round. In addition to 
	the aforementioned desire to integrate with the existing credit card and 
	inventory systems, we would have liked to addressed the following:</span></span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal"><span class="normal">the MFA&#39;s over-reaching 
	  goal of selling memberships (we did not wholesale these) </span></span></li>
	<li><span class="normal"><span class="normal">the Museum Art School&#39;s 
	  strong desire to implement web-based tuition payments </span></span></li>
	<li><span class="normal"><span class="normal">visitor services&#39; expressed 
	  need for a reliable online event-ticketing solution</span></span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">In any event, the online store 
	was launched on December 19, 1998. We were elated to have actually done 
	it in such a short time, and with no allocated budget. We had about 200 
	items up for sale, and were ready to go. And waited to see what would 
	happen. But first we had to get some folks to the site. </span></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">To this end, we leveraged www.mfa.org&#39;s 
	&lt;http://www.mfa.org&#39;s&gt; already high traffic (about 25,000 visits/day). 
	We began printing it in the catalogs, on the bags, in the member magazine, 
	on our exhibition sites - anywhere that was free. And they came, and they 
	bought. We actually got a few holidays sales!</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">As our fulfillment and customer 
	service crew familiarized themselves with out Internet shoppers, we decided 
	in the Spring of 1999 to take our site to the next level and offer our 
	entire Fall catalog - with over 500 items - online. The then-current design 
	of the Web site was not consistent with our branding efforts, and with 
	the expectation of converting many of our catalog shoppers to internet 
	shoppers, we realized that we had another obstacle to face: redesigning 
	the online store.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">The redesign was a hefty task 
	to contemplate - our site was generated in RTML, a custom, dynamic version 
	of HTML, so our novice Web team could not create a new look for the site 
	without the help of an experience Web developer. With still no funds for 
	outside help, we were extremely fortunate to find an RTML Web designer 
	who was willing to strike a deal. He worked with our print designer and 
	copy editor - staff members who were still working on Web tasks outside 
	of their normal job descriptions - and used their comps and specification 
	to create a new look for the store.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">On August 15, 1999 the online 
	store was launched with its new look, three-times as many items, more 
	shipping options, and gift wrapping. With this, shoppers began buy! Since 
	then, with little promotional effort beyond search engine registration 
	and the free stuff, we have attracted over 1,500,000 hits and some attention 
	from the press. Our Holiday season was quite successful, with total revenue 
	reaching almost one million dollars in a six-month period.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">The next few months hold many 
	questions, about site growth, staffing, promotion, development, etc. not 
	to mention the ongoing challenges related to administration of the ongoing 
	store, including: </span></span></p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="normal"><span class="normal">	coordination of the 
	  shooting, scanning, collecting, and editing images for the Web 	</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="normal"><span class="normal">	mastering the software.... 
	  	</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="normal"><span class="normal">	faster order-processing/fulfillment 
	  	</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="normal"><span class="normal">	maintaining customer 
	  service / e-mail... 	</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="normal"><span class="normal">	creating clever promotions/discounts 
	  	</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="normal"><span class="normal">	managing inventory / 
	  back-orders</span></span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">Yet, perhaps the biggest challenge 
	of all is to plan for the future...</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">All along, during the first 
	year of this endeavor, we constantly referred to our Yahoo! Store as the 
	&#34;Throw-away solution.&#34; We were constantly thinking we could and would 
	use Yahoo! Only as long as it took to choose, buy, and implement another 
	product. We had that list of things that Yahoo! Store can&#39;t do, and we 
	just figured we&#39;d live without them, until we moved onto a different system. 
	</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">As time goes by, we have learned 
	a few good &#34;workarounds&#34;, but we still dream of the day when our inventory 
	and web systems are integrated. Also, while we did not see the promise 
	of it early-on, our affiliation with Yahoo! Shopping&#39;s other 8000 merchants 
	seems to bring in quite a bit of traffic and sales.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="normal"><span class="normal">We strongly believe in constant 
	consideration of viable alternatives. While Yahoo! Has proven a great 
	fit during the first year, a change in either of our business models my 
	warrant pursuit of other options. To this end, we have added development-track 
	to our project plan for the coming year. In the next months we will setup 
	and test a separate, free-standing e-commerce package, while still using 
	Yahoo store. Building a separate parallel system, using a robust big-name 
	e-commerce package as its front-end. </span> </span></p>
