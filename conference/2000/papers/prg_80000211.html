	Web Resources by the Science Learning Network (SLN)</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="author"><b>Rob Semper, Noel Wanner Exploratorium, 
	USA and Roland Jackson, Martin Bazley Science Museum, UK</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
	<p align="JUSTIFY" class="small">The Science Learning Network (SLN) is 
	  a world-wide partnership of science museums created to explore the development 
	  of World Wide Web resources for school science education. Supported 
	  by the Unisys Corporation, it grew out of an initial experimental partnership 
	  of six US science museums, funded additionally by the National Science 
	  Foundation. The SLN has developed a significant number of online resources 
	  based on museum resources primarily intended for teachers and school 
	  students (<a href="http://www.sln.org/">http://www.sln.org</a>). Although 
	  there is evidence that these resources are widely used by tens of thousands 
	  of users, there is little detailed understanding about who uses the 
	  resources and how they are being used. More generally, there is little 
	  understanding of the use of educational on-line materials. As the use 
	  of online learning resources for both formal and informal science learning 
	  continues to grow, it is important that producers of these materials 
	  and activities have a developing knowledge of their audiences and modes 
	  of use, and of methodologies for evaluating their use and effectiveness.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Goals of the Study</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">This study was designed to explore the 
	development of an integrated methodology for evaluating the use of on-line 
	resources, and then to pilot-test this methodology to provide information 
	about the use of three specific SLN on-line resources. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The Exploratorium, San Francisco, produced 
	two of the resources examined: Cow&#39;s Eye Dissection and Science of Cycling.</p>
      <p align="CENTER"><img src="Semper.fig1.gif" width="400" height="331"/></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The Franklin Institute, Philadelphia and 
	the Science Museum, London jointly produced one of the resources examined: 
	Flights of Inspiration </p>
      <p align="CENTER"><img src="Semper.fig3.gif" width="400" height="393"/></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">These sites were chosen to contrast 
	a range of likely types of use. Cow&#39;s Eye Dissection is a highly structured 
	linear resource that was designed to be used in a step-by-step manner 
	in classrooms. Flights of Inspiration, which (unlike the other two resources) 
	is based on museum collections, is also designed for classroom use but 
	is less linear, more amenable to browsing, and contains material of wider 
	interest. Science of Cycling is presented in a particularly informal way, 
	and was not designed primarily for use in a curriculum context, but rather 
	as informational material for a wide audience of students, educators, 
	and the public.</span></p>

      </ul>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal"><b>Overall Methodology</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The methodology developed is deliberately 
	diverse, to provide a range of types of information about resource use 
	that complement and illuminate each other. The techniques used were:</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <ul>
	<p align="JUSTIFY"> 
	</p><li><span class="normal">server log analysis, providing detailed quantitative

	<p></p>
	<p align="JUSTIFY">

      </ul>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Together, the range of techniques, 
	from wholly mechanical and quantitative to individually human and qualitative, 
	provides a rich inter-locking picture of use.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal"><span class="normal">There is little published 
	evaluation of online learning resources, although an extensive analysis 
	of use of the Why Files, using server data and online survey, has been 
	published (W. P. Eveland and S. Dunwoody, &#34;Users and navigation patterns 
	of a science World Wide Web site for the public&#34; <i>Public Understanding 
	of Science</i> <b>7</b>, (1998) 285-311). A further relevant paper examining 
	visitors to a museum website was presented at the Museums and the Web 
	Conference in 1999 (J. Chadwick and P. Boverie, &#34;A Survey of Characteristics 
	and Patterns of Behavior in Visitors to a Museum Web Site&#34; <i>Museums 
	and the Web 1999</i>, </span><a href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw99/papers/chadwick/chadwick.html">http://www.archimuse.com/mw99/papers/chadwick/chadwick.html</a>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Log Analysis</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Web site logs contain a wealth of 
	information about how the Web site is being used. Each time the Web server 
	responds to a particular request from a browser, for example to view a 
	new page, download some data or input some text, it records to its logs 
	a series of data about the request and the requesting host computer. By 
	analyzing the log files it is possible to learn a great deal about the 
	type of person using the web site and how they make use of it.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">For this project, we analyzed the 
	log files for these resources for a five week period of 1999 (November 
	14<sup>th</sup> through December 18<sup>th</sup>). This is over the same 
	time frame as the on-line questionnaire was on-line (see below). The specific 
	log records for the three SLN resources of interest, The Cow&#39;s Eye Dissection 
	(Cow&#39;s Eye), the Science of Cycling (Cycling) and Flights of Inspiration 
	(Flights) were isolated from the general Web site log files of the Exploratorium, 
	the Franklin Institute and the Science Museum (NMSI), London. Because 
	the Flights Web site was running on both the Franklin Institute&#39;s and 
	the Science Museum of London&#39;s server, we analyzed four log files in total. 
	These two Web sites were cross-linked at the top page (i.e. users who 
	entered the Franklin Institute Flights top page could like to the UK version 
	and vice versa.) In some cases, where appropriate, the data were merged 
	between the two different log files for Flights.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">These logs were analyzed using the 
	software package Summary Pro (version 1.4.1) from Summary.Net <a href="http://www.summary.net/">(http://www.summary.net</a>)which 
	provides over 100 reports detailing Web site operation. (See the report 
	list in Figure 4.) </span></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="Semper.fig4.gif" width="400" height="445"/></p>
      <p align="CENTER"><b><i class="caption">Figure 4 Summary.Net reports </i></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">This analysis software can show 
	information about the host computer requesting access, the navigation 
	path that the visitor takes through the site and the length of time for 
	the visit. It is also possible to get information about how the visitor 
	was referred to the site, the search phrases that were used to find the 
	site, the speed of the connection, and even the type of browser and operating 
	system which the visitor used. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The results we are reporting on 
	here are based on a preliminary analysis of the use of these SLN resources. 
	Because the connectivity on the Internet is complex and often convoluted, 
	it is often hard to determine with precision any particular result or 
	what any result actually means in detail. At best log analysis should 
	serve as a general guide to what is going on. Nevertheless we believe 
	that these initial results can be highly informative about the current 
	state of the use of educational resources on the Web. </span></p>

      <p align="CENTER" class="caption"><b><i>Figure 5 Summary table of log analysis</i></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Figure 5 provides a summary of the 
	log analysis data for the three resources. For this analysis, a visit 
	is defined to be a sequence of requests all made from the same IP address 
	with no gaps exceeding 30 minutes. It is important to remember that some 
	visits are actually from Web sites that have cached the site at other 
	locations where additional users will access the material. This means 
	that the visits number typically underreports the number of people who 
	have accessed the resource. A unique host is a distinct IP address that 
	is requesting access. In some cases a number of users will use the same 
	host at different times and so this number undercounts the number of individuals 
	accessing a particular site. This is why the visits number is higher than 
	the host number. Countries indicates the number of individual countries 
	as shown by the root domain name making a request for the Web page. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">A page request is a request for 
	an individual page. A hit is a single request to the Web site for a page, 
	a graphic element or a link to a new page. Loading a single page can generate 
	many hit requests. A page with a lot of graphical elements will generate 
	more hits than a page that is composed of mostly text or a few images. 
	Referring domain and referring pages indicate the most recent URL that 
	the Web browser was pointing to before it came to this resource. The pages 
	per visit and hits per visit are average numbers. The duration of visit 
	indicated the average visit length in minutes. The visit per host indicates

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Analyzing the root domain address

	the part of the address which indicates that the host computer for the

	server or a server in a specific country like us, ca, uk, etc. Because 
	there is no direct tagging of individual users on the Internet, one has 
	to make an educated guess about users&#39; identities through analyzing the 
	host IP addresses. This is akin to determining who the public museum visitors 
	are through analyzing their zip code. For the Web, the IP number and the

	this information, it is possible to make some inferences by looking at 
	the difference in domains. Of the top 20 domains for Cow&#39;s Eye, at least 
	10 can be recognized as serving schools in some way (a k-12 or a statewide 
	school network for example). For Cycling, the number appears to be closer 
	to 5. While some schools may be using commercial networks or getting their

	that a significant percentage of visitors (14-22%) now have access at 
	speeds faster than 56k. This could have impact on design decisions about 
	whether to include streaming media or large files in web resources. Around 
	40% of users were on 56k Internet connections, but a significant proportion

	Flights, which has almost none. This may reflect a problem with the phrasing 
	of the questionnaire, or with user understanding of the term &#34;multimedia&#34;. 
	Flights was much more frequently printed out than Cow&#39;s Eye. In general

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Some of the possible hypotheses 
	and questions suggested by a first look at the pilot study data are outlined 
	below:</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Information design/navigation has an impact on educational 
	use versus other use</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Why are some resources more successful 
	in classroom settings than others? Both the questionnaire and the log 
	analysis seem to suggest that the Cow&#39;s Eye resource had a larger proportion 
	of classroom educational use. The large number of clearly educational 
	domains (5 out of the top 20 visitor domains) in the visits to resource 
	seems to fit well with the large number of respondents who identified 
	themselves as explicitly educational users (38%). It is worth noting that 
	there may be more educational domains visiting the sites, since not all 
	schools get internet access through a k12 or .edu domain. Cow&#39;s Eye was 
	followed by Flights, with Cycling having the least number of clearly educational 
	domains visiting, and the least number of respondents claiming educational 
	use. Cycling also had the highest share of users identifying themselves 
	as simply &#34;individual&#34;.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">One possible explanation for this 
	difference could be the design of the resources: Cow&#39;s Eye is quite linear, 
	with a set of instructions for step-by-step use, which may make it quite 
	adaptable to use in a traditional classroom or curriculum. Flight has 
	a certain amount of explicitly educational material, designed for classroom 
	use, while Cycling has very little, requiring flexibility and adaptation 
	for use in a standard curriculum. Alternatively, the difference could 
	due to the content of each of the resources: perhaps the Cow&#39;s Eye Dissection 
	is a natural part of a life-sciences curriculum, while the Science of 
	Cycling fits less neatly into a physics or other curriculum, requiring 
	more adaptation or flexibility from teachers and students. This question 
	will be explored through further observation of classrooms and discussions 
	with teachers.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Use of resources in educational settings yields longer 
	visits and more focused use.</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Why do some resources receive longer 
	visits than others do? The distribution of the length of use curve is 
	roughly the same for all three resources, though the length of use. The 
	length of visit for Cow&#39;s Eye shows a preponderance of users who stayed 
	for between 1-8 minutes, a much longer duration than the other two resources. 
	Since both the questionnaire and the Summary data on visitors&#39; domains 
	suggest that Cow&#39;s Eye is being used in classrooms to a larger extent 
	than the other two resources, it is possible that the length of use is 
	a result of use as a classroom resource, for research and assignments, 
	instead of a &#34;browsing&#34; site for casual users. Another possibility 
	could be that the linear design of Cow&#39;s Eye invites and rewards sustained 
	visits, as opposed to the more modular approach of the other resources.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>The role search engines play in brokering Web site 
	visits</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">How do people find a given web resource? 
	Both the questionnaire and the log analysis seem to suggest that search 
	engines or portal sites play a crucial role in bringing visitors to a 
	given resource. Since roughly %40 of questionnaire respondents indicated 
	that a search engine had brought them to the site, and given the repeated 
	appearance of search engine/portals like msn.com, yahoo.com, and netscape.com 
	in the top referring domains for each resource, the role of search engines 
	seems established. This seems to suggest that a strong understanding of 
	how search engines create their indexes could help in the creation of 
	successful resources, resources that can be found amidst the clamor of 
	competing information on the Web.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">These questions are clearly only 
	starting points, and there are many others to be generated from the examination 
	of the various data sets gathered during this project. Each of these questions 
	could support a separate research effort. One of the goals of this pilot 
	was to evaluate the usefulness and feasibility of more research of this 
	kind; it seems clear that such research will be worthwhile.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Conclusions: Towards a template for 
	evaluation of educational websites</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">When designing this pilot, we chose 
	to gather and examine many different types of data over a relatively brief 
	period. The rationale was that by doing this, the strengths and weaknesses 
	of each type of data could complement each other, producing insights into 
	user behavior, preferences and patterns of use. Ideally, this multi-faceted 
	data should help to identify &#34;who&#39;s out there&#34; and what use 
	they are making of the educational resources like those produced by SLN 
	museums.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">During the course of the study, 
	each data type has revealed strengths and weaknesses. Some of these weaknesses 
	should lead to a revision of the process for future studies. On the whole, 
	what we have seen in this pilot seems to strengthen the argument for this 
	model of a multi-faceted user research study.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Log analysis</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Log analysis is a method that yields 
	a great deal of quantitative data on file accesses to the resource. No 
	&#34;cookies&#34; or personal information are gathered. This method 
	has the advantage of neither invading the privacy of users nor disrupting 
	the user&#39;s experience by requiring the user to choose to participate in 
	a study. Data can be gathered on every user who visits a site, giving 
	a broad and in some ways complete picture of use. However, the anonymity 
	of the data makes interpretation difficult. If a given user stays in a 
	resource for only 30 seconds, we will never know why she left: had she 
	found what she wanted? Had she been irritated by confusing navigation? 
	Was she bored? Without recourse to more in-depth and qualitative data, 
	we will never know. Thus the weakness of log analysis is largely a lack 
	of depth.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The choice of analysis software 
	has an impact on this type of data: different programs use different methods 
	to generate reports on log data, which can confuse results when compared 
	with reports from other software.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Online questionnaire</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The online questionnaire generates 
	quantitative data on specific user&#39;s identity, purpose and modes of use. 
	This form of quantitative data adds depth to log analysis, by asking some 
	of the questions missing from log data: who are you? Why are you here? 
	What are you doing? The strength of this method was that it gathers a 
	greater depth of information than log analysis, while still gathering 
	a large enough sample to be significant, without a huge outlay of time 
	by researchers. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The weaknesses of this method are 
	again lack of depth, and they are the result of the technological solution 
	we chose to administer the questionnaire. In order to create a questionnaire 
	which could generate numerical results dynamically from a database program, 
	we had to choose questions which could be answered by choosing from a 
	pull-down list of possible options, or by checking a series of &#34;radio-buttons&#34; 
	for each response that was applicable. Thus we limited the range of possible 
	responses a participant could choose, and we did not allow for any elaboration. 
	Allowing participants to type their responses into a text field would 
	have allowed for a full range of responses, though it would have required 
	an elaborate effort to read, sort and code the responses into numerical 
	data. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The &#34;multiple-choice&#34; 
	format was also chosen in an effort to limit the time the questionnaire 
	would take, thereby hopefully increasing ease of participation. For any 
	voluntary survey, participation levels are a concern, especially on the 
	web, when less demanding sites are only a click away. In order to encourage 
	participation, the questionnaire did not ask for specific personal information, 
	protecting the privacy of the users. It was also designed so the respondent 
	could see his/her own responses in the context of all responses to date, 
	thereby enabling the respondent to be a more active participant and providing 
	a small &#34;carrot&#34; for participating.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Thus the choice of possible responses 
	offered to the users becomes crucial to the success of any such questionnaire. 
	By failing to offer a relevant set of choices, or by choosing responses 
	that are too general, the effectiveness of the question is severely limited. 
	Several of the questions from the initial questionnaire will be revised 
	for future research efforts. (By administering a questionnaire on the 
	web, such iterative trials and revisions are easily carried out.) </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The weaknesses or limits of the 
	questionnaire may be addressed through telephone follow-up and classroom 
	observation.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Follow up interviews</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">These interviews are currently being carried 
	out. The decision to undertake these interviews was largely based on the 
	results of the log analysis and the questionnaire: given the limits of 
	the two quantitative data sets, we sought the ability to probe user experience 
	in a more open-ended and responsive way. So when a user says, &#34;Oh, 
	your site bored me,&#34; or &#34;It was useless in my classroom,&#34; 
	we can ask &#34;why?&#34; Instead of being limited to the category of 
	&#34;other&#34;, responses that don&#39;t fit our pre-conceived categories 
	can be looked at in detail. By limiting our interviews to questionnaire 
	respondents who volunteered for further conversation, we may skew our 
	results somewhat, but we should gain insight into the blank spaces left 
	by other data types.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Classroom observation</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">This is essentially an &#39;ethnographic&#39;-type 
	of study. For each classroom, the observer needs to be aware of the lesson 
	content a teacher is trying to convey, and how it fits into the overall 
	scheme of work in that classroom and the school and school system as a 
	whole. Educational systems and curricula vary widely from country to country, 
	and from state to state within the United States, and this can have a 
	strong effect on how given resource is approached, and even on how computers 
	and networks are viewed and implemented within the classroom. (A teacher 
	whose class can use computers only in a &#34;computer lab&#34;, far 
	away from other materials and tools will find a web resource that contains 
	recipes for student experiments far less useful than a teacher who has 
	computers in the classroom. A sobering possible scenario for the apparent 
	educational &#34;success&#34; of the Cow&#39;s Eye Dissection is that it 
	lends itself easily to a computer-lab environment.)</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">As we move forward with this pilot 
	study, we will develop a protocol for in-classroom evaluation, with brief 
	follow up discussion(s) with the teacher. This will enable us to gather 
	in-depth qualitative data (stories) reflecting how a given web resource 
	is successfully or unsuccessfully used in a classroom setting.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>The Invisible Web Visitor: Moving 
	towards understanding the audience</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">By combining log analysis with questionnaires 
	and log analysis and user observation/interviews, insights may be gained 
	into the stories behind the numbers, while the numbers help to place the 
	stories into the context of the entire use pattern for that resource. 
	From our experience with this pilot study, this form of multi-modal research 
	into web resource use is an extremely rich source of information, one 
	we have only begun to explore. The information we gathered begins to reveal 
	a picture of a previously invisible audience, and may yield valuable guidance 
	for on-going efforts to create web resources, which serve the educational 
	and public audiences of museums.</p>
