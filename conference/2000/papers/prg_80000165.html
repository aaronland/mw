      <blockquote> <b> </b> 
	<p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="small">Based on experience over the past 
	  year developing the next generation program &#34;Making Sense of Modern 
	  Art,&#34; this paper asks the question: what happens when you position yourself 
	  firmly in the dialectic between content and interactive functionality? 
	  Multimedia or Web-based projects are often characterized by a standard 
	  book-like or template-based design augmented by the occasional inclusion 
	  of video, audio, and/or animations. In developing the new version of 
	  &#34;Making Sense,&#34; a concerted effort was made to map ways of thinking 
	  about and experiencing art more directly into ways the screens function. 
	  The work flow process for content development and template design in 
	  one particular section of the program, the Answer Exploration screens, 
	  is discussed:</span></p>
	<ul>
	  <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
	  </p><li><span class="small">Research, with seminar-like discussions about 
	    each artist and work, followed by storyboarding and spec&#39;ing out of 
	    potential tools appropriate to the variety of methodological approaches 
	    key to a given artwork. </span></li>
	  <p></p>
	  <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
	  </p><li><span class="small">Generalization of these tools when appropriate, 
	    without stifling creative solutions for new animations, metaphors 
	    and juxtapositions</span></li>
	  <p></p>
	  <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
	  </p><li><span class="small">Development of modular and recombinable elements 
	    for many screen-types</span></li>
	  <p></p>
	  <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
	  </p><li><span class="small">Design of a Flash Generator database capable 
	    of generating the interactive Flash functionality for each of these 
	    screens</span></li>
	  <p></p>
	  <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
	  </p><li><span class="small">Development of an interface that allows us to

	  </p><li><span class="small">Augmentation of the catalog of database-generated 
	    screen types by selective hand-coding to assure variety of experience 
	    and spontaneity of feeling. </span></li>
	  <p></p>
	</ul>
	<p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="small">The resulting program will be publishable 
	  not only on the Web, but to gallery-based kiosks/flat-panel stations, 
	  CD-ROMs (for easy distribution of high bandwidth material to the schools), 
	  and potentially to wearable computers and smart table technology. Subsets 
	  of content can be targeted to different audiences, locations, and delivery 
	  platforms.A hierarchy of different degrees of interactivity and personalization

      <b class="heading">Introduction</b> 
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">As you may have noticed in your 
	own experience, ideas are dangerous things. They start small and then 
	have a way of exponentially expanding to fill years of time, and ballooning 
	to engage dozens of people in their execution. Thatís if you are lucky. 
	</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Over the past few years at SFMOMA, 
	we have been very, very lucky <sup> 2</sup>. We have not only had an idea, 
	we have seen it through several design iterations, tested it, gotten it 
	funded, staffed up, and are now working on it full-tilt boogie. In this 
	paper we shall give a structural presentation of the development process 
	that has guided our work. We shall discuss how we think of audience in 
	designing our tools, and how we then envision ourselves as future users 
	to build a meta-toolset for continued content authoring in the future. 
	</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>1. The Idea</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The program is called <i>Making Sense 
	of Modern Art</i>. It is<i> </i>an educational multimedia program publishable 
	not only to the Web, but to gallery-based kiosks/flat-panel stations, 
	CD-ROMs, wearable computers and smart tables as well. The goal is, in 
	the final analysis, to have a sea of content, and of critical frameworks, 
	from which we can draw interactive essays on many different subjects, 
	suited to a variety of audiences and delivery platforms, and publish them 
	at will.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>2. Research</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">With this goal in mind, initial 
	content research began. What was the scope of our inquiry? How would we 
	<i>make sense</i> of modern art? On the highest level we divided our approaches 
	into examinations across the century (Timeline and Themes) and those that 
	would be artwork specific (The Domain of the Work). This paper concerns 
	the question and answer exploration screens in the third, artwork-specific 
	section, to which we have been devoting much of our attention over the 
	past year. After creating an initial list of artworks from our permanent 
	collection to explore, we dove in to look at the issues that would surround 
	each work. Our interest was to use the content itself to drive the process. 
	</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Our initial content meetings were 
	conducted a bit like seminars with the lead researcher presenting salient 
	issues about a work. Each issue was then framed as a question and together 
	we sketched what we saw as a mental map of its exploration. For example 
	when looking at Dali and Spain as a Surrealist context we sketched a map 
	which layered the influences of García-Lorca, Civil War, Catalonia, 
	etcÖ </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Or when talking about Robert Rauschenberg 
	in his early years at Black Mountain College we laid out a web of collaborative 
	relationships. </span></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">By working with researchers who 
	were self-conscious and articulate about the historical methodologies 
	they were employing, we were able to think explicitly about the user experience. 
	If we were in fact presenting a range of art historical methodologies, 
	how could we put the user in a position to live or re-enact those discovery 
	processes? Even as we confined ourselves to paper storyboard prototypes, 
	we were already thinking not just about what to say, but how the userís 
	doing something would help them understand the matters at hand. What tools 
	might enable us to develop interactivity based in these approaches?</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">We noted that as we considered more 
	artworks, each spawned a variety of issues and approaches. Certain approaches 
	became generalizable, and we were able to combine salient features from 
	different sketches to form screen types that we felt could serve us well 
	throughout the program. Often, these mapped to specific art historical 
	methods, such as: </span></p>

	of the many levels on which a single artwork can be understood. Each &#34;layer&#34; 
	is triggered by clicking on one of the triangles center right; it reconfigures 
	the screen to present a set of accompanying documentary materials (illustrations,

	possible answer screen templates: e.g., Formal Analysis, Collaboration 
	Web, Onion Skin, etc. These screens in turn can launch special &#34;viewers&#34; 
	for the movies, books, etc. that they reference.</i></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">All the screens shared a common trait: 
	they served as multipliers of content within a single screen. What the 
	viewer saw on first arriving was not what they saw as they explored the 
	screen. The screen types were inherently polyvalent: each held within 
	it a mechanism for revealing a cascading succession of related media content, 
	as a result of the viewerís engagement. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>4. Screen Design Implementation </b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Armed with our sketches, the time 
	had come to build screen templates. Particularly important at this juncture 
	was working again with the researchers to make sure that the tools would 
	in fact work for the bulk of the content they were beginning to script. 
	We also had to test the screens to make sure that they could be made into 
	templates for our authoring database.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The Slider Gallery (Fig. 5) is a 
	good example of a screen type that came out of the process. Initially 
	created for use as a gallery of monochromatic paintings over time, we 
	knew that it could be used for other types of galleries: works throughout 
	an artistís life, works arranged according to a particular theme, etc.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Similarly the Collaboration Web, 
	which grew out of a sketch (Fig. 1) of Robert Rauschenbergís circle of 
	collaborators and friends, would be applicable to other situations where 
	multiple links could be made between a group of artists, works, or ideas. 
	(Fig. 6) It could also serve, with a slight modification in functionality, 
	as a layered gallery with the works on the screen revealing other works 
	when clicked. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Finally, for the basic garden variety 
	coffee table book/magazine-like web page-multimedia screen, we developed 
	what we called the Variety of Media screen, which could launch close-ups 
	or videos of the various elements it contained. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>5. Testing</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Somewhat confident that the screens were 
	working for our content, we engaged in two initial waves of usability 
	testing with a professional facilitator in a corporate testing lab. (In 
	this we were inspired by Scott Sayreís presentation at last yearís Museums 
	&amp; the Web conference. (Sayre 1999)) Testing is always both frightening 
	and enlightening; it becomes especially important when new interface conventions 
	are being defined and a broad range of users is envisioned. In the case 
	of <i>Making Sense</i>, the first group of users is museum visitors and 
	web users. We also plan to develop a curriculum guide for use in secondary 
	schools. We tested early with these groups so that we could identify which 
	tools would be most useful for them. Even from static screen print-outs, 
	our teacher-advisors have given us important insights into the areas of 
	the program and the particular functionalities that they will be able 
	to use in the classroom and for which we should consider curriculum development.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>6. Authoring Tool Development</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The next task was to design a Flash Generator 
	database capable of creating the interactive Flash functionality for each 
	of the programís screens and sequences. Our developers were challenged 
	in this by the loose, non-hierarchical nature of our design process. What 
	was perhaps just an inconvenience became a bit more maddening as they 
	tried to accomplish our next mission: to create an automated &#34;wizard&#34; 
	tool that would walk curators or art historians through the process of 
	putting together a content screen, and that would factor in all possible 
	screen-type combinations. What screen type would lead to what screen? 
	they asked, noting our desire to embed alternative questions within initial 
	answer exploration screens. Our response was invariably: &#34;We canít 
	predict&#34;óa database designerís nightmare. While the end userís entry 
	into the program would in fact be hierarchical, with the user able to 
	move from one of three main interfaces down to question screens and from 
	there into answer exploration screens, once within the exploration screens, 
	there is no inherently hierarchical relationship among them. A user might 
	branch via a supplementary, embedded question from a Collaboration Web 
	to a Slider Gallery or from a Formal Analysis to a Variety of Media screen 
	(Figure 9). This pushed the developers to rethink their design of the 
	authoring tool.</p>

	9</a>. February 2000 schematic of </i>Making Sense of Modern Art<i> authoring 
	tool by Red Eye Digital Media. This is a working iteration of the architecture 
	for the database tool which will permit us to assemble new content screens 
	and Flash presentations from the templates and media assets we develop.</i></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The authoring tool is designed to build 
	not only individual screens, but to assemble them into Flash presentations 
	as well. Presentations are collections of screens that can be destined 
	for the web, kiosks, fixed disk or another delivery platform. The important 
	thing is to have the content available in the form of media assets ready 
	to assemble; then the author-designer can choose the appropriate media 
	to publish to their chosen delivery platform (Figure 10). </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>Addition of Non-Database Driven Components</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">While we were aware of the benefits of 
	using database-driven templates to create content, we always knew we wouldnít 
	be satisfied if that was all we provided for our users. That knowledge 
	and our desire to create special content for the web led to the creation 
	of theme screens. As we have written elsewhere (Samis, 1997):</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <blockquote> 
	<p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">We must ask the question: does standardization 
	  best serve our audience? Object-oriented programming and other second-generation 
	  technologies do not in and of themselves guarantee an approach more 
	  in tune with the art. At worst, they guarantee merely an approach more 
	  in tune with computer programming.</p>
	<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The theme screensí design is still emerging 
	and will continue to develop because each theme will be hand crafted in 
	Flash by teams of author/designers. Like the exploration screens the process 
	will be content driven. While the question and exploration screens focus 
	on individual artworks, the theme screens traverse the century and connect 
	multiple works in their threads. Free from any database constraints we 
	will use typography, animation, and sound to enliven these discussions 
	of issues like &#34;art and the everyday object,&#34; &#34;artists 
	and the body,&#34; and &#34;Who gave artists the right to make their 
	own rules?&#34; We envision these screens as an opportunity to custom 
	design interactivity for a range of users from children to art historians. 
      </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>8. &#34; Díoù venons-nous? 
	Que sommes-nous? Où allons-nous?&#34; </b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Gauguinís famous questions, &#34;Where 
	do we come from, what are we, where are we going?&#34; put us in mind 
	of the different levels of interactivity that this program, and others, 
	have charted. A rough typology follows:</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><b>First degree interactivity</b> 
	might be exemplified by a book. It is primarily linear, the type is fixed 
	and immutable, but you can stop whenever you want and dream, you make 
	up in your own mind what each of the characters looks and sounds like. 
	Whatís more, if there is an index or itís alphabetically organized, you 
	can access its contents in a non-linear way. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal"><b>Second degree interactivity</b> 
	is exemplified by point and click multimedia, i.e., the standard web page 
	with a layout reminiscent of a book or magazine. You can still stop and 
	reflect, pace yourself, etc., and the capacity for video, animation, and 
	audio is addedómuch like an animated illustration on a static page. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Our development strategy for the 
	answer exploration screens in <i>Making Sense of Modern Art </i>is what 
	we will call <b>third degree interactivity</b>. Here we are using the 
	screen templates to model ways in which an educated viewer may come to 
	his or her understanding of the meanings of a work, and allowing the user 
	to emulate those processes, making discoveries and connections for themselves. 
	The screen might undergo fundamental changes in state between the userís 
	arrival and departure, depending on how they use the template at hand. 
	A more dramatic example of third degree interactivity is made available 
	in our Timeline and Concepts &amp; Relations screens, not treated in this 
	paper. There, object-oriented programming permits viewers to compare artworks 
	across time using drag-and-drop functionality.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">At the <b>fourth stage</b>, we turn 
	those tools over to the user. For example, the formal analysis tool that 
	highlights sections of an artwork for description could be used by users 
	to add their own annotations or to reference related works of their own 
	choosing (or making?). The same tool could be used in a group discussion 
	forum as a site for people to raise issues about a work. Instead of our 
	supplying the answer &#34;Whatís going on in this picture?&#34; both 
	the questions and answers could be raised by users.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The future of the program is not 
	limited to the web and kiosks in the galleries. Working with Flavia Sparacino 
	of the MIT Media Lab, we are porting content developed in the authoring 
	toolís &#34;sea&#34; of exploration screens to a wearable computer that 
	will enable the work of art to trigger content as you walk through the 
	gallery. Other features of the <i>Making Sense</i> program structure not 
	treated in this paper will bear fruit in physical &#34;smart tables&#34; 
	that will provide social interaction in the galleries along with an exploration 
	of the interconnectedness of works in our collection.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Our ultimate goal for <i>Making 
	Sense of Modern Art</i> is to enable users to co-author program content 
	with usóand with each other. If we can further personalize the programís 
	tools to correspond with their learning styles, then we may reach a <b>fifth 
	degree of interactivity</b>. Just as we are giving ourselves the option 
	to selectively publish content to different delivery platforms, at a later 
	date, we might give users the options to select the kinds of media and 
	interactivity they prefer to experience.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The authors wish to thank Jeannette 
	Redensek and Karen Fiss, successively directors of research on the project, 
	our collaborators in the development of these screen types. Thanks are 
	also due to our patient and long-suffering outside collaborators at Red 
	Eye Digital Media (for engineering the web functionality and authoring 
	tool) and Perimetre Design (for the current generation of screen designs). 
	<i>Making Sense of Modern Art </i>has received generous support from The 
	Getty Grant Program and Compaq Computer Corporation. Finally, none of 
	this work could be done without the support of John Weber, Lori Fogarty,
