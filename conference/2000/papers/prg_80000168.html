	at the National Maritime Museum</b></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Sarah Ashton and Sophia Robertson, National Maritime 
	Museum, UK</b></p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading"><b>Abstract </b></p>
      <blockquote> <b> </b> 
	<p align="JUSTIFY" class="small">Following the launch of the Centre for 
	  Maritime Research at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, UK, the 
	  Museum has enhanced the collections databases already available on the 
	  Web with the addition of an impressive range of new services and repackaged 
	  content. This paper looks at major online developments to date: the 
	  Search Station collections resource and Port the maritime information 
	  gateway. Produced using FileMaker Pro and Web technologies, the Search 
	  Station is a multimedia resource providing thematic access to almost 
	  two thousand exhibits from the Museum&#39;s collections. This paper will 
	  outline the production and extent of the content, examine the user profile, 
	  and highlight the future potential of the system. Port ñ an information 
	  gateway for maritime studies ñ employs the open source software toolkit 
	  ROADS (Resource Organisation and Discovery in Subject-based Services) 
	  to provide a searchable and browseable catalogue of maritime-related 
	  Internet based resources. Hosting considerations and the Web-based administrative 
	  features of Port are examined, together with the gatewayís development 
	  and marketing.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The National Maritime Museum (NMM) 
	encompasses three public sites - the National Maritime Museum, the Royal 
	Observatory Greenwich (ROG) and the Queenís House. It houses an unrivalled 
	maritime collection of over two million objects, including 64,000 prints 
	and drawings, 4000 oil paintings, 270,000 historic photographs, 50,000 
	charts, 5000 scientific instruments and globes, 7000 uniforms and weapons, 
	and four miles of manuscripts. These collections relate to every aspect 
	of ships, seafaring, astronomy and time, from prehistory to the present 
	day. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The NMM is very much a self-reflective 
	institution that continually reassesses its role and purpose in the museum 
	world. In recent years the Museum has redefined itself to attract new 
	audiences and to maintain its appeal in todayís competitive leisure industry. 
	In April 1999, the NMM completed a major redevelopment programme. This 
	resulted in the creation of a dramatic new architectural space enclosed 
	within a glass roof, and the production of sixteen new galleries. The 
	Museum also aims to re-position maritime history as a subject and to improve 
	access to its collections in order to attract researchers from a range 
	of disciplines. To facilitate these developments, the Museumís Centre 
	for Maritime Research (CMR) has harnessed the very latest information 
	and communication technology (ICT) to transform and substantially ërecastí 
	its information services on the Internet. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The NMM was one of the first UK 
	national museums to establish a web presence early in 1996. Searchable 
	text catalogues of the library, manuscripts and prints and drawings collections 
	were made available online soon after. The approach of the new millennium 
	prompted a re-evaluation of the museumís information and research services. 
	ICT is seen as integral to the NMMís digital policy, allowing the Museum 
	to work towards fulfilling the demand for online access to its information 
	resources from a UK and worldwide audience. In this paper, we will look 
	at the CMRís two flagship projects to date: the Search Station collections 
	resource and Port, the maritime information gateway. These key projects 
	are essential ëbuilding blocksí towards making the NMMís collections and 
	resources fully accessible online, and both have been commended in a recent 
	report for Britainís National Museum Directorsí Conference. The projects 
	involved technical collaboration with a multimedia production company 
	and a university-based electronic library project respectively. We will 
	describe our experiences as project managers, the resulting developments 
	and future applications.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="heading"><b>The Search Station</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The Search Station is a collections resource 
	providing thematic access to over 1800 objects. It opened onsite in April 
	1999 and offers the public ten touchscreen and mouse-operated work stations. 
	It was launched online (<a href="http://www.nmm.ac.uk/searchstation">http://www.nmm.ac.uk/searchstation</a>) 
	in early December 1999, allowing the public worldwide access to highlights 
	of the Museum&#39;s varied and vast collections. From original idea to onsite 
	launch and then to online access, the evolution of the Search Station 
	is interesting to consider as the project was achieved with limited resources 
	but using a variety of new technologies.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Planning and Creating the Content</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The Museum began to computerise its collections 
	using the Multi-Mimsy collections management system in 1996, and it was 
	one of the first national museums in England to establish advanced in-house 
	scanning facilities in early 1997. This provided a basis for the Museum 
	to improve public access to its collections, particularly those that could 
	not be displayed, in readiness for the opening of the new Museum. The 
	refurbishment had secured over 20 million pounds in lottery funding and 
	the majority of staff were working towards its completion, so both staff 
	time and money for other projects were in short supply. In addition, a 
	future-proofed public access system for collections was unavailable in 
	the UK at that time, and Multi-Mimsy the collections management database 
	required a great deal of interpretation before it could be made available 
	to the ëvisitingí public. So the Museum decided to create multimedia presentations, 
	highlighting key areas in the collections, which would both inform and 
	entertain. This pilot project formed the first stage of making the Museumís 
	collections accessible electronically to the public. The Search Station 
	idea was born and the challenge was to put the idea into practice.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The tight timeframe demanded rigorous 
	planning if the project was to meet its deadlines. Funding was secured 
	through Museum project funds and sponsorship from Research Machines plc, 
	the Royal Bank of Scotland and Silicon Imaging. This, although adequate, 
	did not allow for lavish production techniques. The Director of the CMR 
	together with the Head of IT at the Museum were responsible for overall 
	control of the project, the choice of technology and installation, whilst 
	the content project manager was responsible for the day-to-day operation 
	of producing and managing the content and system design. Six themes were 
	chosen for production (three for completion in April 1999, and the remaining 
	three in September 1999). These six themes provided a good cross-section 
	of objects from the collection and were chosen to complement the new Museum 
	galleries. The themes were: Nelson, Passengers, Trade and Empire, Exploration, 
	Maritime Art and Sea, Stars and Time. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The themes were divided into topics and 
	sub-topics, and researchers were chosen internally and also appointed 
	externally to develop each theme. Researchers were asked to provide object 
	information and associated topic text for each item they chose within 
	a topic, to order the objects within each topic and to provide topic overviews. 
	Thus the Search Station provided factual information on a variety of topics, 
	for example The Slave Trade, alongside the usual object information - 
	date, maker etc. Researchersí guidelines were produced to provide helpful 
	information on writing for multimedia applications and to ensure consistency 
	in style and form. With links to the National Curriculum in mind and in 
	view of the Museumís own preferred reading age for labels, all text was 
	aimed at the 11-14 age group. A template was produced for the collections 
	information and full object lists for each topic were passed to the Museumís 
	Photo Studio for photography and scanning. All submitted data was checked 
	and text edited by both an education specialist and a copy-editor. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Production and Delivery</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Whilst the content was being created, 
	the Museum put the production contract out to tender. This was awarded 
	to Cognitive Applications Ltd, Brighton (<a href="http://www.cogapp.com/">http://www.cogapp.com</a>). 
	Production began with the immediate collection of materials. Content data 
	was entered into a source database online using an HTML form and Perl 
	script. This enabled data to be collected from a number of contributors 
	at once into one text file. It also allowed the producers the ability 
	to develop the system whilst material was still being collated or refined. 
	At a fixed date, the text file data was exported into Filemaker Pro databases. 
	These different databases - including theme, topic, exhibit (text and 
	title) and asset (object information and media files) - were of varying 
	size and complexity, and formed the master database for the Museumís onsite 
	system and website. The database was thus used to manage all the data 
	for the system - text, images, animations, audio, film, atlas, timeline, 
	glossary entries, quizzes and design data. Image files were collected 
	in batches and routine programmes were written to accelerate their collection 
	and management from the Museumís server. The database and system structure 
	continually developed as the project progressed and particularly as new 
	materials were added. Early on, in addition to the object and contextual 
	information, a variety of extra features were added to make the system 
	more entertaining and informative to the user. Different storyboards, 
	maps, quizzes and materials were assembled from which the producers created 
	many stand-alone features in Dynamic HTML, QuickTime, Java applets and 
	Macromediaís Shockwave and Flash. The design for many of these items followed 
	the constraints of working with touchscreen delivery but producers were 
	aware that all materials would be reworked for the Web. The onsite version 
	was delivered using Filemaker Pro Web Companion and Microsoftís Internet 
	Information Server.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">In order to turn the onsite Search Station 
	into a website, there were a number of considerations. The Search Station 
	needed to run trouble-free on as many browsers and platforms as possible, 
	so two versions of the site were created ñ a ëtext and images onlyí version 
	and an ëadvanced versioní which included the features and plug-in content. 
	The site was designed to work with Version 3 browsers and above. There 
	were three options to choose from for transferring the master database 
	to the Web. Firstly, it was possible to host the databases with a Filemaker 
	internet service provider who offered a database service. But this option 
	would have been expensive and difficulties may have arisen with server 
	reliability and ease of access for updates and bug-fixing, plus it would 
	have delivered a slow system. Secondly, the website could have been compiled 
	from the source databases to produce a static site. This would have required 
	the programming of a tool for compiling a static version of the website 
	from the source databases. Although this could be hosted on the NMMís 
	server, it would have involved the licensing and integrating of a standard 
	web engine into the site, and again was costly. The third option, and 
	the one that was finally taken, was to deliver the system via a custom 
	Perl script. This method was preferable as delivery would be faster, the 
	site could be hosted on the Museumís own server, updating would be simple 
	and it was known to be reliable. As one of the most common programming 
	languages used for CGI throughout the Web, Perl has been used widely to 
	programme electronic web forms and as the glue and gateway between systems, 
	databases and users. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">Having decided on this route, the producers 
	exported all the fields needed from the master database into a number 
	of text files (themes, topics, exhibits, assets, quizzes, atlas, timelines 
	and glossary). Then a Perl script was written that retrieved the information 
	needed to display elements of the website - the page layout, screen titles, 
	text descriptions, asset data, images, image sizes, quiz questions, timeline 
	entries, index information and multimedia content. The information was 
	subsequently turned into web pages using a small number of HTML templates. 
	At the same time as allowing the system to build itself quickly, this 
	also enabled global design changes to be made independently of the underlying 
	data. </p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">11. <i>Film Clips</i>: Over thirty 
	film clips were included in the onsite Search Station using Quicktime.

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The Search Station has been online 
	for a comparatively short time but so far public reaction has been extremely 
	positive. Even at these early stages it is possible to identify distinct 
	user profiles from the feedback forms. The subject matter tends to attract 
	a predominantly male audience, and this is born out in results so far. 
	Schools and universities are also emerging as regular users. The feedback 
	has indicated that people find the material both educational and interesting, 
	the system delivery quick, and the design and navigation clear. Users 
	also emphasise that the content organisation is both innovative and engaging. 
	Monthly website logs will be implemented shortly, and these will provide 
	more detailed information about the usage of the content and which themes 
	and areas are most popular. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Users actively want to access collections 
	information and are fascinated to see the breadth and depth of our collections, 
	but they also want integrated resources and interactive services. Some 
	of these have been provided, but there is much more still to develop within 
	the Search Station. In the coming twelve months, planned additions will 
	include: teacher resources linked to the National Curriculum, a support 
	CD-ROM created specifically for teachers, default Search Links throughout 
	the NMM website to help publicise the shipsí plans collection, manuscripts 
	collection and picture library, and new content, including the outstanding 
	film clips. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Museums in the UK are now actively 
	being encouraged to create digital museums providing access to their collections 
	and to join government schemes such as the National Grid for Learning 
	(aimed at schools) and Peopleís Network (aimed at lifelong learning). 
	Pilot projects like the Search Station have been well received by museum 
	professionals and public audiences alike, and greater resources are being 
	made available for the consolidation or growth of many such projects. 
	Many UK museums including the British Museum are working towards their 
	own public access systems and SCRAN (Scottish Cultural Resources Access 
	Network) is the UKís prime example of just what can be achieved when substantial 
	funds are invested. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The NMM is building on the success 
	of the Search Station to begin the second stage of providing electronic 
	access to its collections with a fully comprehensive public access system 
	of its own. There are many issues still to consider including free and 
	subscription access, rights management and associated multimedia publishing, 
	but the NMM feels that its experience with the Search Station can only 
	assist in providing what the public wants and pointing the way for future 
	developments. With over two million objects within the Museumís collection 
	there is obviously a long way to go but the Search Station certainly has 
	shown that something very worthwhile can be achieved with limited resources 
	in a relatively short period of time.</span></p>

      </blockquote>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The rapid expansion of the Internet 
	and global networked information makes it increasingly difficult for users 
	to locate useful material. To tackle the problem of finding quality information 
	resources on the Internet, in recent years a number of subject-based information 
	gateways have been developed, in subject areas such as the social sciences, 
	history and medicine. The aim of Port is to facilitate access to high 
	quality networked information resources for maritime studies, to be McClintockís 
	&#34;commanding breeze&#34;. Port is based on the model developed by 
	other UK subject-based information gateways as part of the Electronic 
	Libraries Programme (eLib) (<a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/services/elib/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/services/elib/</a>) 
	funded by JISC (<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/</a>), 
	the Joint Information Systems Committee for the university sector. These 
	subject gateways provide catalogues of Internet resources which users 
	can search or browse. As they relate to a specific subject area, they 
	are far more focussed than the large search engines and often contain 
	a range of associated materials and services.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">For Port, maritime-related Internet 
	resources are identified, assessed, organised and described by a Librarian 
	or Subject Specialist at the Museum, and cataloguers are also employed 
	on a temporary basis to populate the database from time to time. This 
	skilled human involvement is crucial to quality control: only resources 
	which fall under the Port Scope Policy and also fulfil criteria according 
	to, for example, currency, relevance and authority are included. A meaningful 
	description of the resource is written and keywords are assigned which 
	are appropriate for the end-users wanting to locate such resources. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><img src="ashton.fig9.jpg"/></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="caption"><b>Figure 9: Sample record.</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> <span class="normal">Effectively Port staff carry out 
	the time-consuming tasks for users: they join discussion lists, monitor 
	sites, perform searches and filter out items which are irrelevant, out-of-date 
	or of poor quality. In addition to the catalogue of high-quality resources, 
	Port extends access to related materials developed by the CMR, such as 
	a series of self-help research guides which provide information about 
	the Museum&#39;s collections and about other sources for research into maritime 
	history. The development of some of these materials was generously supported 
	by Londonís Baltic Exchange. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Port employs the open source software 
	toolkit ROADS (Resource Organisation and Discovery in Subject-based Services). 
	To the best of our knowledge, the NMM is the first museum in the world 
	to exploit this set of Internet-based software tools. ROADS (<a href="http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/roads/">http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/roads/</a>) 
	was originally a project from the Access to Networked Resources section 
	of eLib and the software has been developed by a consortium of leading-edge 
	developers in the fields of metadata (especially Dublin Core), cataloguing, 
	indexing and searching. Although this project has now finished, the software 
	continues to be developed and is used by service providers around the 
	world. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">ROADS is a set of software tools 
	which enables the set-up and maintenance of Web-based subject gateways, 
	for example it looks after all the indexing of resources, creates a search 
	mechanism and checks links automatically. The toolkit perspective means 
	that developers can select which parts of the software they wish to use. 
	The software consists of a package of Perl modules which can be downloaded 
	as a bundle and installed on a Web server. ROADS runs on any modern version 
	of the UNIX operating system, such as Linux. ROADS uses the Whois++ directory 
	service protocol. This presented the Museum with a problem. At the time, 
	the NMMís website was hosted by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and 
	that ISP was unwilling to house scripts written by anyone else. A further 
	problem was that ROADS requires that a Whois++ server be run on the web 
	server. The Whois++ server is not a CGI script, it is a daemon that is 
	started up and allowed to run continuously. Unlike a CGI script (which 
	typically is fired up when it is triggered from a web page, runs and dies), 
	a continuously running daemon presents a higher risk to a web server. 
	A daemon may also use more resources than is reasonable for a single user 
	or it may interfere with other server processes. Several randomly selected 
	ISPs were contacted and the Museum found two who were potentially willing 
	to host the gateway. Soon after this, the NMM website was transferred 
	to a server administered by the Museumís IT Department. However, at the 
	time the Museum did not have the technical skills (UNIX and Perl) to develop 
	and support the ROADS software in-house. Coupled with this, the dynamic 
	nature of the software and the remote access to the server required by 
	ROADS developers was considered a potential security risk to a proposed 
	e-commerce system which would run on the same server. The decision was 
	therefore taken in June 1998 to accept a proposal from the Institute for 
	Learning and Research Technology (ILRT) at Bristol University to host 
	and provide technical support for Port. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The ILRT is one of three project 
	partners that developed the ROADS software. A Project Manager and a Technical 
	Officer were seconded by the ILRT to liase with the full-time Port Project 
	Manager at the NMM. This arrangement has worked extremely well and the 
	success of Port owes a great deal to this partnership. The Museum has 
	been fortunate to be able to draw on the ILRTís experience of working 
	on established gateways: both the social sciences information gateway, 
	SOSIG (<a href="http://www.sosig.ac.uk/">http://www.sosig.ac.uk</a>/), 
	and the business and economics gateway, Biz/ed (<a href="http://www.bized.ac.uk/">http://www.bized.ac.uk/</a>), 
	are based at the ILRT. Throughout the planning and development stage of 
	Port (July - November 1998), a number of face to face meetings took place 
	in Bristol and Greenwich. Generally, however, the Project Team communicated 
	via email. A timetable for website design and content development was 
	established to fit in with the launch date of Easter 1999. The most time-consuming 
	part of the project - inputting resources into the database ñ began in 
	November 1998. This process was assisted by the Museumís appointment of 
	a temporary Project Assistant. Also in November, work began on the look 
	and feel of the Port website which was designed with low resolution users 
	in mind. This part of the project was delayed in order to incorporate 
	the NMMís new corporate identity, a separate project linked to the Museumís 
	physical redevelopment programme. Between November 1998 and the end of 
	March 1999, materials were developed by the CMR for the events and research 
	sections of Port. Port was completed on schedule and was launched at Easter 
	1999, containing some 600 resources in the database. This figure has risen 
	to more than 1000 to date, with an average of 50 new resources being added 
	to the database every month.</span></p>

	Centre. </i></b></p>
      <p class="normal"><span class="normal">The password-protected ROADS Administration 
	Centre</span> gives the gateway maintainers control over the day-to-day 
	running of the gateway. It contains the tools needed to create and edit 
	templates, together with an automatic link checker, statistical counters, 
	record validators and online documentation. The tools all have a Web front 
	end and ñ from the point of view of the maintainer ñ consist of nothing 
	more complicated than Web forms. Templates are used to add records to 
	the database of Internet-based resources. They allow records to be entered 
	individually and carry out certain validation and indexing tasks. The 
	resource description (or metadata) format of the ROADS templates is based 
	on Internet Anonymous FTP Archive (IAFA) templates. ROADS templates are 
	defined for different resource-types, for example document (for cataloguing 
	a single piece of information such as, an electronic journal article) 
	and service (for collections of information, such as company websites). 
	The templates consist of simple attribute-value pairs displayed as a series 
	of text boxes. Administrative metadata (such as unique identifying number) 
	are assigned automatically by the software, whereas descriptive metadata 
	(such as the resource URL, title, description and keywords) is added by 
	the cataloguers. There are mandatory fields (such as title and description) 
	which must be completed for the template to be accepted into the database 
	and optional fields (such as administratorís email address and language 
	of the resource). These can be left empty but in practice are completed 
	as fully as possible. In order to create browseable listings for the end 
	user, each template requires the subject descriptor field to be used. 
	As no maritime-related subject-specific scheme exists, the Port subject 
	categories are based on the UDC (Universal Decimal Classification) scheme 
	used in the Museumís Caird Library. To ensure consistency, authority files 
	are used to select pre-set options for subject categories, geographical 
	coverage and historical period </p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">The software is highly configurable and 
	this flexibility meant that it was possible to tailor the software to 
	the Museumís requirements. For example, the standard ROADS configuration 
	files were altered to include the option to browse resources by historical 
	period and an ëemail template to administratorí option was enabled whereby 
	an off-site cataloguer can send work to the Project Manager to be checked 
	and activated. The Admin Only interface contains the tools used only by 
	the database administrator to edit these catalogued templates or remotely 
	update the content of Port web pages (for example, the events listings).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Since its launch, Port has seen 
	a steady increase in users: there were on average almost 7200 user sessions 
	per month between April 1999 and January 2000, with each user typically 
	spending 7 minutes on the site. Considerable emphasis has been placed 
	on promoting the service both electronically and by traditional paper-based 
	methods. The website was registered with the main search engines and metadata 
	included in all the pages on the Port site to facilitate its classification. 
	The site has been marketed through subject- and library-specific electronic 
	discussion lists. The aim is also for there to be a link to the Port site 
	from as many quality websites as possible. For example, the administrators 
	of all websites included in the Port catalogue are notified of their inclusion, 
	and a reciprocal link from their site is requested. At the launch, adverts 
	were placed in key maritime and information journals. Leaflets were produced, 
	together with posters and postcards incorporating the Museumís images. 
	These have been distributed widely - for example to maritime-related university 
	departments - and are available to on-site visitors. Opportunities to 
	demonstrate Port in person have also been taken, for example as part of 
	the Museumís established adult education programme. In May 1999, the Museumís 
	Press Office organised press releases together with a high profile launch 
	for Port and the Search Station. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">Port also has strong links with 
	another related online initiative - the Museumís recently launched Journal 
	for Maritime Research <a href="http://www.jmr.nmm.ac.uk/">(http://www.jmr.nmm.ac.uk/</a>) 
	(JMR). The JMR is the first fully refereed electronic journal for maritime 
	research. The journalís content includes substantial essays covering maritime 
	studies in the broadest sense, book reviews, a discussion forum and upcoming 
	conferences listed in Port. As a value-added feature for each journal 
	essay, related Internet resources and news items are identified and added 
	to the Port catalogue. The immediacy of these ready-made reference lists 
	provides readers with rich and timely content, impossible to replicate 
	in the printed form. </span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><span class="normal">The Port Project Manager actively 
	encourages feedback or suggestions and an online questionnaire to find 
	out more about users is planned for Spring 2000. Informal feedback suggests 
	that the speed and ease of use of the Port catalogue and the quality of 
	the related services are greatly appreciated. Port helps promote the Museumís 
	online activities, raising awareness of maritime-related networked information 
	and promoting the use of the Internet to complement existing research 
	methods. Ongoing work to both the catalogue and the website will ensure 
	that the best quality resources in the NMMís subject area are accessible, 
	steering people away from the &#34;reefs and detached rocks&#34; often 
	found on the Internet.</span></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><b class="heading">Conclusions</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY" class="normal">As we have shown in this paper, the Search 
	Station and Port substantially augment the Museumís Web-based collections 
	databases. The two projects combine multimedia and cutting edge technology 
	with well-prepared, well-managed content for a global audience. They highlight 
	what can be achieved through careful planning with limited resources and 
	in collaboration with software developers. The NMM has fully embraced 
	its responsibility in the emerging digital world with these innovative 
	projects. The Museum seeks to engage people with its unique collections, 
	provide access and interpretation of them for enjoyment and learning and 
	enable two-way communication and participation between the Museum and 
	its audience. These flagship projects have established the CMR as a centre 
	for excellence in ëNetí<i>-</i>worked maritime-related information, and 
	this supports its mission to encourage collection-led maritime research 
	and promote the Museum as a centre of study for schools and colleges, 
	academics and lifelong learners. </p>
