      <p class="author"><b>Guido Lütsch, MoneyMuseum, </b>Germany</p>
      <p align="CENTER" class="heading">Abstract</p>
      <p align="CENTER"></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="small">The MoneyMuseum is probably the world&#39;s biggest virtual 
          museum of money. Over 1,000 HTML-pages bring you all &#34;you ever wanted 
          to know about money&#34;. For numismatists and &#34;money-specialists&#34; a database 
          is currently under construction. After the opening on April 29th, 1999 
          the virtual MoneyMuseum was visited by more than 500,000 within the 
          first 6 months. This was an incredible success for a single museum and 
          could only take place on the internet. </p>
        <p class="small">We&#39;d like to present how the MoneyMuseum was built in 
          just a few months from primary idea to the opening event. Furthermore, 
          we&#39;d like to present the marketing-concept and explain why we were successful 
          in attracting more than 500,000 visitors within the first 6 months. 
        </p>

      <p class="heading"><b>Conclusions</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">How to Get More Than 500,000 Visitors in 6 Months:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">The subject must interest a wide audience. For 
          instance money in the MoneyMuseum.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">The overall concept must be simple. For instance: 
          the 9-room concept of the MoneyMuseum.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">The design must be intuitively comprehensible. 
          For instance: the navigation-style of the MoneyMuseum.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Information should be exciting, witty and informative 
          at the same time. For instance: the first story of the MoneyMuseum.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Interactivity should be integrated. For instance: 
          the questionaire in the MoneyMuseum.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Good PR and media activities. For instance: the 
          opening event of the MoneyMuseum.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">The Internet pages must be permanently updated 
          and expanded. The visitor wants to experience something new every time 
          he visits, but at the same time trusts to find again that which he already 
          knows. </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Connect virtual information with real events. 
          For instance: the slide show of the Moneymuseum in the Landesmuseum, 
          Zurich and real events.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="heading">Vision</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Conzett: Founder and Director of the MoneyMuseum</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In 1997, Dr. Jürg (pronounced Yorg) Conzett, 
        came up with the idea to have a special place where people could come 
        to in order to think about the meaning of money and itís affect on society. 
        This special place should allow food for thought and produce critical 
        discussions on the subject. The target group should be the &#34;intellectually 
        curious.&#34; Dr. Conzett, a financial consultant, has had many opportunities 
        in his life to observe people in their behavior when handling finances 
        and is therefore in the forefront when it comes to knowing the trials 
        and temptations of money.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Coming from a long line of book publishers, Dr. 
        Conzett has been able to realize his discoveries and publicize his ideas. 
        Firstly, through a series of &#34;Money&#34; books he publishes, and 
        secondly through the production of the &#34;MoneyMuseum&#34; as a place 
        where all can seek knowledge on the subject and allowing for an open debate 
        on the theme.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>The Idea of a Virtual Museum</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">A medium was needed to reach the greatest number 
        of people with a MoneyMuseum. The first idea to work directly with a real 
        museum was rejected. The MoneyMuseum should also be fun and exciting and 
        allow the opportunity to be actively involved in whatís happening in the 
        museum. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The second idea was to produce the museum as a CD-ROM, 
        but the inflexibility and the difficulty in updating and revising the 
        museum spoke against this option.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">With itís amazingly development and speedy spread 
        around the world, the Internet proved to be the ideal platform. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">A virtual museum had itís many advantages:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Economical construction</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">The opportunity to revise quickly </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Low cost of maintenance</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">The endless opportunity to expand and upgrade</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">User-friendly through key word search </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Visitor-interactivity</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="heading"><b>Product</b></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>The Concept</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The basic concept: Each of the three floors are 
        divided into three further departments that open up into three other departments. 
        Therefore the &#34;9-Room-Concept.&#34;</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The first floor is divided into: </span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Making Money: This department is divided into 
          the three rooms &#34;Atelier, Workshop and Bank.&#34; It is here that 
          the visitor discovers all about the materials money is made of; the 
          design of money; how money is made and the theories of economics.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Loving Money: The three rooms &#34;Passion, 
          Temptation and Tradition&#34; are divided into the departments Thieves, 
          Counterfeiters and Money Fairy Tales. Playboys, millionaires and many 
          odd anecdotes are found in the department &#34;Loving Money.&#34;</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">Moving Money. The Rooms have the headings &#34;Market&#34;: 
          a place about financial trade with investment tips and a wishing well!; 
          the &#34;Cafe&#34;: a place to spend some time and listen to a radio 
          interview with the museum director or to fill out the questionnaire 
          &#34;Which Money Personality am I?.&#34; The &#34;Forum&#34; gives 
          every person the opportunity to find out the Museum Directorís 10 Secrets 
          to Wealth and the opportunity to share his opinion with the Director 
          via email. </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="normal">Basically the MoneyMuseum is targeted to the &#34;intellectually 
        curious&#34;. According to strength of knowledge and thirst for information 
        the museum visitor can choose between the following three floors: </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>First Floor</b></p>
      <p class="normal">The first floor covers general subjects. The goal of this 
        floor is to grab the interest and excite the general audience. Therefore, 
        language and presentation is kept simple. In an amusing and witty way 
        the visitor is presented with information and curiosities about money.</p>
      <p class="normal">The way how money is stolen, counterfeited and how it 
        is made is presented. In the Cafe the visitors can chat with other visitors, 
        find out what type of money personality they have and much more.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Second Floor</b></p>
      <p class="normal">The second floor deals with the many eras of civilization. 
        Divided into the subjects &#34;Antiquity, Middle Ages and Modern Age&#34;, 
        the visitors are presented with coins, information and maps of these eras. 
        Here one would find out, for example, about the Spanish Peso and how it 
        spread throughout the world as well as who the relevant personalities 
        in each era were. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Third Floor</b></p>
      <p class="normal">The third floor is for specialists. Coin collections and 
        those of famous collectors are presented. Numismatists and coin lovers 
        have the opportunity to present and trade their own coins.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Web Design</b></p>
      <p class="normal">It was purposefully kept in mind that the visitors should 
        be presented with a visit to a real museum and this is shown by its design. 
        An architecturally classic style was chosen for the building front. Three 
        different existing buildings lend their design to the building on the 
        home page. The drawings of people convey an busy picture and hence invite 
        the visitor to enter the museum. </p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Foyer</b></p>
      <p class="normal">The entrance hall or foyer has three stories. Directly 
        from this standpoint the visitor can enter all departments of the museum. 
        All departments and rooms are labeled. The foyer (as well as the first 
        page) takes its design from a real existing building. (Taken from Berlinís 
        Museum for Communication with which a close cooperation could be built.) 
        It was a coincidence that the Museum for Communication has exactly the 
        same concept that the MoneyMuseum has with its three stories divided into 
        three rooms each.</p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Navigation</b></p>
      <p class="normal">The navigation was kept as intuitive as possible. A stair-symbol 
        brings the visitor always back to the foyer. A large &#34;A&#34; brings 
        one to the glossary where 100 of the wittiest and most interesting money 
        items are explained. A click on the hourglass brings one to an overview 
        of the history of money. The question mark brings one to the help page 
        which explains the various functions of the MoneyMuseum. The &#34;Triangle&#34; 
        (one level/chapter up) brings the visitor one level back in the structural 
        design.</p>
      <p class="normal">On the second story weíve added three more buttons to 
        the usual navigation-symbols. These enable the visitor to move within 
        each era problem free.</p>

      <p class="heading"><b>Techniques Used</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The first floor was built with the programming language 
        HTML. In the meantime, as of February, 2000, the MoneyMuseum has grown 
        to over 1,000 HTML pages. Interactive pages are perlscript operated. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The second floor will be presented by databank. 
        The databank uses pictures and text to dynamically produce an internet 
        page. Animations are partly gif-animations and partly flash-animations. 
        Particularly the nightly Witching Hour was built entirely with Flash 4 
        and integrated with sound.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Marketing</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The success of the MoneyMuseum depends, according 
        to us, on many factors:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">The Subject: Money is a subject that interests 
          everybody.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">The Concept: It seems we were successful in interpreting 
          a simple but interesting idea.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">The Information: Thereís something for everybody. 
          Academic information as well as informational oddities are offered. 
          </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">The Design: The MoneyMuseum presents the impression 
          of being in a real existing museum. When one hears the word &#34;MoneyMuseum&#34; 
          one sees a real museum.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">The Wit: Not only the many oddities about money, 
          but also the presentation of various figures from the serious to the 
          jocular suits a mixture of various tastes. For example, the janitor 
          Krawuppke who greets the visitor on every &#34;page under construction&#34; 
          with a thick Berlin dialect has become a favorite amongst the MoneyMuseum 
          visitors. </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">And naturally, Marketing: With small but spectacular 
          events we were able to become one of the most regarded Museum Sites 
          in Europe in a matter of days.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="heading"><b>Introducing the MoneyMuseum to the Public</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">On the 29<sup>th</sup> of April, 1999 the MoneyMuseum 
        was presented to the public. It was important that this introduction take 
        place in a real location so that interpretation by the media, especially 
        television, could take place. At the same time a location had to be chosen 
        that didnít lead the public to think that a real existing museum was being 
        presented. We wanted to avoid that our future visitors would enter the 
        internet and search for an existing museum. Therefore, we rejected the 
        possibility of a real museum as the event location.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The Berlin Memorial Church was an ideal choice: 
        A worldwide well known building where no one would get the idea that this 
        is in fact a money museum, and therefore, the fact that the MoneyMuseum 
        only exists in the internet would be communicated.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">The MoneyMuseum presents itself as an old and honorable 
        building. Itís no wonder that ghosts spook the old building. In October 
        of 1999 ghosts were discovered for the first time around midnight by the 
        janitor Krawuppke. A speedy decision to take advantage of the opportunity 
        and present the &#34;cyber-ghosts&#34; to the public was made and since 
        the 27<sup>th</sup> of November, 1999 spirits spook the MoneyMuseum from 
        midnight to 1:00 am. (But of course these are middle European ghosts and 
        only show themselves at Central European Time. )</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Public Relations</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">For the opening, three different mailings of press 
        kits were done and the representatives of the press were invited to a 
        conference in the Memorial Church.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">In order to excite the press photographers and TV 
        crews to record the event, 18,000 MoneyMuseum &#34;bank notes&#34; were 
        printed and thrown into the public by two hired actors on stilts. These 
        notes would then be cashed in for real Deutsche marks directly on site. 
        At the same time a question and answer prize game-event pertaining to 
        the MoneyMuseum was shown on a huge video screen. Two winners would win 
        1,000. DM each.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">These measures lead to media-effective coverage. 
        The &#34;raining bank notes&#34; were in all daily newspapers and countless 
        television reports by the next day. This high regard of an opening event 
        has the result that the MoneyMuseum in the space of a few hours was respected 
        in the most relevant PR circles.</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Advertising</b></p>
      <p class="normal">Escorting the opening event advertisements were printed 
        in all the biggest computer and technical magazines in Germany. In all 
        100,000 DM flowed into the advertising budget. </p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Results: TV, Radio and Print</b></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Based on the described PR and marketing activities 
        the following results were reached:</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Print: In the period from the 29<sup>th</sup> of 
        April to July, 1999 a total of 132 newspaper reports were revealed. </span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Internet: A mention in the biggest newsgroups and 
        search engines.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">TV Reports: In the period of time between the 29<sup>th</sup> 
        of April and June, 1999 21 television reports were revealed.</span></p>
      <p><span class="normal">Radio: The manager and the director of the MoneyMuseum 
        were guests on countless talkshows. </span></p>
      <p class="heading"><b>Events</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="normal">The huge success of our opening event gave us 
          the assurance to regularly stage events. On the 27<sup>th</sup> of November, 
          1999 we started our &#34;Witching Hour&#34; with an appropriate contest. 
          </span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">In April, 2000 we await our 1,000,000th visitor 
          to the MoneyMuseum. This will be accompanied with a contest and big 
          event with press conference in the foyer of the MoneyMuseum, respectively 
          the Museum for Communication in Berlin.</span></li>
        <li><span class="normal">Our plan is a &#34;Long Night of the Museums&#34; 
          in which web-cams will be set up in various real museums where they 
          would be linked to each other by the internet in this night. Virtual 
          and real museums meet for the first time on the same platform in the 
          internet.</span></li>
