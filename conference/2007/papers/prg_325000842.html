				  <p class="abstractText">Waag Society and the Archive of the province of
				    Drenthe have developed <em>Operation Sigismund</em>. <em>Operation
				    Sigismund</em> is an experiential learning
				    environment: a magic realist representation of an archive, combining
				    game elements, narrative elements and learning goals in a clearly defined
				    physical space within the Archive’s building. The project brings
				    the archive to life for children in primary schools. The children get
				    pulled in by an exciting story and have to protect an important private
				    collection against all kinds of dangers –  like dampness,
				    fire, and ink corrosion – and solve the mystery of Sigismund. The
				    context, contents and rationale of the project are described.</p>

				  <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
				  <p>The diary of an 18<sup>th</sup> century Dutch aristocrat
				    by the name of Sigismund van Heiden Reinestein is the starting point
				    for the educational adventure in the basement of the monumental building
				    of the Archive of the province of Drenthe (in Dutch: <em>Drents Archief</em>). </p>
				  <p>The concept of an adventure game is used to create
				    an experiential learning environment in which the private records of
				    Sigismund are naturally embedded. Sigismund van Heiden Reinestein (1740 – 1806)
				    was chamberlain and confidant of William V, stadtholder of The Netherlands,
				    and as such in charge of managing the household of the prince. His archive
				    consists of thousands of unique personal and political records, government
				    documents and correspondence, all held by the Archive of the province
				    of Drenthe. </p>
				  <p>The diary of Sigismund,  presented to pupils
				    aged 10-12 at the start of the 1.5 hour adventure, suggests that he is
				    aware of the whereabouts of the lost seal of William V. The seal is important
				    because it functions as symbol of the authority of the prince. The seal
				    might have been entrusted to Sigismund in the dangerous times when William’s
				    reign was disputed by The Patriots (a political faction in
				    the Netherlands that
				    struggled for the removal of the corrupt Stadtholder regime and
				    its nepotistic way
				    of governing, eventually
				    leaving William V no choice but to flee the country).</p>
				  <p>In the adventure the pupils go on their own journey
				    to reconstruct 18th century life, including the actions of Sigismund,
				    and to locate the abandoned royal seal. </p>
				  <p>The adventure is a combination of computer-based
				    and physical interactions connecting pupils to their local heritage in
				    an exciting way. The solution to the mystery is to be found in Sigismund’s
				    records that they have to preserve and organize themselves in order to
				    be able to reconstruct Sigismund’s story. The pupils work in groups
				    of three on conservation activities such as the examination,
				    documentation, advice on treatment, and preventive care of these historic
				    records. </p>

				  <h1>2. A Playful Experience</h1>
				  <p class="BlockQuote">Play is a structuring activity, the activity out
				    of which understanding comes. Play is at one and the same time the location
				    where we question our structures of understanding and the location where
				    we develop them. (James S. Hans; quoted in <em>Rules of Play</em>)</p>
				  <p>In their projects, Waag Society researches the possibilities
				    of gaming and playful learning for education. Our main questions in this
				    area are: </p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>Is it possible to use simulations and &#39;serious
				      gaming&#39; to create authentic learning experiences? </li>
				    <li>In what way do virtual and physical gaming experiences
				      influence each other? </li>
				    <li>How can we combine the cognitive, affective,
				      kinetic, strategic and problem solving skills that are
				      addressed in a game environment in formal education? </li>
				    <li>What is the role of narrative in<span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;; "> </span>an
				      experiential learning environment?</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p>Though <em>Operation Sigismund</em> might
				      not instantly be regarded a game by most (computer/video) game enthusiasts,
				      as there is no adrenaline rush, no explicit game levels and no competitive
				      element, I will refer to game (related) research to describe the users’ experience,
				      bringing our design and development choices to the surface. Though
				      intrinsically connected, users’ experience is described from
				      three different viewpoints: the game experience, the narrative experience,
				      and the learning experience. In verbalizing these viewpoints, the book <em>Rules
				      of Play</em> by game experts Katie
				      Salen and Eric Zimmerman has been especially helpful.</p>
				  <h2>2.1 The Game Experience</h2>
				  <h3>2.1.1 A Magic Circle</h3>
				  <p>We have taken the basement rooms of the building
				    of the Archive of the province of Drenthe as a clearly defined physical
				    story space or games space in which the story develops. It is centered
				    on the figure of Sigismund, with the adventure adding to the experience
				    of the story.</p>
				  <p>The pupils’ game experience within <em>Operation
				      Sigismund</em> consists of:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>a theatrical setting;</li>
				    <li>a narrative steering the flow of the adventure;</li>
				    <li>an educational design underlying the actions
				      and assignments;</li>
				    <li>interaction with intelligent, tangible objects;</li>
				    <li>goal-oriented interaction;</li>
				    <li>a clear outcome.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p>This game space can be characterized as a magic
				    circle the pupils enter when descending into the basement, formally stepping
				    into the game, “temporarily enacting a world within the ordinary
				    world” (Klabbers, 2006). The term ‘magic circle’ is
				    used by Johan Huizinga (1951) to describe an ‘isolated’ setting,
				    an alternate reality, in which rituals and special rules apply to all
				    participants, whether they are witches or judges. Although the magic
				    circle is just one of the examples in Huizinga’s list of ‘playgrounds,’ the
				    term is used by authors Salen and Zimmerman as “shorthand for the
				    idea of a special place in time and space created by a game” (2004).</p>
				  <p>As all our participants are players and there is
				    no interference from an outside reality, a special place indeed is created:
				    literally by entering the basement, and metaphorically when encountering
				    the diary of Sigismund and the quest it symbolizes. </p>
				  <p>The fragment of the diary directs the pupils’ attention
				    instantly towards the quest, fostering an open or “lusory attitude” (Bernard
				    Suits, 1999; in <em>Rules of Play</em>)
				    towards playing the game. In addition, we have taken the rituals and
				    rules of the professional life of an archivist as the rules for our game.
				    The pupils do not consciously pretend to be archivists; they remain themselves.
				    Their task is to assist the Archive in categorizing, preserving and studying
				    the records, ultimately leading them to the treasure. </p>

				    of the Archive of the province Drenthe. Each of the 5 basement
				    rooms has its own identity. Here the pupils first see the diary fragment
				    that triggers the adventure and hear about the historic figure of Sigismund.</p>
				  <h3>2.1.2 Adventure Game</h3>
				  <p>In game research, the concept of adventure games
				    is mainly referred to as a genre of video and/or computer games typified
				    by exploration, puzzle solving, and interaction with game characters,
				    with a focus on narrative rather than reflex-based challenges. Though
				    some of these characteristics apply to Sigismund, here the adventure
				    is rolled out in the physical space, with a narrative structure that
				    gives the archive, its role and its collection a logical and appealing
				    context, thus creating stimulating ground for learning. Our challenge
				    here was to balance the game elements, the narrative experience and the
				    learning goals. </p>
				  <p>The driving element of our ‘game’ is
				    a treasure hunt or puzzle hunt. With Sigismund’s records, the pupils
				    hunt for clues related to the mystery. They have to work as true archivists
				    and discover the possibilities an archive offers to reconstruct exciting
				    stories of the past. </p>
				  <p>Salen and Zimmerman cite Bernard Suits who in his
				    book <em>Grasshopper: Games, Life and Utopia</em> defines
				    games as inherently inefficient: often there are more efficient ways
				    to achieve a goal. Why engage in an excruciating game of boxing when
				    you can also shoot someone if your goal is to make that someone stay
				    down for 10 seconds? In the case of <em>Operation Sigismund,</em> it
				    would have been an option to explain to the pupils more formally how
				    an archive works, but here the constructionist learning theories and
				    individual learning styles come into play, assuming that learning from
				    personal experience has more enduring learning outcomes. </p>
				  <h2>2.2 The Narrative Experience</h2>
				  <h3>2.2.1 Game as Drama</h3>
				  <p class="BlockQuote">“Within narrative we order and reorder the
				    givens of experience. We give experience a form and a meaning.”   (J.Hillis
				    Miller; quoted in <em>Rules of Play</em>)</p>
				  <p>Game designer LeBlanc uses eight categories of games
				    describing the kinds of experiential pleasure the players derive from
				    playing games, as a means to go beyond the concept of ‘fun’ (1999).
				    Though categories like <strong>Sensation </strong><span style="font-weight:normal; ">(games
				    as sense-pleasure), </span><strong>Fantasy</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> (game
				    as make-believe), and </span><strong>Narrative</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> (game
				    as drama) may overlap, the category Narrative</span><strong> </strong><span style="font-weight:normal; ">strongly
				    connects to <em>Operation Sigismund</em></span>. </p>
				  <p>The narrative experience starts when the pupils
				    enter the basement rooms and take in all the visual cues from the rooms.
				    The formal start of the 1.5 hour adventure for the pupils is a fragment
				    of the diary of Sigismund, suggesting that Sigismund was aware of the
				    whereabouts of the lost seal of William V. (Though some diaries of Sigismund
				    are available as part of the Archive’s collection, this particular
				    fragment was created by us to frame the narrative.)</p>
				  <p>The Archive’s educational staff explains to
				    the children where they are and introduces the pupils to their tasks
				    ahead. They function as external narrators – not being actors in
				    the story, but &#39;standing outside&#39; the story  – at the beginning
				    of the adventure and highlight the elements of the quest, creating an
				    atmosphere of suspense and urgency. </p>
				  <p>The narrative experience consists of:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>a narrative goal</li>
				    <li>a narrative object (Sigismund’s diary)</li>
				    <li>internal and external characters</li>
				    <li>suggested uncertainty of the outcome</li>
				    <li>a narrative space</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p>The adventure can be described as an embedded narrative
				    (LeBlanc, 1999) because Sigismund’s story is pre-generated narrative
				    content that exists prior to the players’ interaction with the
				    game (as opposed to emergent narratives that arise from the process of
				    playing; these are the players’ own stories). The narrative gives
				    reason to the players’ action and provides the major story arc
				    for the game. The adventure adds more layers to the pupils’ experience
				    of the story.</p>
				  <p>Because of the pre-generated narrative and the fact
				    that Operation Sigismund uses a more or less hierarchical educational
				    design in which the pupils knowledge and skills are gradually being built,
				    the linear structure became a given for the development of the adventure.
				    Still, where possible we have created some flexibility, using a content
				    management system that allows us to create different time-based sequences
				    of the assignments (in these sequences also, issues such as time-played
				    and time-left play a defining role as the adventure has to be finished
				    within 1.5 hours).</p>
				  <p>Along the way the children learn about the archive,
				    and about life in the 18th century, their own local history, and life
				    at the Dutch court. By interacting with the workstation computers and
				    physical objects in the basement rooms, the pupils are steered towards
				    the final clue, hidden in one of the archival records. </p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="vanDijk_fig9.jpg" alt="Fig 9: The final clue to the adventure is hidden in the encoded message." width="400" height="346"/></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 9: The final clue to the adventure is hidden
				    in the encoded message. The encoded message is historic,
				    but the meaning of it is unclear. We have used the idea of encoded messages,
				    which were common in the diplomatic communication in the 18<sup>th</sup> century,
				    to give closure to the narrative. </p>
				  <h3>2.2.2 Systems of Meaning</h3>
				  <p>As Salen and Zimmerman say, game play takes place
				    within a representational universe, filled with depictions of objects,
				    interactions and ideas out of which a player makes meaning. Author/ designer/
				    writer Brenda Laurel’s standpoint that the key to the success of
				    a dramatic representation is that all of the material used is drawn from
				    the circumscribed potential of the particular dramatic world (Laurel,
				    1993), is equally true for physical interfaces such as ours, not only
				    visually, but also dramaturgically.</p>
				  <p>Design-wise we borrow and sample heavily from Sigismund’s
				    portrait and his time. But we also incorporate the physical movements
				    and the routines within an archive into the physical space. The overall
				    atmosphere is magic realist. The basement rooms in which the learning
				    activities take place are a mix of high tech and 18th century salons,
				    as shown in the design illustrations in this document. </p>
				  <p>When first browsing through the records of Sigismund’s
				    archive, we, as adults with an active interest in history, were impressed
				    by the nature of the records in the archive and all the historic associations
				    they evoke, especially when we experienced the tactile quality of the
				    old materials (without the expected white protective gloves!). To our
				    surprise, the target group kids with whom we did our initial research
				    shared the same fascination while studying, for a serious amount of time,
				    what was for them an unreadable French record. They ‘felt’ the
				    importance of the documents. Based on these initial findings we decided
				    to stay as close to the historic feel and its narrative quality as possible,
				    rather than focusing on computer based gaming.</p>
				  <p>The basement rooms we have created are as follows.</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>The Reception room with seating for 24 pupils
				      (the average size of one local class) is where the adventure
				      starts. The fragment of the diary is displayed in the center of the
				      room. A selection of (facsimile) records from Sigismund’s personal
				      archive is presented to the pupils in leather saddle bags
				      and travel boxes, as though they have not been touched for ages;</li>
			        <li>Two Workstation rooms with in total eight workstations
			          is where the groups of pupils get their cues after logging
			          into the Digital Archivist system, and where the pupils
			          return to collect their materials. Though the Digital Archivist
			          is not visualized as a game character, the software engages in dialogue
			          with the pupils, functioning as core mechanic for the advancement
			          of the overall story;</li>
			        <li>The Scanner room is where the pupils can access
			          tools to help them in their archival tasks and in their
			          larger quest.</li>
			        <li>The Archival room is where the records need
			          to be placed, accurately catalogued, where the Cabinets
			          give feedback to the pupils, where the room’s temperature
			          and humidity conditions can be adjusted, and where the historic
			          stories from Sigismund can be heard.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p>The rooms suggest history, but all the interior
				    components are also objects for storage and <span style="color:black; ">organizing,
				    familiar to an archive. In line with the ability of children to make ‘something’ out
				    of ‘nothing’ we created a seemingly disorderly array of boxes
				    and crates (where stories and treasures may be kept) that with a little
				    imagination becomes an 18th century salon. </span>Within this magic circle,
				    special meanings accrue and cluster around objects and behavior. In effect,
				    a new reality is created, not only ‘defined by the rules of the
				    game and inhabited by its players’ (Salen, Zimmerman), but also
				    defined by the theatrical sphere. This new reality also allows us to
				    introduce ‘intelligent’ objects to the space.</p>

				  <h2>2.3. The Learning Experience</h2>
				  <h3>2.3.1 Augmented Space</h3>
				  <p class="BlockQuote">The phenomenon of play involves a paradox,
				    a condition in which something is both real and not real
				    at the same time. (Russian psychologist Levigotsky; citation
				    from Tony Graham, 1999)</p>
				  <p>Although games have been played in real-world spaces
				    for millennia, Lev Manovich states that people in the 1990s were more
				    fascinated by new virtual spaces made possible by computer technologies.
				    In his essay “The poetics of augmented space” (2002), he
				    suggests that the decade of the 2000s might be all about physical space
				    filled with electronic and visual information, as computers and network
				    technology more and more enter our physical spaces. Especially his definition
				    of <em>tangible interfaces</em> – treating
				    the whole physical space around the user as part of human-computer interface
				    (HCI) by employing physical objects as carriers of information – and <em>smart
				    objects</em> – object connected
				    to the net; objects that can sense their uses and display ‘smart’ behavior – seems
				    applicable to Operation Sigismund. The use of nearfield technology such
				    as RFID and iButtons in combination with network technology allows us
				    to create or suggest intelligence in doors, cabinets and electronic devices.
				    Though Manovich uses the definition of electronically augmented space
				    to connect (visualized) new and existing data spaces to physical space,
				    we use the augmented objects and interfaces to steer the pupils’ activities
				    and further empower the learning experience, placing the user <em>inside</em> the
				    experience.<span style="color:black; "> </span></p>
				  <p>The intelligent objects are:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>enhanced digital scanners that not only digitize
				      the archival records, but also help establish authenticity
				      of, age of, and damage to the records;</li>
				    <li>enhanced cabinets that help organize the archival
				      records by giving feedback on the records offered, but
				      also broadcast the content of (some of the) records through built-in
				      audio (audio scapes);</li>
				    <li>two electronic displays for conservational conditions
				      such as temperature and humidity in the archival room.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p>The objects and eight workstations (computers) are
				    connected in a local network. On the workstations the specifically developed ‘Digital
				    Archivist’ interface is installed. </p>

				  <h3>2.3.2 Educational Design</h3>
				  <p class="BlockQuote">‘Whether gamespace is more real or not than
				    some other world is not the question. That even in its unreality it may
				    have real effects on other worlds – is.’ (McKenzie Wark,
				    2006)</p>
				  <p>Although Wark in this quote from Gamer Theory is
				    referring to a different game space (simulation games such as the Sims,
				    2006) the point he is making is very valid for our project. Experiential
				    education (or ‘learning by doing’) is the process of actively
				    engaging students in an authentic experience that will have benefits
				    and consequences. Students make discoveries and experiment with knowledge
				    themselves instead of hearing or reading about the experiences of others.
				    Students also reflect on their experiences, thus developing new skills,
				    new attitudes, and new theories or ways of thinking (Kraft &amp; Sakofs,
				    1988). </p>
				  <p>As children can easily relate to modern technology,
				    the choice for a game-based educational learning experience
				    was easily made. We incorporated the formal learning goals of the primary
				    school into our educational design: learning goals such as letting children
				    experience an archive as containing intriguing stories rather
				    than ‘stuffy’ documents,
				    and further experiencing that these documents are worth preserving,
				    are a treasure in themselves. </p>
				  <p>The resulting educational design of Operation Sigismund
				    consists of:</p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>formal learning goals</li>
				    <li>educational content</li>
				    <li>assignments</li>

				  <p>To organize the educational content and assignments,
				    the Archival staff proposed  the Dimensions of Learning
				    model (Marzano, 1988). The Dimensions of Learning model encompasses
				    five critical components of learning:</p>
				  <ol>
				    <li>maintaining positive attitudes and perceptions</li>
				    <li>acquiring and integrating knowledge</li>
				    <li>extending and refining knowledge</li>
				    <li>using knowledge meaningfully</li>
				    <li>developing productive habits of mind</li>
			    </ol>
				  <p>We used the model to create a more or less hierarchical
				    working structure for the educational content and assignments. The assignments
				    vary from open questions and multiple choice questions to the performance
				    of physical tasks and creative assignments, in such a way that we first
				    facilitate the acquisition of contextual information, go on to build
				    and refine the pupils’ knowledge and skills, and then create opportunities
				    for them to apply their knowledge and skills (be it in the digital or
				    physical space). The relationship between the computer environment (Digital
				    Archivist), the intelligent objects, and the physical space lets the
				    pupils repeat certain actions in an alternate setting (applying a set
				    of skills, first, derived from a digital assignment, secondly, in the
				    physical space, and the other way around).</p>
				  <p>The educational design combined with the narrative
				    structure provides the learner with enough context to play the game.
				    And because the total experience affects the learner not just on a cognitive
				    level, appealing to more than one learning style, it can lead to better
				    retention (which should be further tested).</p>
				  <p>The assignments function as narrative descriptors,
				    identifying objects and events in the larger narrative, and following
				    the representational logic of the larger narrative. They could also be
				    described as narrative actions (Manovich, 2001) as they trigger the events
				    of the narrative. In the assignments, the children take on the role of
				    deputy archivists, in both computer-based and physical actions, mimicking
				    the rules and routines of the Archive. The pupils work in groups of three
				    to facilitate understanding and dialogue among them, but also to give
				    them the possibility to naturally take on different roles within their
				    group.</p>
				  <p>Some of the digital assignments can be described
				    as embedded games, such as a memory-game-inspired setting in which the
				    pupils have to match damaged archival records and their probable causes.
				    Another example is a creative assignment that lets the pupils create
				    their own computerized design of William V’s seal, based on the
				    information they have acquired so far on the theme of seals and what
				    they represent. </p>
				  <p>“It’s natural for players to reconstruct
				    a story from a game play experience, but it is not inevitable, nor is
				    the story the game” (Costikyan, 1999; quoted in <em>Rules of Play)</em>,
				    but for the educational experience, the retelling and sharing of the
				    game experience is critical. For this purpose we have created two moments,
				    one at the end of the game (after the pupils have located the hidden
				    seal), the other afterwards, back at school where the pupils discuss
				    amongst themselves what they have experienced and what they have learned
				    from it. In addition the pupils take home their own (printed) Operation
				    Sigismund Certificate as a basic record of their experience (with personalized
				    results of some of the creative assignments) ; the teacher can build
				    upon these in future lessons.</p>

				  <h1>3. User Participation</h1>
				  <p>As part of our working methodology, teachers and
				    pupils of local primary schools have participated in the project as a
				    development panel. Based on the personal preferences, needs, wishes and
				    feedback of these individuals, we engage in an iterative process of designing
				    concepts, mock ups, demos and, ultimately, tested prototypes. The designers’ intuition
				    and the users&#39; behavior here are in a constant dialogue. </p>
				  <p>The Operation Sigismund development panel has given
				    us feedback on mood boards, narrative scenarios, (interaction) design
				    sketches, exemplary assignments, and hard- and software mock-ups. They
				    even had to pretend walking through the basement rooms following chalked
				    outlines of the interior elements. Their feedback and enthusiasm is an
				    important factor in our development process, called ‘users-as-designers’. </p>
				  <p>Between February – April 2007, the schools
				    will participate in three sequential pilot settings where
				    we test the understanding, the logic and the timing of the
				    adventure. Based on their input, we will further optimize
				    the adventure for opening in May 2007. </p>

				  <h1>4. Partners</h1>
				  <p>Operation Sigismund is a project from the Drents
				    Archief in Assen (<a href="../http://www.drentsarchief.nl/" target="_blank">http://www.drentsarchief.nl</a>)
				    and Waag Society in Amsterdam (<a href="../http://www.waag.org/" target="_blank">http://www.waag.org</a>).
				    The project is supported financially by local and national funding organizations.
				    The educational aspect of the project is tested against a development
				    panel consisting of target group teachers and pupils.</p>
				  <p>Waag Society is an acknowledged Medialab where,
				    apart from R &amp; D, there is room for experiment with new technologies,
				    art and culture. Partners come from all parts of society: universities,
				    and also large companies take part in the design and development projects.</p>
				  <p>Waag Society and the Drents Archief believe that
				    new media for learning purposes mix well with the daily routine of young
				    people, as youth culture today is more and more dominated by (communications)
				    technology and high tech applications – such as mobile phones,
				    games and on-line chats. An experiential learning environment should
				    incorporate youth culture and let pupils play, communicate, create, cooperate,
				    experience and learn, in ways that suit them, inside the classroom, out
				    on the street or in cultural institutions like archives and museums.</p>
