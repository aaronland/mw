        <p class="abstractText">This paper looks at the use of cell phones for
        tours of cultural sites in Europe. Although several projects have experimented
        with IVR, SMS and even multimedia tours on standard and next-generation
        networks, take-up of this platform by museums has remained low in comparison
        to US activity, despite cell phone usage being more wide-spread and longer-developed
        than in North America. Through case studies of recent phone tour projects
        at Tate Modern and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, we examine
        what the key differences and similarities are between phone-based tours
        on the two continents, and what each can learn from the other.</p>

    <h1>A Tale of Two Tours</h1>
    <p>Since the turn of this century, mobile phone use in
      Europe per capita has outstripped use in the US, with many western European
      countries having more cellular subscribers than citizens because people
      own more than one mobile phone (<a href="../http://www.c-i-a.com/pr0206.htm" target="_blank">http://www.c-i-a.com/pr0206.htm</a>).
      As a result, Europe has seen wide-spread experimentation with phone-based
      tours of cities and outdoor monuments, and today many mobile operators
      provide cultural information to tourists at a four-digit phone number.
      Meanwhile, in the United States, over 100 museums have found that the cell
      phone reduces infrastructure and staffing costs for the audio tour, making
      it possible to provide tours for exhibitions that previously would not
      have been able to afford them. The cell phone tour in the US is usually
      provided ‘free’ to end users: the museum pays for the infrastructure
      costs so that visitors need only spend the ‘minutes’ that also
      come free with their phone contracts. Yet given the prevalence of the cell
      phone in Europe for nearly a decade, and positive responses from museums
      and visitors alike to the platform in the US, why have there been almost
      no mobile phone tours in European museums to date? </p>
    <p>There are several factors that have contributed to
      this slow take-up among European museums that have otherwise proven themselves
      leaders in the development of new tools for interpretation:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Many museums in Europe are housed in thick-walled,
        historic buildings where cell phone reception is poor, and the cost of
        adding internal repeaters to improve reception is prohibitive;</li>
      <li>With higher percentages of foreign visitors, European
        museums know that greater numbers of visitors could incur high roaming
        fees to take a mobile phone tour;</li>
      <li>More Europeans have ‘pay-as-you-go’ plans
        instead of contracts for their mobile phones, leading to higher per-minute
        call costs, even for local and ‘free’ phone numbers (which
        nonetheless cost mobile phone users in the UK 10 pence per minute, for
        example); </li>
      <li>And finally, some museums simply stick by the
        traditional ban on mobile phone use in museums; others, in particular
        museums of modern and contemporary art, face concerns over copyright
        violations that can arise from people using the cameras on their phones
        to snap art in the galleries. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The mobile phone tour is not necessarily, then, the
      great democratic tool for reaching new audiences in Europe that it is heralded
      to be in the US. Jane Burton, Curator of Interpretation at Tate Modern,
      explained these reservations about the phone tour, despite its promise: </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">I was particularly interested in finding out whether
      it could reach new audiences who wouldn’t have considered taking
      a traditional audiotour. I suspected it might. The reason we’ve held
      off trialing a phone tour until now is the difficulty in telling people
      how much their call is going to cost – and with pay as you go and
      roaming charges, that could be a significant amount of money. </p>
    <p>In 2006 and 2007, Antenna Audio had the opportunity
      to test the reception of phone tours by US and European audiences through
      pilot projects with Tate Modern and the San Francisco Museum of Modern
      Art during the <em>Matthew Barney: DRAWING RESTRAINT</em> exhibition
      at San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMoMA), 23 June – 17 September
      2006, and the <em>David Smith: Sculptures</em> exhibition
      at Tate Modern, 11 November 2006 – 21 January 2007. Both these exhibitions
      and institutions attract audiences with similar interests in modern and
      contemporary art, so it was an unparalleled chance to measure how visitors
      use the phone tour in the two countries. </p>

    <p class="caption">Fig 1: Phone tour at Tate Modern’s David Smith:
      Sculptures exhibition</p>
    <p>Both tours were available through a local phone number
      on IVR-based platforms, meaning that from a technical point of view at
      least they were accessible to any generation of mobile phone the visitor
      might bring to the galleries. The Barney pilot at SFMoMA was produced in
      collaboration with US-based IVR provider, Guide By Cell, while Plum Networks
      provided the phone platform for Tate’s pilot. Both tours offered
      ten audio stops on the tour, produced by Antenna Audio in partnership with
      the museums. The aim of the Barney pilot, however, was to test visitor
      response to a range of interpretation tools, including brochures, wall
      graphics, kiosks and a multimedia ‘learning lounge’, as well
      as to the audio tour on a variety of platforms: cell phone (free except
      for roaming costs and ‘minutes’); Antenna Audio’s purpose-built
      X-plorer™ mp3 players (free with rental of the $3 permanent collection
      tour); and downloadable podcasts that the visitor could bring to the museum
      on their own MP3 player to get a $2 discount on admission. At Tate Modern,
      the audio tour of the exhibition was only available on visitors’ own
      mobile phones. </p>
    <p>The Barney pilot aimed at a pure technology comparison
      of the three audio tour platforms, so used the same content on all three
      platforms (the music was removed from the cell phone tour, however, because
      of the lower audio quality provided by phone handsets). Tate Modern, on
      the other hand, chose to experiment with content design for the mobile
      phone platform, anticipating that visitors would prefer shorter messages
      and a more casual approach to accessing information à la carte rather
      than the in-depth informational experience that is more typically designed
      for museum-specific stereo MP3 players. Jane Burton commented:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Knowing that people would be aware they were paying
      for each stop, I felt it important to take quite a different approach to
      content from the usual tour. We made no attempt to offer a comprehensive
      survey of the show; instead, we anticipated people dipping in and out,
      and produced a series of short, off-the-cuff conversations, each one self-sufficient
      and anecdotal – more in keeping with the notion of a friendly phone
      conversation than a scripted tour.</p>
    <p>In his paper on the project for Museums and the Web
      (2007), Peter Samis, Associate Curator, Interpretation, at SFMoMA and project
      leader for the Matthew Barney tour, confirmed that SFMoMA’s audiences
      used the cell phone tour in just this way: </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Cell phone users who had not planned to take a tour
      prior to arriving on the gallery level seemed to adopt an à la carte,
      or “cafeteria” approach to audio tour use. The tour was free,
      so they reached for their phones on demand. There was no compunction to
      take the whole tour.<span style="color:black; "> </span></p>
    <h1>Exhibition Audiences</h1>
    <p>The David Smith exhibition at Tate Modern was chosen
      in part for the expected similarity between its audiences and those of
      the Matthew Barney show at SFMoMA, to keep at least this variable constant
      in the study. In many respects this expectation was confirmed: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Both audiences were highly educated: 76.9% of
        Tate’s visitors and 81% of SFMoMA’s had at least a bachelor’s
        degree;<strong><u></u></strong></li>
      <li>Both audiences rated themselves as knowledgeable
        about modern art, giving themselves an average 4.4 out of 7 at Tate Modern,
        and 4.1 at SFMoMA;<strong><u></u></strong></li>
      <li>In both cases nearly half the visitors<strong> </strong><span style="font-weight:normal; ">came
        to see the exhibition: 44.3% for the David Smith show, and 45% for the
        Barney exhibition;<u></u></span></li>
      <li>Both shows were successes with their audiences, Barney
        drawing a mean 4.4 approval rating out of 7, and Smith 4.6 in evaluating
        the exhibitions as interesting, meaningful, and enjoyable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="proctor.fig2.jpg" alt="Fig 2: Phone tour at Tate Modern’s David Smith: Sculptures exhibition" width="400" height="266"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 2: Phone tour at Tate Modern’s David Smith:
      Sculptures exhibition</p>
    <p>Where there were differences between the cell phone
      user demographics at the two sites, they do not seem to have impacted the
      overall take-up rate of the cell phone tours: </p>
    <p>At Tate Modern, half the visitors were 46 and older,
      while half SFMoMA’s audience were under 35 years of age. This slightly
      older audience did not result in the Tate tour’s having any lower
      take-up rate than SFMoMA’s overall; however, we cannot predict how
      many more people would have taken the cell phone tour at SFMoMA if it had
      been the only audio tour on offer.<u></u></p>
    <p>The majority of visitors to the Smith exhibition had
      been to Tate Modern before (87.9%), compared to a more 50/50 split at SFMoMA
      between first-time and repeat visitors.We
      found that repeat visitors were more likely to take the cell phone tour
      than first-time visitors – nearly 93% of those who took the Smith
      cell phone tour had been to Tate Modern before. This resonates with Antenna
      Audio’s 2006 Global Visitor Survey, which indicates that the more
      visitors go to museums, the more likely they are to take audio tours in
      general.</p>
    <h1>Usage</h1>
    <p>To encourage visitors to view other non-commented
      works in the room before moving to the next audio stop, the Tate tour instructed
      visitors to hang up after each call and call back once in the next room.
      This led to Tate Modern’s visitors making on average 3.4 calls during
      their visit, compared to 2.4 for the Barney tour. </p>
    <p>Certain other of the statistics gathered on these
      pilot projects are reflective of audio tours in general, and are not specific
      to the cell phone platform. For example, not finding objects on the tour
      was a problem cited by visitors to both exhibitions. Tate’s visitors
      listened to fewer stops on the tour (on average 3.7 compared to and average
      of 4.6 at SFMoMA), and therefore slightly fewer minutes of the tour overall
      (average 7.94 versus 8.51 in the Barney show) since the Smith stops were
      shorter. There was only one object on the tour in each room, so visitors
      had to look harder to find the next stop on the tour, whereas the layout
      of the Barney exhibition gave the impression of greater density of audio
      commentaries. A higher percentage of commented objects naturally increases
      the probability that visitors will listen to more stops as objects catch
      their eye. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Also because of its linearity, the Smith tour witnessed
      a steady drop-off in numbers of visitors listening to the tour as they
      progressed through the galleries. This variance in take-up rate per stop
      was less visible in the Barney show whose design was more free-flow; however
      confusion over the order of stops was another problem visitors reported
      in taking the Barney tour. Some visitors prefer a linear guided experience
      as it is easier to follow without fear of ‘missing anything’.</p>
    <h1>Tour Marketing</h1>
    <p>There were significant differences in how the two
      tours were marketed. Both were promoted by giving away brightly-colored ‘bookmarks’ that
      listed the tour phone number and stop numbers. While these were distributed
      at several points around SFMoMA’s 4<sup>th</sup> floor, and the phone
      number for each stop was printed on the object label, at Tate Modern, visitors
      were given a bookmark (usually inside the exhibition brochure) as they
      entered the gallery. Object labels on the Tate tour included a telephone
      symbol with the stop number, but not the phone number, for aesthetic reasons.
      Both studies found that many people didn’t take an audio tour simply
      because they didn’t know it existed: 24.5% at Tate Modern, and nearly
      half (49%) at SFMoMA. At Tate, the bookmark was what prompted half of visitors
      to try the phone tour. Word of mouth, including promotion by the personnel
      at the gallery entrance, also played an important role in introducing visitors
      to the tour (25.1%), as did the phone symbol on the object label (24.6%).
      As for any tour on any platform, good marketing and visibility through
      a wide range of outlets is key to raising take-up rates. <span style="color:red; "> </span></p>

    <h1>Take-up Rates</h1>
    <p>Because of these differences in approach and in aims
      for the interpretation at the two shows, it is not possible to compare
      the Barney show results with Tate’s in every respect. Furthermore
      a quota system for collecting data from SFMoMA visitors meant that while
      we can compare user preferences among the audio tour offerings, it is not
      possible to make statistically reliable comparisons between the audio offerings
      and the other kinds of interpretation used. And finally, it was not possible
      to track the exact number of visitors to the exhibition at SFMoMA, so the
      take-up rate for the various tours is an estimate. </p>
    <p>Approximately 3.6% of visitors to the Barney exhibition
      took the cell phone tour, and 2.6% took the rented audio tour at a $3,
      which included the audio tour of the permanent collection. These are low
      take-up rates compared to most audio tour programs, but are typical of
      modern and contemporary art exhibitions. By its very nature, it is more
      difficult to measure exactly how many people who downloaded the podcast
      tour then used it to tour the exhibition, but we estimate that in total,
      approximately 8% of visitors to Barney took an audio tour on one of the
      three platforms. Almost uncannily, Tate Modern’s take-up rate for
      the cell phone tour was the same as SFMoMA’s – 3.6% – but
      this is a percentage of all audio tours taken in the exhibition. We can
      only speculate as to what the cell phone tour take-up rate would have been
      at SFMoMA if that had been the only audio tour option available. Nonetheless,
      SFMoMA’s experience indicates that the more ways the audio tour is
      available, the more people will take it. In today’s culture of highly
      flexible and personalized media consumption, there simply is no one size
      that fits all.</p>
    <p>As expected, Tate Modern had nearly twice as many
      foreign visitors to its exhibition (6.1%) as SFMoMA (3.3%) had. While the
      vast majority of visitors to the exhibition owned a mobile phone (94.8%),
      a relatively high percentage of visitors had ‘pay as you go’ (PAYG)
      plans (38.7%). It is not surprising, then, that 23.2% of visitors to Tate
      Modern’s show said they did not take the cell phone tour because
      of fears of the hidden costs of taking a cell phone tour in minutes and
      roaming charges. Among those who did not take the Tate cell phone tour,
      over half (<span style="color:black; ">52.6%) were on PAYG plans. </span>In
      general, then, <span style="color:black; ">we should probably expect lower
      take-up of cell phone tours in Europe compared to the US because of the
      lower proportion of users with contracts that include cheaper or free minutes.</span></p>
    <p>The big question, of course, is whether the cell phone
      reaches audiences that would never normally take an audio tour. It is possible
      to ask this question of the Tate data, with the following conclusions. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The majority of visitors who had never taken an
        audio tour before were young, almost 59% below the age of 36 (closer
        to the Barney audience demographic);</li>
      <li>Having taken their first audio tour on a cell
        phone, 63.3% said they would take an audio tour of the permanent collection
        at Tate Modern if it were offered on cell phones.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a particularly good result given that 22.6%
      of these non-audio-tour-takers were also foreign, so presumably would be
      facing higher call charges than locals. Nonetheless, 80.6% of these visitors
      had contracts rather than the higher per-minute cost ‘pay-as-you-go’ plans.</p>
    <p>There are therefore strong indications, backed up
      by other studies, including Antenna Audio’s 2006 visitor survey,
      that the cell phone platform could be a good way to attract new audiences
      to the museum’s interpretation program. A note of optimistic caution
      is in order, however: in previous studies gauging visitor receptiveness
      to new tour technologies in museums, audiences have consistently predicted
      a higher take-up rate than has in fact materialized. In other words, just
      because visitors say they will try a new tour, does not mean they will
      in the numbers that they self-report.</p>
    <h1>Tour Preference</h1>
    <p>The Smith exhibition tour had two distinct audiences:
      those whose primary aim in taking the tour was to learn more about Smith
      and his works (66.1%), and those who tried the tour out of curiosity (53.6%).
      Of those whose main motivation in taking the tour was learning, more said
      they preferred the traditional audio tour platform over cell phone delivery
      (46.8%; 18.1% of this group preferred the cell tour, while 35% had no preference).
      This feedback suggests that the dedicated MP3 technology is more suited
      to an in-depth, educational audio tour experience. Among those who took
      the tour out of curiosity about the new tour technology, there was no clear
      winner among the platforms: 32.4% preferred the audio guide handset, 31%
      preferred the mobile phone tour, and 36% had no preference.</p>
    <p>Overall, only 22.8% of Tate Modern visitors reported
      that they would have preferred the cell phone tour if given a choice. At
      SFMoMA, 52% of audio tour-takers preferred the phone-based tour to the
      rented tour device. It would be useful to understand here how much the
      $3 rental fee impacted this perception, if at all. Unfortunately we don’t
      have enough data from both sites to ascertain if this difference is also
      down to the slightly older demographic at Tate, or the probably higher
      number of visitors with ‘pay-as-you-go’ plans at Tate that
      would make taking a longer audio tour a more expensive option. Nonetheless,
      as Peter Samis observed, “Across the board, familiarity and comfort
      with the device and being able to access information as needed are common
      themes. But different age groups are “familiar and comfortable” with
      different devices!” (Samis 2007).</p>
    <p>The younger-skewing visitor demographic at SFMoMA
      gave the cell phone and podcast tours higher marks (6.2 out of 7) than
      the rented audio tour (5.6 out of 7); however, more visitors thought the ‘traditional’ audio
      guide would be easier to use in the museum:</p>

    <p>The Smith exhibition tour had two distinct audiences:
      those whose primary aim was to learn more about Smith and his works (66.1%),
      and those who tried the tour out of curiosity (53.6%). This prompts the
      question of whether usage will taper off as the novelty of cell phone tours
      wanes, or whether on the contrary an increase in comfort with using the
      cell phone platform in the museum will see it rise. The one appetite that
      is likely to remain constant is the demand for variety: the enduring lesson
      of the evaluation of the many tools on offer for the Matthew Barney show
      is that the more options available, the more likely visitors are to avail
      themselves of interpretation, and therefore the more likely they are to
      leave with a greater appreciation for, understanding of, and sense of connection
      with the exhibition. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">As at SFMoMA, few visitors to Tate Modern had trouble
      using the cell phone. Where there were complaints (26.1%), they were mainly
      about the technology platform itself: audio quality (31%), problems with
      connecting to the network (30.9%), and tiredness from holding the phone
      (16.7%). A significant percentage (31%) of visitors also had problems following
      instructions for using the tour. Nonetheless, the majority of the respondents
      were willing to use their cell phones for a tour of the entire museum (58.1%)
      and found the shorter length of the messages just right for the phone platform
      (73.1%). </p>
    <h1>Conclusions</h1>
    <p>Although there are some important differences in user
      demographics between the British and American audiences, the overall take-up
      rate for the two phone-based audio tours was comparable, and visitors reported
      similar levels of satisfaction with the phone tour. Most importantly, Tate
      Modern’s experience demonstrated that the new mobile phone platform
      can induce people who have never done so before to take audio tours, and
      that as a result of their experience, they are most likely to take another
      one.</p>
    <p>However, these pilots indicate that there are more
      concerns among European museums’ audiences about cell phone tour
      costs than there are in the US, where they are perceived as cheap or free
      if there is no charge other than minute costs. Internationally, the business
      model for cell phone tours remains a challenge, as long as the value chain
      is mediated by mobile network providers. Will cell phone tours remain an
      overhead for museums, dependent on sponsorship and grants for funding,
      or can they be at once affordable for a significant population of visitors
      and revenue-generating for museums along the lines of traditional audio
      tour rentals? </p>
    <p>In addition, the museum cannot assume that every visitor
      will own or want to use a cell phone or any other personal digital device,
      so we are unlikely to see an immediate end to older platforms that are
      already familiar and easy for the majority of museum visitors to use. The
      wider the variety of interpretation tools on offer, the more likely the
      museum is to reach a wide range of visitors. In today’s information
      economy, customization is king.</p>
