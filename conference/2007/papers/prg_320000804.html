        podcasting may be ideally suited for teaching and studying visual art.
        In museums or school classrooms, on-site or on-line, image-enhanced podcasting
        expands options for those with visual, audial, and kinesthetic learning
        styles. The iPod’s appeal to young audiences also favors its use
        in the art museum, where youth are typically underrepresented. This paper
        reviews the use of podcasting using video iPods during the National Gallery’s
        2006 Teacher Institute, <em>Dutch Art in the Golden Age</em>.
        Participating teachers  – most of whom had no experience with the device
         – created short podcasts on a Dutch painting of their choice after a
        four-day immersion experience in more traditional art historical subjects.
        The program goals, instructional design, preliminary findings, and next
        steps are summarized by the two staff members primarily responsible for
        its conception and planning.</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Each summer the National Gallery of Art offers a six-day
      professional development seminar for teachers. Taught by staff and outside
      specialists in art and education, the Teacher Institute provides information
      about art in its cultural context and models techniques for incorporating
      art across the K-12 curriculum. </p>
    <p>The 2006 Teacher Institute focused on Dutch art of
      the seventeenth century, a period when the Netherlands enjoyed a ‘Golden
      Age’ of economic success, world power, and prolific artistic production.
      Paintings were considered within the broader context of seventeenth-century
      Dutch life; this made the program particularly appropriate for teachers
      of history and social studies as well as studio art and art history. During
      the last two days of the program, teachers explored ways to integrate art
      into classroom studies by creating podcasts about art.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Note: While the term podcasting denotes
        a subscription-based, serialized system for downloading and playing digitized
        files, the use of the term in this paper refers to the creation of a
        single, image-enhanced audio file that could be serialized as one within
        a series. A better term might be “artcasting” (Samis &amp; Pau,
        2006).</p>
    <h1>The 2006 Teacher Institute</h1>
    <h1>Rationale</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Students
        live in a mobile, multimedia, digital world; surveys suggest that 60%
        or more use MP3 players. </li>
      <li>Podcasting
        expands options for visually, musically, and kinesthetically oriented
        students (Howard Gardner’s multiple intelligences).</li>
      <li>As
        a user-driven activity, podcasting favors constructivist, or learner-centered,
        education.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Goals of the Institute</h1>
    <p>The goals of the program were to</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explore
        new digital technologies suited for studying and teaching art by creating
        a podcast about art;</li>
      <li>Enhance
        teachers’ skills and comfort levels using new digital technologies
        and, indirectly, help participants meet new National Technology Standards;</li>
      <li>Provide
        participants with podcasts of selected staff tours and gallery talks,
        providing them with audio-visual resources they can take back to the
        classroom.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Earlier Programs</h2>
    <p>Since 2001, the Teacher Institute has incorporated
      digital media as a teaching tool. This follows on school mandates to increase
      teachers’ technology skills and on recognition overall of the educational
      potential of digital media in K-12 education. In the 2001 and 2002 Institutes,
      teachers designed interactive lesson plans using objects from the Gallery’s
      permanent collections, some of which are now available through the museum’s
      Web site (http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom). From 2003 through 2005,
      teachers explored storytelling in visual art and then created their own
      digital stories about art objects of their choice using Apple iMovie software.
      These programs were all framed according to constructivist, or learner-centered,
      philosophies and charged teachers with tailoring their own approaches to
      teaching with the museum’s collections (Springer, et. al., 2004).</p>
    <h2>The iPod</h2>
    <p>With the October 2005 advent of Apple’s video
      iPod, the stage was set to take the best aspects of digital storytelling
      about art into the more ambulatory realm of the museum’s galleries.
      When used in tandem with the Belkin TuneTalk Stereo, which plugs into the
      base of the iPod and allows it to function as a portable recording device,
      teachers were able to capture their immediate responses to an object while
      standing directly in front it. Stronger, more persuasive podcasts resulted
      from teachers’ ability to produce them at the source of inspiration
       – the artwork itself.</p>
    <p>One of the drawbacks of earlier digital storytelling
      programs was that teachers were too often tied to a desk-bound computer.
      The iPod allowed teachers to do a little more of their work in the galleries,
      face-to-face with the artwork and its attendant sensory qualities. Nonetheless,
      many aspects of the original do not translate to digital or other forms
      of reproduction, including the physical scale of the object, the tactile
      qualities of paint on canvas, and  – in the case of Dutch art especially
       – the gem-like radiance of oil applied in translucent glazes. Thus, in
      its best applications, the imaging capability of the video iPod <em>complements</em> the
      viewing experience, without competing with the original object.</p>
    <h1>Instructional Design</h1>
    <p>From the outset, teachers participating in the 2006
      Institute were encouraged to be thinking about objects for their podcast
      as they studied the Gallery’s permanent collections. Most program
      participants had viewed in advance examples of image-enhanced podcasts
      available on the password-protected Web site established to help prepare
      them for their week in Washington, DC. They were provided with brief guidelines
      for making an effective podcast (see Appendix), and those who wanted more
      structure could follow an outlined approach to the project as detailed
      below.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote"><em>What’s Dutch about Dutch Art?</em></p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Select a painting that
        speaks powerfully to you about seventeenth-century Dutch culture. In
        what ways does this object relate to something significant you have learned
        this week?  How might
      it stand as a visible embodiment of Dutch culture? (Your response might
      be to style, subject, and how that subject is interpreted).</p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Begin your podcast by
        writing a script (for voice-over narration) in which you analyze the
        object and argue your points. Be sure to defend your rationale by referring
        to the objects’ visual
      evidence. Have fun!</p>
    <p>On the third day of the Institute, teachers were given
      an overview of podcasting through an hour-long PowerPoint presentation
      aimed at helping them circumvent the mistakes commonly made by beginners,
      such as speaking too formally and didactically (Samis &amp; Pau), or not
      clearly identifying the intended audience. As youth have led both production
      and dissemination of the podcast medium, exemplary and innovative student
      podcasts were screened in order to demonstrate the iPod’s potential
      in the classroom. Many program participants were unfamiliar with podcasting,
      and only a handful of the younger teachers reported already owning and
      using an MP3 player. To maximize time and facilitate learning, the iPods
      were issued early in the week so teachers could familiarize themselves
      with the user interface at their leisure. Additionally, the iPods were
      loaded with short podcasts about art to introduce a few models and give
      teachers some ideas for creating their own.</p>
    <p>Having thereby mastered the mechanics, they were ready
      to focus on production issues when they reached that portion of the Institute
      on day four. The next day  – the first of two full days devoted to podcasting
       – the group worked with writing and technology coaches. Since there were
      only enough computers to accommodate half the group at a time, the group
      was split in two. While half wrote their scripts for the voice-over narration,
      the others learned GarageBand. The third and last day of podcasting saw
      a flurry of activity – selecting and formatting pictures, recording scripts,
      and mixing audio with imagery  – as teachers pushed to finish before the filmfest when
      individual products were shared with the group. From the outset, teachers
      were asked to limit themselves to objects in the Gallery’s permanent
      collection, and if desiring a soundtrack, to use GarageBand ‘jingles’ or
      other copyright-free music. </p>
    <p>To make the most of their podcasts, many teachers
      worked on them well into the last evening (in fact, up to the last minute),
      revising and fine-tuning their narratives. Some doggedly pursued a particular
      image or piece of music. Others revisited art historical sources, checking
      and rechecking their facts. The high standards they set for themselves
      and their level of engagement suggests that the task was both challenging
      and genuinely meaningful. This is every educator’s wish fulfilled,
      or in K-12 parlance, an occasion for “authentic” learning. </p>
    <h1>Exemplary Podcasts</h1>
    <p>The same high level of personal engagement characterized
      the best podcasts. The most compelling were those that revealed a powerfully
      felt connection to the objects chosen. The process of interpreting the
      picture in historical context was often the occasion for self-reflection,
      and the choice of image came from a strong sense of identification with
      the subject. Studio art teacher Melissa Carl was drawn to the self-portrait
      of Judith Leyster (see Fig.1), as were several women in the group who chose
      it for their podcasts. Leyster’s early success, later eclipsed by
      motherhood and the career of her spouse Jan Miense Molenaer, struck many
      as paradigmatic of issues women still face. Moreover, the youthful self-portrait
      has a spontaneity and charm as the elaborately dressed artist turns from
      her easel, smiling, lips parted, as if on the verge of speaking. The immediacy
      of the work inspired Carl to write her narrative as an imaginary dialogue
      with the artist, an approach that made the painting come alive, while making
      it more accessible to her students. </p>
    <p>Carl’s podcast also demonstrates many of the
      qualities emphasized in the tutorial. Her voiceover narration is spontaneous
      and conversational. She adeptly melds creative interpretation with factual
      information. She refers to the visual evidence of the painting without
      sounding officious or didactic. Her podcast engages and enchants adult
      and youth alike  – while providing enough substantive content to qualify
      as a digital lesson for her students. </p>

    <p class="caption">Fig 1:
        Judith Leyster’s <em>Self-portrait</em> was
        a popular podcast subject among women <br/>
      (c. 1630, oil on canvas, National
      Gallery of Art, Washington, <br/>
      Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Woods Bliss,
      29 3/8 x 25 5/8 in.).</p>
    <p>Humanities teacher Mary Marshall produced an unusually
      ambitious and insightful overview of Dutch painting, noting its wealth
      of subject matter and the multiple levels of meaning informing seemingly
      ordinary scenes. At a crossroads in her own life, she was particularly
      struck by a Vermeer (Fig. 2) that spoke to her not only of seventeenth-century
      Dutch culture, but also of issues she personally grappled with:</p>
    <blockquote class="BlockQuoteAuthor">
      <p>Even the most casual observer of seventeenth century
        Dutch art will notice that it offers us a vast array of subjects, and takes
        these on in a variety of ways. From portrait art and still life to historical
        and genre painting, the Dutch artist sets out life as he or she knows it,
        or perhaps imagines it, and invites us, the viewers, to make something
        of it.</p>
      <p>What are we to make of this world? Is man really the
        measure of all things, as an enlightened Renaissance thinker would have
        us believe? Or is there more to it? Is there something to be said for
        taking one’s own measure and finding oneself lacking? Are all things
        under the sun vanity and foolishness, as Solomon the Wise asserts? Or
        should one gather her rosebuds where she may?</p>
      <p>Vermeer’s <em>Woman Holding a Balance</em> suggests
        that the choices one makes in life matter  – and matter greatly. The painting
        hanging behind the woman alludes to Christ’s Last Judgment, and
        reminds the Christian faithful that he or she will help Christ judge
        the living and the dead, as written in first Corinthians. But interestingly
        enough, the woman is not yet weighing or judging anything. Instead, she
        seems to be contemplating the very idea. Both the scale and her face
        are bathed in light, suggesting that the moment is important. She is
        reflective and thoughtful  – contemplating weighty matters of the soul,  perhaps
        taking her own measure before she actually weighs the material object
        . . ..</p>

    <h1>Preliminary Findings </h1>
    <p>The following observations will help us fine-tune
      the next program.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Participants experienced a steep technology learning
        curve, but deemed the process and end product satisfying. </em>We
        knew from past experience that the technology portion of the program
        was going to raise anxieties for many teachers. Few reported having previous
        experience using an iPod or other MP3 player. Also, many of the teachers
        attending were at mid-career and beyond  – fourteen years being the average
        number in the profession  – thus less fluent using digital technologies
        than their younger peers. Program evaluations nevertheless revealed that
        the process, although stressful for some, was perceived by most as valuable
        and  – dare we say it?   – fun. This was particularly important to
        National Gallery staff who felt it crucial that the experience be positive,
        particularly since few teachers would be able to turn around and use
        the tutorial in the classroom due to the expense of the equipment. Staff
        wanted to offer teachers some creative playtime, and in the process help
        them appreciate the educational potential of creating a podcast. One
        elementary art teacher thanked us for dragging him “kicking and
        screaming into the twenty-first century.” Another, teaching gifted
        and talented, K-5, noted: </li>
      </ul>
    <blockquote class="BlockQuoteAuthor">
      <p>The process
        of creating a podcast about art was eye-opening and mind expanding. The
        level of dissonance was just enough  – uncomfortable enough to provide
        a stretch  – satisfying enough to make me want to do more. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Staff needed more equipment available to participants. </em>In
        this tight, two-day timeframe, staff and participants would have benefited
        from a one-computer, one-person ratio, instead of having two individuals
        share a computer on alternate schedules. Even nine technology coaches
         – roughly one for every three people  – were not enough to compensate
        for too few computers. Those waiting for a computer experienced frustration,
        and valuable program time was wasted.</li>
      <li><em>Participants preferred printed resources over
        digital instructional aids. </em>Most
        teachers preferred written guidelines for the project to digital ones.
        Despite the introductory PowerPoint presentation and Web resources they
        had access to before the program, the desire for written guidelines was
        expressed with enough frequency that for the second session of the Institute,
        Gallery staff drafted hard-copy guidelines that addressed the most frequent
        problems teachers had with their podcasts. Many teachers also believed
        that having a print <strong>how-to</strong> manual would have
        helped them. While this request was considered, staff ultimately decided
        this would, in fact, slow the process; therefore we continued the approach
        of  pairing instructional podcasts with live coaching. </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Next Steps, And Implications
        For Learning</h1>
    <p>In 2007, the program on Dutch art will be repeated
      and will incorporate improvements based on feedback and observations from
      2006. With the help of Randi Korn &amp; Associates, program evaluation
      will aim to discover what, if any, aspects of the Institute teachers have
      adopted for classroom use. Using a combination of participant questionnaires,
      direct observation, and follow-up interviews, we hope to determine whether
      teachers attending in 2006 and 2007 are any more comfortable with digital
      media, understand the potential for podcasting in the classroom, and have
      been able to actually use, or adapt, the model presented to them during
      the Institute.</p>
    <h2>Podcasting Supports Learner-Centered
        Education</h2>
    <p>Based on these experiences, Institute staff are convinced
      that podcasting has great potential in learner-centered education. As with
      digital storytelling, it is a process that requires individuals to chart
      their own voyage of discovery, establishing their desired destination and
      determining the best strategies to get there. When pursuing topics of genuine
      interest, participants are much more inclined to be engaged, resourceful,
      and creative. They can work at their own level and pace, while instructors
      must differentiate among student needs and abilities, and individualize
      their coaching accordingly. Staff have found that podcasting students -
      adult as well as school-age  – typically impose standards of quality for
      their work that are far higher than those of the instructors. They willingly
      record and re-record their voices to get just the right intonation, or
      repeatedly edit sequences of image and audio, working well beyond the time
      assigned. Because podcasting integrates a wide range of tasks, it allows
      teachers to address multiple learning styles within a single project. Because
      it can draw on a wide range of academic subjects and skills, it has great
      cross-curricular potential. Because it affords students a fair degree of
      autonomy and creative control, it has the potential to engage them in ways
      many traditional school projects do not.</p>
    <h2>Other Cognitive Benefits?</h2>
    <p>There may be more substantive cognitive benefits to
      image-enhanced podcasting as well. Paul
      Messaris (2001), of the Annenberg School for Communication, has
      found that active engagement in making visual media  – not merely consuming
      it  – is critical to building visual literacy skills. While it is possible
      to view imagery and not comprehend it,
      the task of structuring meaningful sequences of imagery builds skill in
      the conventions of visual communication. He argues further that visual
      literacy skills can carry over into other areas of cognition, specifically
      citing film and image editing as enhancing students’ spatial intelligence
      and aptitudes for analogical thinking  – skills critical to advanced studies
      like algebra, calculus, and physics. His findings reinforce Howard Gardner’s
      well-known theories on multiple intelligences, and suggest that the process
      of podcasting with images may prove to be a very useful pedagogical tool.</p>

        Teacher Institute  2006 <br/>
      Guidelines for Creating
      a Podcast</h1>
    <h1>Key idea</h1>
    <p>Focus on developing one key idea, and keep it simple.
      (You have 2-5 minutes). Pick one object, or use a couple, but use them
      toward a single theme. </p>
    <h1>Identify your audience  </h1>
    <p>Who is the audience for your podcast? Your students?
      Your peers? Yourself? Your personal response to a work  – its power, significance
      for you  – may be the most evocative and compelling for your audience.</p>
    <h1>Voice</h1>
    <p>Keep your tone conversational and personal. Avoid
      the didactic, or omniscient voice of authority. Here is what one Institute
      participant noted about voice, while making some other valid points about
      the potential of podcasting:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">The
        podcasts that were that were the most effective (I felt) had a conversational
        quality that, for me, communicated volumes about what the speaker knows
        about the art, and how they <u>feel</u> about art. What’s the point
        of a podcast, after all  – isn’t it to teach how to talk about art,
        how to think, and how to look at art? I mean, we’d like to make
        the art come alive, so it isn’t relegated to some distant period
        . . . . the podcast has the potential to bring the past into the present.</p>
    <h1>Make it visual</h1>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Help
        your audience <em>see what you see</em> in
        the object. Avoid lecturing or talking about things external to the image
        itself. Exploit what the medium offers: the <em>visual</em> and <em>auditory</em>. </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Example:
        The Museum of Modern Art’s short podcast about Matisse’s <em>The
        Piano Lesson</em> is
        an excellent example of a podcast that illuminates what one sees. In
        less than three minutes the listener/viewer understands how the design
        choices Matisse made actually shape the meaning, or content, of the image.</p>
