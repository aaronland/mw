				  <h1>1. Introduction </h1>
				  <p>Museums have been exploring the use of multi-user
				    virtual environments (MUVEs) for more than a decade, often in the form
				    of proprietary, non-persistent virtual worlds designed and developed
				    for select audiences such as teachers and students. Since launching in
				    2003, the on-line virtual community of Second Life (<a href="../http://www.secondlife.com/" target="_blank">http://www.secondlife.com/</a>)
				    has attracted over 900,000 dedicated ‘residents’ who are
				    laying the foundations for widespread adoption of MUVEs by museums, libraries,
				    archives, and other information organizations.</p>
				  <p>Already there is a range of museum-like activities
				    occurring in Second Life (SL).<em>  </em>There
				    are many parallels with the early development of the Web, including how
				    resident-developed museum spaces currently outnumber those created by
				    real-life museums (see Taylor, 1995). These experiments in a new medium
				    can tell us a lot about what ‘real-life’ museums should consider,
				    as well as how we might want to inform and re-merge with our physical
				    resources. SL museums can be about historical re-enactment, such as dressing
				    up and walking around Ancient Rome with other residents acting in character – a
				    variant on real life (RL) re-enactments. There are SL museums containing
				    digitized RL artifacts. There are other collections of &#39;born digital&#39;
				    artifacts created in SL that are collected, curated and preserved by
				    in-world museums. There are outdoor sculpture parks, places that are
				    more like art galleries, and venues to support Warhol-like art happenings.
				    There are labels, lectures, tours, audio guides, docents, even museum
				    shops. Some of the museums created in Second Life are now seeking affiliations
				    with real-life artists, or museums, and others are actively establishing
				    themselves as 501(c)3 non-profit organizations.</p>
				  <p>This paper presents a selection of the results from
				    our work that attempts to understand the nature, diversity and evolution
				    of current museum and museum-like activities in Second Life<em>. </em>Drawing
				    on the experience and lessons learned from past museum virtual environments,
				    non-museum collaborative spaces, and recent research on learning in multiplayer
				    on-line games, this research can serve as a guide for museums interested
				    in establishing a virtual presence in Second Life.<strong></strong></p>
				  <h2>2. Literature Review: What is Second Life?</h2>
				  <p>In many ways, the growth of MUVEs mirrors the growth
				    of the Web, as new functionalities and technologies transition from small
				    scale prototypes constructed by researchers at great expense to large
				    scale, rapidly growing mainstream products available to the general public.
				    These products are not only used by many people, but they are also co-created
				    by them. With the Web, this was a matter of using hypertext to create
				    Web sites, initially derived from various genres of print media, and
				    soon evolving their own genres. In the case of Second Life<em>,</em> users
				    can create 3D artifacts, buildings, and social spaces where people interact.
				    The social nature of Second Life is a critical component of understanding
				    what it is and how it can, and should, be used.</p>
				  <h2>2.1 Between First Life and Second Life: MUDs, MOOs and VRML</h2>
				  <p>While the scale of Second Life is unlike what has
				    come before, the idea of a persistent world that offers users the opportunity
				    for engagement and a role in creating the world with which they interact
				    is not new. In 1978, Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle, students at Essex
				    University, created the first multi-user dungeon (MUD) as a game that
				    allowed multiple players to engage in Dungeons &amp; Dragons-like adventures.
				    In addition to being multi-player, MUDs were also persistent – when
				    a user logged off, the world did not go away; it continued to exist ready
				    for players to enter. MUD users often found the social aspects of MUDs
				    the most important aspect of their engagement, leading to more socially
				    oriented MUDs. In 1989, the MOO (MUD, Object Oriented) was developed
				    to allow participants to create and modify places within a MUD space,
				    enabling the development of various social and educational MOOs (Bartle
				    1999; Castronova, 2006).</p>
				  <p>While the development of 3D rendering technologies
				    such as Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) paralleled MOO development,
				    it lacked the capability to create multi-user environments (Durbridge,
				    2004).  In the place of multi-user VMRL, companies such as Blaxxun
				    (<a href="../http://www.blaxxun.com/" target="_blank">http://www.blaxxun.com</a>) and ActiveWorlds (<a href="../http://www.blaxxun.com/" target="_blank">http://www.activeworlds.com</a>)
				    created persistent multi-user environments, worlds that offered many
				    of the affordances that social MOOs had offered, only in 3D. Limitations
				    of available bandwidth, lack of active development, and ultimately the
				    collapse of dot com funding prevented these early worlds from having
				    more than limited success. At the same time, graphic role playing games,
				    the successors to original text-based MUDs, were migrating on-line. RPGs
				    initially offered the ability to connect via local area networks, migrating
				    to full on-line-based networks in 1997 with the launch of Ultima Online.
				    Participation in massively multi-player on-line games (MMOGs) grew rapidly
				    as domestic access to broadband increased, and by mid-2006 exceeded 13
				    million subscriptions to various MMOG environments (Castranova, 2006;
				    <a href="../http://www.mmogchart.com/" target="_blank">http://www.mmogchart.com</a>). </p>
				  <p>Although Second Life represents only a small percentage
				    of the total number of participants in MMOGs worldwide, it is the largest
				    and fastest growing of the new generation of persistent MUVEs. There
				    (<a href="../http://www.there.com/" target="_blank">http://www.there.com</a>) offers similar features, but unlike Second Life
				    moderates user activities to allow only ‘PG-13’ content.
				    Linden Labs created TeenSecond Life
				    (<a href="../http://teen.secondlife.com/" target="_blank">http://teen.secondlife.com</a>) that requires adults aged 18 and over to
				    complete a background check before they enter. Multiverse (<a href="../http://www.multiverse.net/" target="_blank">http://www.multiverse.net</a>)
				    is creating an open platform for the development of both MUVEs and MMOGs
				    through a common set of standards and clients. A consortium of academic
				    institutions is developing the Croquet project (<a href="../http://www.opencroquet.org/" target="_blank">http://www.opencroquet.org</a>)
				    as an open-source environment for building collaborative virtual learning
				    environments. Lastly, the Acceleration Studies Foundation has established
				    a Metaverse Roadmap Project (<a href="../http://www.metaverseroadmap.org/" target="_blank">http://www.metaverseroadmap.org</a>) to forecast
				    and shape the development of the new 3D Web. </p>
				  <h2>2.2 Museums and Collaborative Virtual Environments</h2>
				  <p>In the early 1990s several MOOseums were constructed,
				    and museums were early adoptors of VRML for display of 3D artifacts (Corcoran,
				    2002; Fernandes, 1998). Museums also explored emerging 3D multi-user
				    environments such as Blaxxun and ActiveWorlds, although museums have
				    mainly favored custom developed non-persistent environments under their
				    control (Barbierie, 2001; Di Blas, 2005, 2006; Lucey-Roper, 2006). Many
				    of these virtual environments were developed with museum education and
				    K-12 students as their primary audiences, placing the emphasis on traditional
				    learning activities and pedagogy (e.g. Economou et al. 1999). These experiments
				    stressed the need for carefully structured and controlled activities
				    in order to make MUVEs successful as educational tools (Di Blas, 2003).
				    Museums have also been concerned about accurate representations of their
				    collections, sites or spaces in virtual worlds (Johnson, 2005; Tolva,
				    2005). However, a very different focus is needed if the goal of a MUVE
				    is social interaction and not authentic modeling of virtual artifacts
				    (Di Blas, 2003; 2005). </p>
				  <h2>2.3 Second Life as a ‘Third Place’ for Serious Leisure</h2>
				  <p>Second Life presents some challenges for the traditional
				    museum model of working with virtual environments. The residents in SL
				    (and TeenSecond Life, There, etc.)
				    are independent actors within the world. Like the real-world environment,
				    SL residents also have many choices for engagement, learning, and fun.
				    At present, little hard evidence is available about how residents spend
				    their time in-world (data we are accustomed to seeing in Web server logs
				    are still scarce in SL). Some thought is needed about how to evaluate
				    museum activities in SL. </p>
				  <p>Past evaluations of MUVEs have drawn from the literature
				    of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and studies
				    of on-line virtual learning. Recent research involving MMOGs
				    (Castranova, 2006; Dieterle &amp; Clarke, 2006; Ducheneaut, 2005; Steinkuehler,
				    2004; Yee, 2006) suggest that such a clear separation between
				    work, learning and play may not always apply to multi-user
				    virtual environments in which participants invest a great
				    deal of ‘work’ in
				    return for tangible or pleasurable benefits. These studies
				    also suggest that instead of creating alienated individuals,
				    MMOGs create vibrant communities that can serve as ‘third places’ for
				    social interaction (Steinkuehler &amp; Williams, 2006).  </p>
				  <p>Fortunately, museums are not unfamiliar with adults
				    who engage in challenging tasks that provide them personal rewards. Volunteers
				    provide an important supplement to museum professional activities, even
				    though they are not officially employees or students of the museum; “Volunteers
				    are...involved participants rather than consumers” (Orr, 2006;
				    Stebbins, 1992). For them, the museum may often function as their ‘third
				    place’ where serious leisure pursuits can take place. If it is
				    possible to connect ‘third places’ and serious leisure activities
				    in both virtual worlds and museums, this might suggest a course of action
				    for the creation of virtual museum spaces that engage adults interested
				    in serious leisure. If museums can engage SL residents as individuals
				    interested in serious leisure with whom they can collaborate, rather
				    than treating them as consumers, museums may help establish new uses
				    for platforms such as SL. </p>

				  <h1>3. Methodology</h1>
				  <p>Our research began by trying to create a list of all
				    museums or galleries currently available in Second Life. This delightfully
				    difficult task was made all the harder not only by the frequency with
				    which new museums are added to SL, but also by the number of real-life
				    museums or related organizations exploring the potential of SL by developing
				    private museums not open to the public. Eventually, we decided that the
				    best approach was to conduct a straightforward search, using SL&#39;s in-world
				    search engine, for all locations self-identifying as either a &#34;museum&#34; (43
				    locations) or a &#34;gallery&#34; (102 locations). By combining the
				    results of this search with on-line lists of favorite museums and galleries
				    in SL – some publicly available, such as in Wikipedia, and some
				    not, e.g. SL note cards passed around to residents in-world – we
				    produced a list of more than 150 museums.</p>
				  <p>We next visited each of these museums ‘in person’,
				    touring the entire installation as best as we could, and making notes
				    about the nature of the museum, the type of exhibits displayed, and the
				    special features available for visitors. Resources and descriptions about
				    these museums available on the open Internet were also consulted to round
				    out the available data for the researchers. Based on these observations,
				    and drawing upon existing approaches for describing virtual spaces (Castronova,
				    2006), we developed an extensive list of characteristics about museums
				    in SL, and then used a qualitative analysis process of coding and memoing
				    (Straus &amp; Corbin, 1998) to create a conceptual framework for classifying
				    and characterizing SL museums (see below). </p>
				  <p>Based on this framework, we identified several exemplars
				    of museums in SL for further analysis and study (see below
				    for descriptions of these exemplars). Informal interviews
				    were conducted with selected developers of these museums using Second
				    Life Instant Messaging sessions. (Further details of our ongoing research
				    are available at <a href="../http://www.isrl.uiuc.edu/~rjurban/" target="_blank">http://www.isrl.uiuc.edu/~rjurban/</a>.) </p>
				  <h1>4. Characteristics of Museums in Second Life</h1>
				  <p>This section presents nine characteristics that we
				    believe are helpful in discussing and comparing the variety of different
				    museums and museum-like places in Second Life. The characteristics are
				    illustrated by particular SL museums that are discussed in more detail
				    in section 5.</p>
				  <h2>4.1 Scale</h2>
				  <p>Museums in SL vary tremendously in terms of size and
				    scale, ranging from single installations to extended complexes
				    where exhibits are arranged over an entire island (such as
				    the International Spaceflight Museum). While the majority
				    of museums in SL maintain an RL metaphor by displaying artifacts on walls
				    or in cases in rooms, there is no explicit need to do so. In a world
				    where the sun always shines, there is no reason not to display artifacts
				    in the open air or even floating in mid-air. Since SL avatars are able
				    to fly, museums in SL can take innovative approaches to displaying artifacts
				    that maximize vertical space as well as horizontal. With
				    no need to worry about artifact theft or deterioration over
				    time, developers of museums in SL may choose to display their collections
				    in vast open spaces rather than forcing visitors to move from room to
				    room in a single building. Not only does this openness enable more visitors
				    to observe exhibits simultaneously, but it also cuts down dramatically
				    on the feelings of claustrophobia users often feel in MUVEs, especially
				    when moving around in small spaces. </p>
				  <h2>4.2 Setting</h2>
				  <p>Just as in RL, how a museum chooses to display its
				    collections matters tremendously in SL. Exhibits may be displayed in
				    one or two small buildings, one very large building, or in the open air,
				    and the setting where visitors encounter the museum’s exhibits
				    matters as much as the exhibits themselves. The developers of some SL
				    museums, such as the Second Louvre Museum, work very hard to create a
				    setting that duplicates, at least partially, an RL museum or location.
				    Such an approach, however, raises the question of whether the setting
				    is more important than the artifacts contained therein, or even whether
				    the setting itself is on display rather than the artifacts. So as not
				    to detract from the displayed collections, some museums, particularly
				    galleries of born digital art, present their exhibits on relatively blank
				    walls in relatively undecorated spaces. However, other museums seem inspired
				    by a 19th century exhibit mentality, displaying large walls covered with
				    a multitude of paintings as far as the eye can see. </p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="urban_fig02.jpg" alt="Fig 2:  WPA Poster Exhibition at Artsplace" width="400" height="237"/></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 2:  WPA Poster Exhibition at Artsplace</p>
				  <h2>4.3 Persistence and Evolution</h2>
				  <p>While not uncommon to MUVEs, the fact that all locations
				    in SL are persistent can be challenging for first-time visitors to SL
				    museums. Individuals more used to playing computer games, where each
				    time they return to a game they can pick up where they left off, may
				    find it confusing to have a virtual world that persists and evolves even
				    when they are not present. When visitors return to a previously visited
				    museum in SL, they may find the museum completely different. Even visitors
				    accustomed to RL museums’ changing collections and rotating galleries
				    may be unnerved by the way virtual buildings can so easily change their
				    shape or size from one visit to the next. To address this, some SL museums
				    developers maintain a distinction between permanent and temporary galleries. </p>
				  <h2>4.4 Media Richness</h2>
				  <p>Even within an intensely graphic 3D environment such
				    as SL, there can be great differences between museums as to how they
				    employ multimedia and other media rich technologies. When interacting
				    in MUVEs, the fact that one is constantly working within an extremely
				    rich media environment leads visitors to consider that environment as
				    the norm, thus making examples of multimedia applications <em>within</em> the
				    multimedia environment stand out. For instance, visitors to the Sci-Fi
				    Museum can visit a “Star Trek Holodeck,” selecting from a
				    menu of possible objects and then entering the Holodeck to view the object
				    they ‘created’. Other examples of media richness in SL museums
				    include live video feeds from outside sources such as NASA TV shown in
				    the International Spaceflight Museum, live Flickr streams shown in SL
				    art galleries, and 3D representations of live weather data, courtesy
				    of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), displayed
				    in the Science Center on Info Island II. Given the nature of the available
				    technology, the concept of media richness takes on all new meanings for
				    on-line museum visitors and raises visitor expectations when visiting
				    museums in SL. </p>
				  <h2>4.5 Visitor Engagement</h2>
				  <p>Like museums in RL, successful museums in SL try to
				    encourage visitors to return again and again. Opportunities such as special
				    events, lecture series, group activities, and so on allow for community
				    building among visitors and encourage them to feel integral to the museum
				    itself. The International Spaceflight Museum, for instance, has a regular
				    lecture series covering topics ranging from the space shuttles to the
				    Mars missions. Presentations are extremely well-attended and well-publicized
				    in-world and in RL. Special events and similar activities can be powerful
				    tools for building a strong community of regular visitors who feel intimately
				    involved in the museum’s activities. It is important for developers
				    of museums in SL to find some way of drawing visitors into the museum
				    experience and building a community of the museum’s many virtual
				    visitors.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="urban_fig03.jpg" alt="Fig 3:  Blasting off at the International Spaceflight Museum" width="412" height="252"/></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 3:  Blasting off at the International Spaceflight
				    Museum</p>
				  <h2>4.6 Social Interaction</h2>
				  <p>In order to take advantage of the multi-user aspects
				    of MUVEs, many SL museums offer visitors opportunities for social interaction,
				    providing areas to congregate such as cafes, places to exchange memorabilia
				    such as gift shops, settings for special events such as conference rooms,
				    etc. The mere fact that someone might visit a gift shop in an SL museum,
				    and purchase a t-shirt for their avatar to wear around a virtual world,
				    thereby advertising the fact that they visited a virtual museum, is a
				    good indicator of how strongly visitors value these opportunities for
				    social interaction. Visiting a museum in SL, interacting with other individuals
				    with similar interests (individuals who in RL may be located anywhere
				    in the world), and discussing the museum’s artifacts and collections
				    in real time can be a powerful incentive for encouraging museum visits.
				    When developing museums in MUVEs such as SL, it is important to provide
				    suitable opportunities for social interaction among visitors. </p>
				  <h2>4.7 Intended Purpose</h2>
				  <p>The majority of museums in SL fall on a continuum
				    somewhere between existing primarily to display artifacts (e.g. virtual
				    galleries such as the Bayside Beach Galleria) and existing primarily
				    to display a space or environment (e.g. replicas of historical settings
				    such as Paris 1900). For developers of SL museums, the museum’s
				    intended purpose influences numerous choices, such as the arrangement
				    of gallery space for tours and teaching purposes. Museums designed for
				    the explicit purpose of displaying a historical location face particular
				    challenges, as it can be difficult to recreate an entire location exactly,
				    given the technological limitations of building in <em>SL</em>.
				    Replicated environments such as Paris 1900 or Casablanca must therefore
				    focus on extracting key elements from the RL location and then re-positioning
				    them in SL to convey the look and feel of the original without necessarily
				    creating an exact copy. Recreated historical settings also face difficulties
				    if they wish to use non-player characters to add realism, and may enforce
				    certain rules (e.g. flying is not allowed in Paris 1900) to keep visitors
				    from performing in ways that violate the spirit of the exhibit. </p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="urban_fig04.jpg" alt="Fig 4: Exhibit on Malay culture at the Fort Malaya Museum" width="400" height="237"/></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig 4: Exhibit on Malay culture at the Fort Malaya
				    Museum</p>
				  <h2>4.8 Collection Types</h2>
				  <p>While everything in SL is digital by necessity, SL
				    museums display digital representations of many different types of objects,
				    from classic works of art to the latest scientific models, in both permanent
				    and temporary exhibits (there is even a History of Second Life Museum
				    in SL). Built-in multimedia technologies provide opportunities for displaying
				    unique types of collections that may be physically impossible to display
				    in RL museums. The International Spaceflight Museum, for example, offers
				    a solar system simulation where visitors can stand in the middle of a
				    model of the solar system, calibrate it to any date in history, and watch
				    the planets revolve around them. Museums in SL can offer unique experiences
				    that would be prohibitively expensive in RL museums, allowing visitors
				    to find out what it would be like to be caught in a tsunami (at NOAA’s
				    Meteroa Island), take a rocket ship ride into space (courtesy of the
				    International Spaceflight Museum), or parachute from the top of the Eiffel
				    Tower (in Paris 1900). </p>
				  <h2>4.9 Target Audiences</h2>
				  <p>Identifying and targeting specific audiences in SL
				    can be challenging. Not only is access to SL limited to people over the
				    age of eighteen (there is a teen version of Second Life, however), but
				    also the nature of interacting with individuals in SL, combined with
				    the typical SL citizens’ reluctance to give out information about
				    their RL identities, makes it very difficult for museum professionals
				    to administer surveys or conduct needs assessments in SL (and indeed
				    raises the question of whether one should collect data on visitors’ first
				    or second lives). Beyond counting the number of visitors who come through
				    the door and encouraging visitors to leave comments in a guestbook, there
				    is little at this point that museum professionals can do to learn more
				    about their visitors in SL. As more museums experiment with developing
				    exhibits and identity in SL, it will likely be necessary for museum professionals
				    to work with the developers of SL (Linden Labs) on improving mechanisms
				    for learning more about their target audiences.</p>
				  <h1>5. Exemplars of Museums in Second Life</h1>
				  <p>This section presents several exemplars of museums
				    in Second Life specifically chosen to illustrate the range of possibilities
				    inherent in the above conceptual framework. Selecting these museums for
				    discussion does not necessarily mean they are the best possible museums
				    in Second Life, but only that they are illustrative of the diversity
				    of content and experience that can be created. </p>
				  <h2>5.1 International Spaceflight Museum (Spaceport Alpha 48, 78, 24)</h2>
				  <p>The International Spaceflight Museum is an example
				    of a large-scale SL museum with many opportunities for social interaction.
				    The museum’s exhibits include a replica of the lunar landing module,
				    photo galleries, and a large ring circling the island on which a series
				    of rockets and other spaceflight vehicles are displayed. The rocket ring,
				    which is simply breath-taking in its scale and scope, is the centerpiece
				    of the museum; as visitors walk around the ring from rocket to rocket,
				    they have the opportunity to witness firsthand the evolution of space
				    exploration technology. In addition, there are numerous examples of rich
				    media and interactivity, including a solar system simulator, a planetarium,
				    and a rocket ride into space. At the end of the ride, visitors can teleport
				    from planet to planet to observe models of the various spacecraft that
				    visited each planet (including a special field trip to the surface of
				    Mars). The museum also offers a number of opportunities for social interaction,
				    including a large open-air auditorium for lectures and presentations,
				    small conference areas, and plenty of places for groups to gather and
				    discuss the museum’s exhibits. The combination of detailed exhibits,
				    elaborate multimedia displays, and frequent opportunities for interaction
				    has contributed to the museum’s success at building a community
				    of regular museum visitors. </p>

				  <p class="caption">Fig 5: International Spaceflight Museum</p>
				  <h2>5.2 Second Louvre Museum (Tompson 153, 97, 100)</h2>
				  <p>The Second Louvre Museum is an example of a traditional
				    museum installation displaying both classic and modern works of art in
				    a setting specifically designed to replicate a wing of the Louvre Museum
				    in Paris. The exterior of the museum is exquisitely detailed, with colonnades,
				    statues, fountains, and other features carefully designed and developed
				    to evoke the grandiloquence one feels when standing in front of the Louvre
				    in RL. Inside, the museum is divided into different galleries, and the
				    artifacts on display often cover the walls vertically as well as horizontally,
				    thereby requiring visitors to fly up to the ceiling to get a good look
				    at the works of art. While the historically accurate yet closed-in design
				    of the museum can make it hard to navigate in large groups, the structure
				    does a fabulous job of replicating the sense of visiting a grand European
				    art museum. Like many other museums in SL, the Second Louvre Museum does
				    not provide much, if any, descriptive information about the artifacts
				    on display. The museum seems to concentrate more on presenting works
				    in an evocative, artistic setting than on educating the visitors about
				    the artifacts and images on display. </p>

				  <h2>5.3 Sci-Fi Museum (Indigo 75, 213, 22)</h2>
				  <p>The Sci-Fi Museum is an example of an interactive
				    museum using rich multimedia technologies as part of its displays. The
				    museum’s exhibits focus on science fiction in TV and movies, including
				    a sizeable collection of TV show posters and a movie theater that shows
				    a regular rotation of science fiction films. Floating above the museum
				    are replicas of the USS Defiant and a Klingon Bird of Prey (Star Trek
				    spaceships) which visitors can explore in detail by using a Star Trek-style
				    transporter that teleports them to and from the ships. One particularly
				    engaging exhibit is a multimedia simulation that allows visitors to select
				    from a number of preset displays (including such Sci-Fi staples as a
				    Star Wars Tie Fighter, a Dalek from Dr. Who, and H.G. Wells’ Time
				    Machine). The selection is then displayed in a room designed to look
				    like a Star Trek Holodeck. In a fascinating example of the problems that
				    can occur when working in MUVEs, the Holodeck simulator warns visitors, “Please
				    do not sit on the holographic exhibits or you will end up underground
				    when they dematerialize.” Museums in SL similar to the Sci-Fi Museum
				    include the Star Trek Museum, the Science Center, and the Computer History
				    Museum (which features a slightly aggressive and somewhat insistent robot
				    docent </p>
				  <h2>5.4 Bayside Beach Galleria Museum of Contemporary Art (Flyingroc Chung
				    109, 118, 22)</h2>
				  <p>The Bayside Beach Galleria Museum of Contemporary
				    Art is an example of a museum designed with an explicit focus on displaying
				    works of art in a neutral setting with few instances of media richness
				    or social interaction to get in the way of enjoying the art (one notable
				    exception being the museum’s location only a few steps away from
				    a nude beach). The museum comprises a series of interconnected rooms
				    where rotating collections of contemporary art are displayed on maintly
				    blank walls. Like many other art galleries in SL, the museum exists in
				    the middle of an extremely busy neighborhood, with plenty of excitement
				    to distract visitors after they leave the museum. The museum seems to
				    exist on the virtual equivalent of the Las Vegas Strip, and is surrounded
				    by, among other things, a castle, a windmill, and numerous rotating spotlights.
				    These issues illustrate the problem of building museums or galleries
				    on non-private land where developers cannot control what other people
				    build around them; designers who wish total control over their museums
				    will need to purchase their own, private island. Museums in SL similar
				    to the Bayside Beach Galleria include Artsplace, the Crescent Moon Museum,
				    and the Bolinas Museum of Art (which also exists in an extremely busy
				    and distracting neighborhood, surrounded by neon signs). </p>
				  <h2>5.5 Paris 1900 (Paris 1900 9, 174, 16)</h2>
				  <p>Paris 1900 is an example of a replica historical environment,
				    where the purpose of the museum is to display a particular setting and
				    to provide opportunities for social interaction within that setting.
				    To that end, there are a number of cafes, nightclubs (including a replica
				    Moulin Rouge complete with elephant and full service bar), and shops
				    selling fashionable clothing from wedding gowns to lingerie; Paris 1900
				    also features a small art gallery that puts on regular exhibits by SL
				    artists. While avoiding all anachronisms is impossible, the designers
				    of Paris 1900 work very hard to encourage their visitors to act in ways
				    appropriate to the historical setting.  Flying is disabled, for
				    example, and visitors are encouraged to use an underground Metro station
				    when teleporting to and from the island. By contrast, as an example of
				    the innovative experiences available only in SL,  visitors to Paris
				    1900 who climb to the top of the replica Eiffel Tower will find a box
				    of free parachutes, thereby enabling them to jump off the top of the
				    tower and parachute to the ground. Museums in SL similar to Paris 1900
				    include the Xibalba Maya Museum, Fort Malaya History Museum, Tudor Village,
				    and Casablanca.</p>
				  <h1>6. Interviews </h1>
				  <p>This section contains a few results derived from interviews
				    with owners and builders of Second Lifemuseums.
				    These residents were excited to share what they had learned from their
				    experiences in Second Life.  Just as early Web sites set the tone
				    for subsequent efforts on-line, so also museums considering their own
				    projects will find that they have much to learn from these SL pioneers.  Like
				    other on-line communities, SL residents take pride in their activities.  They
				    strongly believe what they are engaged in is hard, creative work and <em>not</em> “just
				    playing a game.”  For this reason SL residents have been wary
				    of being subjects for game studies research. However many of them are
				    likely visitors to our RL institutions and are interested in seeing museums
				    have a greater presence in .<u></u></p>
				  <h2>6.1 Building Museums is Serious Leisure </h2>
				  <p>With the exception of one participant, all of the
				    museum owners interviewed were doing so in the context of serious leisure.  Some
				    found the prospect of creating virtual architecture compelling, while
				    others saw opportunities to share interests that they were passionate
				    about.   Not only do these activities require a significant
				    investment of personal time, but they also often included real and ongoing
				    financial support (in some cases in excess of $US 200 per month for land
				    rent).  Resident builders felt these costs were offset by the opportunity
				    to have positive social interactions with visitors, who also provided
				    donations of exhibits, collection objects, or Linden dollars to support
				    a museum’s existence.  Smaller scale museums were often the
				    responsibility of a single owner/builder, while larger scale museums
				    were collaborations between well-organized groups where the costs and
				    responsibilities could be shared. </p>
				  <h2>6.2 Second Life Isn’t the Real World</h2>
				  <p>Most builders acknowledged that their activities are
				    still very much in the experimental stage.  Many sites began by
				    emulating real world conventions simply because these metaphors felt
				    comfortable and intuitive.  Most builders recognize that what is
				    intuitive in the real-world does not always translate into SL settings
				    and are tweaking as they go along. Many residents recommended thinking
				    carefully about the purpose behind the metaphors used in creating a setting
				    in order to select those that are appropriate for intended goals.   In
				    some cases it is possible to literally turn convention on its head. For
				    example, if making an optical illusion work normally requires inverting
				    the image, in Second Life it can be much more engaging to invert the
				    avatar instead.  </p>
				  <h2>6.3 Interacting with Visitors</h2>
				  <p>As noted above, there are limitations in the kinds
				    of information that is automatically logged, in contrast  to the
				    more sophisticated Web analysis possible today. However, one of the major
				    attractions for SL museum builders was the ability to observe or interact
				    directly with visitors.  One builder experienced in Web site development
				    noted that SL was different for exactly this reason and that an SL space
				    was more rewarding than looking at anonymous Web logs.  This suggests
				    that visitor studies methods might be adapted to studying virtual museum
				    spaces in ways that we cannot study our Web sites.  The development
				    of synchronous and social activities, such as lectures, collaborative
				    builds, and accepting feedback from visitors, is a hallmark of SL museums.  As
				    one participant noted, “If you build it they will come once; if
				    they build it, they keep coming back.” </p>
				  <p>SL museum builders also noted the more interactive
				    nature of SL as a motivating factor of their work.  Many hoped to
				    create more than a static space for visitors by including interactive
				    features (such as those mentioned in the descriptions of exemplars above).  The
				    ability to develop sophisticated interaction is dependent on mastery
				    of the Linden Scripting Language (LSL) or the ability to acquire scripts
				    through purchase or donation. </p>
				  <h2 style="page-break-after:auto;">6.4 Prim Economy</h2>
				  <p>One of the largest challenges to builders are limitations
				    on the number of primitive objects (prims) allowed on a single
				    parcel of land (see <a href="../http://secondlife.com/knowledgebase/article.php?id=055" target="_blank">http://secondlife.com/knowledgebase/
				    article.php?id=055</a><span style="font-size:13.0pt; color:black; ">)</span>.  These
				    limitations force creative choices about how a simulation
				    is constructed or what types of labeling a museum offers (since label
				    cards can double a prim count for a museum of objects). Certain kinds
				    of objects, such as particle emitters and flexible prims, can also decrease
				    the performance of a simulation and introduce unwanted lag and jerkiness.  </p>
				  <h1>7. Conclusions</h1>
				  <p>Second Life currently has many parallels with the
				    early days of the Web. It is an exciting place that participants are
				    co-creating while simultaneously trying to understand what it is, what
				    it might be, and what it is good for. It has many potential contexts
				    of use, but as in the early days of the Web, cultural heritage applications
				    are part of that pioneering exploration. The preliminary results of this
				    research do more than indicate the opportunities and challenges of using
				    Second Lifeas a platform for museums;
				    they suggest that it is equally important to understand how museums may
				    become collaborative partners in an already evolving community. Even
				    more so than the Web, SL is not just about providing information and
				    artifacts. It is about facilitating interaction. Because SL residents
				    have already decided that museum-like activities need to be an important
				    part of their second lives, a study of how they construct these activities
				    may provide museums with important clues about how they might engage
				    virtual audiences in ways that they have not been able to in the past. </p>
