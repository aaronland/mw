      <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="abstractText">As part of our ongoing mission to collect, present,
        and interpret works of art to our community, the Dallas Museum of Art
        (DMA) has developed an integrated business and infrastructure model that
        is both sustainable and expandable to address content creation, content
        storage, and content presentation.  We think the DMA is quite innovative,
        if not unique among museums, in adopting an organizational strategy that
        takes a matrix based, holistic approach to digital asset management.<strong></strong></p>
      <p class="abstractText">Our concept – The Arts Network, a television-style
        network system –  provides both a program development process and
        a robust, extensible program delivery system.  The network is comprised
        of four distinct channels.  These channels were created using the
        results of a study of Museum visitors, which grouped users according
        to their experience at the museum and their participation in museum programming,
        a concept we refer to as “Levels of Engagement with Art” (LOEA<sup>sm</sup>).</p>
      <p class="abstractText">We believe that such a system will support an ongoing
        engagement with all our current constituents and help grow our audience
        for years to come.  The Arts Network has the potential to bring
        the DMA’s expansive and increasingly important collection of works
        of art to the larger audience it deserves - and to do so with scholarly
        integrity and sophisticated technology.</p>
      <p class="abstractText">This presentation will show the approach taken
        to make the transition from “siloed”, disparate databases
        to a decentralized, standards-based, media-rich content management system
        that will grow along with the Museum’s needs. Some of the items
        covered  include enterprise architecture planning, metadata standards,
        and cost analysis.  We also discuss impact to culture, business - both
        internal and external - and changes in methodology and governance, followed
        by an overview of achievements and lessons learned. </p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The Dallas Museum of Art is an emerging national museum that serves primarily
      North Texas; a nine-county urban area with a total population of approximately
      7.2 million people.  The region has averaged more than 150,000 new
      residents per year for the past four years, and 100,000 new residents per
      year for the last seven years.  The median age for the region is 30.5
      years, with more than 50 percent of the population between the ages of
      20 and 54.  The population is expected to grow by 11.8 percent by
      2008.  The Dallas Museum of Art has a membership base of 18,000+ and
      served an estimated 556,000 visitors in fiscal year 2005 and 475,600 in
      2006.  A key consideration in developing any content management system
      is the scale of the solution and the flexibility of the institution’s
      organizational structure.</p>
    <p>The DMA places at the center of its work the educational mission of the
      Museum: connecting the broadest possible audience with great works of art
      in ways that are enriching, personalized,  enjoyable, and educational.  Over
      the past five years, the Museum has broadened and deepened its commitment
      to educating adults and children, both in the Museum and on-line.  As
      a result, the DMA currently has more programming than most other regional
      museums in the US. The Internet has transformed the landscape of communication,
      affecting the way we learn. As technologies advance, user expectations
      change.  Mirroring the experience of businesses and educational institutions,
      cultural institutions too are in a race to keep up with constituent expectations
      of easy access to offerings and resources.  </p>
    <p>The program development process begins with a central repository Content
      Management System (CMS) that is accessible by all staff members.  All
      digital content converted, collected, created, acquired, recorded, and
      developed is entered by contributors into the CMS where it is cataloged
      and indexed using a mix of local notes and industry-standard metadata,
      primarily Dublin-Core and Categories for the Description of Works of Art
      (CDWA).  CMS gives staff and program creators access to a searchable
      resource containing documents, images, video, movies, transcripts, and
      other relevant digital assets needed for program development. </p>
    <p>The program delivery system is an in-house and Web-based network enabling
      DMA visitors, both at the Museum and on-line, to access programs and information,
      formatted to fit their particular interests, through four <em>Arts Network</em> channels.  From
      a Webcast of an <em>Arts &amp; Letters</em> <em>Live</em> program to the
      background on a specific painting, from downloading a personalized tour
      to the e-notification of the start time of a lecture, all that a visitor,
      potential visitor, or distance learner would like to know, can be conveniently
      accessed.  All information collected in the CMS can be channeled through
      the DMA’s Web site, wireless devices in the galleries, cell phones,
      personal digital assistants (PDAs), iPods and other emerging technologies. </p>
    <p>IT technical guidelines assist in ensuring consistency and interoperability
      among the software applications, components, and services that comprise
      the CMS infrastructure.  These technical guidelines focus on providing
      a secure platform that ensures common infrastructure services for next-generation
      systems and applications within the CMS architecture.  The DMA has
      adopted a modified version of Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) as the standard
      application development environment for our infrastructure framework. J2EE
      uses a multi-tiered distributed application model in which application
      logic is divided into components according to function.  We will adhere
      to basic three-layer target architecture: presentation, application, and
      data. </p>
    <h1>From Initial Investment To The The Arts Network</h1>
    <h2>Robust Content Management System As Core</h2>
    <p>In 2003, the Museum’s Information Technology (IT) department was
      faced with an overtaxed e-mail system, concerns about increasingly large
      image files and storage space, and complaints regarding lost or duplicated
      documents.  We were also struggling to support increasing requests
      for Web site updates and additions with one Webmaster and an outdated editing
      process.  The combination of our new focus on expanded on-line learning,
      along with mounting internal document management problems, highlighted
      the need for a comprehensive approach to creating, storing and sharing
      documents and images.</p>
    <p>With the support of the Museum’s senior management, IT staff began
      a process of researching CMS software, and developed core requirements
      for a system that would satisfy the Museum’s immediate and anticipated
      needs <em>(see figure 1)</em>.  Only after this initial research did
      we contract an independent consulting company to evaluate CMS software
      in detail.  They helped us refine our requirements set, provided industry
      insight and documented the outcome. </p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a><a href="gutierrez-fig1.html"><img src="gutierrez.fig.1.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 1: DMA CMS High-level Requirements" width="400" height="298" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 1: DMA CMS High-level Requirements</p>
    <p>Our objective was to acquire or build a system that was easy to support,
      easy to use, and incorporated tools our users were already familiar with.  We
      also needed a foundation for an intranet - a gateway to sharing information,
      applications, and improving internal communication.  These requirements
      led us to a system that is relatively open-source, loaded with built-in
      Web services, ‘component’ based, and proficient in document
      management.  A small IT staff could support this type of system, and
      build-out would require minimal staff and outsourcing.  </p>
    <p>At the core of the system is a searchable repository for content.  <strong>Plug-and-play</strong> components
      then offer document versioning, workflow, Digital Asset Management (DAMS),
      Media Asset Management (DAMS-V), and decentralized Web site contribution
      with multi-site management capabilities.  For customization and interoperability
      with other applications, we have built-in services, APIs and scripting <em>(see
      figure 2).</em></p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a><a href="gutierrez-fig2.html"><img src="gutierrez.fig.2.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 2: DMA CMS Software Structure" width="400" height="311" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 2: DMA CMS Software Structure</p>
    <p>We purchased our CMS software in 2003, and following installation, key
      staff members from each department received training to use the system
      for internal document management and Web site contribution.  In 2005
      we added DAMS, and in 2006 we added DAMS-V <em>(see figure 3).</em>  It
      is important to note that the initial implementation of this system, through
      evaluation, purchase and installation, was accomplished within the constraints
      of the museums&#39; operating budget and did not require supplementary, non-recurring
      sources of funding. </p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig3" id="Fig3"></a><a href="gutierrez-fig3.html"><img src="gutierrez.fig.3.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 3: DMA Content Management — Phase 2" width="400" height="311" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 3: DMA Content Management — Phase 2</p>
    <h2>Research Shapes Program Development Model </h2>
    <p><strong>LOEA<sup>sm</sup> Research</strong></p>
    <p>At the same time IT was building the CMS, the Museum was in the midst
      of evaluating a creative new theory that addressed how we might better
      understand our audience.  In 2002, the Museum introduced an audience
      framework known as Levels of Engagement with Art, or LOEA<sup>sm</sup>, a
      concept that offered valuable insight into how the Museum’s visitors
      might be categorized.  The DMA originally identified three distinct
      Levels of Engagement with Art: Aware, Curious, and Committed, based on
      visitors’ prior knowledge of art, art consumer behavior, and participation
      in art experiences.  The DMA conceived of LOEA<sup>sm</sup> in an
      effort to address the need for an overarching institutional strategy for
      strengthening staff collaborations for programming, marketing, and exhibition
      development that would, in turn, promote innovative program design and
      increase visitors. </p>
    <p>The DMA then worked with consultant Randi Korn and Associates to evaluate
      our audience and to refine interpretive materials.  From 2003-2004,
      RK&amp;A and the DMA collaboratively designed a questionnaire to more deeply
      explore the relationship between the DMA’s visitors and the LOEA<sup>sm</sup> framework.  The
      study’s results validated the Museum’s initial supposition:  that
      a personal connection to art, rather than the traditional demographic benchmark
      of age, race, gender, and socioeconomic background,  is the best indicator
      of visitor participation.  The study identified four audience clusters
      within the three levels, based on visitors’ preferences for types
      of interpretation and programming, comfort level with looking at and talking
      about art, and enthusiasm and passion for art (Korn, Pitman &amp; Davitt,
      2003-2005).  The four visitor clusters - Tentative Observers, Curious
      Participants, Discerning Independents, and Committed Enthusiasts - exist
      within the three Levels of Engagement, with two clusters - Discerning Independents
      and Committed Enthusiasts — residing in the Commitment Level <em>(see
      figure 4).</em> </p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig4" id="Fig4"></a><a href="gutierrez-fig4.html"><img src="gutierrez.fig.4.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 4: Level of Engagement with Art " width="400" height="311" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 4: Level of Engagement with Art </p>
    <p>The information in this study, while complex, is remarkably concrete and
      specific, and staff members continue to use it to design gallery programs.  One
      of the challenges the DMA and other art museums face is to be sensitive
      to visitors’ distinctions.  Each visitor has the ability to
      create his or her own unique experience, influenced by individual works
      of art, what the museum offers, the visitor’s personality traits,
      passion toward an individual work of art, intellectual curiosity, and art
      background.  When all these variables merge, the possibilities are
      endless and extraordinarily rich.  </p>
    <p>Researched and tested over five years with over 1,100 surveys, the LOEA<sup>sm</sup> concept
      fundamentally changed the Museum’s organizational culture, the presentation
      of its resources, and the relationship between the Museum and the surrounding
      communities of the Dallas area.</p>
    <h1>The Arts Network – A New Model For A New Day</h1>
    <p>The Arts Network is an integral part of the over-arching institutional
      strategy to strengthen staff collaboration and connect the broadest public
      segment with great works of art in diverse ways.  It addresses the
      need not only for an institutional program development methodology, but
      also for a complementary delivery system to support and sustain it.  As
      such, The Arts Network is both a program development model <em>and</em> a
      program delivery system.  The program development model incorporates
      LOEA<sup>sm</sup> research and provides Museum staff with a process for
      taking new ideas from concept to completion.  The program delivery
      system is an in-house and Web-based network enabling DMA visitors - internal
      (at the Museum) and external (worldwide), regardless of end-user device
      - to access information they need to enjoy the extensive and varied resources
      of the Museum. </p>
    <p><em>The</em> <em>Arts Network</em> concept matured during a series of
      in-house, cross-departmental brainstorming sessions led by Scott Sayre
      and Kris Wetterlund of Sandbox Studios in 2005. Educators, technology experts,
      and workshop leaders contributed ideas to address the desire of our audience
      to use cell phones, iPods, video and other electronic means to plug into
      museum programs - both at the museum and on-line  Through further
      exploration we found that program ideas we had organized into ‘channels’ mapped
      naturally into previously established LOEA<sup>sm</sup> clusters.  We
      realized that much like a television network, what we were shaping was
      a plan for broadcasting our programs and offerings. For internal use only,
      we gave the channels easy to recognize television-style names <em>(see
      figure 5).</em> </p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig5" id="Fig5"></a><a href="gutierrez-fig5.html"><img src="gutierrez.fig.5.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 5: The Arts Network Channels" width="400" height="311" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 5: The Arts Network Channels</p>
    <p>Early in the process we determined that by taking advantage of standardized
      technical specifications for data design and software development we would
      have the capability to broadcast programming that could be accessed by
      any Web-capable device <em>(see figure 6).</em> </p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig6" id="Fig6"></a><a href="gutierrez-fig6.html"><img src="gutierrez.fig.6.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 6: Development Process + Delivery System = Access" width="400" height="311" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 6: Development Process + Delivery System = Access</p>
    <p>Merging these concepts created a matrix where content and use became integrated
      and dynamic, providing the potential for customized presentation tailored
      to the interests of an individual or identifiable group.  With the
      addition of interactive features such as user communities and social tagging,
      we could create not simply a broadcast network, but an <em>Arts Network</em> that
      goes beyond one-way communication and empowers visitors to forge their
      own relationships with art. </p>
    <h1>Building Infrastructure For Now And The Future</h1>
    <h2>Planning And Execution Timeline</h2>
    <p>The Arts Network depends on incremental investment <em>(see figure 7)</em> in
      the three areas of development identified in our technology roadmap <em>(see
      figure 8)</em>:</p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig7" id="Fig7"></a><a href="gutierrez-fig7.html"><img src="gutierrez.fig.7.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 5: The Arts Network Channels" width="400" height="381" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 7: DMA Arts Network Projected Incremental Operation
      Expenses</p>
    <p class="listwithbullets"><strong>Infrastructure initiatives</strong> provide
      foundational changes and upgrades needed to support the technology expansion
      for The Arts Network.  This includes data structure guidelines utilizing
      available standards, a Data Integration Project, and staff training on
      new technology.</p>
    <p class="listwithbullets"><strong>Prerequisite initiatives</strong> include
      digitization of the collection, a metadata project and the creation of
      new content on the collections.  Text-based documentation is necessary
      for the design and development of innovative, public-facing programming.  </p>
    <p class="listwithbullets"><strong>Audience experience initiatives</strong> will
      directly transform and enhance the resources into programs and products
      for the diverse users of the museum.  This includes various educational
      pilot projects as well as a main Web site facelift.</p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig8" id="Fig8"></a><a href="gutierrez.fig.8.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="gutierrez.fig.8.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 5: The Arts Network Channels" width="400" height="172" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 8: DMA Arts Network Timeline (<a href="gutierrez.fig.8.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>) </p>
    <h2>Technology Approach</h2>
    <p>To maintain control over cost, support, and access, we chose to host our
      own solutions as opposed to opting for industry alternatives such as ASP
      or co-location arrangements.  In addition, we have adopted the approach
      of primarily using standard software support agreements.  In certain
      cases, enhanced or customized software support agreements are utilized.<strong>  </strong>For <em>The</em> <em>Arts
      Network</em> we are using software out-of-the-box (<em>see figures 9 and
      10)</em>, and beginning with simple Web services, we are moving towards
      a light Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that will allow us to re-use
      and eventually share functionalities. </p>

    </ul>
    <h1>The Future </h1>
    <p>At this point, we have invested in a sophisticated system capable of content,
      digital asset, media asset, and multiple Web site management.  We
      have also completed our preliminary metadata model <em>(see figure 11)</em> that
      provides appropriate tags for future archiving.  These tags allow
      for easy search and retrieval, indications of public and private access,
      and the sharing of DMA material with other institutions via an XML gateway.  Metadata
      tags will also help facilitate future development of <em>Arts Network</em> programs.
      Well-formed metadata is a key component in reducing program creation time
      and reducing program time to market (Allen, 2006).</p>
    <p class="caption"><a href="gutierrez.fig.11.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="gutierrez.fig.11a.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig
				      11: DMA Metadata Standards Crosswalk for Digital Asset Management" width="400" height="311" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 11: DMA Metadata Standards Crosswalk for Digital
      Asset Management (<a href="gutierrez.fig.11.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>) </p>
    <p>Currently we are working on a user-friendly interface that will provide
      streamlined access to digital archives, whether for internal staff or those
      accessing the museum remotely.  We have also begun a Web site redesign
      to reflect our new interactive network.  Looking forward, we project
      that by the first quarter of 2008 we will have full broadcast capability <tt>-</tt> allowing
      us, for example, to feed a real-time lecture to an <em>Arts Network</em> program
      that can be accessed by any number of end-user devices. </p>
    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
    <p>Launching any type of collaboration software like a Content Management
      System should be an inter-divisional effort and supported from the beginning
      by senior management.  Success  depends on a shared vision of
      this technology’s place in achieving institutional goals. </p>
    <p>Technology is a means, not an end, and IT staff are hired to support the
      work of the museum’s education, curatorial, marketing and development
      staff.  By understanding the needs of our museum’s experts we
      can build tools they can easily use.  We utilized our staff’s
      existing research and audience designation criteria to help shape a CMS
      that will serve the Museum’s educational mission for years to come.  Here
      are our tips.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make a commitment to training.  By establishing
      a frequent and ongoing training program for our staff<strong>, </strong>we
      increase user acceptance and start to develop a common language across
      our institution.</li>
      <li> Be explicitly clear on why the museum should invest in expensive
        software and servers. Once the value of the flexibility and longevity
        of a system is understood, it is easier to find funding to build it.  In
        other words, we must make our business case.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li> Unless your institution has the staffing and budget to oversee
        the development of proprietary or overly customized applications, keep
        your software implementations as simple as possible and choose your technology
        platform wisely.  Data and application integration can be achieved
        by increasingly easy paths.  Overcomplicating things – <tt> </tt>well
        – overcomplicates things.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>By taking a comprehensive approach to content management we create a physical
      system that is easy to support, cost effective, extensible, and sustainable
      for years to come.  At the same time we create a program development
      model that targets specific audiences, engages previously siloed internal
      business units, and frees our content experts from many of the old constraints
      of production time and resources so that they can focus on the quality
      of the program. </p>
