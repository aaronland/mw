  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  
<p>The use of the mobile phone as an interpretative device within museums has 
  dramatically increased within the last few years; dozens of institutions now 
  offer such capabilities- from the Southern Utah University Library to the Walker 
  Art Center in Minneapolis. [Within this paper, I will use the term &#39;cell phone&#39; 
  and &#39;mobile phone&#39; interchangeably, with the understanding that this terminology 
  also covers smart phones such as the Blackberry and the Treo.] </p>
  <p>Very preliminary evaluation data, primarily formative, is now becoming available 
    from these projects. The results from some of these early studies, almost 
    anecdotal in nature due to the small sample size, have been quite intriguing 
    to me, especially as I begin work on a major mobile phone project. I have 
    been particularly focused on those visitors who do not use the mobile phone 
    capabilities while within an exhibition. While some of the non-users have 
    logistical reasons for not making use of the technology (such as a very short 
    visit duration), another portion simply say they are not interested. As very 
    preliminary data has shown that those who do make use of the technology find 
    that it enhances their museum experience (Luke and Stein, 2006; Nickerson, 
    2005), I wish to further examine the context of use of mobile phones within 
    an exhibition space with a long-term goal of understanding and possibly increasing 
    visitor usage. While summative data on the outcomes of using cell phones as 
    interpretive devices is greatly needed, we also need to better understand 
    barriers to their use before we can document impact. The amount of data available 
    at this point is small; nonetheless, the exploration of issues surrounding 
    the use of phones can help move these projects to the next stage of development.</p>
  <p>The first section of this paper gives an overview of the project we are currently 
    embarking on, SNSE, and the use of mobile phones in that context. Then it 
    demonstrates the issue at hand, early formative data on the non-use of cell 
    phones in exhibitions that offer such programs. The following sections discuss 
    some of the ideas from other fields relevant to the use of cell phones in 
    exhibitions, including diffusion of innovation theory and studies done on 
    the use of cell phone and cell phone norms in public spaces. Finally, I speculate 
    on the linkages between these components and the data thus far as it relates 
    to the future of cell phones in exhibitions. </p>
  <h1>Background Project Information: Science Now, Science Everywhere</h1>
  <p>In July 2007, Liberty Science Center (LSC) will reopen after a major renovation, 
    after being closed for 22 months. Within the new Liberty Science Center, three 
    newly-designed exhibitions will take advantage of current developments in 
    technology to redefine a museum visit by enabling visitors to download customized 
    content and applications from the exhibits on to their cell phones. This NSF-funded 
    project (ISE #0610352) is called <strong>SNSE</strong>, for Science Now, Science Everywhere.</p>
  <p>SNSE is a collaborative project led by LSC, and 
    the team includes the Institute for Learning Innovation (Institute), Caterpillar 
    Mobile, Onomy, Lucent Technologies, Rutgers University’s Center for Mobile 
    Communication Studies, and Verizon Communications. The project aims to explore 
    the unique learning opportunities that are possible when visitors use their 
    mobile phones as tools for learning in a science center environment. Specifically, 
    LSC believes that by using their phones, visitors will have more ownership 
    over their learning experiences as well as access to the content after their 
    visit. SNSE is a mobile learning initiative that enables the public to interact 
    with exhibits, retrieve content, and extend<em> </em>their learning by 
    using their mobile phones; visitors will be encouraged 
    to utilize SNSE both on-site and off-site. The bare details of the application 
    being developed for SNSE are as follows:</p>
  <h2>Interaction</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Listen to audio interpretation</li>
  <li>
    Vote in a poll</li>
  <li> 
    Contribute to exhibit displays</li>
  <li>
    Participate in a camera phone challenge/game</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Retrieval</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Take information with you</li>
  <li>
    Save multimedia creations</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Extension</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Subscribe to current science updates  </li>
  <li>
    Subscribe to camera phone challenges</li>
	</ul>
  <p>The Institute for Learning Innovation (the Institute) will conduct the formative 
    and summative evaluation for SNSE. (We have already completed the Front-End 
    study.) Our role is to gauge to what degree SNSE is able to: </p>
  <ol>
  <li> Broaden visitors&#39; engagement at exhibits by taking advantage of the unique 
    capabilities of mobile phones, </li>
  <li>
    Encourage subsequent learning experiences that sustain informal science 
    education beyond the wall of the science center, and</li>
  <li>
    Engage teenagers, including those from underserved communities, in 
    informal science education through mobile learning.</li>
  </ol>
  
<p>A fundamental tenet of the SNSE project is to make use of the visitors&#39; own 
  personal technology devices, specifically their cell phones. By asking the visitors 
  to use their own devices, rather than lending them devices to use during their 
  visits, LSC hopes to increase visitor interaction with the content material 
  after the visitors have left the institution. Through using their own devices, 
  their sense of ownership over the content material might increase. In addition, 
  they will be able to share this content with others, encouraging post-visit 
  review and reflection on the content material. These objectives are fundamentally 
  important to learning, as research has demonstrated the impact of conversations 
  about content and subsequent reinforcing experiences on increasing learning 
  (Falk and Dierking, 2000).</p>
  <h1>Why Cell Phones in SNSE?</h1>
  <p>Initially, I was dubious that cell phones could be of any added value within
     a museum exhibition. Cell phones seemed limited in the scope of what added
     value they could provide and the logistics, both for the museum and for
    users,  seemed too complex to be worthwhile. LSC was open to a number of
    possible  content delivery devices as long as they were personally owned,
    as LSC was  specifically interested in having individuals use their own devices.
    The Instituteconducted  early front-end evaluation for SNSE, looking at a
    variety of devices, including  phones, PDAs, iPods, and others. The results
    were clear. The choice was mobile  phones, not because they were optimum
    from a technology standpoint, not because  learning is best supported on
    phones (we don’t have the evidence yet to make 
    that claim), but simply because phones are overwhelmingly the most common
    device.  The evolution of phone capabilities was examined at the time of
    the last front-end  study (Haley Goldman and Foutz, 2005); no other personal
    technology device  is regularly enough brought to the museum to be considered
    for the project.</p>
  <h2>Data about the Use of Cell Phones in Exhibitions</h2>
  
<p>The SNSE project has since completed some prototyping of SNSE applications. 
  During prototyping, the LSC marketing department completed some interviews with 
  exhibit visitors. Out of 24 interviews, 5 people (21%) tried the prototype. 
  Another 21% didn’t realize the prototype was available (didn&#39;t see the signs), 
  17% (n=4) did not have a phone with them, and one individual did not want to 
  use up the minutes. Of the non-users, the greatest number of them (7 individuals 
  or 29% of the overall sample) said they were simply not interested (LSC Marketing 
  Study, 2006).</p>
  <p>In 2006, my colleagues at the Institute, Jessica Luke and Jill Stein, conducted 
    an evaluation of a variety of interpretive experiences at the Walker Art Center 
    (Minneapolis, MN). They had some similar findings, despite the very different 
    environments (art museum vs. science center). Among the 5 components the Institute 
    evaluated was <strong>Art on Call</strong>, the Walker’s interactive information system 
    where visitors can access audio resources from their cell phones, both on 
    and off site. During the evaluation, Institute researchers tracked and interviewed 
    a total of 78 participants. While usage of the Art on Call capabilities was 
    too low within this sample (17%, n=13) to make generalizable comments about 
    overall impact, those individuals that used the system found it highly enjoyable 
    and rated themselves as highly likely to use it again. </p>
  <p>Luke and Stein did interview non-users to find out why they did not use Art 
    on Call more extensively. Non-user responses were described as the following:</p>
  <ul>
  <li> Unaware that the service was offered (didn&#39;t see the signs);</li>
  <li>
    Were aware of Art on Call, but unsure of what it was or how 
    to use it;</li>
  <li>
    Assumed that cell phone usage was prohibited onsite, and therefore 
    it must be an offsite activity;</li>
  <li>
    Wondered if there was a fee for the call;</li>
  <li> Thought that the program was part of a pre-paid audio &#39;tour&#39;;</li>
  <li>
    Were not interested in learning more about the artwork while 
    there; and</li>
  <li>
    Did not find the idea of using the cell phone in the museum 
    appealing (Luke and Stein, 2006).</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>While not diminishing the positive impact of Art on Call or SNSE for the users 
  in any way, the low usage rates invite an exploration of this particular technology 
  in museum settings. All but the last two responses represent issues that might 
  be influenced by varying visitor orientation, changing signage, or other such 
  packaging changes. The second to last category perhaps represents individuals 
  who wish to interact with the art directly, as an aesthetic experience, and 
  wish little interpretation. The last category is the one that intrigued me the 
  most and served as the basis for some of the research review in this paper.</p>
  <h2>Mobile Phones: The Third Screen</h2>
  
<p>Cell phones, already a part of daily life for the majority of American adults, 
  are now more popular than ever with teens and even younger children. Occasionally 
  called the &#39;third screen&#39; (third after television and the computer), cell phones 
  are owned by more than two-thirds (68%) of adults in the US, making cell phones 
  the most common personal handheld device. While teens are less likely to own 
  cell phones than adults, nearly half (45%) of all teens own a cell phone. Of 
  those, teens living in urban areas are the most likely to own cell phones (51%), 
  followed by their suburban counterparts (46%) (Lenhart, Madden, and Hitlin, 
  2005).</p>
  <p>Though it may seem trivial to document exactly what mobile phones are used 
    for, I think it is necessary here. The psychological uses extend far beyond 
    the actual making of calls, and as we understand current use in a deeper fashion, 
    we can better explore the barriers to use in certain environments, such as 
    museums and science centers. Wei and Lo (2006) have divided uses of cell phones 
    into 6 categories, which they call gratifications, based on several previous 
    studies of fixed and mobile phone uses in their own pilot study. Those categories 
    of use are: </p>
  <ol>
  <li>
    Information seeking (getting updated information on traffic, stocks, 
    news, and entertainment);</li>
  <li>
    Social Utility (to chat, gossip, pass time, relieve boredom and relax);</li>
  <li>
    Affection (checking in with others, showing caring, improving relations, 
    feeling closer);</li>
  <li> 
    Fashion &amp; Status (looking fashionable, cool, stylish, avoiding 
    looking old-fashioned);</li>
  <li>
    Mobility (avoiding looking for, getting change for or lining up for 
    a public phone); and</li>
  <li>Accessibility (being accessible and available regardless of location).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The study was based in Taiwan, and while Taiwan has been the world leader 
    in cell phone adoption (by 2001, 96.6% of the population had cell phones), 
    this study was completed in 2001 and does not include current mobile phone 
    applications such as Internet access, television viewing, or even cameras 
    and text-messaging. Thus we might expect to see other categories such as entertainment 
    included in these categories were the data collected more recently (Wei &amp; 
    Lo, 2006). </p>
  <h2>Do Teens Differ?</h2>
  <p>The special case of teen use of mobile phones is interesting for two reasons. 
    First, teen usage of a device or application is seen by some as a predictor 
    of large-scale adoption, as teens are perceived as adopting new technology 
    earlier than the population at large. Secondly, and more practically, the 
    SNSE project has a specific focus on mobile phone usage by teens. </p>
  <p>As might be expected, there is a difference by age in the percentage of teen 
    cell phone ownership. Younger teens, those aged 12-14, are less likely to 
    own a cell phone than older teens, those aged 15-17. The trend seems to be 
    linked to the changes in school grade; there is a marked jump in cell phone 
    ownership as teens enter middle school and again as they enter high school. 
    For example, 48% of ninth grade students in the U.S. own a cell phone, compared 
    to 29% of eighth grade students (Lenhart, Madden, and Hitlin, 2005). </p>
  <p>Text messaging, while not the most popular form of written communication 
    among teens, is quite common. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of teens with cells 
    phones use text messaging. When given a choice among forms of written communication, 
    however, instant messaging (IM) is the most popular among teens, with 46% 
    of teens who go on-line preferring to IM with friends, compared to 33% who 
    prefer e-mail, and just 15% who prefer text messaging (Lenhart, Madden, and 
    Hitlin, 2005). And while teens more overtly discuss the issues of fashion 
    and status (Ling, 2004), the gratification of a mobile phone as an indicator 
    of status is not solely limited to teens (Wei &amp; Lo, 2006).</p>
  <h2>Diffusion of Innovation Theory and Technology Adoption</h2>
  <p>Over the past 15 years a number of frameworks for understanding developments 
    in and user reactions to technology have been proposed in both popular and 
    academic literature, from a range of disciplines. The academic fields investigating 
    communication include information systems, management systems, and communications.</p>
  <p>One classic text in the study of the adoption of new ideas and technologies 
    is Everrett Roger’s book <em>The Diffusion of Innovation </em>(2003), originally 
    published in 1962 and most recently updated in 2003. Roger formulated distinct 
    population segments including the Innovators, the Early Adopters, the Early 
    Majority, the Late Majority, and the Laggards. Each segment has different 
    characteristics and reacts to innovations in a different fashion. According 
    to Rogers, innovators make up 2.5% of the population, early adopters another 
    13.5%, followed by equal segments of the early majority (34%), late majority 
    (34%) and then finally the last 16% of the population, the laggards. These 
    percentages form a bell curve. In this theory, innovation is believed to spread 
    throughout society on an S-shaped curve, with one plateau early on as the 
    innovation is changing, followed by a rapid escalation in users (the “tipping” 
    point), followed by another plateau as the laggards eventually adopt the innovation. 
    As the tipping point on mobile phone ownership has passed (in 1998, according 
    to Gladwell [2000]), we are now in a period of the evolution and adoption 
    of the applications of the mobile phone, rather than of the phone itself.</p>
  
<p>In Rogers&#39; <em>Diffusion of Innovation</em>, he explains that innovations vary 
  greatly in their perceived attributes. These perceived attributes help explain 
  why some innovations, such as cell phones, are adopted fairly quickly, while 
  others, such as seat belts in cars, require decades to reach widespread adoption. 
  The adopter categories have different values and characteristics. The Innovators 
  are active seekers of innovation and are willing to deal with difficult interfaces 
  and other uncertainties in order to use a particular innovation. Early adopters 
  are the opinion leaders for most innovations. They are frequently considered 
  to be the &#34;person to check with&#34; or the &#34;individual in the know&#34;. 
  Both Innovators and Early Adopters are driven by the hedonic outcomes – the 
  fun factor – and the social outcomes within close-knit, though possibly geographically 
  diverse, communities. Those in the early majority tend to deliberate for some 
  time before adopting an innovation. They are motivated by more utilitarian outcomes 
  and want new ideas to be proven in terms of usability and reliability. For the 
  late majority to adopt an innovation, their skepticism must be addressed. Peer 
  influence and, at times, economic necessity are key factors for individuals 
  in the late majority adopting new innovations. Laggards are seen as distrustful 
  of new innovations; they value predictability, are economically disadvantaged, 
  and possibly socially isolated. (These categories were recently discussed and 
  re-conceptualized in the popular literature in Malcolm Gladwell’s <em>The Tipping 
  Point.</em>) </p>
  
<p>This work in the diffusion of innovations has been extended by Geoffrey Moore, 
  both in academic articles and in his book <em>Crossing the Chasm </em>(2002). 
  The central proposition in <em>Crossing the Chasm </em>is that there are significant 
  differences between those who adopt innovations early on – the innovators and 
  the early adopters – and the rest of the continuum. Not only are the behaviors 
  different, but the motivations and values of the groups are different as well. 
  One of the key challenges for companies that are growing is to cross the chasm 
  from what is appealing to the innovators and the early adopters to what is necessary 
  to attract and retain the rest of the consumer public. Rogers, in the latest 
  edition of his book, disputes the existence of the chasm between adopter categories, 
  claiming &#34;innovativeness&#34; is a continuous variable (Rogers, 2003).</p>
  <p>The diffusion of innovation theory does make another debatable assumption, 
    that everyone does eventually adopt the innovation. In information technology, 
    this is not necessarily so. Personal computers were predicted to have a 70% 
    market penetration rate by the year 2000; instead only 50% of U.S. households 
    had a computer by the year 2000 (Brown and Venkatesh 2003). Some research 
    suggests spending more time examining the non-adopter and their characteristics 
    (Mathieson, Peacock, and Chin, 2001).</p>
  <p>There are a number of other theories on the adoption of information technology
     besides the diffusion research. Most notable is the Technology Acceptance
     Model (TAM) (Ma and Liu, 2004; Mathieson, Peacock &amp; Chin, 2001) described
      first by Venkatesh and Davis (2000); it is one of the more widely applied
      models of the acceptance of informational technology. The model is generally
      believed to be more predictive and robust than other models. In the TAM,
     perceived  usefulness and perceived ease of use, in combination with a variety
     of external  variables, are seen as the key factors in influencing attitudes
     towards the  adoption of a technology. Those attitudes then contribute to
     the intention  to use the technology and the actual use of the technology.
     Due to the several  hundred studies that make use of TAM, there is  a wide
     variety of variations  on the survey instruments. Other theories with implications
     for technology  adoption include Mathieson’s Theory of Planned Behavior
     and Social Cognitive  Theory.</p>
  <h1>Division between Public and Private Spaces</h1>
  
<p>In the current media-rich environment, the delineation between public and private 
  spaces itself is being redefined. There are certain rules or norms of acceptable 
  behavior within public spaces – both physical and virtual – and these norms 
  are being negotiated and renegotiated as the applications and implication of 
  the technology change. This becomes particularly notable as the boundaries between 
  public and private break down. A story in the New York Times last year included 
  the remarks of a college senior who, surprised at his lack of job interviews, 
  was advised to Google himself. He turned up a satirical essay he had written 
  titled, &#34;Lying Your Way to the Top&#34;. &#39;&#39;I never really considered that 
  employers would do something like that,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;I thought they would just 
  look at your resume and grades.&#39;&#39; Despite being posted on-line, in a public 
  forum – the student in question felt that it was semi-private information. (Finder, 
  2006). A follow-up editorial in the New York Times went on to say, </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">The Internet feels private in certain ways that it isn&#39;t. 
    Sharing posts with friends, fellow hobbyists or potential dates, a user could 
    be forgiven for overlooking the possibility that a human resources executive 
    might be zeroing in as well.…We are only just beginning to wake up to the 
    wider ramifications of the Internet on the personal and the confidential (New 
    York Times, 2006).</p>
  
<p>In a cell phone specific incident of porous public/private space, Edward Schegloff 
  recounts an anecdote from the Long Island railroad where a young woman was having 
  a crisis with her significant other, with whom she was speaking on her cell 
  phone. There were multiple other passengers in the train car, all of whom were 
  &#34;busy doing and not overhearing this conversation&#34; (Schegloff, 2002) 
  except for one individual who was directly watching the young woman. This caused 
  her to exclaim in an outrage, &#34;Do you mind? This is a private conversation!&#34; 
  (Schegloff, 2002) As Schegloff points out, there are mixed cues whether this 
  is in fact a private conversation, as she is speaking into the phone in a loud 
  voice in a public train car. Yet the actions of the others in the car support 
  the idea that the young woman should be afforded some sort of privacy. Communication 
  research has been investigating this ongoing negotiation of public and private 
  space. This research stands mainly in opposition to the other more technologically 
  deterministic theories previously mentioned, where technology is the driving 
  force of social change (Surry, 1997).</p>
  <h2><strong>Behavior of Bystanders: Civil Inattention</strong></h2>
  <p>Places such as museums, restaurants, and train stations are both public and 
  private places, where we have &#34;become quite accomplished at ignoring others 
  who are in quite close proximity, through the use of fictive curtains&#34; 
  (Ling, 2004, 125-6). These places tend to have heavy normative expectations, 
  with very specific ideas of prescribed behavior. The bystanders on the train 
  were engaged in &#34;civil inattention,&#34; defined by Humphreys as &#34;a 
  social norm which allows individuals to tacitly interact without actively paying 
  attention to strangers&#34; (2005, 369).  This negotiation is not unique to 
  mobile phones. Humphreys quotes Ruback’s 1989 study of the territorial defense 
  of callers using public telephones. Callers actively negotiated and defended 
  their privacy to a similar extent when their space was intruded upon; in fact, 
  they tended to lengthen their conversations when other individuals came too 
  close. Some places, like train stations, were seen as places where phone use 
  is more accepted. Train stations offer open areas where the noise from talking 
  on the phone is more easily absorbed. In addition, most individuals in train 
  stations are in transit, thus making it logical that one would use the phone 
  for coordination purposes. In other places, such as restaurants, individuals 
  felt it was rude to use one’s phone without stepping outside.</p>
  <h2>Behavior of Users: Disengagement</h2>
  <p>Disengaging with others through physical cues is a common behavior during 
    mobile conversations (Humphreys, 2005, Ling 2004), and includes actions such 
    as looking away, using body language to signify that you are currently not 
    available for conversation, moving away from others, and at times physically 
    blocking out your space, using bags or other items. In one research study, 
    the researcher attempted to make eye contact with various individuals on the 
    street who were using their phones; phones users would only look at him in 
    order to make navigation decisions, i.e. to not physically run into him (Ling, 
    2004).</p>
  <p>In order to create that private space within a virtual space, cell phone 
    users have a variety of strategies, including:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
    Overall closed body position;</li>
  <li>
    Turning their back on others in the space;</li>
  <li>
    Leaning forward;</li>
  <li>
    Moving their head downwards or ducking; and</li>
 <li>
    Staking out space, by using bags or other items. (Humphreys, 
    2005, Ling, 2004), </li>
 </ul>
  <p>These behaviors are almost exclusively ones of disconnect. Even when among 
    individuals apparently within social groups, the cell phone user would disengage 
    from the immediate surroundings by physical distancing or changing body posture 
    or both. Other members of the social group would engage in another task such 
    as looking away or out a window, reading, or fiddling with their own phone.  </p>
  
<p>Interestingly, while these strategies were all noted during observational studies, 
  interviewees could not generally describe how they mediated between public and 
  private spaces. Still, phone users do understand using their phone as an activity 
  that precludes the involvement of other people, or what Humphreys describes 
  as an &#34;involvement shield&#34;. These interviewees admitted they would 
  pretend to use their cell phone in a public space to avoid interacting with 
  others. </p>
  
<p>Humphreys based part of her work on Goffman&#39;s concept of social groupings and 
  power within public spaces. Goffman divides individuals in public spaces into 
  &#34;singles&#34; and &#34;withs&#34; - those who are alone and those who 
  are with others. Singles are seen as more &#34;vulnerable&#34; to contact 
  from others and may be seen as having something wrong with them for not being 
  able to be in a with – potentially seen as not having friends, not being &#34;sociable&#34; 
  (Humphreys, 2005) When one is a single, then, the mobile phone allows some negation 
  of the &#34;single&#34; status – as if saying, &#34;See, I have friends, 
  I’m not truly alone.&#34;</p>
  
<p>When in a group, however, this dynamic changes. A member of a dyad becomes
  suddenly  exposed when the other individual disengages to make or receive a
  call. Bound  by the norms of civil inattention, this individual must also disengage
  and occupy  himself or herself with another task, such as looking at a museum
  or fiddling  with a personal phone. This sense of &#34;exposure&#34;, of
  suddenly becoming  a single, is rooted in the power dimensions of the disengagement.
  Being on the  phone signals to others, in a public space, that the call is
  more important  than being with your companion, a tacit acknowledgement of
  the power relationship.  Humphrey states upon ending a call, the phone user
  almost always apologizes  (2005).</p>
  <h1>Relationship of Theories to Barriers of Using Phones in Exhibitions</h1>
  <p>Having now spent considerable time (yet only touching the surface) on the 
    ideas of the adoption of technology and the use of phones in public spaces, 
    I now turn back to how these ideas might be relevant towards the practicalities 
    of museum projects using cell phones. There are clearly several barriers towards 
    greater adoption of these offerings among the public. Some of those barriers 
    may be removed through tweaking the exhibition signage, providing better explanations 
    of how the project works, and more strongly communicating a sense of added 
    value.</p>
  <p>Other barriers may be more complex to address, though solutions are worth 
    pursuing. The discussion of these theories on a macro level is important; 
    however I am interested in how they apply on a micro level. I’m not interested 
    in these theories as a method for understanding systemic change in the domain 
    of technology. I’m interested in product utilization from the adopters (visitors) 
    point of view. Is the use of mobile phones within the museum representative 
    of a new technology application, and thus we are seeing the early stages of 
    the diffusion of the more innovative method of using technology? If that is 
    true, do teenagers function as early adoptors? Will studying their usage give 
    us clues to the overall adoption? Or should we be using a TAM model, which 
    would prescribe looking at factors such as perceived ease of use and perceived 
    usefulness to see if this can be used? Research needs to be done to probe 
    visitors both regarding perceived ease of use of the phone in this context 
    and perceived usefulness. </p>
  
<p>A third possibility is to look more closely at communication theory. Perhaps 
  this early resistance to the use of phones in museums is more reflective of 
  the museum as a context with significant expectations of appropriate behavior 
  (heavily normative context), and the use of phones within that context is considered 
  to violate these norms. To a visitor, even subconsciously, using a cell phone 
  within an exhibition may indicate disengagement from the group. As museum-going 
  is often a social experience, this disengagement seems inappropriate – even 
  offensive – if one is in effect making another group member or members feel 
  &#34;exposed&#34; or vulnerable. This barrier will be difficult to overcome, 
  and possibly only with the newer features of mobile phones. While we can perhaps 
  partially mitigate the problem with signage and other advance organizers, an 
  added approach is to bundle the audio portions of the resource with content 
  that makes use of the other, more social capacities of the phone. Making use 
  of the phone as a camera or text-messaging device and highlighting those features 
  may allow individuals fearful of cutting themselves off from their group a way 
  to use their phone as a shared resource, as in when viewing a picture or video-clip.</p>
  <p>As with any newly developed visitor resource, we must spend some energy investigating 
    how the resource actually functions on the floor with visitors. Additionally, 
    we must investigate how this technology appeals or does not appeal to visitors 
    and what we can do to make it easier and more comfortable to use. Once mobile 
    phone functionalities are as easy to use as possible, we need to clearly communicate 
    to visitors how these features are to be used and what the added value to 
    the experience will be. As mobile phone technology and functionalities continue 
    to develop, we should expect the continued evolution of the social norms surrounding 
    their use and then proactively decide how to adapt our institutional approach.</p>
