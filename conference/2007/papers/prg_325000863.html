      <p class="abstractText">From September 19, 2007 to January 21, 2008, Centre
        Pompidou is presenting the exhibition called ‘Erice – Kiarostami:
        correspondences’ suggesting travels through the two directors’ films,
        exploring relations between films, photos and paintings and presenting ‘video
        correspondence’ exchanged by the two directors. Although the exhibition
        has been presented previously in Barcelona and Madrid, the Paris edition
        features a radically new experimentation performed by the newly founded
        Centre Pompidou Research and Innovation Institute. The experimental set-up
        is built around new film annotation software called <em>Lignes de temps</em> (Timelines)
        bringing a graphical representation which immediately reveals the inner ‘rhythm’ of
        the movies, be it based on technical features (shot, sequence, camera
        moves, audio elements …) or on narrative features (characters,
        landscapes, flash-backs …). Also, <em>Lignes de Temps</em> may
        be superimposed to reveal co-occurrences, repetitions or mirror effects
        in one film or across several. For the exhibition, visitors are fitted
        with PDA and encouraged to write and record notes during their visit.
        By the end of the exhibition, a dedicated place called ‘Espace
        critique’ (a place to criticize) offers 8 computers where the comments
        recorded on PDA may be reworked, synchronized with the films and shared
        with other visitors. </p>

    <h1>1. Exhibition</h1>
    <p>While several exhibitions are presented for confronting the work of one
      or two artists, the Exhibition <em>Erice – Kiarostami: correspondences </em>illustrates
      a double evolution of contemporary art, oriented by the increasing influence
      of cinema and the hybridization of artistic practices. Victor Erice and
      Abbas Kiarostami were both born in June, 1940, one in the context of Franco’s
      Spain and the other in the Iran of the old regime. They both made the radical
      choice of not submitting to the laws of industry and marketing, bearing
      witnessing to liberty and morality without compromise regarding creation.
      Both are convinced that their cinema is directly linked to the position
      of a child, as a starting point and as a topic. They share a common sense
      of “slowness”. They both work at the borders of cinema, getting
      into video installations, photography and painting. This exhibition suggests
      visual experience across all Kiarostami’s photos and installations
      and across Erice’s rushes, linked with and confronted by Antonio
      Garcia Lopez paintings. These symmetrical pathways merge at the heart of
      the exhibition with miniDV videos exchanged by the directors, an ongoing
      work performed together. </p>
    <p>New technologies are proposed for criticizing the presented art pieces
      through mobile devices to use during the visit, recording vocal comments,
      texts and photos. By the entrance, presented in a Web site, an “espace
      critique” (a virtual place for criticizing) offers new software called « Lignes
      de temps » (Timelines) for producing and sharing comments in the
      form of annotations synchronized with films and exhibition objects. If
      not at the physical exhibition, visitors at home may upload their film
      enrichment items to the exhibition Web site in order to perfect them and
      share them with others. Our belief is that, unlike existing blogs or wikis,
      shared “instruments for criticism” should support the advent
      of art practitioners (and not users) and new communities of “amateurs” (in
      the noble sense it had, for instance, at the French royal academy in the
      18<sup>th</sup> century). </p>
    <h1>2. Video Annotation Software: <em>Lignes De Temps</em> </h1>
    <p class="caption"><a href="puig_Tab1.ScreenshotLT.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="puig_Tab1.ScreenshotLT.jpg" alt="Fig 1: Lignes de Temps" width="426" height="276" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 1: Lignes de Temps</p>
    <p><em>Lignes de temps</em> is a video annotation tool for film analysis.
      It makes use of the full potential of the digital media context. Inspired
      by timelines traditionally used in digital video editing software, <em>Lignes
      de temps</em> features a graphical representation of the film, revealing
      immediately its entire segmentation. <em>Lignes de temps</em> brings an
      alternative view of the film by rendering a graphical score or spatial
      cartography instead of the traditional temporal stream familiar to all
      cinema viewers. Therefore, by selecting a segment in <em>Lignes de temps,</em> the
      user gets direct access to the corresponding film sequence, which can then
      be described and analyzed with textual, vocal and video comments or documented
      with images of Web links.</p>
    <p>To this first stage of analysis (allowing the user to browse into the
      film shot by shot) may be added other parameters, allowing other « Lignes
      de temps » parallel to the film itself to be superimposed in order
      to explore other dimensions related to shot scales, camera motions, incoming
      or outgoing events and any other objective features. This allows users
      to visualize, compare and combine description criteria, meaningful indexes,
      recurrences or symmetries.</p>
    <h2><strong> <em>Amateurs</em></strong> - Practices</h2>
    <p>Already several historians, critics, theorists, students from art and
      cinema schools have agreed to experiment with the software in order to
      verify hypothesis, to explore new analysis strategies, bringing expertise,
      enrichment or unsuspected usage of the tool. Benefiting from this first
      expert audience, new communities of “amateurs” have already
      developed new practices of Lignes de temps. This is particularly the case
      of teachers in high schools studying cinema and more broadly of “cinephiles” (cinema
      amateurs) who wish to express their feelings about a film - their memories,
      impressions, reflections - on adapted digital media.</p>
    <h2>Objective Analysis, Subjective Analysis, Sharing</h2>
    <p>To the objective criteria mentioned before, practitioners of the tool
      may add purely subjective criteria based or not based on the given objective
      features. Subjective annotation goes beyond the visible dimension; it may
      focus on the technical, narrative or emotional construction. For this purpose
      the tool proposes to insert markers or to define segments along the « lignes
      de temps », and then to attach free annotations, keywords managed
      in a shared database or, in the future, taxonomies (controlled vocabulary)
      or thematic hierarchies. Annotations may also take the form of vocal comments
      recorded via the software, or of documents synchronized with the film (audio
      files, texts, photos, videos, URLs).</p>
    <p>A third challenge of this tool is related to its sharing capabilities,
      allowing one user to share its “Lignes de temps” with identified
      partners or in a public and open context. In this case a “Lignes
      de temps” is an organized instrument for dialogue in synchronization
      with the film. “Lignes de temps” of different contributors
      may exchanged, superimposed, or modified by one another independently from
      the developed Web site described further.</p>
    <h2>Signed Views</h2>
    <p>A concept derived from the <strong>Signed listenings</strong> (Donin)
      developed at IRCAM under the leadership of Bernard Stiegler, <strong>Signed
      views</strong> transcribes the points of view of amateurs, whether film
      critics, film makers, teachers or students. While the comments are all
      produced and modifiable in Lignes de temps, they may be published in different
      rendering formats. Among these rendering formats, « Lignes de temps » allows
      the visualization of a non destructive edition of sequences, the simultaneous
      display of two films, and a text layout with hyperlinks driving video sequences,
      with or without vocal comments.</p>
    <p>Among the Signed views, famous film critics such as Youssef Ishaghpour,
      Jean Louis Comolli, Alain Bergala and Sylvie Lindeperg have provided analysis
      on the narration, on topics crossing several films, on relationships between
      cinema and paintings, on the way a film has been constructed in time, or
      on the way it has been reused in different historical, political or cultural
      contexts.</p>
    <p>“Lignes de temps” are not limited to cinema, but are already
      tested in dance by the William Forsythe company and its dancers. Fixed
      images and texts will also be the topic of future adaptations of these
      annotation tools.</p>
    <h1>3. A Collaborative Web Site</h1>
    <p class="caption"><a href="puig_Tab2.Webportal.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="puig_Tab2.Webportal.jpg" alt="Fig 2" width="341" height="449" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 2: Erice et Kiorestami Web Portal</p>
    <p>Open in March 2007, this collaborative Web site is intended for preparing
      users for the exhibition visit. It is a preview of a periodical called <em>l’Amateur,</em> intended
      to bring new theoretical reflection on Art and cultural practices to the
      public.</p>
    <p>This Web site offers access to the “Signed views” created
      during the exhibition, together with an analytical tool shared by all.
      The visitor is also able to access on this Web site: :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Biographies, film listings of both directors, and related texts and
        photos,</li>
      <li>Vocal correspondences produced by critics and downloadable as podcasts,</li>
      <li>Document engineering tools (description criteria, vocabulary, search
        engines, semantic links),</li>
      <li>An on-line version of “Lignes de temps” allowing Wikipedia-like
        annotation but on temporal objects,</li>
      <li>PA personal space for managing publications, sharing, annotation organization,
        RSS aggregation, etc,</li>
      <li>Downloadable off-line tools allowing those who accessed the films in
        DVD or VOD form to process annotations directly on the video stream,
        keeping full integrity of the film thanks to the non-destructive synchronization
        system of the software. </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>4. <em>Espace Critique</em> And Annotation On Mobiles</h1>
    <p>The <em>espace critique</em> of the Erice - Kiarostami exhibition is made
      up of eight computers located at the entrance to the gallery. It is open
      to visitors willing to use the PDAs offered in order to record their vocal,
      textual and photo comments while visiting the exhibition. This visit with
      a PDA is preferably performed after a first visit without a mobile device.
      When the PDAs are returned after the visit, comments on them will be uploaded
      on the server. The users will then recover their comments on the computers
      of the <em>espace critique</em> and may start, if they wish, to synchronize
      them with the timecode of the films, modify them, or enrich them. They
      are also able to access the comments of other visitors. This working space
      dedicated to new practices of amateurs is also open to spectators of the
      film retrospective programmed in Centre Pompidou cinemas, after they viewed
      the films.</p>
    <p>To sum up, the <em>espace critique</em> brings together:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Complementary documents: </strong>Multimedia
        documents linked to the films bring elements for enriching the context
        of the films (links with the film bibliographies, organization and map
        of the exhibition, etc), or propose Signed views of artists, critics
        or film makers. These documents may be text, image, video, or audio elements.</li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Vocal correspondences:</strong> They
        are created specifically for the exhibition and are recorded by cinema
        critics or arise from thei texts (Alain Bergala, Jean-Louis Comolli,
        Youssef Ishaghpour, Marcos Uzal,…). They are available in the
        form of podcasts.<strong></strong></li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Signed views</strong>: They are realized
        with <em>Lignes de temps</em> and take the form of different multimedia
        rendering forms. They support and illustrate the way critics navigate
        inside a film or several films.</li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Mobile devices:</strong> Visitors may
        use the PDAs of the exhibition or their mobile phones if they allow recording
        capabilities (vocal, textual, photo). Mobile devices also allow visitors
        to receive the vocal correspondences and other information related to
        the exhibition. An important and distinctive aspect of the system is
        that the comments are synchronized with the objects of the exhibition
        or with precise timecode of the films. This is possible because visitors
        are asked to take a photo of what they are going to comment on before
        commenting, and also because PDA can record the general clock of the
        exhibition. </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>5. Cine Lab</h1>
    <p>Cine Lab is a new research project (2007-2008), supported by the French
      Ministries of Research and Culture. It aims to push further our collaborative
      framework in the education domain, specifically for large film archives
      and in conjunction with DVD and VoD distribution, since annotations produced
      and shared by amateurs (including on mobiles) remain independent of the
      films themselves. Partners working with Centre Pompidou are Forum des Images
      (Paris Film Library), LIRIS (CNRS-Lyon I) and Antenna Audio (Discovery
      group). Its goal is to design and experiment with a system for film annotation
      and the production of film metadata and editorial materials (using innovative
      tools for audio comments, recordings, photo, video catch-up and typed texts)
      from various media, including mobile devices. Annotations remain independent
      of the subject film in order to be freely shared over networks, so that
      any user can get them and synchronize them with the film in its integrity
      on any format (DVD, video file, streamed video). Annotations are produced
      following independent ontologies and description schemes and will be shared
      using latest XML Web 2.0 recommendations.</p>
    <p class="Texte" align="left" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Project objectives
        targets:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Semantic schemes modeling, relevant to cinema but generic in this field</li>
      <li>Description, annotation and rendering tools </li>
      <li>Multimodal annotation interfaces</li>
      <li>Annotation sharing in a community-based editorial context. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Project impact is expected on four applications:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Editorial production and film critics: annotation tools and multi-support
        publishing</li>
      <li>Education: tools for annotation, courses and tutorials</li>
      <li>Libraries and film archives: LAN based and Internet based system for
        AV annotation and sharing </li>
      <li>Mobility: Multimedia Audio guides, PDA &amp; mobiles adapted for recording
        and synchronization, Portable DVD &amp; Laptop extended for navigation
        and annotation. </li>
    </ul>
