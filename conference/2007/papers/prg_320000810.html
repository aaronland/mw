    <p class="abstractText">In the fall of 2004 the Smithsonian American Art
      Museum’s (SAAM) Web team proposed creating a blog. The museum had
      been closed for renovation since January, 2000, and was scheduled to reopen
      July 2006. Our Web team wanted to connect our on-line content with our
      museum’s mission and soon-to-be galleries full of art. The goal was
      to engage our audiences in conversations connecting their American experiences
      with the artworks in our collection. </p>
    <p class="abstractText">A blog would be a very different type of Web offering
      for SAAM. New content would be produced at an accelerated rate, more than
      we were used to. Encouraging conversations with our viewers would require
      constant attention. As each museum office was gearing up for our reopening,
      there was concern about additional workload. How much time and what resources
      would this new project take?  The Web team believed the benefits of
      producing a blog outweighed the possible liabilities. We began to develop
      a project management plan that clearly defined the benefits, roles and
      responsibilities, subject matter, and workflow. Then we met with key staff
      and administrators to convey these details. Once the project was approved,
      we developed a pilot project to refine the scope and time constraints on
      museum staff. </p>
    <p class="abstractText">In the year since we launched Eye Level (<a href="../http://eyelevel.si.edu/" target="_blank">http://eyelevel.si.edu</a>)
      to the public, we have continued to evaluate and expand story ideas, monitor
      workload issues, and refine our workflow to make it more efficient. <em>Eye
      Level</em> is a study in process and
      teamwork. </p>

    <h1>Why Publish a Museum Blog?</h1>
    <p>The Smithsonian American Art Museum’s main galleries
      had been closed for six and one-half years for renovation. Yet we had been “open” on
      the Web during that entire period. In those  years, much had changed
      about Web development in general and how it relates to museum practice
      in particular. With our reopening we had the opportunity to use new tools
      to connect with our on-line visitors and connect our Web offerings with
      our about-to-be-reopened galleries. </p>
    <p>In addition, we saw an opportunity to strengthen our
      connection with younger audiences: twenty- and thirty-somethings who were
      getting much of their news and cultural information on-line. In the long
      term, these young people would eventually become sixty and seventy-year-olds
      with cultural capital, time, money, and even art collections. </p>
    <p>The blog was also a way to highlight our assets with
      high impact at low cost. The project fit well with our museum’s mission
      to connect Americans’ experiences with our artworks. It reflected
      SAAM’s tagline: “A destination museum for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.” Connecting
      our collection and museum activities with the social network also known
      as the “blogosphere” would bring new audiences to our museum’s
      Web sites. We wanted to use viral marketing to create a “buzz” as
      we readied the museum for its debut.</p>

    <h1>Proposing a Blog to the SAAM Community</h1>
    <p>Our initial blog team included the Chief of Information
      Technology, the Head of New Media Initiatives and myself (Lead Producer
      in New Media). As the key authority on our collection, our Head Curator
      joined us to evaluate blog post ideas. Our Publications department would
      edit each post. (Note: At SAAM, our Web editor is in the Publications department.)
      Once the project was approved, we hired an outside contractor with both
      blogging and art history experience to be our main blogger. </p>
    <p>In early discussions within the blog team, we decided
      a well-planned approach to informing and educating our staff about this
      project was critical. We created a PowerPoint presentation to get initial
      staff feedback. We would need to get final approval from our Director,
      and these initial presentations helped us refine our scope and presentation.
      We could now anticipate questions and concerns.</p>
    <p>We also wanted to address staff resources. As we were
      preparing for our reopening, all departments were very busy with their
      own projects. We needed to be sensitive to ‘adding yet another undertaking’ to
      everyone’s already full load. It was important to show that we could
      sustain Eye Level with a limited
      amount of help from the rest of the museum. </p>
    <p>The blog would build community, connect to our museum’s
      mission, and be used as a powerful marketing tool in a ‘conversational
      mode’ rather than just a ‘broadcast mode.’ Rather than
      just disseminating information, as had been the role of museums for most
      of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, we wanted to use the blog to encourage
      a dialogue with our viewers. </p>
    <h1>A Slow and Deliberate Rollout</h1>
    <p>We chose Six Apart’s Typepad
        (<a href="../http://typepad.com/" target="_blank">http://typepad.com</a>) as our blog
        content management system (CMS). It was inexpensive ($149/year) and offered
        free technical support. Most blog CMS’s require mySQL or php. The
        Smithsonian’s concern for security issues prevented us from using
        these alternatives (although Six Apart’s Moveable Type Enterprise
        edition now uses Oracle or SQL databases). </p>
    <p>Once we hired our outside contractor and the blog
      was designed and functioning, we began to publish stories internally to
      the blog team. Our strategy was to move slowly. We wanted to become familiar
      with our publishing process. This allowed us to fine tune our workflow
      and backend. After a few weeks we opened the blog to all SAAM staff for
      their feedback. Two months later, we went live. </p>
    <p>The decision to publish Eye Level internally,
        indefinitely if need be, until everyone was comfortable with it was important
        in overcoming early skepticism about how this project would function
        within our organization.</p>
    <h1>Workflow</h1>
    <p>We use Basecamp’s Writeboard (http://<a href="../http://www.basecamphq.com/" target="_blank">www.basecamphq.com</a>)
      to publish each post for internal review. An author places his initial
      story on the Writeboard. Initial discussion by the entire blog team takes
      place there. When complete it goes to our Publications department for editing.
      Coding and image preparation take place concurrently. After editing, the
      piece goes to our Director. As part of our blog team, our Director is in
      a  unique position to offer insights to the subjects we are discussing,
      and this also allows her to become familiar with this new medium. Once
      the piece is complete it is put in the queue for publication. </p>
    <p>Anyone on the blog team can propose a piece. And we
      have had interest from other museum staff as well. Our lighting designer
      has written two posts about his work, for example.</p>
    <p>Some posts are timely and these get priority, while
      others are more ‘evergreen’and can be posted at any
      time. There are numerous issues that can delay updating the blog, including
      not enough new content, long discussions about content, delays in editing,
      and waiting for final sign off. The roles and responsibilities of each
      team member in this process are clearly defined. As Managing Editor it
      is my job to keep an eye on each story as it makes its way through the
      workflow and juggle publication schedules when necessary. I notify our
      Chief when the story is ready to go up to the Director, and he passes it
      on to her.</p>
    <p>Our initial goal was to publish at least two posts
      a week. During our first full year we exceeded our goal by publishing 108
      stories.</p>
    <h1>Story Ideas: Changing as the Situation Warrants</h1>
    <p>Defining the parameters of our blog before we started
      publishing was important. What did we want to talk about, and how did we
      want to talk about it? An early definition of a blog (circa 2001-2004)
      was a site that had frequent informal postings with links to other blogs
      and Web sites. Back then the blogosphere hotly debated this definition.
      Could storytelling and journal sites be blogs? This debate has since subsided
      in the general community. Now a blog can be anything and in any form. </p>
    <p>Early on we decided our workflow could not support
      quick spontaneous blog posts that react to current events. More like <em>The
      New Yorker</em> than the <em>New
      York Times</em>, our stories would offer
      fewer current events and more reflective pieces on current art and museum
      practice. We wanted to convey a sense of quality about what we said. Robert
      Scoble and Shel Israel (2006), in their book <em>Naked Conversations,</em> suggest
      that showing your passion and authority when blogging is a way to be successful.
      Our goal was to bring a thoughtful behind-the-scenes look to what was going
      on as we prepared for reopening, to promote discussions on artists and
      American art, whether it be here or elsewhere, and to enlarge our audience
      and to connect our content to the social network that is the blogosphere. </p>
    <p>While our initial proposal was to do two posts a week,
      the one major exception to this was the weekend we reopened. We decided
      the event demanded we blog live on July 1 and July 2, opening weekend.
      We moved blog central from our offices across the street from the museum
      to a room within the museum. Our blog team grew to include others from
      our department, and with high-speed net access we even hosted other outside
      bloggers who were covering the event. During the opening weekend we blogged
      eight stories. </p>
    <p>After the museum opened, we had to shift our attention
      to a new reality: we were no longer ramping up to reopen. We <em>were</em> open.
      So we had to refocus on new ways of writing about SAAM. We discovered we
      could say a lot very succinctly with a photograph and a short caption (which
      shortened the story’s development time). We started a new category
      with these photos called <em>Picture This</em> and
      adjusted our workflow to create ‘quick’ posts. </p>
    <p>After we opened we had two new and very unique centers
      in the museum: The Luce Foundation Center for American Art (<a href="../http://americanart.si.edu/luce" target="_blank">http://AmericanArt.si.edu/luce</a>),
      an open study/storage facility displaying over thirty-five hundred objects
      from the collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Lunder
      Conservation Center (<a href="../http://americanart.si.edu/lunder" target="_blank">http://AmericanArt.si.edu/lunder</a>),
      an open conservation lab. We included photographs of conservators working
      on artworks in <em>Picture This</em> and
      began a new feature called <em>In This Case,</em> highlighting
      interesting objects found in our open storage area. This was a way to bring
      interesting aspects of our museum to the surface.</p>
    <h1>PR versus Insightful Content</h1>
    <p>In blog posts about SAAM, a fine line can separate interesting
      content from press release-type posts. If <em>Eye Level </em>were
      seen merely as a PR tool, our community would start to take note and lose
      interest. By defining our blog’s parameters from the outset we can
      scrutinize each post as it develops in order to navigate this fine line.
      We strive to be authentic, truthful and transparent; use a human voice;
      and talk about and link to other museums/competitors whenever possible
      to interact with the blog social network. </p>
    <h1>Controversy</h1>
    <p>Controversy is an inevitable part of blogging. But
      there are ways to be prepared for it when it occurs. Comments on <em>Eye
      Level </em>are moderated; this allows
      us to view them before they go live. We developed a comment policy before
      launching the blog and state it clearly on each comment page. Critical
      comments are published and we reply to them on-line, even if it is to say
      we will think about it and respond in more detail later. This gives the
      commenter the feeling we are being responsive and gives us time to decide
      how best to address the issue. Trolls and flames are deleted. If a comment
      is confusing, we will contact the writer for clarification. With the writer’s
      cooperation we can edit his or her comment for clarity. </p>
    <p>The comfort level of your organization will determine
      the controversy limits you will be able to tolerate. Think about this zone
      when you are first defining your blog. Discuss it with administrators and
      others on your blog team. Limit surprises by being prepared.</p>
    <h1>Managing Editor: A Necessary Position?</h1>
    <p>Adding Managing Editor to my job description was not
      part of our initial plan. But as project manager I was in the best position
      to coordinate the numerous aspects of an organizational blog. This part
      of my job takes from 30% – 40% of my time and includes running editorial
      meetings, creating blog post schedules, updating the team weekly on where
      each blog post is in the workflow, moderating comments, researching and
      formatting images, and alerting our team whenever there is a bottleneck.  </p>
    <p>Depending on the nature of your institutional blog,
      you may or may not need a managing editor. If you decide to make it more
      open-ended, simple rules for posting might suffice. But someone should
      monitor your blog’s posts and comments. </p>
    <h1>Connecting to the Social Network (Web 2.0)</h1>
    <p>Connecting to the social network is one of the main
      reasons we started a blog at SAAM. We were hoping to create an area of
      our Web site where conversations about American art could take place. And
      there are a number of methods for connecting to this network of people
      interested in what we have to say.</p>
    <p>Creating RSS feeds helps more readers access your
      information. Tagging posts via social network sites like Technorati, flickr,
      and del.icio.us allows for greater visibility. Through networks like these, <em>Eye
      Level</em> is linked to by over 500 other
      blogs. This is huge for a cultural blog like ours and further proof that
      we are successfully connecting to this social network. </p>
    <p>In our first year we had over 127,000 visitors to <em>Eye
        Level. </em>We invested in a good statistic
        program (<a href="../http://extremetracking.com/" target="_blank">http://extremetracking.com</a>).
        It is inexpensive (about $55/year) and we can see where our readers are
        coming from and who’s linking to us. We use Feedburner (<a href="../http://feedburnder.com/" target="_blank">http://feedburnder.com</a>)
        to monitor the number of people subscribing to our blog via RSS. While
        deciphering stats is still being debated (what is the best metric: visits
        or page views, for instance), they give you and your administration one
        benchmark for success. </p>
    <p>We are still trying to determine why certain posts
      result in a large number of comments and others do not. Our two most commented-upon
      posts were on the contemporary artist Dana Schutz and on the Noguchi Museum&#39;s
      exhibition, <em>The Imagery of Chess Revisited.</em> Schutz&#39;s
      piece had already been a topic of discussion in popular culture due to
      recent coverage of her in Vogue Magazine and in the art community.  In
      the second case, the large numbers of chess players today must have brought
      in a crossover audience that accounted for the boost in the comments on
      the Noguchi exhibition.</p>
    <p>Through our stats we get to know our readers. I’ve
      often written comments on referrer sites or spoken with them directly.
      All these methods help develop relationships with others interested in
      your field. This is the social network: Web 2.0.</p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Eye Level began
        as an attempt to: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Connect
        our artworks to the American Experience in a new way</li>
      <li>Create
        a dialogue between our Web offerings and our bricks and mortar activities</li>
      <li>Create
        interesting new Web content on an ongoing basis and in an efficient    manner</li>
      <li>Allow
        viewers a behind-the-scenes look at what takes place in our museum</li>
      <li>Connect
        to Internet social networks to enlarge our audience and ultimately bring
        people into our museum</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our continuing success can be attributed to our adopting
      a process that allows for growth as well as connecting <em>Eye Level </em>to
      the changing roles of our museum at the beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
      In many ways, our experience has led to more questions than answers. How
      can we reach out to an even wider audience? What tools can we adapt for
      this to take place? If our blog is the first step in this new engagement
      with our communities, what will be next? </p>
