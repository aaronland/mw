      <p class="abstractText">Museum Web sites, like the cultural institutions
        they represent, must serve the needs of a wide array of users, from elementary-school
        students to scholars, and everyone in between. How can a museum make
        its site relevant and, dare we say, compelling, to these diverse audiences?
        At the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) we have taken a user-centered
        approach to finding an answer. In spring 2006, we partnered with Hot
        Studio, a leading user-centered design firm, to conduct an intensive
        research and strategy project as part of a larger Web site redesign initiative.
        Our project employed a variety of research methods that are considered
        best practices in user-centered design, including an extensive on-line
        survey of site visitors, live interviews with site users and SFMOMA staff,
        and a think tank with representatives from national and international
        institutions. This paper, co-authored by SFMOMA and Hot Studio, presents
        an overview of user-centered design research tools and methods. We present
        the findings from our own research, and we demonstrate how these findings
        led to tangible design features in the plans for our new site. Readers
        will get the benefit of our research findings and come away with a deeper
        understanding of the value of research as well as some fresh ideas on
        how to incorporate user-centered design techniques into their own work.</p>

    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Museum Web sites, like the cultural institutions they represent, must
      serve the needs of a wide array of users, from elementary-school students
      to scholars and everyone in between. How do we know who these users are
      and what they want? How can we make our site relevant and, dare we say,
      compelling, to these diverse audiences?</p>
    <p>At the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), we have taken a user-centered
      approach to finding an answer. In spring 2006 we partnered with Hot Studio,
      a leading user-centered design firm, to conduct an intensive research and
      strategy project as part of the development of a new SFMOMA Web site scheduled
      to launch in early 2008.</p>
    <p>In this paper we share some of the unexpected things we learned (for example,
      our visitors include more business and finance people than designers and
      educators!) and cover the background of how this project came to be. We
      give an overview of the research tools and methods we used, share our findings,
      and give concrete examples of how we applied these findings to our new
      Web site design. And, finally, we offer tips for conducting your own user
      research on a budget.</p>
    <h1>Why a Redesign?</h1>
    <p>The SFMOMA Web site redesign initiative began in 2005, when the museum
      decided that a complete front- and back-end revamp of sfmoma.org was long
      overdue. The site, which was launched in 1995, receives in excess of two
      million visits annually – more than triple the number of visits to
      the SFMOMA building. Yet almost ten years have passed since the site was
      last redesigned (in 1998), twice the lifespan of a typical Web site. Although
      the visual design of our site has aged relatively well and our traffic
      is continuing to rise steadily, the underlying code is obsolete, and the
      information architecture is inflexible;  even the most minor updates
      are major undertakings. Furthermore, several of our peers have redesigned
      their sites within the past few years, offering fresh designs, enhanced
      educational resources, opportunities for on-line giving, easy membership
      registration, and improved e-commerce experiences. If SFMOMA is to retain
      its current audiences – and build new ones – its Web site must
      advance along these lines and offer the wide array of on-line services
    and features that today’s sophisticated users have come to expect. </p>
    <h1>Why User-Centered Design?</h1>
    <p>Once we decided to undertake a complete visual, functional, and technical
      redesign, we wanted to do it right. The last time the SFMOMA site was redesigned,
      there was no user research or testing to speak of, and the primary focus
      was on the visual aspect. The field of user-centered Web design was still
      emerging at that time, and rigorous research was not the norm for non-profit
      and museum sites. For most museums, SFMOMA included, it was enough to have
      an attractive and up-to-date site. This time around, however, understanding
      our target audience was our number-one priority. We felt the best way to
      achieve this was to enlist the expertise of outside professionals who live
      and breathe user-centered design.</p>
    <p>User-centered (also called human-centered) design is exactly what it sounds
      like: design based on the needs of users, as opposed to the needs of the
      people who are executing the design. Much has been written about the field – some
      of those resources are listed at the end of this paper – and many
      organizations have used it to great effect. Still, however, only 25 percent
      of American businesses today actually conduct customer research (Terry,
      2004). Too often, organizations avoid doing research because they think
      it is too expensive. But we knew that spending money up front on research
      would generate income in the long run by making our users happy (and therefore
      more willing to spend time – and money – on our site). We also
      believed that this approach would result in a site that was more efficient
      to manage and maintain.</p>
    <h1>Qualitative Benefits </h1>
    <p class="listwithbullets">We knew there was a lot to gain from the user-centered
      approach. In our case, we expected the following qualitative benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Increased visitor satisfaction</strong><br/>
        If our site is a pleasure to use and relevant information is easy to
          find, users will experience an overall higher satisfaction with the
          site and with SFMOMA in general. While this is certainly a qualitative
          benefit, it is also something that can be quantified through before-and-after
          surveys.</li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Increased awareness of SFMOMA’s
          offerings</strong><strong><br/>
        </strong>A better site experience will make our visitors more aware of
        what SFMOMA has to offer and more likely to visit the brick-and-mortar
        museum.</li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Increased operational efficiency</strong><strong><br/>
        </strong>If the site improves the front- and back-end of key tasks such
        as buying or renewing memberships or purchasing products from the store,
        we gain some efficiencies in how we fulfill these transactions –  and,
        we hope, increase the number of transactions as well.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Quantitative Benefits </h1>
    <p>Studies have proven that user-centered design has measurable results.
      For example, Nielsen has found that Web sites demonstrate an increase across
      several usability metrics, including site traffic and sales/conversion
      rates, by an average of 135 percent after a user-centered redesign (Nielsen,
      2003). </p>
    <p>For our project, we identified a handful of very specific tasks that we
      wanted to impact through the redesign. This gave us some specific metrics
      that we could use both to benchmark our progress over time and to identify
      areas for ongoing refinements. These metrics included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Memberships purchased or renewed on-line </li>
      <li>On-line sales from the museum store </li>
      <li>Donations collected on-line</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Project Funding and Goals</h1>
    <p>To pay for this undertaking, we applied to the Haas Jr. Foundation to
      fund a $30,000 five-month Web site audience research project. We applied
      the grant funds toward hiring an outside firm. We chose to seek help outside
      the museum for several reasons. Our in-house staff did not have the bandwidth
      to take on such a project. We also felt that we would gain valuable knowledge
      and expertise from a firm that conducts user research with many different
      industries. If we worked on this project with experts, our in-house staff
      might gain valuable experience that could be applied to future projects.
      And, finally, we knew that determining what needed to change on our current
      site would be better received internally if it came from a neutral third
      party. The departmental politics of projects like these should not be underestimated. </p>
    <p>Before contacting potential outside firms, we identified what was important
      to us in a partner: physical proximity (to allow for face-to-face collaboration),
      a range of expertise of the individual team members, and the company’s
      overall commitment to user-centered design. After soliciting proposals,
      we chose the San Francisco-based Hot Studio for their reputation in the
      field, their exceptionally strong team, and their extensive experience
      with both commercial and nonprofit organizations.</p>
    <p>Our goal was to develop a nuanced picture of our users and their needs,
      to set institutional priorities for the new site, and to build internal
      consensus along the way. These were just a few of the many questions we
      hoped to answer in this ambitious undertaking:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who really uses our site, and what do they like and dislike about it?</li>
      <li>Should we think of our Web site as an extension of the museum building,
        or as a destination unto itself?</li>
      <li>How can our Web site encourage people to become visitors to the physical
        building, members of the museum, or even donors?</li>
      <li>How knowledgeable are our current site users about art, and what is
        our role in educating them?</li>
      <li>How much detail do people need about our collection and exhibitions
        (and do they even understand the difference between the two)?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To answer these questions, Hot Studio applied several best-practice methodologies,
      described in the next section. </p>
    <h1>What We Did</h1>
    <p>We had to be selective about what types of research activities to undertake.
      This was not an academic exercise for us; our research had to answer the
      questions above, and it had to be actionable. We concentrated our efforts
      primarily on interviews and surveys with end users and SFMOMA staff, while
      leveraging knowledge and expertise from museum experts. The project took
      approximately four months to complete. </p>
    <p>Our research activities included the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Best practices and heuristic evaluation</strong><strong><br/>
        </strong>We reviewed numerous other museum sites, including the Best
        of the Web winners from past Museums and the Web conferences, and identified
        positive features relevant to our project’s goals. Because we brought
        in an outside firm to lead this effort, we had the benefit of fresh eyes
        on our own site as well as on those of our peers. Together with Hot Studio
        we also conducted a heuristic evaluation against the SFMOMA site. A heuristic
        evaluation involves analyzing and critiquing a Web site to assess its
        compliance with some basic usability principles, or heuristics, such
        as consistency and user control (Nielsen, 1994). More details on how
        to conduct a heuristic evaluation can be found at the end of this paper.</li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">On-line survey<br/>
        </strong>We launched a one-week survey from the SFMOMA home page. More
        than six hundred site visitors participated. We offered participants
        a $5 Amazon.com credit or SFMOMA museum store coupon in return for completing
        the survey. The results gave us great insights into our visitors’ demographics
        as well as the content and features they want and need. </li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Interviews with new and returning Web
          visitors</strong><strong><br/>
        </strong>We interviewed twelve target users over the phone about their
        site-related needs and expectations. We recruited them through a pop-up
        window that included some screening questions (to ensure a mix of members
        and non-members from various geographic locations). We found these interviews
        tremendously grounding in terms of our perception of who our on-line
        visitors are, what they need from us, and their relationships with art
        and with the museum.</li>
      <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Other activities<br/>
        </strong>Other activities that we conducted as part of our research included
        a museum think tank session, a review of existing research and data,
        and a technical assessment. The start date of our project dovetailed
        nicely with the 2006 Museums and the Web conference, so we invited nine
        conference attendees to get together in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for
        a think tank discussion about various Web-oriented activities and emerging
        trends. The discussion, facilitated by Hot Studio, helped us understand
        how other institutions address challenges similar to ours. Back at SFMOMA,
        we reviewed an extensive collection of research materials that had been
        collected by various groups within the museum, including Web traffic
        reports, internal documents, and several years of in-building visitor
        surveys. And finally, we met with our IT department to discuss institutional
        needs and technical requirements for the redesign.<strong></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What We Learned</h1>
    <p>Our research yielded a wealth of insights that helped us develop a clearer
      understanding of our users and how we could better serve them. Below are
      some highlights from our findings:</p>
    <h2>Finding 1. “I may not be an art expert, but that doesn’t
      mean I’m not interested in art.”</h2>
    <p>One of our assumptions at the beginning of the project was that our site
      visitors were predominantly scholars, educators, researchers, or individuals
      with some type of professional art background. We couldn’t have been
      more wrong. Our surveys and interviews showed that site visitors included
      everyone from human resource managers to engineers. (One even identified
      himself as a farmer!) This had a big impact on how we saw the role of our
      site in educating and serving the public.  Just over half of the survey
      respondents told us their occupations, which we grouped into the following
    general categories: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>18.56%: Business/Finance/Technology professionals</li>
      <li>16.47%: Students</li>
      <li>12.28%: Architects/Designers</li>
      <li>8.68%: Teachers/Educators</li>
      <li>8.38%: Other</li>
      <li>7.49%: Artists</li>
      <li>6.89%: Healthcare professionals</li>
      <li>6.29%: Professors/Art Historians/Researchers</li>
      <li>3.89%: Museum/Gallery professionals</li>
      <li>3.29%: Retired</li>
      <li>2.99%: Publishing professionals</li>
      <li>2.69%: Scientists/Engineers</li>
      <li>2.10%: Lawyers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Finding 2. “Help me understand the art.”</h2>
    <p>Although the majority of our users aren’t art professionals, they
      do have a strong interest in learning about art. Our research showed that
      the information we are currently providing does not go far enough to expand
      our users’ understanding of our artworks and exhibitions. Users want
      a narrative experience that is clearly presented in <em>accessible </em>language.
      They also want the human story behind the art: <em>who is this artist,
      in other words, and why should I care?</em> They want someone or something
      to connect with as an entry point rather than a more technical or art-historical
      presentation. </p>
    <h2>Finding 3. “How are you different from any other museum?”</h2>
    <p>The on-line survey and interviews made it clear that visitors are not
      aware of SFMOMA’s distinctive character and the cutting-edge, contemporary
      aspects of the institution. Our Web site needs to convey more clearly who
      we are, why we are here, and what that means to the public. It needs to
      help users understand what kinds of art and what sort of overall experience
      they can expect at the physical museum. </p>
    <h2>Finding 4. “SFMOMA is just a place to see art.”</h2>
    <p>Beyond the art, users have no sense of the things going on at SFMOMA and
      the breadth of resources and content we offer on-line. They think of the
      physical institution simply as a place to view artworks, and our Web site
      as no more than a place to get information about the art. The site needs
      to provide intuitive access to our various on-line resources and better
      promote SFMOMA’s many activities and offerings.</p>
    <h2>Finding 5. “Help me find what I need.”</h2>
    <p>For people looking to accomplish specific tasks or find particular information,
      our current site can be very difficult or even impossible to navigate.
      We need a more intuitive navigational framework to aid users’ overall
      comprehension of the site, and it needs to offer more information.</p>
    <p>The following excerpts from our survey present a sense of what people
      are looking for on our site, or hope to find there in the future. (Note
      that only the top three responses are listed below, and that users could
      make multiple selections).</p>
    <h3>“Why are you visiting the site today?”</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>65%: To get information on current exhibitions</li>
      <li>43%: To get information on museum hours, directions, parking, etc.</li>
      <li>14%: To view the collection on-line</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> “What things would you like to be able to do on the SFMOMA
    site in the future?”</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>61%: Find out if a specific artwork is currently on view</li>
      <li>47%: Receive event reminders</li>
      <li>40%: Watch videos of artists, lectures and interviews</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Finding 6. “Help me plan my trip.”</h2>
    <p>At the beginning of the project, we struggled with whether we should think
      of our site as an extension of the physical museum or as a destination
      unto itself. Our research made the answer clear: the vast majority of users
      are coming to the site to learn what is on view in the building and to
      facilitate their in-person visits. Therefore, the content and tools we
      provide on-line should ultimately lead to, and enhance, in-person interactions
      with the art. </p>
    <h1>What We’re Doing About It</h1>
    <p>Our research helped us envision a new site that will better convey the
      breadth and magnitude of SFMOMA’s offerings. It will encourage our
      visitors to interact with the artwork, and make their eventual visit to
      the physical museum more meaningful. </p>
    <p>In the following examples, we explain how our findings translated into
      tangible site design ideas. In each case, we start with the original finding,
      then the insight we gained from that finding, and finally the design application.
      Some of the examples include screenshots from our schematics. These schematics,
      or “wireframes,” do not represent the final visual design of
      the new site, but rather are intended to convey content organization and
      page elements that will appear there.</p>
    <h2>Example 1. Collections vs. Exhibitions</h2>
    <p><strong>The finding: </strong>The vast majority of visitors want to know
      what is on view at SFMOMA regardless of whether the artwork is part of
      our collection or part of a temporary exhibition.</p>
    <p><strong>The insight:</strong> Most visitors do not intuitively understand
      the difference between “collections” and “exhibitions” and
      are confused by those categories as they are presented on the current Web
      site. While this distinction may be important in the museum world, the
      majority of our visitors don’t know or care about it. </p>
    <p style="text-autospace:none;"><strong>The design:</strong> We decided to
      meld the two sections into a new category called “On View.” The
      main page of this section mixes images of works from temporary exhibitions
      with images of collection objects that are currently in the galleries.
      This allows users to discover what they can currently see at SFMOMA, or
      to perform searches across what is on view if they are looking for specific
      works. </p>
    <h2>Example 2. Breadth And Depth Of On-Line And On-Site Content And Programs</h2>
    <p><strong>The finding:</strong> Our audience is not aware of what we have
      to offer. </p>
    <p><strong>The insight: </strong>On-line, we offer everything from information
      on lectures and public programs to streaming media footage of artists at
      work, but users are not aware of most of this. </p>
    <p><strong>The design: </strong>We need to find ways to highlight the variety
      of public programs happening at the museum, and to expose the rich educational
      materials available on-line.</p>
    <p>The new home page (Fig. 1, Screenshot of Homepage schematic) will promote
      SFMOMA’s programs, upcoming events, and announcements in a much more
      aggressive manner than the current home page (Fig. 2, SFMOMA Homepage, <a href="../http://www.sfmoma.org/">http://www.sfmoma.org</a>).
      Right now, for example, we dedicate a very small portion of the page to
      one-line, text-based news items, whereas the new home page will devote
      much more screen real estate to enticing visitors to explore our on-line
      and off-line offerings. </p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a><a href="mitroff-fig1.html"><img src="mitroff_fig1_thumbnail.gif" alt="Fig 1: Screenshot of Homepage schematic " width="400" height="256" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 1: Screenshot of Homepage schematic </p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a><a href="mitroff-fig2.html"><img src="mitroff_fig2_thumbnail.gif" alt="Fig 2: SFMOMA Homepage http://www.sfmoma.org" width="400" height="334" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 2: SFMOMA Homepage <a href="../http://www.sfmoma.org/" target="_blank">http://www.sfmoma.org </a></p>
    <p>We also need to extend the promotion of events and content to second-level
      pages. On new screens devoted to individual artworks, we will highlight
      relevant public programs and on-line content related to that artist or
      object. For example, on the screen for Frida Kahlo’s painting<em> Frieda
      and Diego Rivera, </em>there could be prominent links to related events
      and programs (such as a docent tour that includes works by Kahlo and Rivera
      or a lecture on post-revolutionary Mexico), streaming video of a contemporary
      artist discussing Kahlo’s work, and pictures of Kahlo and Rivera
      at their home in Mexico. </p>
    <h2>Example 3. Web 2.0</h2>
    <p><strong>The finding:</strong> When we talked with our users about potential
      Web 2.0 features we could offer on our site (blogs, wikis, etc.), they
      showed surprisingly little interest in them. The users we interviewed were
      fairly passive about the types of interactive things they would like to
      do on our site. Instead of asking an artist a question, they would rather
      read what other people asked. Instead of giving feedback about an exhibition,
      they would rather read what other people wrote.</p>
    <p><strong>The insight:</strong> We realized that if we were going to add
      any of these new types of Web 2.0 features, we should not invest in designing
      things that our visitors would not use. And if we were to incorporate any
      of these features in the future, they should extend the interpretation
      dimension and make the artwork more accessible.</p>
    <p><strong>The design:</strong> In addition to providing an authoritative
      museum perspective on an artwork, we must include features that incorporate
      perspectives from a variety of users, from front-line staff to visitors.
      On the “On View” main page, for example, we plan to include
      a feature called something along the lines of “Guest Take” that
      will present rotating works from SFMOMA’s collection selected by
      prominent local community members, artists, writers, museum members, etc.
      These guests will write about what the works mean to them and share their
      personal reactions, thoughts, and musings. Another feature, called something
      like “In Focus,” will allow museum staff members at different
      levels throughout the organization to select works from the collection
      and share their personal thoughts and reactions. This informal, multi-vocal
      approach will bring Web 2.0 values to the site and complement what we are
      already doing with SFMOMA Artcasts, our podcast audio-zine. SFMOMA Artcasts
      feature “Guest Take” commissions of music, poetry, and prose
      in response to works on view as well as “Vox Pop” pieces that
      capture live reflections from visitors in the galleries. We see these as
      methods of engaging the community in a dialogue of art and ideas; they
      are excellent ways to bring Web 2.0 values to the interpretative dimension
      of the museum experience.</p>
    <h2>Example 4. Layering information</h2>
    <p><strong>The finding:</strong> All kinds of people are coming to our site,
      from physical therapists to curators. How can we serve this wide range
      of users most effectively? </p>
    <p><strong>The insight: </strong>General site visitors are looking for very
      different information than scholars and academics are. While academic content
      should be available, it should not get in the way of the experiences of
      general users.</p>
    <p><strong>The design:</strong> (Fig. 3, Detail of Artwork Detail Page schematic)
      The “Artwork Detail” page shows our solution to this problem.
      General information about an artwork, relevant to the majority of site
      visitors, is immediately accessible. More scholarly info is situated on
      a “closed” section of the page that can be “opened.” Once
      opened, it reveals a tabbed interface with detailed information pulled
      from SFMOMA’s collections management system.</p>

    <h1>You Can Do It, Too</h1>
    <p>We were in the fortunate position of having a research grant that allowed
      us to hire an outside firm and invest the necessary time and effort in
      this project. However, there are many ways to incorporate these research
      techniques in-house on a shoestring budget, using tools and resources you
      may already have. Below are just a few examples. </p>
    <h2>On-line surveys</h2>
    <p>On-line surveys are an affordable and easy way to get demographic information
      about the people coming to your site and what they are looking for. You
      can also use surveys to ask questions about new features or content you
      are considering for your site. Using a hosted service such as Survey Monkey
      or Zoomerang will range in price from nothing (for the most basic service)
      to $350 per year for more advanced features. We used Zoomerang’s
      professional subscription. Not only can you easily create
      your own custom survey, but you can also access the results in an on-line
      report and then cross-tabulate the data. We offered users an incentive
      to take our survey (a $5 coupon redeemable at Amazon.com or at our museum
      store), but 30 percent of them opted to “donate back” the $5
      to SFMOMA.</p>
    <h2>Interviews with end users</h2>
    <p>One-on-one interviews with real users can offer invaluable insights into
      how they think. While you can spend a lot of money hiring outside interviewers
      and a recruiting firm to find interviewees, you don’t have to. To
      save money on recruiting costs, start with your own network. Send an e-mail
      explaining the type of people you want to interview to all your contacts,
      and ask them to send it to every suitable person who fits that description.
      You can also recruit by posting notices at local universities or on-line
      through Craigslist and other community-based sites. We recruited through
      our own site with a pop-up form that asked users for some basic information
      (age range, geographic location, and whether they were members) and then
      followed up over the phone with the respondents who matched our criteria.
      We offered an incentive to participants (a $25 Amazon.com coupon), which
      they all accepted.</p>
    <p>For the interviews, develop a script with open-ended questions that do
      not lead people to particular answers. Try to limit your script to a dozen
      or so questions to prevent “interview fatigue,” and focus on
      the areas that will have the biggest impact on your work. For example,
      if you are trying to decide what types of content to provide on your site,
      ask people what they do on the site now (or if they use it at all) and
      what they would like to find, and then follow up with questions about some
      specific features that you have considered adding. And don’t be afraid
      to stray from your script if you sense someone has valuable information
      about a topic that you didn’t anticipate. The script should be a
      guide. The more people you interview, the more patterns you will see emerging
      from their responses. <strong></strong></p>
    <h2>Interviews with internal stakeholders</h2>
    <p>The above technique applies to internal staff as well. People working
      in technology, communications, outreach, and other areas often have a lot
      to share about their needs for communicating with the public. They are
      bound to have insights into your target audiences. To motivate our internal
      stakeholders to communicate with us, we provided snacks at every meeting
      and found that free food works well!</p>
    <h2>Usability testing</h2>
    <p>This is another technique that can get quite expensive but doesn’t
      have to. If you can forgo a professional lab with a one-way mirror, video
      cameras, and a moderator (who will also write up the reports), you can
      conduct your own test quite affordably. All you need is a quiet room and
      paper printouts of your new designs. Formulate a predetermined set of questions
      to ask your users about their impressions of the pages they are viewing
      and the tasks they might need to complete. Take good notes, and keep your
      ears open for unexpected information.</p>
    <h2>Heuristic evaluations</h2>
    <p>There are some basic improvements to your site that you can probably identify
      without doing a lot of user research. The goal of a heuristic evaluation
      is to identify these “no-brainer” types of improvements by
      reviewing some general Web conventions and then analyzing how your site
      measures up. This can be a good exercise for you to do internally because
      it forces you to document necessary improvements that you might otherwise
      overlook. To perform your own heuristic evaluation, start with a list of
      principles for good Web design and click around your site to determine
      if you are meeting these basic standards. You may want to start with a
      set of known heuristics, such as Jacob Nielsen’s ten general principles
      for user interface design, and adapt them to fit your project (Nielsen
      1994).</p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Conducting research to learn who our Web site users are has informed every
      aspect of SFMOMA’s site redesign. By gathering qualitative and quantitative
      data, we have been able to make informed decisions about desirable new
      features and interfaces and justify those decisions to organizational stakeholders.
      From on-line surveys to telephone and in-person interviews, the experience
      of conducting this research has put us in touch with our users and given
      us the confidence to move on to the next phase of the project: visual design
      strategy. During this phase we will refine the schematics we have developed,
      do paper prototype testing with users, and then develop the complete visual
      design for the new site. </p>
