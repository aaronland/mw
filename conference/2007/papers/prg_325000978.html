    <p class="abstractText">When
        planning interactive and electronic signage installations in the new
        de Young museum, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco looked to existing
        Web-based resources to help manage these programs. Our approach was shaped
        by both philosophical and practical concerns, and emphasized the repurposing
        of existing Web content and content types, as well as a familiar back-end
        interface already in use by numerous FAMSF staff members for maximum
        usability and efficiency.</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Over the past ten years, museums have invested in the development of a
      range of digital information resources, from Web sites and collections
      databases to educational interactives, electronic signage and digital audio
      guides. Even a casual review of Museums and the Web proceedings shows that
      new information resources have fundamentally altered the ways museums communicate
      with their audiences. In most cases, the creation and maintenance of new
      digital assets has also required a major commitment of staff time and direct
      financial investment.</p>
    <p>Historically, digital information resources have often been developed
      by museums as stand-alone efforts. The in-gallery educational interactive,
      the Web site, and the signage system are often created and managed by different
      departments. They may be on different, even proprietary, systems. The information
      they present is rarely managed from a central point or shared dynamically
      across different platforms and applications.</p>
    <p>With the opening of the landmark new de Young museum, designed by renowned
      architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron, in October, 2005, the Fine Arts Museums
      of San Francisco (FAMSF) sought to take a more integrated approach to the
      challenge of developing and presenting the digital information resources
      planned for the building. The most obvious direction involved utilizing
      FAMSF’s largest and best-known digital asset, its Web site and landmark
      on-line collection database or ‘ImageBase’, http://www.thinker.org/.
      One of the first of its kind in the museum world, FAMSF on-line collections
      database was launched in 1996, and won ‘Best Research Site’ at
      Museums and the Web 1997. The Web site has since been improved and expanded
      upon over the last nine years.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="fox.fig1.jpg" alt="Fig 1" width="400" height="346"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 1:
        The home page of the FAMSF Web site <a href="../http://www.thinker.org/">http://www.thinker.org</a></p>
    <p>With its existing infrastructure and systems, the Web site was a logical
      point of departure for the digital resources planned for the new de Young.
      These included, and in the end were limited to, three arrays of regularly
      updated electronic signs, and interactive kiosks allowing visitors to explore
      the holdings of the de Young’s textile collections in-depth. The
      data-driven nature of the Web site meant that the nearly all of the museum’s
      collections, programs, and exhibitions were listed on-line, and much of
      this information would necessarily be redeployed in both electronic signage
      and interactive kiosks.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the Web site was powered by a browser-based content management
      system (CMS) - Mediatrope’s Sitebots - that allowed for updating
      of information by non-technical museum staff, and enabled a single Web
      master to maintain a large, diverse Web site in-house. </p>

    <p class="caption">Fig 2:
        The Sitebots CMS </p>
    <p>In concept, it seemed both redundant and impractical to have museum staff
      enter two identical sets of information for two different purposes, and
      the idea was born to harness the power of the CMS to provide data for the
      de Young’s installations. Lastly, there were, as with all museum
      projects, economic concerns. It seemed far more viable to use our existing
      CMS system than pay for the research and development of something new.
      Again, since many of the data types were the same, it seemed the natural
      course to take.</p>

    <p class="caption">Fig 3:
        We elected to leverage Web-based data sources and our Content Management
        System for the signage and Textile interactives at the new de Young.  Data
        is entered once and published to multiple platforms.  The system
        is managed through a single CMS.</p>
    <h1>Textile
        Study Center Interactives</h1>
    <h2>Origins
        and Goals </h2>
    <p>The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (the de Young and its sister museum,
      the Legion of Honor) boast a major textiles collection of more than 20,000
      objects. However, the textile collections remain one of the undiscovered
      jewels of the institution because of limited exhibition space and the fragile
      nature of the objects.  Limited gallery space means that only a tiny
      percentage of the collection is ever on view. While this is an issue for
      the entire museum, (and indeed for most museums), public access is a particular
      challenge with this collection:  the textile galleries rotate more
      frequently than others because of the unique conservation requirements
      of the objects. </p>
    <p>The new de Young museum features several new public spaces dedicated to
      the textile collections.  In addition to expanded galleries, the museum
      includes both research library as well as a textile study center with visible
      storage drawers.  The textile study center is also home to a new educational
      interactive available on two Apple iMac work stations. Expanding public
      access to the textile collections was the primary goal of the new interactives.
      The interactives were also designed to provide an introduction to textiles
      as art objects and artifacts through various perspectives on the Museums’ collections.</p>
    <h2>Building
        On Existing Web-Based Resources</h2>
    <p>In our initial planning for the Textile interactives, we used the Museums’ existing
      Web resources as building blocks. FAMSF’s on-line collections database
      represented one of the Museums’ largest public education resources
      and, at the time, a nine-year investment in collections data and images.
      The on-line collections provided a strong foundation for the interactives.
      In addition, there had long been a desire to find ways of making the on-line
      collections accessible from within the museum, and the interactives offered
      a clear path to achieving this goal.<strong></strong></p>
    <p>However, we didn’t want to simply reproduce the on-line collections
      on a workstation.  The on-line collections contain images and information
      about more than 82,000 objects - 75% of the Museums’ entire collection
      - offering a wide view of FAMSF’s collections.  But the on-line
      collections, despite their scope, lacked depth and context. On-line visitors
      could browse dozens of Anatolian kilim rugs, zooming in to view the objects
      in extraordinary detail, but the on-line collections provided no information
      on, for example, the definition of “kilim” or the location
      of Anatolia.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="fox.fig4.jpg" alt="Fig 4" width="400" height="376"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 4:
        The FAMSF online collections http://www.famsf.org</p>
    <p>Our approach to the interactives was also shaped by lessons learned in
      the creation and management of our Web site. The interactives were designed
      to be easy to modify and expand, and to be managed by non-technical staff.  In
      this case, content development and ongoing maintenance would be done by
      textile curators, using the same CMS that other staff use to manage FAMSF’s
      Web site. </p>
    <h2>Design and Content</h2>
    <p>The interactives provide visitors with many ways to explore and learn
      about a particular object or browse more than 12,000 textile collections
      objects.  The CMS provides the same collections objects as building
      blocks for textile curators to create new content and ‘chapters’ of
      the interactive with text, images, audio, video and Flash animations. </p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="fox.fig5.jpg" alt="Fig 5" width="400" height="250"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 5:
        The Textiles interactive intro screen</p>
    <p>The major sections of the textiles interactives are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collections
        highlights, including European tapestries, Bay Area textile artists,
        fans, footwear, and Iban ceremonial skirts.</li>
      <li>Objects
        on view, such as special exhibitions and objects found in the Textile
        Center’s study drawers.</li>
      <li>Techniques
        such as embroidery, felt, resist dyeing, and lace techniques.</li>
      <li>Geography:
        a detailed map interface allows users to navigate by geography. The geography
        interface also understands the concept of regions. Textile curators can
        create a region (such as Central Asia) and associate countries with it.</li>
      <li>A
        visually annotated glossary of textile terms, where images, video or
        Flash files can be attached to any glossary item. Objects can be attached
        to glossary terms, providing examples drawn from the collections database.</li>
      <li>Links
        to more than 12,000 related textile objects in the FAMSF collections
        at the de Young and the Legion of Honor.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="fox.fig6.jpg" alt="Fig 6" width="400" height="250"/></p>

    <p class="caption">Fig 6:
        Textile Collection Highlights. </p>
    <p>Objects can be interrelated in Sitebots. For example, a series of tapestries
      may be linked together, or a ceremonial headdress and cloak can be connected. </p>
    <p>The interactives are synchronized with the same collections databases
      that provide content for FAMSF’s Web site. When she wishes to add
      new collections information to the interactives, the textiles curator uses
      an import tool within the CMS to import from the 4D collections database.
      The system synchronizes the new data by matching against accession numbers
      to add new records and update existing information. Once in Sitebots, the
      curator can use any of the more than 12,000 textile objects to modify or
      create new sections of the interactive.</p>
    <h2>Technology
        Approach</h2>
    <p>In our overall technical approach to the interactives, we also followed
      a Web-based model. One Web server in the museum’s basement delivers
      all content to the two iMac work stations in the Textile Study Center (the
      same Web server delivers content to the signage as well, but more on that
      below). </p>
    <p>The textile interactives are data-driven Flash applications. The Flash
      is generated by the CMS; no Flash programming is required for content management
      or updating.  Curators use Sitebots, a browser-based CMS to update
      and manage content on the interactives from their desks. </p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="fox.fig7.jpg" alt="Fig 7" width="400" height="250"/></p>

    <p class="caption">Fig 8:
        The corresponding page in Sitebots. </p>
    <p>We built on our current technical infrastructure, expanding our existing
      CMS to accommodate the new tools and content of the interactive. This enabled
      us to develop the interactive at relatively low cost. Equally important,
      we built on existing systems and workflow. The interactives were developed
      with Mediatrope, an outside firm, but they can be supported by the museum
      Web master. </p>
    <h2>Future
        Directions: Returning To The Web And Experimenting With Handhelds</h2>
    <p>Since the de Young opened in October 2005, Textile curators have modified
      and expanded the content on the interactives significantly.  In addition
      to considering new features, like an enhanced search function and new video
      tours, we’re also thinking about new ways to distribute the content
      on the interactive. The interactive has greatly increased the collections
      information available to visitors to the textile study center, but it is
      not lost on us that this educational content is currently limited to those
      who visit this small space within the museum.</p>
    <p>We imagine that the content on the interactive will migrate <em>back</em> to
        the FAMSF Web site. Our original decision to build the interactive on
        a Web-based foundation will serve us well as we complete the circle:
        mounting a version of the interactive on the FAMSF Web site will cost
        relatively little. Moreover, because the interactive and Web site are
        powered by a single CMS, publishing the interactive’s content on
        the Web site will not increase the maintenance or content management
        burden on staff. </p>
    <p>We’re also considering creating a second Flash skin for the interactive
      and publishing it to a handheld device for use as visitors tour the textile
      galleries. The CMS that curators use to create and manage content on the
      interactive will also publish to a handheld. Our collections database provides
      real-time information about an object’s location, and so the handheld
      would provide interpretive content about only those objects on view. Finally,
      the single Web server that delivers content to the interactives in the
      study center and the electronic signage could also easily serve content
      to a handheld system. </p>
    <h1>Electronic
        Signage</h1>
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Perhaps the most prominent digital resource in the new de Young is the
      electronic signage program. Consisting of three separate installations
      of large-screen monitors, the electronic signs serve as ever-changing billboards
      alerting and informing museum visitors about exhibitions, programs, events,
      and collections.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="fox.fig9.jpg" alt="Fig 9" width="400" height="230"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 9:
        The electronic signage in the lobby of the new de Young</p>
    <p> At the time of initial planning, such displays were seen in only
      a handful of museums, and were generally experimental in nature. They were,
      however, seen in ever-increasing numbers in trade-shows, retail stores,
      and public facilities such as airports. In fact, from our temporary offices
      near San Francisco’s Union Square we could walk to see nearby examples
      installed in Macy’s and the Apple Store. </p>
    <p>Initially, the primary impetus for developing the electronic signage lay
      in the visual impact of the illuminated, moving images displayed on the
      large screens. Many ideas, including that of a large “video wall” installation
      wherein an entire section of wall, from floor to ceiling, would be covered
      in video displays showing animated content, were floated but eventually
      rejected for reasons of technological and financial practicality and practicability.
      Eventually, the idea of a sort of animated billboard was chosen as the
      ideal model for the electronic signage - sweeping animations that would
      intrigue and excite visitors about the permanent installations and special
      exhibitions offered by the museum, and in keeping with the sophisticated
      and state-of-the-art environment of the new de Young.</p>
    <p>After site visits - to museums, trade shows, and other venues - and extensive
      research by members of the development team (including myself, FAMSF Chief
      Graphic Designer Ron Rick, Curator Karin Breuer, and Mediatrope principal
      Ethan Wilde), we developed a set of initial goals and requirements for
      content, software, and hardware.</p>
    <p>As an initial experiment to gauge public response to electronic signage,
      a 40-inch LCD monitor was set up in a prominent public space at the Legion
      of Honor, the de Young’s sister museum. A set of animations promoting
      exhibitions, resources such as the museum store and café, and the
      new de Young’s imminent opening was run in an ongoing loop. Public
      reaction was extremely favorable, with the most positive comments about
      the animated exhibition previews. Interestingly, opinions as to non-exhibition
      content were polarized between those who thought the information moved
      by too quickly and those that felt it wasn’t displayed long or frequently
      enough!</p>
    <p>Ultimately, the decision was reaffirmed to head in the ‘animated
      billboard’ direction and reject the ‘airport signage’ model.
      Due to the varying locations of the electronic signage arrays in the new
      de Young, none of which were immediate to obvious visitor-oriented points
      such as admission and information desks, there was no guarantee that visitors
      would see, and more importantly, stop and read a great deal of information
      on the screens. Animated, cinematic information, on the other hand, would
      attract visitors to the screens where they would be exposed to information
      in a more efficient manner.</p>
    <p>Software was another issue. There are numerous turn-key products readily
      available:  among them Omnivex, Scala, and Clarity CoolSign. These
      proprietary applications focus mainly on presenting large quantities of
      data information in the ‘airport signage’ model; Omnivex, for
      example, is geared mainly to display information for financial institutions..
      More importantly, these products are stand-alone applications unable to
      interact with our current CMS, thus necessitating a duplication of data
      and staff effort to program the signage. Price, too, was a consideration.
      While not overwhelmingly expensive - various out-of-the-box setups were
      all in the low to mid five-figure range - we found that it was more cost-effective
      to invest a similar amount in a custom application that met our specific
      needs well. Another factor was cross-platform compatibility; all of these
      proprietary applications are Windows-only, and our development team all
      use Macs.</p>
    <p>Finally, the signage hardware itself had to be determined. Several competing
      technologies were considered: plasma, projection, and LCD. Projection,
      while offering large screen size for a relatively reasonable price, was
      the first option rejected due to space considerations in the new de Young.
      Plasma was also considered, but rejected for several reasons: picture quality
      was more suited for television than computer graphics, and the screen would
      burn in and require replacement in a relatively short time. We heard from
      one institution that had learned this lesson the hard way and needed to
      replace all of their plasma screens only two years after installation.
      LCD monitors were decided upon as they possessed superior graphics qualities,
      and, though more expensive than plasma screens, would be more cost-effective
      in the long run.</p>
    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <p>The monitors eventually decided upon were NEC LCD4610 46-inch LCD units,
      with a maximum screen resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. The project was
      originally designed around 55-inch units that were under development by
      NEC and due for release in May of 2005, but these units ultimately were ‘vaporware’ due
      to technical development problems at NEC, and the smaller units were selected
      with a promise by NEC’s North American representative for a partial
      exchange of the existing units for the 55-inch models when they became
      available. A 57-inch model (NEC LCD5710-BK) was finally made available
      in limited quantities in November, 2006.</p>
    <p>Each array of three signs is powered by a single Hewlett Packard workstation
      that runs the Flash-based signage application. Each workstation is equipped
      with two high-end Nvidia Quadro 4000 graphics cards that work in tandem.
      The three displays do not operate independently and are in effect one large
      monitor of 4,080 x 768 pixels. An additional HP workstation serves as the
      central server for the electronic signage, allowing content to be repurposed
      in all three locations.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="fox.fig10.jpg" alt="Fig 10" width="400" height="306"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 10:
        The electronic signage display outside the de Young’s Herbst Exhibition
        Galleries.</p>
    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>Like the above-mentioned textile interactives, the de Young’s electronic
      signage follows a Web-based model. Driving the signage is a Flash application
      that takes advantage of Flash’s ability to access and display dynamic
      content. Content is input into the appropriate fields in the Sitebots CMS
      user interface, as it would be for the Web site, and when published, the
      information is sent to the main electronic signage server where it is then
      accessed by the client workstations. Additionally, the electronic signage
      program interacts with the de Young Web site’s events calendar. If
      configured, the electronic signage will display calendar events at the
      appropriate date and time, drawing the information from the main FAMSF
      Sitebots Web server, which pushes updated content to the electronic signage
      server on a nightly basis. This eliminates the need to update the signage
      as a parallel calendar system.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="fox.fig11.jpg" alt="Fig 11" width="400" height="78"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 11:
        When entering a calendar event into Sitebots, museum staff can opt to
        make the event details available for publication on the signage.</p>
    <p> While the signage system, like the textile interactives, is served
      locally, the FAMSF Web site and CMS are hosted at a large San Francisco
      data center.</p>
    <p>Each signage location functions on its own separate schedule, and draws
      from a menu of individual ‘modules’ which are Flash animations
      lasting from 10 to 120 seconds. Each module consists of images, text and
      an ‘animation toolbox’ of a variety of pre-set animation types,
      allowing images to pan horizontally or vertically, up or down, left or
      right. Additionally, there are a number of animated transitions - wipes,
      fades, and dissolves - that can be selected and deployed between modules
      for a seamless appearance. All modules are stored in the central signage
      server and are available for use at any or all of the locations in the
      building. Schedules for each location consist of up to 20 modules, which
      run in a pre-defined order as dictated by the schedule. If needed, special
      schedules can be created to automatically override existing schedules based
      on date and time. These are especially useful for corporate building rentals
      and special events.</p>

    <h1>Assessment</h1>
    <p>The electronic signage system launched with the opening of the new de
      Young in October 2005. As we’ve used the system day-in and day-out
      over the past 15 months, the successes and lessons of the project have
      become increasingly clear.</p>
    <p>Overall, the program has been a huge success. Although the signs were
      initially afflicted with display problems due to various installation issues,
      the display quality at present is very high. The system is, as mentioned
      previously, extremely flexible, with nearly unlimited configurations for
      each location. Development costs were relatively low, and maintenance costs
      have been nearly non-existent. In fact the most persistent problem experienced
      is an occasional system crash on the workstations. It takes only a few
      minutes to get the displays back up and running. Maintenance to the signage
      program itself can be done in ‘real time’ without disrupting
      the currently playing program. The transition from old to new program is
      done in a seamless manner, with the new program taking over at the end
      point of the old. Maintenance of the system is possible by non-technical
      staff, although design skills and a familiarity with digital media terms
      and concepts are definitely recommended.</p>
    <p>The biggest success by far has been the use of a familiar CMS interface
      to program the signage and manage signage content. Integrating information
      from the Web site, on the other hand, has been successful on a technical
      level, but not necessarily from a content perspective. At this time we’re
      still attempting to determine how best to show this information on the
      current signage deployment. The reason? The Web and the signage, although
      sharing much technologically, are two very different delivery platforms.</p>
    <p>The signs are animated promotions for exhibits, collections and special
      events, and as such are fundamentally promotional rather than informational.
      In contrast, the Web site calendar is almost purely informational, providing
      date, time, location, cost and a brief description of museum events. In
      other words, the signs are movie trailers to the calendar’s movie
      listings. As a result we’re still working out the best way to promote
      specific events on the signs. That said, having event information available
      for easy publication on the signs is a great boon.</p>
    <p>Most of the differences in the two platforms have to do with visitor expectations
      and behavior. With the Web, visitors can guide themselves through the content
      of a Web site in a random path determined by where they want to go. Content
      can be viewed for any length of time and in almost any order, limited only
      by a Web site’s navigation. The signage, on the other hand, relies
      on a static program to display its content. Visitors doesn’t know
      what’s coming up or what to expect, and we as programmers have no
      idea what information any specific visitor wants or needs.  Therefore,
      it is better for the signage to be promotional rather than informational.
      Certainly the situation would be different if the sign were something purely
      informational; for example, something installed near the entrance to an
      auditorium or theater that informed visitors of the events scheduled in
      that space only. Our installation, on the other hand, serves to promote
      the entire museum.</p>
    <p>The initially developed templates and animations allow for the creation
      of new Flash animation modules that are consistent with the museum’s
      branding guidelines. The ease of creation and flexibility of the system
      has led to requests from museum management to deviate from the templates
      and create more custom graphics for the signage modules, resulting in less
      and less use of the template. From one perspective, this is a clear indication
      of the overall success of the system. But we’re still seeking the
      best balance between standardization and customization as we learn to work
      within this new medium.</p>
    <p>Lastly, developing animated Flash presentations for the electronic signage
      requires that the Web master don an additional hat and play movie director.
      This is a new role, and it presents both practical (how much of my job
      is developing signage animations?) and design (how do you design effectively
      for signage audiences?) challenges.</p>
    <h1>Future
        Directions</h1>
    <p>Perhaps the most important outcome of these projects is that we now have
      a strong, tested platform upon which to expand. Possible future enhancements
      to the system include new display templates to vary the styles seen in
      the current electronic signage modules; dynamically integrated exhibition
      information, much like that seen on the FAMSF’s Web site; scheduled
      publication and ‘unpublication’ for future dates; and an integrated
      system for image and digital asset management.</p>
