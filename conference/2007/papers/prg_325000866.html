  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This paper is about enhancing
      the ability of repositories of all kinds to share information. In particular,
      research demonstrates that the phenomenon of “instantiation”   –  multiple
      representations   –  is universal among information objects. Specifically,
      we will see how this phenomenon can lead to ambiguous metadata for artifacts
      and archival documents.</p>
  <h2>1.0 Sharing Metadata and Semantic Interoperability</h2>
  <p>Global resource sharing requires
      the integration of scientific and cultural information. Such integration
      requires semantic interoperability on several levels, from metadata structures
      to the representation of intellectual content. However, interoperability
      is hampered by a lack of empirical evidence supporting the development
      of data structures. Museums, archives, and libraries   – 
    particularly in today’s virtual environment   –  share a common purpose: the
    dissemination of culture. But our post-modern emphasis on domain-specific
    ontology, which is widely seen as an improvement in knowledge organization,
    can lead to a potential form of ‘Balkanization (that is, isolation) in resource
    description. Repository- and resource-specific data-structures, generated
    in-house by rational or pragmatic means, often fail to acknowledge the universality
    of function that might be common among resources.</p>
  <p>An example is the case of
      the phenomenon of instantiation. When is a terracotta hut urn like a sailor’s
      deck-log like a best-selling novel? When its representations are multiply
      instantiated within a repository, but the instantiations are not distinguishable
      for retrieval purposes. In this paper we shall see the results of empirical
      analysis of cases in both a museum and an archives. We will learn that
      for any given artifact, the repository holds a plethora of identically-named
      instantiations. One solution for semantic interoperability would be an
      empirically-verifiable taxonomy of artifact instantiation.</p>
  <h3>1.1 Useless Metadata lack Differentiation</h3>
  <p>Metadata are categorical
      descriptors of information resources, often used to constitute strings
      for information retrieval. That is, resource-linkage is provided through
      the semantic application of content metadata. Furthermore, specific metadata
      structures provide semantic linkage among resource descriptions. Most metadata
      schemas rely on pragmatically-derived descriptive conventions, and most
      of these rely on describing a visible entity   –  ““describe what you see,” or
      as library cataloging rules have it, ““describe the item in hand.”</p>
  <p>However, and herein lies
      the problem, data structures must be designed to both collocate (gather
      together a group of like entities) and disambiguate (allow differentiation
      among identical-appearing, but distinct, entities). Unfortunately, reliance
      on resource description alone can frustrate both objectives. Figure 1 shows
      comparative screen displays, one bibliographic and one artifactual. In
      both, resource description is accurate and therefore succeeds at collocating
      descriptions that appear to be the same. And in both, varying instantiations
      are undisambiguated leading a searcher no recourse other than to wade through
      description after description in search of a suitable object.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="smiraglia.fig1.jpg" alt="Fig 1: Undisambiguated Display" width="432" height="217"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 1: Undisambiguated Display</p>
  <p>In both lists the entities
      look identical, but are not. Rather, their metadata representations, based
      on pragmatic schema, make them appear to be identical. The entities actually
      represent points of instantiation, points along a temporal continuum at
      which representations of the intellectual content have taken form. Some
      (like copies from the same printing, or prints made simultaneously from
      the same photographic negative) are simply re-presentations. Others, and
      this is more likely the farther we get along the continuum, represent altered
      intellectual content (such as translations, or digitally enhanced images).
      The problem, simply enough, is to create a taxonomy that can guide disambiguation
      by turning these displays into relational structures.</p>
  <p>Another problem is that metadata,
      essentially a set of ‘names,’ cannot be neutral because the names influence
      the activity of facilitating (or obfuscating) use. The very act of naming   –  the
      essential activity of resource description   –  objectifies potential use
      of the items named. According to Hjørland’s appeal to activity theory
      (2003, 98), metadata schemas, rationally
      deduced, predetermine the potential use of intellectual content by limiting
      its retrieval. Even the simple name <strong>document</strong>, has the potential
      to limit use of artifacts by directing (or mis-directing) searchers. Knowledge
      extraction then   –  the act of generating taxonomic description of resources   – 
    should be based on empirical observation of the resources themselves. What
    I mean to suggest is that empirical research can both demonstrate the complexity
    of representations of artifacts and also suggest, through dynamic taxonomy,
    a set of practices that allow the resources to speak for themselves.</p>
  <h2>2.0 Instantiation is a Global Information Phenomenon</h2>
  <p><strong>Instantiation</strong> is the phenomenon first denoted empirically by research
      into bibliographic ‘works’ (Smiraglia 2001, 2002, 2005a). Specifically,
      an instantiation of a work exists whenever the work is manifest in physical
      form (in a book, for example). A problem arises when multiple instantiations
      of a work (several editions, translations, etc.) exist and their descriptions
      must be linked in a retrieval system with sufficient information to assist
      in the selection of the instantiation of interest to a searcher. Similarly,
      unique artifacts are represented by metadata or images (called representations),
      which exist in multiple instantiations (a photographic negative, a print,
      its digital descendent, etc.). The same is true of the representations
      of archival documents, which might exist in paper photocopies (original
      and carbon), digital images, and so forth.</p>
  <p>In this discussion we are
      dealing with the interaction of an entity and a phenomenon. The entity
      is the intellectual content of any artifact, known bibliographically as ‘<strong>the
      work</strong>.’
    The work is the set of ideas and the manner of their communication; that
    is, ideational and semantic content combined. A bibliographical work is usually
    associated with a writing, and the writing usually has a text of some sort.
    Artifactually, however, the concept also applies. An object was created with
    some intention (<strong>ideational</strong> content) and some physical form (<strong>semantic</strong> content).
    A red wooden tulip sitting on my desk was created as an artistic representation
    of a flower in bloom   –  its ‘ideation’   –  and it was created mechanically
    from wood and paint   –  its ‘semantic expression.’ A photograph of it is not
    the same as the tulip itself, although ideationally it represents the same
    thing. Furthermore, a black and white print of that photograph continues
    to represent the ideational content, but in altered form. In a retrieval
    system we will want all three iterations (that is, instantiations) to be
    connected to one another so as to identify their common representation. That
    is, we want the descriptions to collocate. But we also want to be able to
    tell the photos from the original and from each other; that is, we want the
    descriptions to disambiguate.</p>
  <p>And so we have the interaction
      of the ‘work’ entity with the phenomenon of instantiation. Instantiation
      (Smiraglia 2005) is essentially a generic term for the realization of a
      work at a specific point in time. Other terms are often confused with this
      phenomenon   –  version, manifestation, for example   –  but instantiation
      is a simpler term that is used to signal a place in a sequence of time,
      but with no further implication of intellectual or physical detail. It
      is the generic name of a universal phenomenon that has been observed among
      all informing objects   –  resources, if you will. And it is very useful
      for analysis of sets of multiply-realized phenomena.</p>
  <p>From bibliographic evidence
      (Smiraglia 2001) we know that substantial numbers of works evolve large
      instantiation networks over time (that is, have many editions, translations,
      screenplays, etc.). The types of instantiation can be grouped in two broad
      categories: <strong>derivation,</strong> which is used for subsequent iterations
      of the work with little change, and <strong>mutation,</strong> which is used for
      iterations with substantial change in ideational or semantic content. Thus
      a second edition of a book is a derivation, but the motion picture based
      on it is a mutation. And we know that the primary catalyst for evolution
      of instantiation is cultural acceptance, termed ‘<strong>canonicity’</strong> in
      the bibliographic realm. Once a work becomes part of public consciousness,
      there is a tendency (one might evoke here the simple law of supply and
      demand) for instantiations to evolve.</p>
  <p>When we turn to museums and
      archives, we find the same phenomenon of instantiation is abundant. But
      there are, of course, some differences. In the realm of artifacts, we must
      distinguish first between the artifact itself, metadata descriptions of
      the artifact, and representations, e.g., photographs, models, etc. While
      the artifacts are unique, we can observe instantiation among both metadata
      descriptions and representations. In the archives we have a similar but
      less clear-cut situation: we can observe instantiations of the original
      documents as well as their representations. In both cases, because we are
      making a distinction between a unique artifact and the subsequent iterations,
      we have termed this process ‘<strong>content genealogy’</strong> (Smiraglia 2004,
      2005b). Let us now turn to some specific examples derived from research.</p>
  <h2>3.0 Hut Urns and Deck Logs</h2>
  <p>Two recent studies demonstrate
      consistently the phenomenon of instantiation across resource and repository
      types (Smiraglia 2004 and 2005b, 2006). Case-study evidence is reported
      in these papers derived from Etruscan artifacts at The University of Pennyslvania
      Museum of Archeology and Anthropology, and from the Archives of The Class
      of 1942 of The United States Merchant Marine Academy. Both the Etruscan
      artifacts and the merchant marine archives demonstrate the presence of
      both representations (images, models, etc.) and metadata sets (descriptive
      data) for each artifact.</p>
  <h3>3.1 Etruscan Artifacts</h3>
  <p>Case study, an appropriate
      first step in uncharted territory, is a useful technique for gathering
      exhaustive data about a few selectively chosen subjects, in order to discover
      as much as possible about them. We were most interested at the outset in
      seeing whether multiple representations of an artifact might be extant
      (which would indicate a need to ‘collocate’ in an information system).
      Therefore we sought a set of artifacts that would be easily available to
      the researcher and that would likely have appeared in representations in
      print as well as in digital form. Etruscan artifacts from the University
      of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology were selected to
      provide qualitative evidence of the content genealogy of representations
      of non-documentary artifacts. These artifacts are housed in a popular exhibition
      that is also well-represented in digital form on the Web (<a href="../http://www.museum.upenn.edu/new/worlds_intertwined/etruscan/main.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.museum.upenn.edu/new/worlds_intertwined/etruscan/main.shtml</a>).
      The exhibit is also accompanied by a published <em>Guide</em> (2002). By
      choosing artifacts that had both Web and print representations, it was
      guaranteed some degree of instantiation would be present. Eight artifacts
      were selected based on their prominence in the exhibit, and with attention
      to their diversity (see Table 1).</p>

  <p class="caption">Table 1: The Eight Artifacts as Described by UPM </p>
  <p>With the assistance of the
      museum’s archivist, every record in-house for each artifact was examined
      and noted. It was no surprise to discover that for each artifact both metadata
      descriptions and representations exist. In fact, instantiation was abundant.
      Table 2 contains the total numbers of representations and metadata sets
      that were found for each artifact, both in-house and outside the repository.
      Internal records were used to compile a bibliography of publications in
      which both metadata descriptions and images could be found. Note the disparity
      among the artifacts in the quantity of metadata and image representations.
      Certain of the artifacts have substantial sets of information-objects,
      both in-house and outside the museum. The Etrusco-Corinthian olpe has the
      most, and the lintel has the fewest. This suggests that presence neither
      on the Web nor in the popular exhibition influences instantiation directly.
      If we disregard the functional metadata and representations   –  those created
      in-house according to routine museum function   –  we still see disparity.
      Now the olpe and the cinerary urn have the largest sets of representations
      in print, followed closely by the satyr head antefix. As reported earlier,
      a number of factors were ruled out as contributors to instantiation.</p>

  <p class="caption">Table 2: Representations of The Eight Artifacts</p>
  <p>However, these two artifacts,
      the olpe and the cinerary urn, together with the satyr head, show the most
      instantiation. The common factor among these three, and the factor that
      distinguishes them from the rest, is appearance in published volumes soon
      after acquisition. As reported in Smiraglia (2005b), these artifacts are
      among those described by the Conservationist as ‘frequent flyers,’ a term
      used to denote objects that are frequently requested for loan. It seems
      that once an object has appeared in publication, it tends to get requested
      even if the museum has better exemplars in its collections. Such items
      spend more time on loan than in the museum, hence the moniker. And each
      time the artifact is loaned, a new set of before- and after-metadata and
      photographs are generated to help monitor the continued integrity of the
      artifact. While on loan, the artifact is likely to have metadata and image
      representations published in the loan-exhibition catalogue, and these likely
      will generate more attention over time. This is the parallel to the bibliographic
      catalyst of canonicity. That is, cultural acceptance of the entity is a
      catalyst for instantiation.</p>
  <p>Types of instantiation were

    </li>
    <li>Image order invoices</li>

        <li>Transparencies</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Object reproductions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Many of the terms here are
      associated with museum functions; the very fact of holding an artifact
      means that a repository might multiply-instantiate various representations.
      Content genealogy consists of the reiteration of metadata sets from field
      notes to object records to database, and the sequential production of images
      from photographic negatives which might subsequently be digitized. The
      olpe had a more interesting instantiation history; for instance, for one
      image there is a lantern slide, a nitrate negative,
      a 35 mm. negative, and 3 copies of the 35 mm. negative, and a photograph published in an early museum catalog. In fact,
      there are two such (different) images of the olpe.</p>
  <h3>3.2 Merchant Marine Memorabilia</h3>
  <p>The U.S. Merchant Marine
      Academy at Kings Point, Long Island, New York, houses an extraordinary
      library with extensive archives of former midshipmen. The members of the
      Class of 1942 have used their self-awareness to constitute a rich historical
      record of their class. The fourteen’““folders’ created by members of the
      class tell the story of young men who chose the seafaring life for a career
      but found themselves destined for greatness. The Pearl Harbor event of
      December 7, 1941, shocked a nation, and these young cadets soon found themselves
      commissioned as officers in the merchant marine and on their way to sea
      in the thick of war. Table 3 is a brief summary that demonstrates some
      of the richness of the collection via a taxonomy of forms, genres, and
      topics; media include documents, video-recordings and one CD-ROM compiled
      as an alumni project.</p>

  <p class="caption">Table 3: Contents of the Class of 1942 Project</p>
  <p>Two folders   –  documents
      contributed by two former midshipmen   –  constitute the cases for analysis.
      In the first folder we found letters, envelopes, binders, photographs,
      ship’s deck-logs, time-sheets, scholarship applications, and so forth.
      A heavy, canvas-bound ring-binder dominated the folder. It contained ‘orders’   –  papers
      ordering military personnel from place to place. A note inside indicates
      the binder had been issued specifically because it would sink in ocean
      water. In the event a ship was boarded, these binders were to be tossed
      overboard so as to be lost to enemy intelligence. Inside the binder was
      a deck long from this cadet’s time at sea; immediately behind the log was
      a photocopy of it. In the second folder we found a bound diary reconstituted
      from the written diary of another midshipman, submitted to the class project
      by his son. The diary is reproduced via word processing, but a substantial
      segment of the original hand-written material has been photocopied and
      tipped in at back. Quite a lot of memorabilia are inserted. Table 4 is
      a schematic representation of the contents of these folders.</p>

  <p class="caption">Table 4: Instantiation among the Merchant Marine memorabilia</p>
  <p>Perhaps the most interesting
      observation was the amount of instantiation built into the collection itself
      by the members of the class as they compiled their historical archives.
      Commonplace are photocopies, carbon copies, digitized scans of postcards
      containing photographs, scans of photos, photos alongside digitized scans
      of them, and documents together with their carbon copies and digitized
      scans of the originals.</p>
  <h2>4.0 Achieving the Ability to Share Knowledge</h2>
  <p>The term <strong>content genealogy</strong> describes
      the succession of representations that occur along a chronological continuum.
      Multiplicity among informing objects is universal, and the analysis of
      instantiation shows this. Instantiation can be demonstrated as one example
      of a semantically interoperable, and empirically derived, model for the
      integration of scientific and cultural information. Elements of instantiation
      that are consistent across these studies, as well as with the bibliographical
      research, are canonicity and nodes within instantiation networks at points
      of change in ideational or semantic content. In fact, we can place what
      we have been calling taxonomies side by side and see that they constitute
      a typology of instantiation (Table 5). That is, the types are not mutually
      exclusive, but may occur simultaneously, as for example in the case of
      a photocopy of a carbon copy of a typed letter.</p>

  <p class="caption">Table 5: Comparative Instantiation Typologies</p>
  <p>The typologies demonstrate
      Hjørland’s idea (2003) that activity theory can proscribe the categorizing
      activity of knowledge organization. We denote categories for metadata in
      order to assign information objects spatial loci within our own schema.
      The typologies also demonstrate the epistemological parameters of derivation
      and mutation. Derivation denotes types or properties of instantiation in
      which intellectual content is unaltered; mutation denotes types or properties
      of instantiation in which intellectual content has been altered semantically
      or ideationally. In table 5, terms listed below the solid line represent
      mutations, which occur in both bibliographic and artifactual typologies.
      According to research to date, archival records and artifactual metadata
      typologies identify derivations.</p>
  <h2>5. Virtual Boundaries?</h2>
  <p>What does all of this mean?
      Primarily it means that there is a need for a common language for sharing
      information about artifacts across repositories and repository types. In
      the virtual world, the potential exists for museums, archives, and libraries
      to constitute unified virtual repositories  of cultural information. Regardless
      of the type of artifacts held   –  that is, whether they are naturally occurring,
      works of art, personal papers, or books, or anything else   –  the phenomenon
      of instantiation is consistent, and is consistently problematic.</p>
  <p>One attempt at a common language
      for information sharing is the CIDOC-Conceptual Reference Model (known
      as CIDOC-CRM). This model is an empirically derived language that supplies
    ““definitions and formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit
    concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation” (<a href="../http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/" target="_blank">http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/</a>). A powerful
    template for knowledge sharing, the CRM has been designed to conform to several
    metadata sets or knowledge models for cultural resources, ranging from the
    Dublin Core, to Encoded Archival Description, to the Functional Requirements
    for Bibliographic Records (wherein instantiation plays a large role), to
    MPEG7, and to a variety of museum specifications.</p>
  <p>The phenomenon of instantiation
      has been extended from the confines of the bibliographic realm into the
      basic language of the CRM, incorporating not only the research reported
      here but also semiotic theory. Major physical entities are <strong>Creation,
      Production, Conceptual Object</strong>, and <strong>Information Carrier</strong>, which
      are the ‘things’ of information resources. Major intellectual entities
      are <strong>Work </strong>and <strong>Expression</strong>, the substance of which are acknowledged
      to act as signs. The substance of a work, always, is ideational content   –  ideas.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>When is a terracotta hut
      urn like a sailor’s deck log? The first answer is that they are alike when
      both are perceived as part of the world’s cultural resources. The second
      answer is that they are alike when both are digitized and placed in virtual
      repositories for use by scholars. And the third answer is that they are
      alike when their multiple instantiations cause confusion in information
      retrieval, or when repositories fail to disseminate the entire realm of
      possible iterations present in the instantiation networks. This is the
      challenge for virtual repositories of every stripe. Efforts
      based on taxonomies derived from empirical analysis show promise for helping
      unite the world’s information repositories.</p>
