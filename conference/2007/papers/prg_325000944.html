          Mesopotamia – today&#39;s Iraq. Called Ancient Mesopotamia: This

          The challenge was to build a Web site that engages students while allowing

          of VTS from a traditional teacher-led instructional setting to a virtual,
          student-driven learning environment. The result is a Web site with
          three major components: a Learning Collection of teacher-selected artifacts
          from the Oriental Institute Museum&#39;s Mesopotamian gallery; an interactive
          archaeological dig called’Dig Into History,’ and an on-line
          course for K-12 teachers. Each of these products draws upon the tenets

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Visual Thinking Strategies, or VTS, is an educational methodology for
      teaching and learning visual literacy that uses a work of art as a springboard
      for classroom discussion (<a href="../http://www.vue.org/" target="_blank">http://www.vue.org/</a>).  Developed
      by museum educator Philip Yenawine and cognitive psychologist Abigail Housen,
      VTS is learner-centered and promotes the acquisition of critical thinking
      and communication skills by providing students with a structured means
      of making observations, solving problems, and communicating ideas about
      works of art.  Although VTS&#39;s facilitation strategy is designed for
      face-to-face instruction in the classroom, we asked the question, &#34;Can
      these same strategies be used to create an educational Web site for student
      learners?&#34; </p>
    <p>At the beginning of 2004, with the support of a National Leadership Grant
      from the Institute for Museum and Library Services, three University of
      Chicago organizations, Chicago WebDocent, the eCUIP Digital Library, and
      the Oriental Institute Museum, came together to explore how best to build
      an on-line educational resource about ancient Mesopotamia, one that would
      be easily accessible to teachers and students nationwide.  The project, Ancient
      Mesopotamia: This History, Our History,
      (<a href="../http://mesopotamia.lib.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">http://mesopotamia.lib.uchicago.edu/</a>)
      marked the first time that all three organizations worked together, and
      each contributed their expertise to different facets of the project.  Chicago
      Web Docent (<a href="../http://chicagowebdocent.org/" target="_blank">http://chicagowebdocent.org/</a>)
      builds Web-delivered, instructional materials for the K-12 educational
      community.  The eCUIP Digital Library Project (<a href="../http://ecuip.lib.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">http://ecuip.lib.uchicago.edu/</a>)
      builds digital collections of source materials that support independent
      student inquiry and classroom instruction in K-12 classrooms.  The
      Oriental Institute Museum (<a href="../http://oi.uchicago.edu/OI/default.html" target="_blank">http://oi.uchicago.edu/OI/default.html</a>) is
      unique as it is the only archaeological museum of its kind in North America.
      Within its newly renovated galleries, it houses a major collection of artifacts
      from ancient Syria, Israel, Persia, Anatolia, Egypt, Nubia, and Mesopotamia.  </p>
    <h1>Goals Of Ancient Mesopotamia: This History, Our History </h1>
    <p>At the inception of the project, the collaborators met with a Teacher
      Advisory Board made up of ten educators from the Chicago Public Schools
      who assisted us in identifying a number of high-level goals for the project. </p>
    <p>The first high-level goal of Ancient Mesopotamia: This History, Our
        History is to relay to the K-12
        audience the concepts behind the science of archaeology and the discovery
        of an ancient civilization as well as a develop deeper understanding
        of Mesopotamian history by using artifacts from the Museum’s collection.  Since
        local, state, and national learning standards require all middle and
        high school students to study ancient Mesopotamia, this resource aims
        to provide teachers and students with a comprehensive view of the area
        we now refer to as modern-day Iraq.  By building a rich historical
        resource we also hope to contribute to a better understanding of the
        present-day Middle East, a task that is extremely important in light
        of contemporary world events.  </p>
    <p>Another high-level goal of the project is to improve the quality of visual
      literacy in our nation’s schools through the study of ancient Mesopotamian
      artifacts.  Toward this end, we wanted Visual Thinking Strategies
      to inform the on-line resource in such a way that it would encourage students
      to be active participants in their own learning process.  We envisioned
      students becoming not only consumers of scholars’ and archaeologists’ interpretations
      of artifacts, but also interpreters of the artifacts themselves. </p>
    <p>One more high-level goal of this project is to use technology as a medium
      to move the Museum from its role as a local storehouse and interpreter
      of artifacts to a dynamic international educational partner and disseminator
      of primary source materials.  Also, incorporating a wide range of
      innovative learning technologies helps to facilitate unique, constructivist
      learning experiences for students. </p>
    <p>Other goals include providing a model for the adaptation and repurposing
      of university research, Museum resources, programming, and learning theories
      into highly effective on-line educational tools.</p>
    <h1>Why Visual Thinking Strategies</h1>
    <p>Using Visual Thinking Strategies to help drive the design of this project
      seemed a natural fit to the partners and members of the Teacher Advisory
      Board.  VTS is a proven method for visual literacy instruction presented
      by Visual Understanding in Education (VUE), an organization that conducts
      educational research and publishes curricula (<a href="../http://www.vue.org/" target="_blank">http://www.vue.org</a>/).  In
      2003, Wendy Ennes and Carole Krucoff from the Education department of the
      Oriental Institute Museum participated in a seminar with Philip Yenawine
      to learn the VTS method.  It seemed a logical next step to try to
      find a way to integrate Visual Thinking Strategies into the on-line ancient
      Mesopotamia resource  that we were going to begin to create in 2004.</p>
    <p>The face-to-face VTS method begins by showing an artwork to a group of
      students and asking them the leading question, &#34;What is going on in
      this painting, drawing, or sculpture?&#34;  Students respond by looking
      closely at the artwork and answering the question.  As each student
      answers, the teacher, without judgment, restates or paraphrases the student&#39;s
      observations to the class while pointing out the visual evidence of the
      student’s opinion as evidenced within the artwork.</p>
    <p>As the discussion evolves, the teacher or facilitator continues to move
      it along by asking, where appropriate, two more open-ended questions: &#34;What
      do you see that makes you say that?&#34; and &#34;What else can you find?&#34;  These
      three key questions can be used while on a field trip to a museum or within
      a classroom setting using a reproduction or projected image.  An added
      benefit of VTS is that the teacher or facilitator need not be an expert
      in art or art practice.  The informal discussion format of a Visual
      Thinking Strategies session allows students to communicate and construct
      their own interpretations while learning from peers as the group moves
      through the process of decoding a work of art.  In its purest form,
      Visual Thinking Strategies is an easy to use, face-to-face constructivist
      teaching tool that encourages novice museum/art-goers to build ideas and
      concepts as a group together.</p>
    <p>Encouraging students to become interpreters of artifacts and active learners
      is a core tenet of Ancient Mesopotamia: This History, Our History’s
      programming goals. VTS has a proven method for teaching many of the same
      skills we aim to translate to our users with our Web-based materials.  Interpreting
      VTS for use on the Web began with us striving to create a Web site with
      ancient Mesopotamian artifacts.  As the project evolved it quickly
      moved beyond our original goals to include exploring and reinterpreting
      the ways in which the Web itself can provide VTS-inspired instruction.</p>
    <p>Questions that arose when planning the outcomes for this project included
      How do we encourage the use of Visual Thinking Strategies with a Web-based
      resource?  How do we translate the tenets of VTS, a face-to-face facilitation
      technique, into Web-based instruction? How do we get students and educators
      to go beyond simply looking at an object and begin to extract meaningful
      information from it?  How do we encourage them to draw unique conclusions?  And,
      How do we extend and amplify the teachable moment of an artifact by using
      VTS?</p>
    <p>As the collaborators and teacher advisory board members strove to answer
      these questions and define our project, additional questions arose as to
      how to make the project different enough from other resources on the Web
      about ancient Mesopotamia.  Our survey of on-line materials and feedback
      from our Teacher Advisory Board told us that there was a severe lack of
      age- and learning-appropriate resources about ancient Mesopotamia on the
      Web.  We realized that just by building the resource, we were filling
      a much-needed gap, but we also wanted to create a unique learning experience
      where students would be driven beyond information gathering and what could
      be typical rote recollection of content to becoming scholars and curators
      themselves - we wanted to make ancient Mesopotamia as engaging as possible.</p>
    <p>Another challenge included making the Museum’s collection more accessible
      and understandable.  We can put the Museum’s collection on the
      Web and provide virtual access to it, but how can the Web make it easier
      for students to understand how archaeologists interpret knowledge?  Scholars
      and archaeologists generated the information that students read, but we
      also know that it is important to allow students to interpret the artifacts
      and challenge what they are reading.  Such an approach would make
      them generators of knowledge themselves.  If we were successful at
      doing this, we could exponentially increase the intellectual accessibility
      of all museum collections.</p>
    <h1>The Web Resource</h1>
    <p>With the flexibility of Visual Thinking Strategies as one of the key conceptual
      underpinnings of the project, the partners moved ahead as a team to create
      the three main components of the Web site.  The first component, a
      searchable database of teacher-chosen artifacts from the Mesopotamian Gallery
      called the Learning Collection, was
      developed by the eCUIP Digital Library Project.  The second is a Flash® interactive
      created by Chicago WebDocent that uses artifacts from the Learning
      Collection to explore the concepts
      behind the science of archaeology and the discovery of ancient Mesopotamian
      civilization.  Lastly, the on-line professional development distance
      learning course for educators draws upon content approved by University
      of Chicago faculty as well as the framework of the Learning Collection,
      and the Flash interactive. Personnel at the Oriental Institute Museum developed
      the on-line course. </p>
    <p>Each of the three core components draws upon the tenets of VTS in very
      different ways. Due to the unique structure of each component and the way
      they mesh together, a wide range of learning experiences is created.  These
      vary and are successful because they engage users in new and different
      ways.  When they are used together in a cohesive teacher-created lesson
      plan, they complement each other and provide rich, constructivist learning
      experiences for students and educators alike.</p>
    <h1>Developing the Learning Collection         </h1>
    <p>The Learning Collection provides
        a searchable and browseable interface to a group of teacher-selected
        artifacts from the Oriental Institute Museum’s Mesopotamian collection.
        All aspects of the Learning Collection were
        impacted by the team’s decision to create a resource that supports
        Visual Thinking Strategies instruction.  Since members of the Teacher
        Advisory Board received VTS instruction prior to choosing the artifacts,
        VTS ultimately guided the selection of the artifacts.  Additionally,
        the metadata schema that supports the Learning Collection is
        based on Dublin Core with controlled vocabularies that support educational
        use of the collection and also VTS instruction.  Finally,
        the interface for the Learning Collection was designed to support face-to-face
        Visual Thinking Strategies instruction and actually provides VTS instruction
        virtually for those students approaching the resource without teacher
        guidance.</p>
    <p>Early in the project, Karen Wilson, the Curator of the Mesopotamian Gallery,
      began the selection process by creating a list of relevant artifacts that
      fit within the goals of the project.  Aligned with the categories
      found in the Oriental Institute Museum’s teacher’s guide,
      Life in Ancient Mesopotamia, the
      list was narrowed down to fifteen artifacts for each of the fourteen categories.  These
      categories were chosen to represent the
      culture of ancient Mesopotamia in its entirety: Archaeology, Prehistory,
      The First Farmers, The First Cities, The Invention of Writing, Literature,
      Mathematics and Measurement, Law and Government, Religion, Architecture,
      Daily Life, The Role of Women, Science and Inventions, and Warfare and
      Empire.  The Teacher Advisory Board then narrowed down the selection
      of artifacts to ten in each category by choosing those artifacts that would
      be most engaging to students, by their ability to educate the students,
      and by how well they illustrate the concepts of the categories.  The
      final list of one hundred and forty-four artifacts became the core content
      for the Learning Collection.</p>
    <p>When designing the interface for the Learning Collection,
        we were driven by two leading questions. How can we build an interface
        that supports face-to-face VTS instruction?  How can we incorporate
        the tenets of VTS into the presentation of the artifacts for independent
        student inquiry?  We developed the interface in such a way that  users
        can access the collection in three ways: through a traditional search
        interface, through a visual interface that requires students to select
        an artifact simply by looking, and through various browse features based
        on teacher-selected categories.  Furthermore, we developed two different
        artifact information pages that allow users to toggle between the two
        to access information about the artifacts in different ways.  The
        Artifact Description page includes curatorial information about the artifact,
        an artifact description, and suggested readings.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="ennes_fig1.jpg" alt="Fig 1" width="400" height="256"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 1:  The
        Artifact Description page for “Plaque with Banquet Scenes” from Ancient
        Mesopotamia: This History, Our History Learning Collection (<a href="../http://mesopotamia.lib.uchicago.edu/learningcollection/search.php?lcid=101&amp;&amp;b=96" target="_blank">http://mesopotamia.lib.uchicago.edu/learningcollection/search.php?lcid=101&amp;&amp;b=96</a>)</p>
    <p>The Visual Exploration page is designed to encourage students to look
      at the artifacts for answers and not the text.  This page leaves out
      the descriptive information about the artifact and instead lists questions
      about the artifact.  The questions were designed as conversational
      prompts for face-to-face VTS instruction or as guides students as they
      approach the artifact individually.  After looking at the artifact
      and interpreting it by using VTS questions as a guide, students can toggle
      to the Artifact Description page to learn what scholars and archaeologists
      say about the artifact.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="ennes_fig2.jpg" alt="Fig 2" width="400" height="256"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 2:  The
        Visual Exploration page for “Plaque with Banquet Scenes” from

        /search.php?lcid=101&amp;view=visual&amp;b=96</a>)</p>
    <p>The visual and browse interfaces are unique aspects of the Learning Collection
      because their design is heavily informed by VTS.  To
      meet the goals set by our incorporation of VTS, the visual and browse interfaces
      had to move beyond traditional browse
      interfaces.  The Visual Exploration interface is a collection of thumbnails
      of all of the artifacts in the collection: the interface  encourages
      students to select an artifact for inspection based upon its physical properties.  When
      students select artifacts through the Visual Exploration interface, they
      are taken directly to the Visual Exploration page that houses the leading
      VTS and discussion questions.  Their interpretation of the artifact
      is dependent upon looking and not upon the interpretations offered by scholars
      and archaeologists.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="ennes_fig3.jpg" alt="Fig 3" width="400" height="257"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 3:  The

    <p>To further the goals of Visual Thinking Strategies, the browse interfaces
      were given interactive, visual designs as opposed to the more traditional
      text-based interfaces.  This provides a social context for their discovery
      and encourages students to look at the artifacts and make connections between
      them.  Two excellent examples of this are the time period and archaeological
      site map browses.  The time period browse interface presents a graphic
      timeline that allows the student to select a time period with visual clues
      to the type of artifacts they will find
      in that area of the timeline.  The archaeological site map browse
      interface presents students with a map of the region.  It allows them
      to select a location or many locations from the map and view artifacts
      from those archaeological sites. </p>

    <p>One of the most important decisions we made was to use the Zoomify interface
        for the artifact images.  Zoomify is a technology that makes it
        easy to deliver high resolution images on the Web.  The Zoomify
        interface includes a tool palette that allows users to manipulate the
      image, zooming in on it so that they can examine the artifact in detail.
      It also includes a tool that enables a user to move around the canvas and
        focus in on different aspects of an artifact image.  We chose to
        use Zoomify because it assists us in achieving many of ourhigh level
        VTS goals. The Zoomify interface is
        successful at allowing and encouraging users to spend time looking at
        an artifact up close.</p>

    <h1>Using Visual Thinking Strategies in a Flash Interface</h1>
    <p>The use of VTS can also be found at the very heart of Dig Into History.  Dig
        Into History is the in-depth educational
        Flash interactive that was created to complement the Learning
        Collection  It was also developed
        for those teachers who wanted a quick and effective way to educate their
        students about the history of ancient Mesopotamia without requiring them
        to first wade through the Learning
        Collection.  For this reason
        the interactive needed to stand alone as an educational tool.  The
        interactive was born out of the museological concepts of collecting,
        classifying, and curating.  During the first years of development,
        we all referred to it as Collect, Classify, Curate.  </p>
    <p>The Chicago WebDocent team is experienced at creating in Flash stand-alone
      instructional units that can be used effectively and easily within the
      context of a classroom period.  Dig Into History was
      designed to be a unit of instruction that would encourage observation and
      critical thinking skills while relaying the concepts behind the science
      of archaeology and knowledge of ancient Mesopotamian civilization through  artifacts
      from the Mesopotamian Gallery of the Oriental Institute Museum.  We
      had broad concepts and a large amount of material we wanted to convey within
      such a compact educational vehicle.</p>
    <p>After many discussions the project team and teacher advisory board members
      developed for Dig Into History an
      interface that supports all of the high-level goals we had established
      for the project.  Well-suited for the middle school audience, Dig
      Into History feels like
      a game because it allows students to choose a quest and go on a simulated
      archaeological dig in real time.  But,
      in fact, it is much more than that.  What seems like an archaeological
      game actually leads to expanded lessons on the skills encouraged by Visual
      Thinking Strategies as well as the implementation and integration of those
      all-important literacy goals that educators desire.  </p>
    <p>With three statements to choose from and clues that lead them to the successful
      discovery of artifacts, students are challenged further as game play shifts
      and the interface becomes more of a tool that records their own discoveries
      and insights.  Students move through the game as project managers
      with the guidance of a mentor.  They dig for artifacts, fly by helicopter
      between three different dig sites, and choose whether or not to take the
      advice of their mentor. They are propelled to find ancient Mesopotamian
      artifacts that support a quest statement that they chose at the beginning
      of the game. </p>

    <p>A student who has located an artifact is prompted to catalogue it and
      collect information about it from the screen.  Cataloguing
      includes identifying where it was found, its age, and the  material
      it is made of, and composing free-form notes about the artifact.  Zoomify
      is used again in the Flash interactive so that students can view the artifact
      up close.  The use of Zoomify software within the Flash interface
      helps support a more refined VTS experience because student users are required
      to examine the artifact up close. Game play advances only if the student
      observes and then composes a detailed written description about each artifact.  Upon
      the successful recovery of at least four artifacts, the student can pause
      and print up a  field report, continue
      to unearth more artifacts, or move ahead to the next step of creating an
      exhibition. </p>

    <p>The field report is a printable HTML
      file that serves as documentation for teachers of their students’ work
      and writing skills.  It includes the overarching quest statement that
      each student chose at the beginning of the game, an analysis of the student’s
      skills as a project manager, as well as photographs of the artifacts discovered
      and  the student’s unique written observations about each artifact.  There
      is also a code generated for each separate field report;  a
      student can use this to move to the next stage of game play - curating
      personal  exhibition in a virtual museum.</p>
    <p>The Curate a Museum Exhibition feature
      of Dig Into History builds upon
      the Visual Thinking Strategies and literacy goals of the Collect
      and Catalog Artifacts experience.  Players
      choose four artifacts that best illustrate and support the original quest
      statement they chose at the beginning of the game.  The students learn
      by doing.  They learn about the structure of a museum exhibition by
      participating in the development and creation of a curatorial premise as
      they write and edit museum labels for each of their artifacts.  Again,
      embedding the Zoomify interface within the interactive encourages students
      to look closely at each artifact and examine it carefully as they compose
      their museum label. </p>

    <p>Visual literacy and literacy skills are inspired through every step of
      the process as each student creates a unique virtual museum exhibition.  This
      exercise culminates in a scrolling exhibition complete with artifact labels
      and a curatorial introduction created solely by the student.  And,
      just like the field report, the exhibition includes photographs of the
      artifacts, the curatorial introduction, and the artifact labels in a printable
      museum catalog of the student’s show.  The catalog is flexible
      enough for teachers to use as a gradable outcome of a student’s performance.    </p>
    <h1>Using VTS Within an On-line Professional Development Course for K-12
      Educators</h1>
    <p>The final feature that was created for Ancient Mesopotamia: This History,
        Our History is an on-line professional
        development course developed for K-12 educators nationwide who wish to
        earn graduate credit while learning about ancient Mesopotamia.  Visual
        Thinking Strategies is introduced immediately within the first module,
        and on-line participants will undertake studying it during the first
        week of the course when it is offered in the fall of 2007.  </p>
    <p>On-line course participants first start by reading PDFs about VTS. They
      download these from the Visual Understanding in Education (VUE) Web site
      (<a href="../http://www.vue.org/" target="_blank">http://www.vue.org/</a>).  Since
      VTS is an instructional tool, one of the many outcomes of the on-line course
      is that teachers will be required to submit a final lesson plan project.  The
      plan will include requisite literacy goals and the use of at least two
      components of the resource: VTS, the Learning Collection,
      or the Dig Into History interactive.  Teachers
      will also participate in a discussion board, answering questions about
      VTS and its applicability in the classroom.  Predetermined discussion
      groups will also participate in a real time exercise by analyzing Mesopotamian
      images using VTS in the Blackboard chat feature.    </p>
    <h1>Usability and Evaluation<s></s></h1>
    <p>Upon completion of the Learning Collection and Dig
        Into History, project staff conducted
        a usability study to identify bugs within the program and gauge whether
        or not the design of the products met our initial goals.   The
        study was conducted with twelve sixth grade students at a Chicago Public
        School.  Over two days, six of the students were observed using Dig
        Into History and engaging with
        a paper mock-up of the Curate section as this interactive was incomplete.  Six
        different students were observed using the Learning Collection.  The
        next section summarizes our observations that shed light on the achievement
        of our learning goals for the products.</p>
    <p>Overall, the students were able to access and use the Learning Collection without
        much guidance.  While completing the study tasks for the Learning
        Collection, the students spent
        time looking at the images instead of glancing at them and clicking on
        to the next image.  They liked the interactive browse features and
        needed prompting to look at other browse features because they were so
        engaged with the one they were currently using.  When viewing the
        Visual Exploration page that uses questions to engage the students in
        looking at the artifact in detail, the students were confused by the
        questions and needed prompts to look at the image for the answers.  They
        had expectations that there would be text that contained the answer.  They
        also expressed concern about answering the questions incorrectly.  These
        responses suggest that face-to-face VTS instruction might be more effective
        with students than independent Web-based VTS instruction.  We concluded
        that students might find Web-based VTS instruction more natural after
        experiencing at least one session of face-to-face VTS instruction with
        their teacher.  We are reexamining ways that we can modify the resource
        to help students incorporate the VTS questions into independent examination
        of an artifact. </p>
    <p>During the study, the students found Dig
        Into History a fun and engaging
        means of learning about ancient Mesopotamia.  Many of the students’ expectations
        for Dig Into History were
        founded on their experience playing video games in other areas of their
        lives.  The students were immediately able to grasp the concepts
        of the interactive game and begin play.  The students commented
        that using Zoomify made them want to look more closely at the artifact
        and that it helped them draw conclusions about the use of the artifact.  Students
        spent a lot of time looking at the artifacts once they mastered the Zoomify
        interface (which we modified to make it easier to use after the study).  They
        really liked finding the artifacts and digging for them.  One student
        commented that, “This is just like what an archaeologist would
        do.”   They also enjoyed cataloguing the artifacts and
        answering the questions about them.  They again expressed concern
        about answering the open-ended questions incorrectly.  The students
        used the interactive as a group and engaged in a lively debate over the
        interpretation of each of the artifacts.  The students were creative
        and imaginative when writing descriptions of the artifacts.  Once
        they were assured that there were no incorrect answers, they enjoyed
        looking closely at the artifacts and making their own observations about
        the artifacts. </p>
    <p>In the Curate a Museum Exhibition portion,
      students were mindful of the selection process, and choice was very important
      to them.  They enjoyed being able to choose the artifacts that they
      wished to examine more closely.  One student commented, “I liked
      being the historian and writing the descriptions.”  We concluded
      that use of the Zoomify tool was an integral part of the interpretive process
      on the Web.  As mentioned earlier, visual literacy and literacy skills
      are inspired through every step of the curatorial process as each student
      goes about creating a unique virtual museum exhibition.  The usability
      and evaluation study demonstrated that the resource was fun and easy to
      use.  The resource led students to spend time looking at artifacts
      in detail, to draw their own conclusions, and learn more about ancient
      Mesopotamia.    </p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>The project team that created Ancient Mesopotamia: This History, Our
        History set out to build a Web-based
        resource that would be successful at encouraging the K-12 audience to
        examine artifacts they might not ordinarily have the opportunity to view.  We
        also wanted to create a resource that supported the latest research by
        scholars and archaeologists, and one that was flexible enough to facilitate
        user-created interpretations of the artifacts.  The Visual Thinking
        Strategies methodology gave the project the necessary instructional framework.  VTS
        provided the model for meeting the educational goals of the project.  Together,
        the Learning Collection, Dig
        Into History, and the on-line
        course create a comprehensive resource.  By promoting the acquisition
        of visual literacy and literacy skills, this resource facilitates teaching
        and learning about ancient Mesopotamia in an innovative way.</p>
