      <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="abstractText">The power of the Internet and ICT lies partly in
        the leveling of the playing field for small and large institutions. Yet
        museums in the south-east of Scotland, mostly small and many dependent
        on volunteers, were failing to take advantage of this opportunity. In
        particular, museum staff and volunteers lacked the knowledge required
        to create their own on-line digital resources; the confidence to build
        on existing skills in using computers, expanding their abilities into
        new areas; the awareness  of what the technologies can (and can&#39;t)
        achieve, how they work, and how they may fail; and an understanding of
        the technologies underlying the provision of Web content. In addition,
        museums, especially smaller, volunteer-reliant museums, were deterred
        by a perception of excessive cost. </p>
      <p class="abstractText">In January 2005 we launched the Digital Resource
        Development Team project with more than twenty partners and £300,000
        over three years from the Scottish Executive. It aims to help the partner
        museums take advantage of the opportunities presented by ICT, the Web
        and open source applications to present their collections, and the knowledge
        about them, in new ways, engaging new audiences, by passing on the skills
        and knowledge to people in museums and helping them to overcome their
        technophobia.</p>
      <p class="abstractText">This paper focuses on two example sub-projects.  <em>Remember
          When</em> was developed in connection
          with the 2006 Rainbow City exhibition at the Edinburgh City Art Centre
          exploring the history of LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, bisexual and Transgender)
          life in Edinburgh. The Linlithgow Union Canal Society has been supported
          in re-purposing older educational material, including video, for use
          on site and on-line. </p>
      <p class="abstractText">So, how did we get them to play, and how did we
        persuade the reluctant? What were the pitfalls, and where were the unexpected
        bonuses? Did we make things better, or just leave the museums dazed and
        confused? How can we ensure this project has a legacy?</p>

    <h1>The Museum Context</h1>
    <p>What is a small museum? There is no standard definition
      in the UK, though the Scottish Museums Council has in some circumstance
      categorised museums according to the number of items in their collections
      -  not a particularly useful measure of capacity. The AAM defines
      a small museum as one whose annual revenue budget is under $250,000, and
      this figure is also used by the ILMS in the United States. Wherever we
      draw the line, some characteristics are common amongst small museums. They
      rely more heavily (indeed, sometimes exclusively) on volunteers, and what
      staff they have wear a number of curatorial and administrative hats. The
      stereotypical museum with specialist curators belies the fact that, in
      a number of institutions at least, most museums are small. The Scottish
      Museums Council has over two hundred members, of which 32 represent local
      council museum services. Of the remainder the vast majority are small independent
      museums – and of course some of the local authority services are
      quite small, too.</p>
    <p>When it comes to developing and maintaining an on-line
      presence, the perception of barriers plays a significant part in preventing
      small museums from making use of ICT and the Internet. </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Many
        barriers can discourage smaller museums from taking advantage of the
        Internet as a method of communication and tool for meeting their mission.
        These barriers may include the cost of creating an on-line presence,
        the staff time for determining and developing an online strategy, and
        the concerns involved in maintaining any effort taken (Bellnier
        2004).</p>
    <p>Yet the power of ICT to &#39;level the laying field&#39; – on
      the Internet, famously, no-one knows you&#39;re a dog – and the proliferation
      of cheap, or indeed free, tools to facilitate the creation of on-line content,
      together with the low financial cost of maintaining an on-line presence,
      mean that the difficulty of surmounting these barriers is being over-estimated
      by many small institutions.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">You don’t need a large team of people to
        develop and maintain complex proprietary software. The tools are out
        there - free, open, ubiquitous and relatively easy to use. (von Appen,
      2006)</p>
    <p>Despite the low level of usage, the concentration
      of power in many organisations in the hands of a few &#39;experts&#39; (often not
      that knowledgeable); and the perceptions of difficulty and expense and
      other barriers to uptake, there is yet a strong desire amongst small museums
      to make more use of especially the Internet as a means of reaching out
      to audiences. But we are all starting from a very low baseline.</p>
    <p>In Scotland, substantial amounts of public money have
      been invested in the digitisation of museum (and other) collections, principally
      funded through the National Lottery. In particular the Scran (<a href="../http://www.scran.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.scran.ac.uk/</a>)
      and NOF-Digitise (<a href="../http://www.enrichuk.net/" target="_blank">http://www.enrichuk.net/</a>)
      programmes resulted in the creation of more than 300,000 ‘digital
      objects’ (mostly in the form of images plus accompanying text and
      metadata). In the main it was larger institutions that were responsible
      for most of the content, but large numbers of smaller, volunteer-run museums
      and even private collectors participated. But as Filippini-Fantoni and
      Bowen (2005) note, there has been a</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">...lack
        of financial support from local or national government...which, after
        having contributed to the collections&#39; digitalization process, are now
        somewhat less eager to invest in the transformation of these resources
        into educational and entertaining services for the public... Even when
        external funding is made available for the development of multimedia
        resources, through the support of private sponsors, the projects are
        usually carried out outside of the institution itself by external companies.
        There is no real integration of the project into the museum structure
        and therefore there is no development of internal competence that could
        be really beneficial in an environment where the already scarce personnel
        have little expertise in this respect.</p>
    <p>Of course, all cultural institutions complain that
      the funding is not adequate, and consequently they lack both the equipment
      and staff resources to do all they wish to do. But according to the Scottish
      Museums Council&#39;s 2004 ICT Survey (Edgar, 2004), only one-third of all
      museums had a broadband or better connection to the Internet.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="gray.fig1.jpg" alt="Fig 1: Museum Internet connections, 2004" width="400" height="222"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 1:
        Museum Internet connections, 2004</p>
    <p>Although nearly 92% of respondents had at least one
      computer for staff use, almost half of these computers were over three
      years old. There were also notable difference between local authority (council)
      museums and independent museums.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="gray.fig2.jpg" alt="Fig 2: Comparison of local council and independent museums IT provision, 2004" width="400" height="199"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 2:
        Comparison of local council and independent museums IT provision, 2004</p>
    <p>The survey pointed to a need for training and skills
      development, and the difficulties, particularly for small, volunteer-dependent
      museums, in addressing this issue.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">54% of
        respondents said that full-time staff at their museum have access to
        ICT training...However, this figure is less (23%) when applied to volunteers...Only
        12 respondents have a dedicated ICT training budget.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">38%
        of respondents consider themselves to have adequate ICT skills in-house...Nearly
        30% of respondents either rely on a volunteer for technical support,
        or have no support available to them ...More geographically remote museums
        also cite the location of training as a problem.  (Edgar, 2004)</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="gray.fig3.jpg" alt="Fig 3: Usage of staff computers, 2004" width="400" height="222"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 3:
        Usage of staff computers, 2004 </p>
    <p>SMC&#39;s response to this was to set up a grant fund
      specifically aimed at helping small museums. The <em>ICT Small Museums
      Fund</em>  would give small grants
      to purchase equipment and training. In the event, most applications were
      for hardware, and few of these included any element of training. In the
      Impact Evaluation of the ICT Small Museums Fund 2004-2005 (Quick, 2006)
      it was noted that</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Several
        museums indicated that extra training in the use of new equipment or
        software would have been very helpful. Several also referred to difficulty
        in either getting information about equipment or knowing how to choose
        the best solution for a particular requirement... A skills base is hard
        to sustain in a volunteer run museum, where resources are often stretched
        and time is the most precious commodity. There is a need for continuing
        support and assistance in this area, both responsive and proactive, to
        help museums to exploit the opportunities available and continue to move
        on.</p>
    <p>In 2005, SMC published guidelines for ICT projects
      (Thomas, 2005), which recommended amongst other things that projects should</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ensure
        that there is a suitable exit strategy in place to retain or, at worst,
        transfer the skills and expertise developed as part of the project and
        maintain momentum;</li>
      <li>ensure
        that the technology is as flexible as possible, for example so that new
        items can be added and the system transferred from an in-house terminal
        to a Web site. This will broaden the application, making future planning
        more cost-effective and straightforward.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is in this context that we came to develop the
      Digital Resource Development Team project.</p>
    <h1>The Funding Background</h1>
    <p>In August 2003 the Scottish executive published <em>An
        Action Framework for Museums</em>.
        The guidelines for the Regional Development Challenge Fund were published
        on 22 December 2003, with a closing date for applications of 31 March
        2004. </p>
    <p>At the instigation of Herbert Coutts, then Director
      of Culture &amp; Leisure at City of Edinburgh Council, a consortium of
      museums in Scottish Borders, East Lothian, Midlothian, West Lothian, Edinburgh
      and Fife, including Local Authority, independent, university and national
      museums, had already been established in the Autumn of 2003 with the aim
      of submitting applications to the fund for specific projects which would
      be of benefit to all the partners. An initial seven proposals had been
      whittled down to four, of which two – the Digital Resource Development
      Team and the Regional Training Project - were successful in gaining funding
      of £300,000 each over three years. The grants were announced in October
      2004.</p>
    <p>The aims of the Digital Resource Development Team
      project were fourfold:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to
        provide staff working in partner museums with the necessary skills and
        required knowledge to create their own on-line digital resources; </li>
      <li>to
        increase their confidence by building on their existing skills in using
        computers, expanding their abilities into new areas;</li>
      <li>to
        give them a knowledge of what the technologies can (and can&#39;t) achieve,
        how they work, and how they may fail, leaving them better equipped to
        knowledgeably commission work from third parties without being ripped
        off; and</li>
      <li>to
        increase their understanding of the technologies underlying the provision
        of Web content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Two staff were employed to deliver training and to
      work with the partners in producing digital content both for exhibitions
      and for the Web. It was an important element of the project that there
      should be actual productions for end users of the museums and their Web
      sites; and that learning would take place through the creation of meaningful
      digital resources of value to the partner museums and appropriate to their
      scale and staff resources. The two project officers were both used to working
      with people whose ICT skills and knowledge were at a very low level. By
      the end of January, 2005, when the project officers started work, we had
      over twenty potential partners lined up, a management group consisting
      of one member from a museum in each of the counties in the region, plus
      a member from Learning &amp; Teaching Scotland (part of the Scottish Executive)
      and a member from the e-business project at Napier University in Edinburgh,
      and a partnership agreement for members to sign. The project was led by
      Peter Gray, the Principal Museums Officer with East Lothian Council. The
      staff were employed by and the project&#39;s cash flow was underwritten by
      East Lothian Council. The whole of the specific cash expenditure on the
      two staff and individual projects was covered by the £300,000 grant,
      but the time and efforts of staff in partner museums were their institutions&#39;
      contributions to the overall project. The original business plan for the
      project can be found on the DigitalMages site at <a href="../http://www.digitalmages.org/wb/media/download_gallery/business_plan.doc" target="_blank">http://www.digitalmages.org/wb/media/download_gallery/business_plan.doc</a> (Mages
      is simply an acronym for Museums &amp; Galleries in the East of Scotland,
      and implies no claim to great occult knowledge).</p>
    <h1>The Delivery Process</h1>
    <p>The East of Scotland Museums Partnership was the vehicle
      for bringing together museums across the region, but each funded project
      needed to have partners explicitly sign up to take part. This involved
      an appropriate person in each organisation signing a partnership agreement
      outlining how the project would work, what partners could expect to receive
      and what they would be expected to contribute (principally their time).
      Actually getting the signed agreements proved to be quite time-consuming,
      particularly where partners required Board or Council Committee approval.</p>
    <p>Coupled with the sign up process was an initial assessment
      of specific needs and capacities. Two surveys were sent to prospective
      partners – one for the partner organisation assessing access to equipment
      and expertise and the use currently made thereof; the second for individuals
      assessing their own skills and knowledge. The feedback from the surveys
      was used to compile the detailed project plan. Some £80,000 ($154,000)
      was set aside in the business plan for ‘projects’. The project
      management group agreed to set aside £20,000 as a ‘Challenge
      Fund’ to which partners could bid for 100% funding for specific projects.
      To date (January 2007), some ten projects have received funding (in addition
      to support and advice from the project officers). The grants awarded have
      ranged from £80 for a piece of software to £1,500 for a gallery
      interactive.</p>
    <p>In addition to one-to-one work either on-site or by
      phone or email, there have been 33 training sessions for groups on Web
      site creation; digital still image capture and manipulation; value for
      money software and hardware; and audio/video capture and editing. The training
      has been tailored to meet the needs of the participants, and has been aimed
      at helping with projects they are currently working on or about to start
      (e.g. Linlithgow Union Canal Society video project; East Lothian Museums
      podcasting project; “Simply Samplers” touring exhibition Web
      site).</p>
    <p>A project Web site was set up (<a href="../http://www.digitalmages.org/" target="_blank">http://www.digitalmages.org/</a>)
      both as a point of contact and as a repository for the help files, partner
      test sites, documents and newsletters. The factsheets, tips or on-line
      guides include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic
        Image Manipulation (2 versions – Gimp, Photoshop Elements)</li>
      <li>Basic
        HTML and Cascading Style Sheet site construction </li>
      <li>Individual
        Guides to the following Content Management Systems – MAMBO, eZ
        Publish and Website Baker</li>
      <li>Guide
        to basic video editing and a guide for video editing using tired, old
        equipment</li>
      <li>Guide
        to providing video suitable for YouTube</li>
      <li>Advice
        on using the RAW image format</li>

      <li>The
        ins and outs of white balance when taking digital images</li>
      <li>Tips
        on Premiere Elements</li>
      <li>Lexicon</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A regular newsletter is e-mailed to the partners and
      available for download on the project site (<a href="../http://www.digitalmages.org/wb/pages/downloads.php" target="_blank">http://www.digitalmages.org/wb/pages/downloads.php</a>).
      It includes news about partner activities, recommendations of cheap or
      free applications – a favourite ‘freebie’ each issue
      - tips and tricks, and so on. </p>
    <p>The project officers themselves have worked on producing
      digital resources for individual partners, though always with the aim that
      the recipient organisations will be able to continue to maintain, update
      or renew the resource themselves. Examples include touchscreen interactives
      running from a local Web server for East Lothian Museums, Fife Contemporary
      Arts &amp; Crafts and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh museum.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="gray.fig4.jpg" alt="Fig 4: Home page of gallery interactive, Dunbar Museum, 2006" width="400" height="320"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 4:
        Home page of gallery interactive, Dunbar Museum, 2006</p>
    <p>They have also worked on a number of partner Web sites,
      including the Friends of Kirkcaldy Museum (a work in progress, but the
      Mobile Museum section is completed: http://66.197.196.213/~friendso/wb/pages/mac-and-outreach-services.php); <em>Remember
      When</em> (<a href="../http://www.rememberwhen.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.rememberwhen.org.uk/</a>);
      and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards Museum.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="gray.fig5.jpg" alt="Fig 5: Fife&#39;s Mobile Museum home page" width="400" height="300"/></p>

    <p>It was an important aim of the project to show partners,
      most of whom have very small budgets, that there were low-cost (or even
      free) alternatives available to them for most of the activities they were
      planning to undertake – OpenOffice instead of MS Office; Gimp instead
      of Photoshop (or Photoshop Elements instead of the full program); Audacity
      for audio editing, and so on. In addition, we wanted to overcome the perception
      that doing anything on the Web was bound to be expensive – showing
      them that hosting could be very cheap; that a CMS need not cost more than
      the time involved to create the content; and that there are free services
      like Flickr, YouTube, and Bebo which can provide facilities that otherwise
      would be both technically and financially beyond the means of all but the
      largest organisations.</p>

    <h1>Remember When</h1>
    <p>The laws pertaining to homosexuality were different
      in Scotland from the law in England and Wales. The decriminalisation of
      (male) homosexuality in the Sexual Offences Act 1967 was not extended to
      Scotland until 1980.</p>

      <a href="../http://www.rememberwhen.org/" target="_blank">http://www.rememberwhen.org/</a></p>
    <p>Remember When… was
        a two-year long oral and community history project to document the lives
        and achievements of Edinburgh’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual
        people, past and present. It received support from the Heritage Lottery
        Fund, Edinburgh City Council and the Living Memory Association (<a href="../http://www.livingmemory.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.livingmemory.org.uk/</a>).
        Alongside the part-time project workers and administrator, and the city
        staff, many volunteers contributed to the project with interviews, participation
        in the collection and accessioning of objects. The principal outcome
        of the project was intended to be an exhibition (<em>Rainbow City</em>)
        at the Edinburgh City Art Centre; it took place from 6<sup>th</sup> May
        to 9<sup>th</sup> July 2006. The material and immaterial information
        gathered during the project’s lifetime were passed on to complement
        the City museums’ social history collection with a LGBT dimension. </p>
    <p>The Remember When project
        team consisted of three part-time project workers plus volunteers from
        the city&#39;s LGBT communities, working under the guidance of the Living
        Memory Association, a voluntary organisation dedicated to Edinburgh&#39;s
        oral and community history. The original project did not contain a Web
        element, but the Digital Resource Development Team project provided the
        opportunity to make the material collected – objects, images and
        oral histories – available via a dedicated Web site (<a href="../http://www.rememberwhen.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.rememberwhen.org.uk/</a>).
        This would also provide an opportunity for additional resources and content
        to be added as an ongoing project.</p>
    <p>Support for the creation of the Web version of the
      project included the setting up of the Web site. Since it was planned that
      the site content would be created by a number of different individuals,
      none of whom had any previous experience in creating on-line content, it
      was decided to use a content management system, but that the look of the
      site would match the existing publicity material for the exhibition (which
      at this point had not taken place). Initial discussions suggested that
      there would be a large number of users adding content to the site, and
      their access would need to be limited to specific areas and functions;
      therefore they would require specifically-tuned access permissions. However,
      there was no actual budget assigned in the original Remember When project
      to the creation of the site. It was therefore agreed to use eZ publish
      (<a href="../http://ez.no/" target="_blank">http://ez.no</a>/)
      as the CMS. This application was chosen both because of its price (it’s
      free) and because of its powerful user permissions system, the most flexible
      of any of the free CMSs. In retrospect, it was perhaps an overpowered solution,
      as the numbers of contributing users has not been as large as originally
      thought. A simpler solution such as Website Baker (<a href="../http://www.websitebaker.org/" target="_blank">http://www.websitebaker.org/</a>)
      would probably have been sufficient. Since it was hoped to provide large
      quantities of images and video, as well as sound files, through the site,
      a key element of the hosting was to find a package with sufficient storage
      space. Again, with other alternatives that are now available (YouTube for
      the video and Flickr for the images, for example), an alternate way of
      storing and providing access to the material (still via the main site)
      would perhaps have been simpler. As so often with ICT projects, it seems
      that there is never a right time to make a decision.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The initial
        funding for our Remember When project was from The Heritage Lottery Fund
        and this finished last year. There were, however, several volunteers
        who were still very enthusiastic to carry on taking part in project work.
        This grant has been a tremendous way of enabling these volunteers to
        continue and learn new ICT skills through working on the Website (Heather
        Robertson, Living Memory Association). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The project officers also helped to create a QuickTime
      tour of the exhibition. It will be available through the Web site, providing
      a permanent means of accessing this temporary exhibition, as well as a
      video guided tour.</p>
    <h1>Linlithgow Union Canal Society</h1>
    <p>The Linlithgow Union Canal Society (LUCS, <a href="../http://www.lucs.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.lucs.org.uk/</a>)
      was founded in 1975 to promote and encourage the restoration and use of
      the Union Canal, particularly in the vicinity of Linlithgow. The Society
      is a voluntary body, and unpaid volunteers man all facilities. The society
      now comprises some 600 members of whom approximately 100 are active in
      the organisation. All members are volunteers. The society is a registered
      charity and is a company limited by guarantee. Its headquarters are at
      the Canal Basin at Manse Road, Linlithgow. Here the formerly derelict stable
      buildings were leased from British Waterways; members restored them to
      form the small museum (opened 1978) and the tearoom (opened 1994). The
      museum forms a core part of their work with schools. They cater mainly
      for primary children, who get a short presentation on the canal in the
      museum and a trip on the boat (often their first experience of being afloat).
      In a typical year they have around 50 – 60 school parties. These
      vary in size from about a dozen people to large parties of 60. </p>
    <p>The motivation for taking part in the project differs
      from organisation to organisation, and from person to person. In the case
      of LUCS:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Personally,
        being now retired I miss the support that comes from working with people
        who are up to date with computers and software. The support of the project
        in overcoming this professional isolation, and in providing a short cut
        to the best solutions to what we want to do, has been invaluable. Organisationally,
        we increasingly felt that what we had on offer, both in the museum and
        in our outreach work (a video cassette, and 35mm slide show respectively)
        had begun to look old and tired. The video was not ideally suited to
        the full range of viewers. These include casual adult visitors and primary
        children from the earliest years up to P6 or 7. We wanted, ideally, to
        provide three distinct offerings, one for casual visitors, and two for
        schools, one for younger and one (basically the existing one) for older
        classes. </p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Initially
        we hoped that whatever equipment we acquired to update the schools programme
        would also be suitable for delivering our outreach programme. However,
        on Angus’s advice we separated these two elements and concentrated
        on the schools programme. Angus’s view was that no single piece
        of equipment was suitable for both functions.
        (Nuala Lonie, Curator)</p>
    <p>Using the money given us by the project, LUCS acquired
      a computer with a large disc drive and memory suitable for manipulating
      images, and a flat screen monitor with a wide viewing angle suitable for
      the small museum space where school parties meet. They also bought a slide
      scanner and video editing software (Adobe Photoshop and Premiere) and,
      with guidance from one of the project officers, downloaded numerous free
      programs for word processing, database and spreadsheets, among other things.
      They borrowed equipment bought for shared use amongst the project partners
      (large numbers of whom have older material on VHS that they would like
      to re-purpose) to transfer their schools’ video (and other film which
      they had) to the computer. This immediately brought them within sight of
      where they wanted to be as it provided a digitised version of the ‘older
      primary’ programme.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="gray.fig8.jpg" alt="Fig 8: Screen grabs from the LUCS videos digitised from VHS" width="400" height="330"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 8:
        Screen grabs from the LUCS videos digitised from VHS</p>
    <p>At the end of the LUCS season (October), the Curator,
      Nuala Lonie, began scanning the society’s slide collection. This
      work is still ongoing. She started with the slides used in the  outreach
      programme and in the museum display, and these will form the core of the “casual
      visitor” slide show. Advised by the new Education Officer who is
      a former primary head teacher, the curator has written a story for very
      young children, giving basic information about the canal (i.e. that it
      was made by digging it out by hand and that it carried coal on barges pulled
      by horses). She is currently engaged in making illustrations for the story
      (49 in total). The plan is to scan the final pictures in at actual size
      to accompany the text. The effect will be like a story book.</p>
    <p>So far the main usable output is a version of their
      video suitable for older children. They could also at any time produce
      very easily, for casual visitors, a slide show from the scanned slides.
      This will play in the museum in the background for people to view. It is
      simply a matter of making a selection of the slides they wish to input
      to this project.</p>
    <p>What have been the benefits of participation in the
      Digital Resource Development Team project?</p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Filling
        the knowledge gap that appears when one leaves work has been a huge personal
        benefit to me and the training provided has given immediate access to
        new software that otherwise I would have had to learn to use by trial
        and error. </p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">One of
        the uses that we intend to put the computer to, as well as the museum
        and schools projects described, is as a central repository for key documents
        and forms that we use in running the society. These include driver records
        and passenger records which we are required by the Maritime and Coastguard
        Agency to keep. We also have work sheets for schools. At present there
        are different versions of these documents on computers belonging to society
        members in Linlithgow and beyond. The society’s treasurer also
        has thoughts of putting his accounts on. Finally, our bookings secretary – not
        an enthusiast for computers – has agreed to learn how to operate
        the bookings system using an Excel type spreadsheet. Probably we will
        do this using the free software.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">It has
        been a very positive and useful experience. As to the next project, ideally
        we would like to return to the idea of digitising our outreach programme.
        This would entail acquiring equipment and software for PowerPoint type
        presentations, and training our outreach members in their use. (Nuala
        Lonie, Curator)</p>
    <h1>Keeping It Going</h1>
    <p>As so often with projects of this kind, continued
      funding is very uncertain, indeed unlikely. To ensure that the gains made
      are not lost and that the skills learned do not wither or fall behind will
      be a key aim of the final year. Building a digital resources support group
      across the region (and possibly wider) will help, and the East of Scotland
      Museums Partnership is already working on further funding proposals to
      build on the successes of their three projects.</p>
    <p>We have tried to ensure long-term sustainability of
      projects for the wide range of partner organisations, but all organisations – and
      particularly small ones – remain vulnerable to the loss of key staff.
      Indeed, in a small museum <strong>all</strong> staff
      are key staff. By establishing the East of Scotland Museums Partnership,
      we hope that at the very least there will be a sustainable group of people
      with the knowledge, skills and expertise to help one another in the future.
      The digital products of the project on the Web and within the museums will
      remain, to be re-used, shared, changed and updated, and in the process
      the learning will continue and the skills base of the partners will be
      maintained. The touring exhibition <em>Simply Samplers</em> and
      its accompanying Web site (<a href="../http://www.simplysamplers.org/" target="_blank">http://www.simplysamplers.org/</a>)
      will continue beyond the lifespan of the project and will serve as a model
      for planning the digital version of exhibitions along with their physical
      manifestation (rather than as a last minute add-on). But in the end, it
      will all depend on the energy, enthusiasm and commitment of the partners,
      and more than anything on their ability to commit time, rather than cash,
      to maintaining and developing their digital resources and their on-line
      presence. </p>

    <h1>The Learning Curve</h1>
    <p>The short time scale created by the Scottish Executive
      (effectively twelve weeks from the announcement of the guidelines to the
      closing date for completed applications) meant that there was lack of initial
      detailed research about specific needs, and just as important, a lack of
      time to prepare potential partners. We were thus unsure from the start
      what specific projects would be wanted – essentially, we were basing
      our ideas on the little research conducted by SMC, and trying to keep our
      options as open as possible. As for the partners, it’s very hard
      to articulate what exactly you want when you don&#39;t know what you <strong>can</strong> want.
      This meant that the first months of the project were taken up in assessments
      of partner needs and capacities and in educating the partners about the
      sorts of things that would be possible for them. A longer lead time for
      developing the projects would have informed the project plan and allowed
      us to get down to work immediately. It is vitally important in a project
      with a large number of partners scattered over a wide geographic area that
      you keep plugging away at the partners to respond to offers and enquiries.
      Since the great majority of the partners are small, often volunteer-run,
      museums, each person working there has a lot of tasks competing for their
      attention, and it’s easy for staff to let things slip. In the end,
      persistence pays.</p>
    <p>Coupled with this is the thorny issue of who it is
      you have made contact with. How do you know your letters and e-mails are
      going to the right person? Are the contact details correct? Often the initial
      point of contact is in a senior position (Chair of the Trustees, Director
      or similar) and information may not reach the appropriate people: really
      you need, as it were, to ‘speak to the minions’. This can
      be a problem in all types and sizes of organisations. It is invaluable
      to have a project advocate within each organisation, and in at least a
      couple of instances it took a long time for the project to make contact
      with this person.  In one case, the institution had heard nothing
      about us until a chance contact was made, and in another it depended on
      a change in staffing taking place.</p>
    <p>The possibility of resistance from specific individuals
      or groups should not be underestimated. There may be individuals with vested
      interests (sometimes financial) in existing practice, or simply a resistance
      to changing established methods of working or taking advantage of new opportunities.</p>
    <p>Corporate policies, particularly with partners who
      are embedded within larger organisations such as local councils or universities,
      can slow things down (or even stop them completely). Indeed, in large organisations,
      network policies may prevent access to services like Flickr and YouTube.
      Decision making may take place at a substantial remove from the actual
      activity. Conflicts within the organisation may also stymie progress. </p>
    <p>The centralisation of purchasing proved to be a problem
      both for the main project and for some of the partners, when what was required
      either could not be sourced from approved suppliers at a competitive price,
      or in some cases could not be bought at all.</p>
    <h1>Not Costing the Earth</h1>
    <p>The project is now two-thirds through its three-year
      programme. Over twenty partners, responsible for more than forty museums
      across the region, have participated to varying degrees. Some have grasped
      the opportunity with both hands and have produced resources and acquired
      the equipment and skills to do so on into the future in ways that would
      not have been possible without the support of the DRDT. When we began,
      we were far from Web 2.0: most of the partners were still at the stage
      of Web 0.2 beta. We have moved on far from there, and though the cost may
      seem large, it amounts to no more than £2,500 (about $4,750) per
      museum per year. The increase in skills, knowledge and confidence is apparent
      in the work that has been produced, but much remains to be done, and the
      developments have been unevenly spread. We have shown our partners that
      it doesn’t require massive funds or huge development teams to produce
      worthwhile digital content; that there are cost-effective, value for money
      alternatives for almost all of the big brand-name applications you might
      need, and that the future financial costs of maintaining their Web presence
      need only be modest provided they can commit  time to doing it.</p>
    <p>Who are you calling cheap? Why, us – but it’s
      a badge we wear with pride.</p>
