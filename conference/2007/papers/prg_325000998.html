				  <h1>Introduction</h1>
				  <p>Software engineering for a long time has moved toward
				    the production of re-usable software components.  The advent of
				    Object Oriented Programming has helped  programmers produce higher
				    quality software that is easier to maintain.  The emergence of best
				    practices allows the production of software that reuses both components
				    and  common design patterns (Gamma et al. 1995).  </p>
				  <p>With the advent of the Web in the 1990s, people were
				    able to start producing their own content.  Later, scripting languages
				    like PERL, PHP and ASP enabled Web developers to make dynamic Web sites.  At
				    first, “Web scripting languages” such as PHP facilitated
				    the production of “one-time” use code, as many less experienced
				    developers found it was easy to produce dynamic Web pages.  Now,
				    many programming languages for the Web allow developers to work within
				    frameworks that have been proven effective (e.g. Jakarta Struts, Java
				    Server Faces, Ruby on Rails, Cake PHP).</p>
				  <p>More recently, a number of technologies that have
				    enabled the production of distributed service components have come about,
				    most notably the SOAP standard (Box et al. 2000).  This shift in
				    the function of the Web gives developers access to an array of useful
				    tools, that are hosted and maintained externally.</p>
				  <p>Now with Web 2.0 (O&#39;Reily 2005) firmly in place, we
				    find the number of Web services and the uses of these growing daily.  Mashups
				    (Mashup) are typical examples of how Web services can be used to enrich
				    a Web site utilizing external resources.  An excellent example can
				    be found at (<a href="../http://www.housingmaps.com/" target="_blank">http://www.housingmaps.com/).</a></p>
				  <p>We are proposing that
				      the Museum community think carefully about their Web sites and
				      their I.T. Infrastructure.  What might look like a one-time development
				      task could be a reusable service that can be utilized by a number of
				      applications.  Both internal and external entities could use these
				      services and effectively reduce future development and maintenance
				      costs.  Before implementing a service, a check should be made
				      to see if similar usable implementations already exist.  If either
				      the component or the design of the component can be reused, it should
				      be.  With the ever-growing adoption of open source software, this
				      is a serious consideration for any museum.  If many museums use
				      the same software or services, maintenance costs are reduced via economy
				      of scale.</p>
				  <p>Section 2 discusses some
				      of the well-known principles of good software design and also best
				      practices regarding the production of a quality service component,
				      whether distributed or otherwise. Section 3 discusses how the museum
				      community might host and make use of services both in-house and externally.
				      Section 4 discusses the disadvantages of distributing components over
				      a LAN and the Internet: we give some suggestions on how to avoid these
				      problems.  </p>
				  <h1><strong>Principles</strong></h1>
				  <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The first principle of
				    good programming is what is commonly referred to as “Loose Coupling”(Gamma
				    et al. 1995). Loose coupling describes programming
				    components that are not dependent on each other.  For example, one
				    might have a Web site that takes credit card payments via Paypal.  One
				    way to design such a system is to include some code to process the Paypal
				    (<a href="../http://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank">http://www.paypal.com</a>)
				    payments.  We subsequently discover that we need to use another
				    payment provider, e.g. WorldPay (<a href="../http://www.worldpay.com/" target="_blank">http://www.worldpay.com</a>).  But
				    the existing system is now tightly coupled to Paypal, and the code that
				    achieves this must be duplicated and adapted for the site to accept WorldPay
				    payments.  The principle of loose coupling tells us that the system
				    should have been designed to work with the abstract concept of a payment
				    provider, with the implementation details that differ between payment
				    providers being hidden behind a common interface or API used within the
				    system.  Applying the loose coupling principle reduces the amount
				    of work required to make modifications to the system.</p>
				  <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">This
				      brings us to the next point, the issue of an API (Applications Programming
				      Interface).  This is the abstraction layer that enables programmers
				      to build on existing systems and “stand on the shoulders of giants”.  Without
				      this idea we would not have the computer systems we have today.  The
				      most commonly used APIs are found in operating systems (e.g. Microsoft
				      Windows/Unix).  These APIs allow programmers to write to files
				      on the disk without needing detailed knowledge of the internal disk
				      management.  When we design software, we may want to enable other
				      people to use the base functionality again in other products.  Several
				      common products with the same API allow the component that uses
				      the API to be moved between implementations. –In
				      the Java world, there are many application containers. If software
				      is written against the standard API, we are free to move between vendors
				      and our software will still work (in theory).  </p>
				  <p>We have covered the design practices that make “software
				    as a service” possible, but we are missing the details of how the
				    service-consumer communicates with the service-provider.  This is
				    simple if the programming constructs are all written in the same programming
				    language and are all on the same machine.  But there are many reasons
				    why this is often not the case.  </p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>Newer
				      programming languages usually offer many benefits over
				      older ones. The more recently a system was developed, the more likely
				      it will have been programmed in a different language to older (legacy)
				      systems still in use.</li>
				    <li>The
				      common programming language of a development team may not
				      be optimal for implementing a new feature, so a different language
				      is used. </li>
				    <li>The
				      service is being offered over the Internet.</li>
			    </ul>
				  <p>If the service-consumer
				    and service-provider are to talk to each other without knowledge of programming
				    languages, or even if they are on different machines, an appropriate
				    messaging format is needed.  This idea is not new: COM+(MS COM+)
				    and CORBA (CORBA) have been around since 1993.  Newer messaging
				    formats such as SOAP and REST are of interest because of their text based
				    (xml in the case of soap) protocol, which can be easily deciphered by
				    humans.</p>
				  <p>The ideas we have mentioned
				      so far have been around for quite some time in the software development
				      world. They have recently become particularly relevant in the Web development
				      world with the advent of Web applications and software-as-a-service,
				      developed using scripting languages such as PHP and ASP. The historical
				      usage of these programming languages in solving simpler problems may
				      have contributed to Web developers being slow to recognize and adopt
				      existing good design practices, as they failed initially to spot the
				      applicability of such practices to new paradigms, or were just not
				      aware of such practices in the first place. The development of Web
				      programming frameworks based on sound design principles such as Java
				      Struts, Java Server Faces and CGI::Application for PERL, among others,
				      along with general awareness raising within the Web development sphere,
				      has helped in improving this situation. </p>
				  <p>A newer twist in the ideas
				    of loose coupling has been the introduction of aspect oriented programming
				    (AOP Alliance) techniques and libraries.  The idea is to separate
				    cross-cutting concerns within your code: a <em>cross-cutting
				    concern</em> is secondary functionality
				    that affects various parts of a program.   One can then
				    re-introduce them declaratively: this means that a separate declaration
				    is made to apply the secondary functionality.</p>
				  <p>Examples of cross cutting concerns are transactional
				    code, logging code or security interception.    </p>
				  <p>One might decide that all methods of our service that
				    retrieve information from the database should be optimized for read-only
				    transactions, and all others be wrapped in a read-write transaction.  It
				    might be that all methods that save data to the database should be declared “secure” and
				    therefore require relevant privileges to be used.  We can test our
				    code without transactions and without security and apply these “concerns” separately,
				    without tainting the core function of the service.  Before, we had
				    to think about all these concerns at once. We are now able to slice them
				    up and let our Aspect Oriented Engine “weave” them back together.  Good
				    AOP libraries provide code generation  of
				    an exceptional quality, both in style and efficiency, so there is no
				    problem with performance.  AspectJ (<a href="../http://aspectj.com/" target="_blank">http://aspectj.com</a>) for Java,
				    and PHPAspect (<a href="../http://www.phpaspect.com/" target="_blank">http://www.phpaspect.com</a>) for PHP are excellent examples
				    of this paradigm.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><img src="ellis-d.figure1.png" alt="Figure 1" height="149" width="386"/></p>
				  <p class="caption">Fig
				      1: AOP DIAGRAM </p>
				  <p>Figure 1 shows an example of how one might apply AOP
				    to a software project.  The method’s really complicated task
				    is wrapped by aspects of security and is placed within a transaction.  The
				    aspects represent layers of the program, separating out concerns that
				    are not directly related to the operational task.</p>
				  <p>With AOP, programmers can write cleaner code that
				    only concentrates on the functionality they are writing and does not
				    force them to deal with other concerns.  This also helps in the
				    testability of your code, because you can test the core task and each
				    concern in isolation, making locating bugs quicker.</p>
				  <p>The final recent advancement worth noting was born
				    in the Java world (although applies to any programming language).  It
				    is called <strong>Dependency Injection</strong> or <strong>Inversion
				    Of Control</strong> (Fowler 2004).  Examples
				    of Inversion Of Control (IoC) containers include <strong>Spring</strong> for
				    Java, and the PHP <strong>Garden project</strong>.  The
				    idea here is to inject programming objects or services into other programming
				    constructs, so that objects do not need to explicitly carry information
				    on how to acquire their dependencies.  This
				    again, encourages good design because it is very easy to switch out components
				    that support the same interface.  When it comes to testing, we can
				    replace “real” objects with “fake” or “mock” objects
				    that emulate the real service.  It may be that testing with a real
				    remote payment system incurs a charge: it would be nice to swap this
				    out and replace it with a fake local version during the test period.</p>
				  <h1>Museum Web Services</h1>
				  <p>When we think about museums and what services we could
				    offer, we immediately see huge opportunity for reuse of software and
				    service offerings.  Many museum Web sites already offer services
				    that are not formally exposed by a standard mechanism.  Examples
				    of these are the portcullis service of the parliamentary archives (<a href="../http://www.portcullis.parliament.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.portcullis.parliament.uk</a>),
				    and the American Revolution site that provides access to its collection
				    (<a href="../http://amrevonline.org/" target="_blank">http://amrevonline.org</a>),
				    among others.  These are Web sites that are closely coupled to the
				    search and retrieval logic, but one could imagine a well-defined separation
				    enabling a great number of usages from the same retrieval engine.</p>
				  <p>We already have one example of a service that museums
				    can offer: search and retrieval of collection data.  This leads
				    us to the discussion of standards.  If we were to implement such
				    a system for a museum like the New York Historical Society, then another
				    museum might implement a second version.  Users of these services
				    would need to write two different versions of code that does the same
				    thing.  We propose the introduction of a well-documented standard
				    for such services.  Concerns that are not directly related to the
				    task at hand also need to be taken care of, such as security and access
				    control.</p>
				  <p>In addition to this, there are many more services
				    that can can be offered to or utilized by museums.  We see the functionality
				    offered by our own open source on-line exhibition system <strong>Nexhibition
				    (</strong><a href="../http://www.nexhibition.com/" target="_blank">http://www.nexhibition.com</a>)
				    as one such service.  This service allows the collation of a number
				    of images from a collection into a database which in turn allows an on-line
				    exhibition to be created.  Users are also able to write narrative
				    around the images.  Our original design for this system was very
				    monolithic as there didn&#39;t seem any need to do it any other way.    As
				    we revisit the design, we are able to see the benefits
				    of employing a distinct separation of the constituent components.  We
				    have built a service that allows the search and retrieval of images,
				    a service that allows one to assemble images from our retrieval engine
				    and other sources into a structured exhibition, and we have provided
				    some work flow to aid in the publication of exhibitions.  Whilst
				    the services exist, they cannot be separated and are very much interwoven.  In
				    our ideal Nexhibition, we would build a system that allows these modules
				    to be composed and used many times, in different software products.</p>
				  <p>The steve.museum  project (<a href="../http://steve.museum/" target="_blank">http://steve.museum</a>)
				    was built from the ground up with Web services in mind.  Stakeholders
				    in the project realized the potential, the need and the architectural
				    significance of providing a <strong>Tagging Service</strong>.  It
				    allowed the developers to more easily respond to changes in the way the
				    software is used, and allows future development to more easily fit-in
				    to the architecture.  It has been an assumption from the outset
				    that the same steve engine will
				    be used to drive many tools, from tagging interfaces to search
				    engines and analysis tools.  </p>
				  <p>The Pachyderm (<a href="../http://pachyderm.org/" target="_blank">http://pachyderm.org</a>)
				    project is an open source project that allows the generation of flash
				    based exhibitions.  Whilst they don&#39;t expose any of their own code
				    as services, the project certainly makes use of a distributed service
				    based architecture.  In particular, the asset repositories are accessed
				    via a distributed service interface.  The compilation engine could
				    be run on a separate machine, enabling the use a variety of tools to
				    author the content.  It might also be possible to share data access
				    and business logic among a number of presentation engines (we could consider <strong>html</strong> or <strong>flash,</strong> among
				    others).</p>
				  <p>Other suggestions of services: </p>
				  <ul>
				    <li>A
				      shopping service – Museums could offer rights to sell digital
				      images of items and provide search and shopping services
				      for them.</li>
				    <li>Event
				      Information – Events going on in museums could be queried and
				      displayed on third party Web sites. </li>
			    </ul>
				  <p>There are many more opportunities to expose functionality
				    as a distinct service. We simply need to be mindful as they present themselves.</p>
				  <h1>The Design Of A Service Oriented, Loosely Coupled Online Exhibition
				    Environment (Nexhibition Next Generation).</h1>
				  <p>We have many ideas for the next generation open source
				    product Nexhibition. We want to reduce dependencies on specific software
				    products and design an application that is flexible and re-usable.  Whenever
				    we see an opportunity to factor out a common service that could/is used
				    else where, we will take it.</p>
				  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a><a href="../http://edit.archimuse.com/mw2007/papers/ellis-d/ellis-d.fig2.html" target="_blank"><img src="ellis-d.figure2.jpg" alt="Fig 2" width="400" border="0"/></a></p>
				  <p class="caption"> Fig
				      2: services required to achieve Nexhibitions  aims</p>
				  <p>Nexhibition is a system that allows different types
				    of users to assemble assets from a number of collections in order to
				    produce on-line exhibitions.  We need a Collection of objects and
				    their associated images; we need a way to manage work flow as exhibitions
				    are passed between users for approval and editing stages; we might also
				    need some tagging of the images we display. Finally, we need a service
				    that assembles assets into exhibitions that can be displayed on-line.  The five
				    APIs required to support these services are depicted in the diagram.  We
				    have not specified which collections management system we are going to
				    use, nor have we said which work-flow, tagging or exhibition manager
				    implementation we are using. We have simply expressed that we need a service that
				    supports those APIs.  Accessing CMS
				    data through a common API means our new software is not dependent on
				    a particular brand of CMS.</p>
				  <p>In the same way that data specifications are being
				    standardized, such as with Dublin core (Dublin Core) and CDWA lite (CDWA),
				    we propose that a number of external service APIs
				    also be standardized.  All vendors would produce API spec compliant
				    software, open source or proprietary.  This would allow us to easily
				    add CMS resources and upgrade exhibition managers.  This approach
				    requires support from both the community and vendors themselves.  In
				    the Request For Comments (Ellis et al. 2007), we examine options for
				    the instantiation of standards bodies to house and vet these specification
				    documents. </p>
				  <h2>Disadvantages and Coping Strategies</h2>
				  <p>We have looked at the evolution of good software design
				    and discussed how we can extend these ideas to a distributed service
				    architecture.  Whilst loose coupling makes software easier to maintain,
				    there are a number of inherent problems when we move to a distributed
				    model.  When programming in a distributed environment, we must assume
				    a level of uncertainty when it comes to contacting services over a network:
				    this is exaggerated on larger networks such as the Internet.  We
				    are now relying on a number of assumptions: the Internet connection between
				    us and the server is operating at a reasonable level of service at the
				    moment; the server itself is under a reasonable load; the server is able
				    to serve our request in a timely manner.  Our code needs to be able
				    to take account of these conditions, and be able to respond accordingly.</p>
				  <p>We find that the service is in the hands of a third
				    party, and clients of the service provider are now dependent on a third
				    party’s state.  If the service is taken down for maintenance
				    or there is a security breach, clients of the service are directly affected.  When
				    designing the implementation of software that uses external services,
				    all of these concerns need to be considered and appropriate measures
				    must be put in place.  Some systems may not be able to function
				    if an external dependency is down. Some might be able simply to shut
				    off that particular part of the system or temporarily replace it with
				    another similar service.  When operating a service, good communication
				    of events goes a long way to its success.</p>
				  <p>Even if the service is always available and is as
				    efficient as possible, it might not be enough.  Latency requirements
				    for a Web site may be unachievable, depending on the service being offered.  It
				    may be that it is simply impossible to maintain a tolerable service level
				    using a distributed Internet based service.  If this is the case,
				    it may be possible to improve performance by introducing some caching
				    on the client system.</p>
				  <h1>Closing
				      Remarks</h1>
				  <p>We began by discussing
				    some of the principles behind good software design.  Loose Coupling
				    of software components has been a driving force made popular in (Gamma
				    et al. 1995).  A further extension to loosely coupled components resulted in
				    the transformation into a distributed (often Internet-based) environment,
				    with technologies such as CORBA, DCOM, and later REST and SOAP, emerging.</p>
				  <p>Secondly, we addressed the museum-based Web sites
				    and software we are aware of and  have worked with, and we began
				    to think about these in a service-oriented way.  We hope others
				    will start to produce reusable software components that offer services
				    to their peers.  Indeed, we encourage readers to produce and run
				    Web services as well as make use of them.</p>
				  <p>It isn&#39;t all plain sailing, and we have talked about
				    some of the inherent problems faced when building any kind of distributed
				    system, especially with Web services.  The advice is to keep it simple
				    and assume that it will break at some point: indeed, failing conditions should be tested
				    and reproduce-able.</p>
				  <p>If the community begins to move this way, we have
				    some interesting economic possibilities with brokers offering services
				    and consumers paying to use them.  If we think about the mechanics
				    of this now, as a community, it will drive vendors and other participants
				    to commit more fully.</p>
