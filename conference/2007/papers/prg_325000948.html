    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Interactive exhibits in museum settings tend to be fairly small-scale,
      typically aimed at individuals or very small groups. In science and technology
      centers, where interactive exhibits are common, such exhibits serve as
      the destination spots of thematically organized environments. Some museums
      have the space and the resources for grander gestures, but these often
      focus on inert historical artifacts or aesthetically compelling large sculptures.
      Some of these pieces are educational and visually evocative, such as the
      Hoberman Sphere at Liberty Science Center. What many museums and science/technology
      centers are interested in developing now are environmental scale installations
      that are responsive to individual user’s actions.</p>
    <p>Hand held devices have been making inroads into museum settings over the
      past decade. Early efforts concentrated on the use and deployment of audio
      and electronic tour guides; much of the use of hand held devices in museum
      settings still focuses on the guided tour function. The authors of this
      paper have been exploring the use of coming hand held devices as interface
      mechanisms for large-scale interactives. This shift from the use of specialized
      hand held devices (mp3 players and headphones for the purposes of guided
      tours) to devices that visitors have access to before, during, and after
      their time at the museum seems a promising vector of interactivity design.  Finding
      ways to use the everyday technologies that people carry with them ‘on
      the move’ - such as cell phones, PDAs, iPods, and digital cameras
      - is an interesting opportunity for the museum to make connections to the
      technological environments and literacies that visitors bring with them.</p>
    <p>One of the biggest challenges in all museums, and particularly science
      and technology centers, is keeping exhibits fresh and informed of current
      events and scientific developments. The need for evergreen content is widely
      recognized as a key factor in the rate and interval of return visits -
      museum visitors don’t want to return and see all the same stuff.
      Presenting and explaining events in the dynamically changing fields that
      comprise contemporary science and technology is one of the pillars of the
      educational mission of these cultural institutions; every conference of
      museum professionals includes sessions on how to explain contemporary technological
      developments that are showing up in the newspapers and magazine headlines
      (for example, human genomics, nanotechnology, biomimicry, to name a few
      of the most current topics of fascination). Creating new exhibits to address
      these topics requires considerable resources of design staff, outside expertise,
      and research, bringing in traveling shows for this purpose requires money
      – all are often in short supply for museums.</p>
    <h1>Call and Response</h1>
    <p>In the spring of 2005, Liberty Science Center put out a call for proposals
      for a large-scale exhibit to occupy the atrium of their expanded and remodeled
      facility in Jersey City, New Jersey. The call was multi-faceted; its central
      design provocation was an invitation to “reinvent Times Square for
      the circulation of science and technology news.”  The museum
      appreciated the way that the many screens of Times Square display the news
      of the day and statistics of the world (stock quotes, weather descriptions)
      in a seemingly unmediated form. The RFP called for proposals for the development
      of a piece that would convey that science wasn’t a staid and static
      field, but rather an exciting and dynamic topic, full of excitement and
      day-to-day developments. </p>
    <p><em>Science Mobilized</em>, a large-scale piece proposed by Onomy Labs,
      Inc., was selected as the installation for the newly renovated atrium at
      Liberty Science Center. In ways that will be described over the following
      pages, <em>Science Mobilized</em> took on the challenge of gathering evergreen
      content, leveraging visitors’ hand held devices, and allowing visitors
      to interact with this large-scale piece in enjoyable and meaningful ways. <em>Science
      Mobilized</em> did not take the obvious path of putting a cartoon of New
      York City urbanism into a museum across the Hudson, but rather mused about
      how Times Square might appear were it <em>designed</em> as a communications
      tool, rather than simply being an accretion of large displays in a public
      space. <em>Science Mobilized</em> is an artful, tech-savvy approach to
      a complex suite of problems.</p>
    <p>The current name of <em>Science Mobilized</em> is now<strong> </strong><em>T2ST:
        The Times Square of Science and Technology</em>. It will premiere in
        July 2007 in the Breakthroughs atrium in the Liberty Science Center.
        The piece takes New York’s Times Square as an inspiration and prototype,
        but goes steps further in various directions. The real Times Square is
        an accretion of display surfaces that came about by historical accident;
        the information display servers were never designed to form a coherent
        whole. In fact, as it is now, the various display surfaces compete with
        one another for viewer attention. <em>T2ST</em> takes a different approach:
        it is designed to employ multiple display surfaces for the presentation
        of different kinds of information. <em>T2ST</em> consists of 25 dynamic
        content surfaces arrayed around the 40-foot cube of the atrium. Throughout
        the day, each screen will be showing video, images, and/or text of current
        events in science and technology. The various display surfaces are orchestrated
        to work together to produce a visually dense but meaningful information
        space. <em>T2ST</em> speculates about how Times Square might look if
        it <em>had </em>been designed as an interactive information source for
        the public. Despite the jumble of information surfaces, Times Square
        evokes a sense of wonder and awe. This is the impact that <em>T2ST</em> aims
        to recreate. </p>
    <p>The most dominant feature of T2ST is a mobile, like those found above
      a baby&#39;s crib, but scaled up to fill a large atrium. The mobile is comprised
      of three large translucent plastic shapes, about 10 feet on a side, inspired
      by the museum themes of Environment, Health and Invention. Several video
      projectors embedded in each shape project images and video on to the surfaces,
      giving the shapes an engaging and dynamic appearance for the museum visitors
      who view the piece from the balconies of the atrium. </p>
    <p>The three shapes and their counterweights are connected to each other
      through cables and pulleys; in this way the mobile addresses all 3 floors
      of the atrium. The system is motorized and the shapes slowly rise and fall
      throughout the day. The shapes thus have the side-to-side dynamic of a
      traditional mobile <em>and</em> the up-down dynamics of the cable system.
      Each shape and its counterweight are statically balanced so that the mobile
      is completely safe in the event of a power failure. For bulb replacement
      and any other service, the shapes can be lowered near to the floor and
      an access panel removed. </p>
    <p>The counterweights in the mobile are two LED ‘zipper’ signs,
      mounted back-to-back, showing textual information on current science developments.
      These signs, highly reminiscent of Times Square stock quote tickers, will
      display content germane to the theme of their corresponding shape.</p>
    <p>On the spandrels of the atrium are two other types of display. A set of ‘text
      sprays’ is  projected on the periphery of the atrium, and emerges
      from and disappears into the corners of the concrete balconies of the space.
      Traversing along two spandrels are two additional zipper signs, each on
      a motorized cart. These signs can be thought of as ‘reading’ information
      that is invisibly inscribed on the spandrels themselves. As the zipper
      moves along a spandrel, sometimes under visitor control, it reveals hidden
      statistics like the falling number of acres of rain forest or the rising
      global human population.</p>
    <p>The content shown in <em>T2ST</em> will include images, text and video
      from a wide variety of Internet RSS feeds about science and technology.
      Onomy Labs has created spider processes that gather material automatically
      from trusted sources, cataloguing it, storing it locally, and queuing it
      for display on the different information sources of the <em>T2ST</em> installation.
      The automating of the information gathering, cataloguing and display  removes
      the necessity of having a full-time staff member devoted to content retrieval
      and management. A digital ‘master scheduler’ application coordinates
      the daily programming of the installation; the day’s program can
      be manually over-ridden in the case of breaking news, or for the presentation
      of specially designed content that might be produced for a special museum
      event. The foundation of the information display system is a set of services
      for acquiring Web-based content. But the information sources still need
      to be routinely monitored by a museum staff member, not only for the purposes
      of the verification of reliability, but also for the purposes of accountability
      and citation. For this reason, the ‘master scheduler’ application
      also includes notification and approval mechanisms for staff. It will also
      produce a history of what’s been displayed on various surfaces during
      any time period. This will enable the museum to adequately document the
      sources of the displayed information, so as to comply with Fair Use standards
      and information audits.</p>
    <p>Museum staff, visitors, artists and students are invited to add new RSS
      subscriptions and pointers to interesting breaking news sources. The museum
      staff direct the overall functioning of the mobile, both when it is in
      its ‘evergreen mode,’ and when it is deployed for the display
      of specialized content. Some provision has been made for considerable public
      input. For example, the Liberty Science Center will collaborate with different
      Universities that have curriculum in new media authoring. Select classes
      of students will be invited to create specialized content for <em>T2ST</em>.
      The opportunity to author for this interactive, environmentally-scaled
      installation will serve several educational objectives. </p>
    <ol>
      <li> It will allow students to explore different how different modalities
        of presentation within the atrium map onto different kinds of information.
        For example: students will be asked to think about the relationship between
        the information presented on a vertical zipper sign and the information
        presented on a video feed that is displayed on various surfaces of the
        mobile shapes. Understanding the relationship between information and
        the form of display is often difficult for students when they design
        for desktop displays: these display environments have been thoroughly
        naturalized, with the result that students fail to see the connection
        between form and content and the way in which this connection too must
        be designed in a meaningful way. </li>
      <li>Kiosks where visitors are presented with opportunities to influence
        the <em>T2ST</em> presentation in the atrium will permit a second mode
        of interaction between members of the public and the <em>T2ST</em> installation.
        These inputs will offer visitors the opportunity to contribute suggestions
        for future T2ST topics, or will present an opinion or interest poll about
        current debates in science and technology where the results of the poll
        are displayed on one of the surfaces. This type of input is part of the
        museum&#39;s <em>Science Now Science Everywhere (SNSE)</em> system that enables
        visitors to link to exhibits using their personal cell phones. In addition,
        the <em>SNSE</em> system enables visitors to take away custom RSS feeds
        and news reports on their cell phones and PDAs. This extends visitors’ engagement
        with the installation and sets the stage for the development of more
        elaborate participation in ‘citizen science projects.’ </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Challenges</h1>
    <p>With respect to the planning and design of the <em>T2ST</em>, Liberty
      Science Center had to make several key decisions in preparation for opening
      its operation - both in terms of the physical structure and in terms of
      enabling connections to visitors’ cell phones. These decisions focused
      on content management and issues involved in ensuring equal access to information
      via cell phone. The science center acknowledges that the determinations
      described here will, in fact, be tested when the <em>T2ST</em> becomes
      operational. Certainly, some adjustment will be required as real world
      situations take shape.</p>
    <h2>Embodying Policies</h2>
    <p>The initial content for <em>T2ST</em> is drawn from seed sites found by
      Onomy Labs from a set of topics provided by the museum. Those sites were
      approved by the museum, both to make certain that the content was a good
      match and to determine that the site was trustworthy. Initially no automated
      filtering of incoming content is in place, though provision has been made
      to use the filters being applied to Internet-connected kiosks on the museum
      floor. Approval for all feeds rests with museum staff, and this will continue
      to be the case as the more challenging issue of approving visitor-submitted
      feeds becomes part of the game.</p>
    <p>The <em>T2ST </em>piece is critical to another science center initiative.
      Liberty Science Center has launched a project called <em>The Exhibit Commons</em>,
      which aims to allow visitors to submit content and even programs to the
      science center’s exhibits. In our case, this will take the form of
      allowing <em>T2ST</em> to accept links to content supplied by the public,
      and also allowing  the public to program the piece for critiques on
      science and society in the news. These submissions, via cell phone, kiosk
      entries and Web visitors, are first checked against a database of previously
      proffered sites, and then passed on in a daily digest to museum staff.</p>
    <h2>Rights Management</h2>
    <p>From the very beginning, the science center saw this art piece as a commentary
      on the pervasiveness of news and data - one focused on the areas of science
      and technology. Creating this social commentary within an art piece falls
      within the Fair Use application of content. To aid this effort, the science
      center created a document outlining the purpose and intent of the piece.
      As a result, the first step taken has been to obtain rights from creators
      or to use content that is issued under the Creative Commons system. The
      science center and the programmers have worked to select sources and presentation
      styles that  follow Fair Use rights and guidelines. This includes
      such considerations as limiting the amount of information presented, controlling
      the amount of ‘air time’ any individual piece will be assigned,
      and providing adequate attribution to the material’s source. As the
      piece evolves through additional visitor contributions via the Exhibit
      Commons, the issues of rights and fair use management will require the
      science center to maintain a watchful eye.</p>
    <p>Several approaches were taken to support this watchful eye. First, a set
      of opportunities for viewers to check the provenance of displayed items
      was provided. These include inclusion of source logos on all image and
      video displays: a presentation of recent items at the research station
      is available where users can peruse the items in their syndicated form
      as supplied, and subscribers to the T2ST aggregations can bring up items
      on their phones or computers in a similar way, and see the source materials
      in their initial context (i.e., T2ST actually drives additional eyes to
      the source sites). Second, at the time of accepting a new feed or other
      site to the scavenger, staff are required to point the database at a URL
      of the feed or Web site&#39;s published usage document as well as staff&#39;s interpretation
      of Liberty Science Center&#39;s rights. Third, T2ST will track the use of each
      segment of collected content, so an audit trail could be provided to any
      concerned source. </p>
    <h2>Content Management</h2>
    <p>Currently, the content management area that has required the most consideration
      and foresight for the science center is operations. The greatest concern
      has been the large amount of information that will pass through the <em>T2ST</em> installation.
      A first issue that needed to be addressed was how to ensure that science
      center staff would not be required to constantly manage content sources.
      Therefore, as part of this project, a content management scheduling system
      was created. This will be used for determining sources of daily content
      scheduling, hopefully minimizing the danger of presenting content that
      does not meet the aim of the experience. With this system in place, Liberty
      Science Center will experiment with the amount of staff eyeball review
      that will be required for the piece. This will also allow the science center
      to refine its collection of trusted sources and its  process for approving
      visitor submissions.</p>
    <p>Presentation in the atrium is the bedrock of this whole project. The default
      repeating query for all displays is “show the latest 10 items for
      my theme weighted by the current suggested categories.” To modify
      this (for instance, to show cross-themed items about space simultaneously),
      museum staff are presented with a Tivo-like interface which allows them
      to specify queries which get played out for a given period of time for
      given displays. </p>
    <p>Accepted RSS feeds are cached in a relational database to allow for a
      variety of queries to be made on the aggregate content. All feeds are tagged
      with both a theme (the themes of the museum as of deployment time are environment,
      health and invention) and a category such as “space,” “global,” or “virus.” Fed
      items are time-stamped so that queries of the form “items about space
      in theme invention received in the last 12 hours” can be made. In
      addition, full text search is available both to the display devices and
      also to museum staff to determine whether new categories should be added.</p>
    <p>A major challenge in running T2ST largely unattended is the loose standardization
      available to RSS syndicators. Heuristics are built into the system to deal
      with most of the variations, and a facility for adding new rules to the
      heuristics is available to refine the system&#39;s capabilities. A related
      issue is finding imagery related to feeds of sufficient resolution to be
      displayed on the floating shapes. This required developing a number of
      heuristic-driven methods of exploring articles looking for appropriate
      imagery. For both of these subsystems, e-mail is used to alert museum staff
      of anomalous results.</p>
    <p>Video content presented several challenges. The first is that the design
      of the system is really built around a notion of ‘silent radio,’ so
      video content either needs to stand alone on its visual qualities or needs
      to come with closed captioning that can be either  displayed directly
      on the video screens or allowed to play out on physically proximal LED
      sign. The second is that moving-image content is not yet widely distributed
      via RSS, so for initial deployment, video aggregation and selection remain
      fairly manual. We believe that videos coming via RSS will become more common
      as time progresses.</p>
    <p>In addition to the screens installed in the atrium at the museum, we are
      allowing visitors to subscribe to various themes/categories as a way of
      continuing to receive <em>T2ST</em>-aggregated content via their cell phones.
      Given the current tariff situation with cell phone service providers (per-
      message charges are typical), users are given various throttling options
      for these feeds. Over time we expect to gather statistics and other insights
      which will allow us to try things like ‘most exciting item of the
      day.’</p>
    <h2>Cell Phone Usage</h2>
    <p><em>T2ST</em> is an essential part of the <em>Science Now, Science Everywhere</em> (SNSE)
      project underway at Liberty Science Center. This experience will provide
      opportunities for visitors to interact with and receive content both inside
      and outside of the science center’s physical structure by using their
      cell phones. The science center took on this project as a way of extending
      the museum’s visitor experience by creatively leveraging the increasing
      use of cell phones among the general public.  </p>
    <p>Cell phone users have three types of interactions with <em>T2ST.</em> Visitors
      can add keywords to influence topic selection for presentation on the displays.
      Visitors can also answer various polls, particularly the <em>Question of
      the Day</em> posed by museum staff. Finally, visitors can opt to receive
      aggregated feeds from the museum for a period of time after they depart
      the facility.</p>
    <p>An essential aspect of presenting content through devices such as cell
      phones is the public’s accessibility to content. How can the museum
      ensure equal access to the content of an interactive when all visitors
      may not have a cell phone? As part of the preparation for the project,
      the science center looked at the current state of cell phone use, and,
      more importantly,  cell phone availability to and usage by the members
      of the public who attend the science center. Through this research the
      staff learned that: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>84% of our audience aged 13 -17 owned a cell phone, and 100% those
        aged 18 to 24.</li>
      <li>20% of cell phone users have access to SMS, and 16% use it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Although cell phone penetration was quite high, the SMS familiarity and
      comfort was considerably less. Based on these results, the museum staff
      desired an approach to broaden access to the content and interactives accessible
      through cell phones. To address this, the <em>T2ST</em> installation includes
      three physical kiosks that allow visitor to participate as though they
      had a cell phone. Moreover, elements of these interactives will also be
      found on the Web, allowing users even further away from the science center
      to interact with <em>T2ST</em>.</p>
    <p>In addition, Liberty Science Center is partnering with Verizon Wireless
      to provide loaner phones for those who wish to use a cell phone during
      their visit. These will be ‘locked’ phones that only allow
      interaction with the SNSE application at the science center.</p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>The <em>T2ST</em> interactive is part of the Liberty Science Center’s
      overall plan to develop innovative modes of interactivity using common
      communication devices. The approached developed by Onomy Labs provides
      evergreen exhibit content in a way that doesn’t rely on the participation
      of a specific staff member or exhibit management team. The objective was
      to leverage the vast amount of interesting science and technology information
      that is already available on the Web, but in a way that doesn’t require
      a great deal of editorial supervision on the part of the museum staff.  This
      provides an innovative use of the Web that doesn’t rely on home-
      or school-based Web-providers and doesn’t relegate the rich Web resources
      to the Museum’s Web portal.</p>
