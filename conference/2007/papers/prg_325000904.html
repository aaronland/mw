    <p class="abstractText">While
        the emergence of Web 2.0 offers many exciting opportunities for museums
        to engage with new and diverse audiences, the reality is that many small
        and medium museums struggle to maintain even an elementary level of presence
        on the Web. They face multiple barriers: an absence of suitably skilled
        staff, limited financial and technical resources, and sometimes even
        a lack of access to reliable broadband Internet services. How can smaller
        museums and cultural heritage organisations be empowered to develop high
        quality content and to participate in the on-line environment in ways
        which are meaningful to them and their target audiences? This paper shows
        how the needs of smaller museums to reach new audiences can be met through
        a collaborative, democratic model conceived around the notion of a Web
        portal. Collections Australia Network (CAN) – a redevelopment of
        Australian Museums and Galleries On-line (AMOL) – uses open source
        software solutions to provide a range of on-line tools that facilitate
        the creation of high quality, customizable, easily updated content by
        smaller museums for publication through the CAN Web portal. This paper
        demonstrates how the opportunities presented by Web 2.0 have been utilised
        by CAN to provide the means and context for smaller museums to make their
        content as discoverable to audiences as that from larger, better resourced
        museums.</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Museums
        and organisations with heritage collections use the Web for a variety
        of purposes – to publicise and promote their activities and exhibitions,
        make their collection records publicly available, and increasingly, to
        create unique discovery and learning experiences on-line. The Web allows
        museums to reach beyond their traditional audiences, promoting an unprecedented
        level of access to their objects and their collections. CAN’s main
        role is to develop and provide accessible and easy-to-use tools and resources
        to assist small and medium museums and collecting institutions to gain
        access to the on-line environment. This paper will discuss the unique
        Australian context in which CAN and CAN Partners operate, and will demonstrate
        the ways in which CAN is adopting Web 2.0 technologies and approaches.
        CAN’s on-line tools are easy to use; information can be simply
        modified and updated by our Partner organisations. Through strategic
        partnerships with larger institutions, CAN is increasing the discoverability
        of content from smaller museums across Australia, fulfilling the Web’s
        early promise as a democratic and collaborative space. <strong></strong></p>
    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>CAN
        is funded by the Cultural Ministers Council (CMC), administered through
        the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts
        (DCITA), and was originally a redevelopment of the highly successful
        and long-running AMOL project. CAN is currently hosted by the Powerhouse
        Museum in Sydney. In 2002, the Australian Commonwealth Government released
        the comprehensive and wide-ranging study of the Australian cultural heritage
        sector titled “A Study into the Key Needs of Collecting Institutions
        in the Heritage Sector” (Deakin, 2002). It identified a strong
        future need for the support of the work of institutions which are undertaking
        computerised cataloguing and those which are either trying to establish
        or maintain a Web site.</p>
    <p>In 2003
        it was determined that AMOL should be redeveloped to better meet these
        needs. As a result, CAN borrows heavily from AMOL in much of its basic
        structure, types of content, and understanding of Australian museums
        and galleries. AMOL was conceived of and to a large extent operated on
        the model of a Web portal. CAN also takes this basic structural approach,
        providing a profile page for all CAN Partners (organisations with not
        for profit, publicly accessible collections).  Where the two projects
        are markedly different is in the way content is created and managed.
        Content for AMOL was solicited from Partners and collected using a variety
        of methods, mainly printed paper forms and database files in common formats.
        AMOL staff was then responsible for creating the Web site content from
        this information. This method was both time consuming and difficult to
        administer. The CAN approach differs because it gives the role of content
        creation back to the CAN Partners. </p>
    <p>After
        an extensive redevelopment phase, CAN first went on-line in May 2005,
        during the Museums Australia National Conference. CAN Partners are able
        to use CAN to publish on-line and promote their news, events and exhibitions,
        resources, and publications and collections records using an on-line
        content management system. This initial version of CAN was developed
        using proprietary software solutions for both the content management
        system and the on-line searchable collections database. Late in 2005,
        it became apparent that CAN would benefit from developing in-house, custom
        software solutions, and it is this later, custom developed version of
        CAN that is the focus of this paper.</p>
    <h1>The Australian Context</h1>
    <p>The
        Australian cultural heritage sector, of which museums form the major
        part, is extremely diverse. Institutions range from large, well funded
        and staffed national and state museums to municipal (local government)
        museums and heritage centres with small staff numbers located in metropolitan
        and regional centres, to small, largely volunteer run local history and
        special interest museums which are most often located in regional and
        remote communities. Although diverse in their situations, there is a
        commonality of needs dictated by the high number of volunteers, particularly
        working in museums. The Key Needs Study identified 2049 museum establishments
        in June 2000: 80.1% of the people working in these museums were there
        in a volunteer capacity; 58% of museums operated on an entirely volunteer
        basis, with no paid staff whatsoever. </p>
    <p>People
        working in museums identified their future needs based on their current
        activities: 75% were engaged in cataloguing – computerised, 72%
        in e-mail correspondence, 55% in Web site establishment, 44% in Web site
        maintenance and 49% conducting research via the Web. At the end of 2001,
        50% of the museums had a Web site, homepage or Web presence. A more recent
        figure, based on a recent informal CAN survey of our Partners, leads
        us to estimate that at the end of 2006, approximately 75% of CAN Partners
        had a Web site or Web presence other than CAN. That still leaves approximately
        25% of the more than 1500 CAN Partners reliant on CAN as their main Web
        presence - a sizeable proportion.</p>
    <p>Given
        these research findings and the combined experience of working with small
        museums of both AMOL and CAN, any Web site for which Partners were expected
        to create content directly had to be quick and simple to use. Volunteers
        in particular would not typically engage in any activity they considered
        time consuming or difficult when there were so many other tasks about
        the museum to which they could divert their efforts. To be successful,
        CAN must provide tools that do not require any specialist information
        technology background or computer training, and must show immediate results
        for effort and time taken. “Web 2.0 tools offer the promise of
        building such on-line communities within the scale of our institutions” (von
        Appen and Kennedy, 2006).</p>
    <h1>The CAN Open Source Solution </h1>
    <p>In early
        2006, CAN began to investigate options for using open source software.
        Plans were drawn up for a new database structure, custom content management
        system and on-line collections database. There were several key considerations
        driving the development process: any databases developed for CAN must
        be flexible and the field structure easy to modify in the future; the
        site must be able to function and be maintained with minimum hands-on
        work by CAN staff; and the content management system should make creating
        and modifying content as simple as possible. </p>
    <p>Looking
        at several technical solutions, it was decided by the CAN Web developers
        that PostgreSQL would be the database software most suited to the needs
        of the project, particularly in terms of operating quick searches through
        the CAN collections database, which has the potential to expand to several
        millions of records over the next 2-3 years.</p>

    <p>Other
        open source software used by CAN includes the Apache Web server, Linux
        operating System and PHP.</p>
    <p>Typically,
        CAN Partners are completely oblivious to the hardware and software which
        is running the site. Their main concern is for the tools and services
        they use to create and modify content. </p>
    <h1>Unlocking Potential</h1>
    <p>CAN’s
        custom content management system is the key to CAN’s ability to
        assist small and medium museums in publishing their content on-line.
        Each Partner has a profile page on CAN, with details of that institution/organisation,
        and its collections. </p>
    <p>Partners
        are issued with a username and password which allow them access to their
        own CAN Admin Area. In the admin area they can modify their own profiles
        and create or modify news, events, exhibitions and sector info items
        for publication on CAN. There is also a set of tools to enable CAN Partners
        to undertake collection management on-line and to make their collection
        records available on-line through the CAN collections database. There
        are image upload, document upload and Web link tools, with the ability
        to add these features to any items that are created. The role of CAN
        staff is minimal – we provide assistance where necessary, and approve
        for publication to the CAN Web site all suitable items. An example of
        the content management system can be viewed at <a href="../http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/apply/" target="_blank">http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/apply/</a></p>
    <p>Partners
        are able to save their work as a draft at any stage before submitting
        an item to CAN, archive items once they are no longer relevant, and make
        changes to any part of their items at any time. Another key feature of
        the content management system is the placement of the <strong>help </strong>information
        in the same on-screen window as the forms that Partners use to create
        and modify content. Although seemingly simple, this feature greatly increased
        the confidence of several Partners when using the site, according to
        recent feedback..</p>
    <p>The
        best indicator of how well CAN’s development work on the content
        development system has been received is in the number of new items of
        CAN content which have been created. In July, August and September 2006,
        the first three-month period in which the custom content management system
        was in use, there were 3 news and 35 event and exhibition items contributed
        by CAN Partners. In the following three months of October, November and
        December 2006, 15 news items and 83 event and exhibition items were created.
        This pleasing trend already looks established and set to continue in
        2007.</p>
    <h1>Extending The Scope Of
        On-Line Discoverability</h1>
    <p>One
        of the key drivers for smaller museums to use CAN is the increased level
        of Web exposure that regular contributions of content to CAN provide.
        The project ensures a regular turnover of items contributed by Partners
        on the CAN front page by implementing a series of rules for front page
        positions which do not discriminate on the basis of which CAN Partner
        contributed the content, or what the content is publicising and promoting.
        The exhibition and event items, which are front, top and centre on the
        CAN Web site under the grouping of “what’s on”, are
        selected for the front page on the dates on which they are actually occurring,
        and also for three days beginning from a fortnight before they are due
        to begin. When they have reached their end date, they are automatically
        removed from the publicly accessible area of the site, but remain in
        the Partner’s Admin Area so that the items can be reviewed, modified
        and reposted if required. A contribution from our smallest Partner promoting
        an event will be given the same weighting on the front page of the CAN
        Web site and sit side by side an item which is contributed by one the
        national or state museums, and this happens on a regular basis. News
        items are posted on a first come, first served basis, with the most recent
        news item taking the prime position, (<a href="../http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/" target="_blank">http://www.collectionsaustralia.net</a>).</p>
    <p>CAN
        also provides the CAN Collections Database. This is a searchable database
        of over 500,000 collection item and collection level descriptions which
        have been contributed by over 70 CAN Partner organisations of all sizes
        from across the entire country. This development work is still relatively
        new, and it is anticipated that CAN will have over a million records
        on-line by the end of 2007. This resource is particularly important to
        small museums, many of which may have substantial portions of their collections
        digitised, but have no Internet or IT capacity to host their collection
        records on-line.</p>
    <p>Larger
        museums, however, have sophisticated marketing and promotions strategies
        in place, in which updating and creating CAN content play a much smaller
        role. They also often have the ability to host their own collections
        on-line; for example, the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney (http://www.powerhousemuseum.com).
        For these larger Partners, CAN must provide more than just a tool for
        on-line discovery. It is also of greater benefit to the smaller museums
        if the larger museums use CAN consistently as it will increase content,
        and more important, site traffic. For this reason, CAN has become one
        of the leading partners in a Federated Search Project across Australian
        cultural heritage collections.</p>
    <h1>The Federated Search Project</h1>
    <p>In 2004
        the Heads<strong> </strong>of
        Collecting Institutions (HOCI) in Australia decided to embark upon a
        national federated discovery project, which was to be managed and led
        by the National Library in Australia (http://www.nla.gov.au/initiatives/federatedsearch.html).
        CAN become involved in this project, now known as the Federated Search
        Project, in 2005. </p>
    <p>Participating
        organisations have agreed to use the Amazon OpenSearch protocol. This
        allows the aggregation of search results from different sources using
        a simple keyword search. OpenSearch, developed by A9.com, is available
        under a creative commons license (<a href="../http://opensearch.a9.com/" target="_blank">http://opensearch.A9.com</a>).
        Based on the popular RSS and ATOM syndication formats, it was chosen
        for the Federated Search Project because it poses the least security
        risk, is relatively easily implemented, and is cost effective. The first
        three Australian cultural heritage collections available through the
        Federated Search Project are the National Library managed Picture Australia
        (<a href="../http://www.pictureaustralia.org/" target="_blank">http://www.pictureaustralia.org</a>), Libraries Australia (<a href="../http://www.librariesaustralia.nla.gov.au/" target="_blank">http://www.librariesaustralia.nla.gov.au</a>),
        and the CAN collections database. The Powerhouse Museum also has its
        records enabled for OpenSearch. In practical terms, this means that a
        visitor using the CAN search page is able to search the CAN collections
        database, Picture Australia, Libraries Australia, and the Powerhouse
        Museum collections from a single search page <a href="../http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/collections" target="_blank">http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/collections</a>.</p>
    <p>Not
        only is the Federated Search Project a strong incentive for larger museums
        to engage with CAN, but it also provides smaller museums with similar
        contexts and opportunities for discoverability as their larger counterparts.</p>
    <h1><span class="Heading1Char">Case
          Study: St George Regional Museum, Hurtsville, Australia</span> </h1>
    <p>St George
        Regional Museum is a small to medium museum which has been actively using
        CAN since the site was updated with the custom content management system
        in July 2006. It is located in Hurstville, in the Southern suburbs of
        Sydney, and is the local Municipal museum for that area. It is council
        funded, but also relies heavily on income from a variety of grants and
        funding schemes. There are 2 full-time paid staff, 5 part-time/casual
        staff, and between 10 and 15 volunteers and interns working with the
        museum at any one time. The focus of the collection is local history,
        particularly social history. This museum has a Web presence as part of
        the local council Web site (<a href="../http://www.hurstville.nsw.gov.au/museum" target="_blank">http://www.hurstville.nsw.gov.au/museum</a>)
        through which their events and exhibitions are regularly updated and
        published as part of the Council Web site’s “what’s
        on”. They also use an Australian collections management system
        designed for small museums. None of the people currently working in the
        museum have a computer or IT background, and they do not consider themselves
        advanced or even intermediate computer users (Pugh, 2007). They represent
        a typical CAN Partner.</p>
    <p>St George
        Regional Museum came into contact with CAN, as most Partners do, through
        one of CAN’s regular promotional activities. In this case it was
        the Museums Australia National Conference in May 2005, where a staff
        member from the museum attended a briefing and training session about
        CAN. At this stage CAN had been on-line only for a matter of days, and
        was still experiencing some teething problems. However the main message
        about CAN, its tools and capabilities was successfully imparted, and
        the staff member who attended was given a username and password, used
        at the training session to update the profile details on CAN (<a href="../http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/org/151/about" target="_blank">http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/org/151/about</a>)
        and create an exhibition item.  In July 2006, Ms Allison Pugh, a
        student intern and volunteer at the museum, made contact with CAN, primarily
        to enquire about the possibility of making the museum’s collection
        records accessible through the CAN collections database. At this time,
        the database was still in development; however, Ms Pugh was advised of
        the museum’s previous CAN experience, and invited to contribute
        and create other kinds of content.</p>
    <p>Ms Pugh
        reports that she spent some time that day familiarising herself with
        the site, and sought permission from the museum manager to update the
        museum’s profile details and add some content. Within a week, with
        no instructions beyond the basic ones included in the standard CAN introductory
        e-mail to new users of the Admin Area, Ms Pugh had created three items
        for CAN. Two of these were exhibition items, and one was promoting an
        event. Each contained an image and included Web links for more information.</p>
    <p>Since
        then, Ms Pugh has created another item, but more important, has demonstrated
        the use of CAN to her colleagues, and they have subsequently included
        creation of CAN items as part of the regular promotional activities for
        exhibitions to be undertaken by the staff at the museum.</p>
    <p>Ms Pugh
        rates herself as a basic to intermediate Web user: “I surf the
        Web , but I wasn’t using it on a regular basis and I had never
        created content for a Web page before. Mostly it was e-mail and newspapers
        and stuff like that”. She estimates that it takes her approximately
        15-20 minutes to create an item for CAN, and that over the six months
        that she has been using CAN, she has spent a total of 10 hours investigating
        and working on the site. In her opinion, the content management system
        is simple to use; she likened it to other on-line activities she engages
        in such as Internet banking and using a Web-based e-mail account.</p>
    <p>When
        asked what the main benefits of using CAN were to her museum, Ms Pugh
        replied that it was an essential part of the museum’s drive to
        reach and attract a broader audience, adding that “it’s a
        great resource for smaller museums because it links them when sometimes
        they feel on their own”. In early 2007, approximately 3000 object
        records from the collection of the St George Regional Museum (200 of
        these with digital images included) will be available for public access
        through the CAN collections database. The museum does not have the financial
        nor technical capacity to host these records on its own Web site.</p>
    <h1>Into the Future</h1>
    <p>Collections
        Australia Network has taken the notion of the Web portal and adapted
        it to suit the needs of the Australian cultural heritage sector. With
        the development of the custom content management system, the CAN collections
        database, and initiatives such as the Federated Search Project, CAN is
        bringing to smaller museums similar kinds of access and exposure that
        Web 2.0 provides for their much larger counterparts. </p>
    <p>Building
        on the current success of CAN will involve development of new tools and
        resources which extend not only the promotional capacity of the Partners
        using the site, but also their ability to create richer, more detailed
        on-line content based around their collections. Currently under consideration
        for development for CAN over the next 18 months are interactive calendars
        for events and exhibitions; a specialised area to post and search for
        touring exhibitions; story templates to allow more narrative-based interactive
        content creation; and partnerships with organisations in the education
        sector to develop on-line training materials for museums to create appropriate,
        curriculum-based learning content.</p>
