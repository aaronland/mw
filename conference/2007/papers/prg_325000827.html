    		    <p class="abstractText">eBird is an ongoing project that aims to document
		    bird distribution and abundance in North America. The project allows participants
		    to report any bird they see using one of several data-collecting protocols.
		    Participants and other visitors to the site also view and manipulate data
		    submitted to the eBird database to answer their own questions about bird
		    distribution and abundance. Responses to these visitor queries can be viewed
		    in the form of graphs and histograms as well as on maps. We were interested
		    in learning about how eBird participants use these data tools, and how
		    participating in the project might affect their thinking about the concept
		    of conservation. The eBird New User Survey employed standard survey questions
		    combined with exploration of live data and an on-line version of the Personal

		  <h1>Introduction</h1>
		  <p><strong>Citizen science</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> is
		      a term coined by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology (CLO) in the mid-1990s
		      to describe projects that involve participants directly in the process
		      of research. Citizen science projects have at least two goals: first,
		      to gather data for studying scientific questions at continental or even
		      global scales, and second, to increase scientific and/or conservation
		      literacy among project participants. By 2007, CLO was operating numerous
		      citizen science projects that together have engaged hundreds of thousands
		      of individuals in observing birds, collecting and submitting bird data,
		      and even analyzing and interpreting those data themselves (<span style="color:black; "><a href="../http://www.birds.cornell.edu/LabPrograms/CitSci/" target="_blank"><span style="font-family:&#39;Gill Sans&#39;; ">http://www.birds.cornell.edu/LabPrograms/CitSci/</span></a></span></span><span style="font-family:&#39;Lucida Grande&#39;; font-size:13.0pt; color:black; ">)</span>.</p>
		  <p>In the past few years citizen science has started
		    to gain acceptance as an authoritative method for addressing large-scale
		    scientific issues. For example, data collected by CLO project participants
		    and published in peer-reviewed scientific journals have shown how bird
		    populations change in time and space (Hochachka et al. 1999); how bird
		    breeding success is affected by environmental change (Hames et al. 2002a);
		    how acid rain affects bird populations (Hames et al. 2002b), how infectious
		    diseases spread through wild animal populations (Dhondt et al. 2005); and
		    how bird life history varies with latitude (Cooper et al. 2006). </p>
		  <p>Citizen science also appears effective at increasing
		    scientific literacy. Evaluations of CLO-based projects have shown
		    that participants not only learn scientific facts (Brossard et al. 2005),
		    but also discover that scientific investigation is neither a precise nor
		    a linear process – rather, a complex procedure that involves careful
		    observations, adherence to data-gathering protocols, cautious conclusions,
		    and an abiding need for further investigation (Trumbull et al. 2000, Bonney
		    2004, Krasny and Bonney 2005, Phillips et al. 2006). </p>
		  <p>This paper addresses the educational impacts of eBird,
		    a citizen science project developed by CLO and the National Audubon Society
		    and operated completely on-line. Like other citizen science projects, eBird
		    has dual goals. Its scientific goal is to increase understanding of the
		    dynamics of year-round bird populations across North America and beyond.
		    Its educational goal is to help participants understand the scientific
		    process, first as they collect data that scientists can use to document
		    bird distributions and population changes over time, and second as they
		    investigate the information that project participants, including themselves,
		    have collected and submitted to the on-line eBird database.</p>
		  <p>eBird is one of the first Lab projects to be operated
		    solely on-line. Therefore, project evaluation has required development
		    of new tools and techniques to assess impacts of on-line participation
		    on a largely unseen audience. In addition to standard survey questions
		    and tracking data from the Web site, we wanted to develop methods for collecting
		    data on understanding of key concepts. This desire resulted in a survey
		    that combined standard questions with a data visualization task and an
		    on-line version of a Personal Meaning Mapping interview. This paper summarizes
		    our evaluation findings and discusses the effectiveness of the methods.<strong></strong></p>
		  <h1>eBird Overview </h1>
		  <p><span style="color:black; ">eBird (ebird.org) was
		      launched in 2002 to provide a means for any birdwatcher to submit any
		      bird sighting from anywhere in North America. Participants can report
		      birds as often as they like from as many locations as they like. Some
		      participants report birds only occasionally. Ot</span>hers submit complete
		      checklists of all the species they see each day, often from several locations<span style="color:black; "> – home,
		      office, vacation spot, favorite birding location. </span><strong></strong></p>
		  <p><span style="color:black; ">Individuals who wish to
		      report sightings for the first time must register by providing name and
		      email address. Once registered, users can log in to report as many bird
		      sightings as they like. Registration and log-in are not required to explore
		      the on-line database, however, and many people view data without submitting
		      data or even registering. </span></p>
		  <p><span style="color:black; ">To report sightings, users
		      choose a reporting location from drop-down menus of birding ‘hotspots,’ such
		      as nature reserves, which have been entered into the database by project
		      staff and other eBirders. Observers also can use eBird’s on-line
		      mapping software to select any number of new reporting locations. For
		      instance, many users pinpoint their home. That location is then stored
		      in the database so that participants can report the birds they see there
		      any time they choose. Users also can enter locations using latitude and
		      longitude. </span></p>
		  <p><span style="color:black; ">To <strong>enter</strong></span><span style="color:black; "> data
		      from a location, users first indicate the <strong>type</strong></span><span style="color:black; "> of
		      observation or observations they have made: casual observation, stationary
		      count, traveling count, or area search. Then, after entering the date
		      and time of observation and indicating whether they are reporting all
		      of the birds they have seen or just a subset, the Web site presents them
		      with a bird checklist for their state or region. Users then fill in the
		      number of individuals of each species seen or an “x” indicating
		      simply that a species was present. Next the user hits <strong>submit</strong></span><span style="color:black; ">. </span></p>
		  <p><span style="color:black; ">At this point, the data
		      are vetted by an automatic filter, developed by regional bird experts,
		      which reviews the submission for suspect information – for example,
		      species that are unlikely to be seen in that region at the time they
		      are being reported, or individual counts that are higher than expected.
		      The vetted data are then summarized on a <strong>Confirmation and Notes</strong></span><span style="color:black; "> page
		      that indicates any information that might be suspect. Users can either
		      change data entered mistakenly, or choose to submit data they are certain
		      are accurate. After making this decision the user hits <strong>submit</strong></span><span style="color:black; "> one
		      more time and receives a Thank You page.</span> </p>
		  <p>Any data that have been flagged by the filters are
		    automatically sent to the regional experts for review. Often these experts
		    contact eBird participants for more sighting details. Only after the regional
		    expert decides that a sighting is accurate can it be viewed by the public
		    in the on-line database.</p>
		  <p>To explore the database, users first choose whether
		    they wish to examine data for a certain species (for example, Yellow Warbler,
		    Black-billed Magpie) or from a certain location (for example, county, state,
		    or bird conservation region, or their personal locations). Then the user
		    can create maps, histograms, and various types of graphs that combine all
		    of the eBird data available for each species or location at any chosen
		    time. Users also <span style="color:black; ">can use the eBird site to
		    keep track of their <strong>life list</strong></span><span style="color:black; ">,
		    or all of the birds that they have seen, sorted by location. </span></p>
		  <p><span style="color:black; ">After five years of operation,
		      the project has become a significant source of scientific information
		      about North American bird populations. In 2006, participants submitted
		      more than 323,500 checklists of more than 4.3 million observations (i.e.,
		      a bird at a location on a date). </span>These data provide an extremely
		      accurate representation of the distribution and abundance of bird populations
		      at both the backyard and continental levels.<span style="color:black; "> </span></p>
		  <p>These data are available not only through eBird but
		    also via other applications developed by the global biodiversity information
		    community. For example, eBird data are part of the Avian Knowledge Network
		    (AKN) which integrates observational data on bird populations across the
		    western hemisphere. In turn, the AKN feeds eBird data to international
		    biodiversity data systems, such as the Global Biodiversity Information
		    Facility (GBIF). In this way any contribution made to eBird increases scientific
		    understanding of the distribution, richness, and uniqueness of our planet’s
		    biodiversity.</p>
		  <p><span style="color:black; ">In addition to its scientific
		      objectives, eBird has several educational objectives. Specifically, the
		      project is designed with the hope that participants will:</span></p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Increase their interest in birds and birdwatching</li>
		    <li>Learn techniques for counting birds</li>
		    <li>Learn methods for gathering scientifically useful
		      data (point counts, transects, area searches)</li>
		    <li>Understand the scientific value of complete checklists
		      versus casual counts</li>
		    <li>Explore eBird data to learn more about birds in
		      their own communities and to compare local bird populations to
		      those in other areas</li>
		    <li>Understand that bird populations change over time
		      and space</li>
		    <li>Understand the value of eBird data for informing
		      bird conservation efforts</li>
	      </ul>
		  <p>These are lofty objectives for a project in which
		    participants are entirely self instructed and self directed. The primary
		    way for eBird to help users meet these objectives is through on-line tutorials
		    and FAQs that help <span style="color:black; ">users understand the site,
		    report their sightings accurately, and view and explore data using methods
		    appropriate for the questions being asked.</span></p>
		  <h1>New User Survey</h1>
		  <p>In 2005, project staff collaborated with Seavoss Associates,
		    Inc. and eduweb to conduct an in-depth survey of new eBird participants.
		    The survey was administered when a new participant joined eBird and again
		    8 weeks later. This pre-post design allowed evaluators to examine changes
		    in attitudes toward, behavior about, and knowledge of birds and scientific
		    research that might have occurred in tandem with project participation. </p>
		  <p>The eBird New User Survey was timed to coincide with
		    the launch of eBird 2.0 in summer 2005. eBird 2.0 is a product of a 3-year
		    development and pilot-testing process that included extensive user testing
		    and formative evaluation. Feedback from user e-mails, interviews, and on-line
		    surveys informed changes that aimed to make eBird 2.0 more accessible and
		    user-friendly than its predecessor.</p>
		  <p>The New User Survey focused on three of the previously
		    stated educational objectives for participants:</p>
		  <ol>
		    <li>Increased interest in birds and birdwatching</li>
		    <li><span class="listwithnumbers" style="color:black; ">Exploration of eBird
		      data to learn more about birds in their own communities and to compare
		      local bird populations to those in other areas</span></li>
		    <li><span class="listwithnumbers" style="color:black; ">Understanding of the
		      value of eBird data for informing bird conservation efforts</span></li>
	      </ol>
		  <p>The survey was divided into three sections. Section
		    one included standard questions about participant characteristics, including
		    demographics, bird-watching expertise, and reasons for participation. Section
		    two explored participant use and understanding of eBird’s View and
		    Explore Data tools. Finally, the survey employed an on-line adaptation
		    of the Personal Meaning Mapping (PMM) technique developed at the Institute
		    for Learning Innovation (Falk et al., 1998). The PMM allowed project evaluators
		    to learn a great deal more about how project participants viewed the concept
		    of conservation, one of the project’s main goals, than could be determined
		    by standard survey questions. </p>
		  <p>Survey respondents, all of whom volunteered to participate,
		    were recruited in two ways. First, a direct link to the survey was placed
		    on eBird’s final registration page. Second, e-mail invitations were
		    sent directly to eBird participants who had created their <em>first</em> location
		    or submitted their <em>first</em> checklist
		    in the two weeks prior to the survey launch. This approach allowed us to
		    capture responses from individuals who had recently registered as well
		    as those who had registered previously but only recently submitted data.
		    A total of 745 e-mail invitations were sent, excluding those returned owing
		    to faulty e-mail addresses. </p>
		  <p>Each respondent was asked to complete two versions
		    of the survey.<strong> </strong><span style="font-weight:normal; ">The
		    first completion (Time 1) was done at the time of eBird registration or
		    first data submission and was intended to document individuals’ current
		    birding habits as well as baseline information on participant ability to
		    understand eBirds’s </span><strong>View</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> and </span><strong>Explore
		    Data</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> tools. The second completion
		    (Time 2), administered approximately 8 weeks later, was similar but not
		    identical to the first survey, and captured changes in participants’ birding
		    behaviors and understanding of eBird’s </span><strong>View</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> and </span><strong>Explore
		    Data</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> tools. </span></p>
		  <p>Substantially complete Time 1 surveys were submitted
		    by 174 participants<strong> </strong><span style="font-weight:normal; ">(a
		    23% response rate), while 82 participants completed both the Time 1 and
		    Time 2 surveys (a 47% response rate to the Time 2 invitation, and an 11%
		    overall response rate for <em>both</em></span> surveys). </p>
		  <h2>Respondent Characteristics</h2>
		  <p>Respondents were asked to complete questions about
		    their background and birding interests. Demographic data for users who
		    completed<em> both</em> the Time 1 and
		    Time 2 surveys are summarized in Table 1. </p>

		  <p class="caption">Table 1: 2005 eBird New User Demographics</p>
		  <p>In addition to selecting their primary reason for
		    participating, respondents also were asked to rate the importance of each
		    of the 5 reasons in deciding to participate. These ratings are summarized
		    in Figure 1 below. Conservation was considered either an important or a
		    very important reason for nearly 80% of new users. Learning about birds
		    and bird populations and obtaining the ability to track one’s own
		    observations also were deemed important by a majority of new users. These
		    responses indicate that the interests of eBird users appropriately coincide
		    with the project’s objectives.</p>

		  <p class="caption">Fig 1: Importance of reasons for eBird participation<span style="background:yellow; "> </span></p>
		  <h3>Active Users Vs. Non-Users </h3>
		  <p>At Time 2, respondents were asked, of the data they
		    had collected about birds during the past month, how much they had submitted
		    to eBird. Based on those responses, we created two categories of eBird
		    usage. Respondents who had submitted data to eBird during the past month
		    were categorized as <strong>active users</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> (n=
		    37); those who indicated that they had not submitted any data in the past
		    month were labeled </span><strong>non-users</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> (n=
		    45). Active users and non-users did not differ significantly in terms of
		    age, sex, education, self-reported bird identification skill, or motivation
		    for eBird participation. The two categories were used in the analyses of
		    behavior change that follow, with the non-users acting as a comparison
		    group for active users.</span></p>
		  <p>Reasons for not submitting data varied. Most common
		    were lack of time or forgetting about the project (70% of reasons fell
		    into one of these two categories). Fifteen percent of participants could
		    not figure out how to submit data or found the process too cumbersome.
		    Ten percent felt that the birds they had seen were “common” and
		    thus not worth reporting. One person decided she was no longer interested
		    in the project, and one felt that her bird identification skills were insufficient.
		    We note that although the majority of non-users cited time as a reason
		    for their non participation, there was <em>no difference</em> between
		    active users and non-users in terms of the number of days of birdwatching
		    activity in the month prior to the Time 2 survey (<em>M</em> =
		    14). Thus, individuals in the two groups appear to have been doing a similar
		    amount of birdwatching; the difference between them was whether individuals
		    submitted data to eBird. The reason for this difference might lie in experience
		    with recording bird data. All active users had recorded at least one type
		    of data prior to participating in eBird. Of the non-users, one-third had
		    never collected any kind of bird data. Strikingly, of the non-users who
		    lacked data collection experience, not one submitted any data to eBird. <strong></strong></p>
		  <h3>Behavior Related To Birding And Conservation</h3>
		  <p>At both Time 1 and Time 2, survey respondents were
		    asked about their membership in conservation organizations; the frequency
		    of their birdwatching and data-recording activity; types of bird data recorded;
		    and birding equipment owned. At Time 2 only, participants were asked if
		    they had visited any new locations or identified any new (to them) species
		    in the preceding month. Behaviors related to birding and conservation as
		    reported by respondents prior to and following eBird participation are
		    summarized in Table 2. </p>

		  <p class="caption">Table 2: Behavior related to birding and conservation</p>
		  <p>Key findings regarding birding behavior include the
		    following: </p>
		  <p><strong><em>New types of data collected</em></strong><span style="font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; ">.
		      Active users were no more likely than non-users to begin collecting any
		      particular type of new data. However, when the total number of new data
		      types collected was calculated, active users showed a significant increase
		      in the number of different data types collected between Time 1 and Time
		      2, t(36) = 3.60, p &lt; .01. Non-users did not show a significant increase.</span></p>
		  <p><strong><em>New species identified</em></strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "><em>.</em></span> Active

		    82<em>)</em> = 9.25, <em>p</em> =
		    .002.</p>
		  <p><strong><em>New locations visited</em></strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "><em>.</em></span> Active
		    users were more likely than non-users to have visited a new-to-them location
		    for birding in the previous month, <span style="font-family:Symbol; ">c</span> ²(1, <em>N</em> =
		    82<em>)</em> = 4.14, <em>p</em> =
		    .042.</p>
		  <p><strong><em>Birdwatching days on which bird data were
		        recorded</em></strong><span style="font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; ">.
		        Active users showed a significant increase in the percentage of days
		        on which they recorded bird data, t(28) = 3.37, p &lt; .01. Prior to
		        participation, active users recorded data on an average of 44% of their
		        birdwatching days; after participating they recorded data on an average
		        of 65% of birdwatching days. Non-users showed no change in their data
		        recording habits.</span></p>
		  <p>There were no significant changes for either active
		    users or non-users in terms of birding equipment owned, membership in conservation-related
		    organizations, or number of birdwatching days in the past month. </p>
		  <p>To summarize respondent characteristics, eBird attracts
		    new registrants with diverse backgrounds in terms of birding experience,
		    education, and age (though participation among those under age 35 is lower
		    than might be desirable). eBird participants cite personal learning (tracking
		    their own observations and learning about distribution and abundance) as
		    the most important reasons for using the site, but also display a strong
		    commitment to conservation issues. </p>
		  <p>Participating in eBird appears to have the effect
		    of broadening the scope of birding activity in ways directly related to
		    eBird’s mission. Active users of eBird recorded data from more of
		    their birding sessions, visited new locations, and identified new-to-them
		    species after they began participating. Active users also began recording
		    data on the time they spent observing and birds per species; both of these
		    data types are among those requested on (but not required for) eBird’s
		    checklists. Some new registrants, notably those with no prior data collection
		    experience, did not submit data to eBird.</p>
		  <h2>Use and Understanding of eBird’s View and Explore Data Tools</h2>
		  <p>One of eBird’s primary goals is that users will
		    explore its database to learn more about bird populations in their own
		    communities and to compare local bird populations to those in other areas.
		    To that end, eBird’s <strong>View </strong><span style="font-weight:normal; ">and </span><strong>Explore
		    Data</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> Web pages guide users
		    in creating data summaries by species or location for whatever time period(s)
		    they choose. The New User Survey was designed to answer two questions about
		    data manipulation. First, what types of information were participants interested
		    in obtaining, and how did they plan to use it? Second, were participants
		    able to determine which of the many available data visualizations- various
		    maps and graphs- were best suited for answering their questions?</span></p>
		  <p>At Time 1, all participants stated that they planned
		    to view at least one type of eBird data. Interestingly, at Time 2, half
		    of the non-users had in fact viewed at least one type of data, indicating
		    that some non-users access eBird features even if they do not submit data.
		    However, active users viewed nearly twice as many types of data (<em>M</em> =
		    4.5) as non-users (<em>M</em> =
		    2.3), a significant if predictable difference, t(80) = 4.59, p &lt; .01.</p>
		  <p>Planned and actual data use by active users is summarized
		    in Figure 2. Responses indicate that eBird users’ interests are varied,
		    with questions about the location or range of particular species tending
		    to be most popular. Users were slightly less likely to look at changes
		    in populations over time, or to compare populations at different locations.</p>
		  <p class="caption"><img src="thompson.fig2.jpg" alt="Fig 2: Planned and actual use of View and Explore Data tools" width="400" height="289"/></p>
		  <p class="caption">Fig 2: Planned and actual use of View and Explore Data
		    tools</p>
		  <p>To learn whether participants could identify appropriate
		    data analyses for answering questions, survey respondents were asked to
		    read three scenarios, each describing a question about bird distribution
		    or abundance. After reading the scenarios, they viewed live eBird data
		    (in a frame in the survey) and identified the analysis they believed would
		    best answer the question. Available analyses included maps as well as graphs
		    showing abundance, frequency, high count, average count, and birds per
		    hour; respondents were able to toggle between the different displays and
		    view the results for as long as they liked before selecting an answer.
		    Respondents also were asked to rate, on a scale of 1-5, their confidence
		    in the answer choice they selected.</p>
		  <p>‘Correct’ responses were identified by
		    the eBird project manager as the best or most efficient analysis for a
		    particular question. The questions were designed so that correct responses
		    corresponded with the most commonly used analyses of eBird data: distribution
		    maps, frequency graphs, and abundance graphs. Even so, many respondents
		    skipped one or more of these three questions. Perhaps these respondents
		    were confused by the questions, or maybe they encountered technical difficulties
		    in viewing the live eBird data (although no such problems were reported
		    to us). Or respondents may have felt that they lacked the knowledge to
		    answer the questions, a possibility supported by two emails from respondents
		    to the evaluation team. </p>
		  <p>Overall, 27% of respondents (41% of those who actually
		    answered the question) were able to correctly identify a frequency analysis
		    as the best answer to Question 1; 50% (or 73% of those who selected an
		    answer) were able to identify the map as the best answer to Question 2,
		    and 39% (61% of those who answered) were able to identify either abundance
		    or average count analyses as the best answers to Question 3. Figures 3,
		    4 and 5 below summarize the responses to each question.</p>
		  <p class="caption">

		    question #3</p>
		  <p>There was no change in the rate of correct responses
		    from Time 1 to Time 2 for either active users or non-users, nor were there
		    significant changes in participant confidence in their answers. Because
		    some non-users reported that they had in fact viewed some eBird data, we
		    also compared the rate of correct responses for all of those who reported
		    viewing data with those who did not; there were no differences in the rate
		    of correct responses between these two groups. <strong></strong></p>
		  <p>To summarize use and understanding of eBird’s
		    View and Explore Data tools, most respondents in our sample made use of
		    these tools, even those who had not submitted any checklists (the non-users).
		    Participants used the data tools to answer a variety of questions about
		    bird distribution and abundance, indicating achievement of one of the key
		    educational objectives of the eBird project. However, when asked to use
		    live data analyses to answer some basic questions, it became clear that
		    not all users were sure which analyses are appropriate for those questions,
		    indicating a need for additional support for users of these data analysis
		    tools. </p>
		  <p>As an evaluation tool, we feel that the live ‘View
		    and Explore Data’ questions yielded informative results. Initially,
		    we thought that the question format itself might have been confusing, leading
		    to the high non-response rate for those particular questions. However,
		    given that the survey questions featured the actual View and Explore Data
		    interface, with live data imported directly from the eBird site, we feel
		    it is more likely that many users simply didn’t understand the different
		    data types themselves. </p>
		  <h2>Personal Meaning Mapping</h2>
		  <p>To capture even more information about the range and
		    impact of participant experiences, the New User Survey also included
		    an on-line version of a Personal Meaning Mapping (PMM) protocol originally
		    developed by John Falk and associates at the Institute for Learning
		    Innovation for use during in-person interviews with visitors to the
		    Baltimore Aquarium (Falk et al. 1998). Given the diversity of experiences
		    possible for eBird participants, we felt that an open-ended tool
		    would help us capture eBird’s
		    learning outcomes. However, we desired an instrument that would yield
		    responses constrained enough to be tractable to coding and analysis.
		    PMM has been shown to be effective at eliciting rich, in-depth visitor
		    experiences and responses that go beyond traditional survey or multiple-choice
		    testing instruments but are amenable to quantitative analysis (Adelman
		    et al. 2000). </p>
		  <p>Because PMM is typically facilitated by an interviewer,
		    Eduweb created a structured Web interface that guided respondents in sharing
		    their thoughts. On the Time 1 survey, participants were asked what words,
		    thoughts, images, or ideas came to mind when they read the prompt “Conservation.” Following
		    this prompt, respondents were offered a series of text boxes into which
		    they could type their thoughts. The prompt was repeated at Time 2, when
		    respondents were invited to review their previous responses and then add
		    to, edit, or delete any or all of them.</p>
		  <p>Our original intent was to examine PMM content at
		    Time 2 compared with Time 1, looking for changes that might be attributable
		    to project participation. However, few users made changes, and those that
		    did typically corrected spelling or grammar. Thus the sample of changed
		    PMM responses was too small to use for meaningful statistical analysis.
		    However, we did examine all responses to learn more about participant perceptions
		    of conservation. Responses were rich and varied, as described below.</p>
		  <p>PMMs collected by Falk and his colleagues in 1998
		    were coded along four parameters: extent of vocabulary used, number of
		    different concepts invoked (“breadth”), depth of understanding,
		    and emotional intensity. The on-line PMM responses generated by the eBird
		    New User Survey lent themselves to coding of extent, breadth, and depth;
		    in this paper, we will discuss coding of breadth only. </p>
		  <p>Responses from the Time 1 Survey were coded into 10
		    categories that are similar but not identical those used by Falk et al.
		    in the Baltimore Aquarium study. Categories were not mutually exclusive
		    (e.g., a single response could receive more than one code, although this
		    happened only in rare instances).</p>
		  <h3>Response Categories</h3>
		  <ul>
		    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Emotional content</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> (anger,
		      sadness, hope, skepticism)</span></li>
		    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Nature</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> (General
		      reference to nature, environment; appreciation/respect of same)</span></li>
		    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Specific issues and resources</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> (clean
		      water, spotted owl, invasive species)</span></li>
		    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Involvement or action</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> (recycling,
		      reducing consumption, government policies)</span></li>
		    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Urgency</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> (conservation
		      is important, critical, essential)</span></li>
		    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Specific people, places, and organizations</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> (Everglades,
		      Audubon, Rachel Carson)</span></li>
		    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Future orientation</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> (saving
		      Earth for the children, planning for the future)</span></li>
		    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Spiritual or religious references</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> (to
		      God, a “Creator” or others)</span></li>
		    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Need for education/awareness</strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> (teaching
		      children, getting others interested)</span></li>
		    <li><strong class="listwithbullets">Other </strong><span style="font-weight:normal; ">(responses
		      that did not fit into any of the above categories)</span></li>
	      </ul>
		  <p>Most respondents offered multiple comments (<em>M</em> =
		      4.5, sd = 2.4). On average, each person gave at least two different types
		      of responses (<em>M</em> = 2.6,
		      sd = 1.2). There was no significant difference between active users and
		      non-users in terms of the total number of comments entered, nor was there
		      a difference in the number of unique concepts entered. The number of
		      responses in each category is summarized in Figure 6 below.</p>
		  <p class="caption"><img src="thompson.fig6.jpg" alt="Fig 6: “Conservation” PMM responses by category" width="400" height="289"/></p>
		  <p class="caption">Fig 6: “Conservation” PMM responses by
		    category</p>
		  <p>Respondents were most likely to offer comments on
		    specific conservation issues, such as habitat preservation or pollution.
		    Predictably, many comments directly concerned issues related to birds in
		    general or particular species, but overall the responses covered a diverse
		    array of content areas. Specific actions were frequently mentioned, including
		    recycling, reducing consumption, and planting trees, along with government
		    policies related to conservation. </p>
		  <h3>PMM as an Evaluation Technique</h3>
		  <p>At this point we have several thoughts about the use
		    of on-line PMM as an evaluation technique. First, the format of the on-line
		    PMM (a prompt followed by a presentation of blank text boxes) offers participants
		    an opportunity to make many discrete comments, rather than to write a single,
		    stream-of-consciousness paragraph that we suspect might result from the
		    use of a single, large text box. In addition, this format seems to be less
		    overwhelming for the user, and also appears to appropriately convey the
		    potential to provide multiple thoughts and ideas, rather than just the
		    first thing that comes to mind (in response to the prompt). The responses
		    from eBird users were rich and detailed, yet the format lent itself to
		    relatively easy coding because the thoughts were already parsed into distinct
		    text boxes.</p>
		  <p>There are several possible reasons why respondents
		    tended to leave their Time 1 responses unchanged. First, in a traditional
		    PMM protocol, the presence of an interviewer could compel respondents to
		    review their previous responses, whereas on-line respondents may be less
		    likely to review what they previously wrote and were thus less likely to
		    make changes. Second, because our on-line PMM was combined with a traditional
		    survey, respondents may have felt pressured for time and skimmed through
		    the PMM, especially on the Time 2 survey.  Third, in museum settings
		    where PMMs are frequently employed, many of the additional comments that
		    participants generate at Time 2 are attributable to “text echo”-
		    phrases that directly reflect text presented as part of an exhibit. eBird
		    offers no text that might be reflected in PMM responses. A final possibility
		    is that concepts of conservation held by eBirders at the time they registered
		    were already quite rich, leaving little room for change in the time period
		    covered by the New User Survey. </p>
		  <p>Overall, we believe that the rich responses we received,
		    coupled with the ability to apply the general coding structure developed
		    by Falk et al., indicate that on-line PMM has tremendous potential. However,
		    the technique requires additional refinement and testing to determine whether
		    it can be used for measuring changes in knowledge and attitudes. Alterations
		    to the format might help elicit a greater number of participant changes
		    and additions to the Time 2 PMMs. For example, it might be helpful to more
		    closely replicate the physical layout of an in-person PMM by allowing on-line
		    respondents to enter their thoughts into text boxes, and then physically
		    arrange them on the page via a drag-and-drop method. We are currently experimenting
		    with changes to the on-line PMM format in evaluation of other projects.</p>
		  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
		  <p>Through the use of a mixed-methods survey, we documented
		    in the birding behavior of active eBird users changes that appear to be
		    directly related to eBird participation (namely, increases in frequency
		    and type of bird data collected, new species identification, and birding
		    locations visited). We also learned that eBirders use the site’s
		    View and Explore Data tools to seek answers to a variety of questions about
		    bird populations and distributions. However, if we had not incorporated
		    live eBird data into the survey, we might have incorrectly inferred that
		    the majority of participants were successfully using the tools.  Instead,
		    we learned that some eBird users may be arriving at inappropriate conclusions
		    about bird populations because they do not know which analyses are most
		    appropriate for answering certain types of questions. Finally, while on-line
		    PMM data were not useful in answering questions about changes in conservation
		    concepts related to eBird participation, they provided extensive insight
		    into the diverse conservation concepts and attitudes that participants
		    bring to the project, and indicate that eBird tends to attract people who
		    are already knowledgeable about and invested in conservation. With refinement,
		    we feel that the on-line PMM technique could become a powerful tool for
		    understanding both the baseline knowledge and the attitudes that users
		    bring to on-line interactives, as well as the impact of such interactives
		    on complex conceptual understandings.</p>
