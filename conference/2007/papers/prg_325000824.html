      <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="abstractText">The Museum of Science (MoS) recently redesigned
        its Web site from the ground up. Everything was replaced – new
        design, new hardware, new content management, new stats tracking. To
        successfully implement a Web site with this much change required a great
        deal of participation from departments and staff throughout the Museum.
        In this paper we discuss the organizational change that spurred the Museum
        to update its Website, along with the change caused by its implementation.</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The Museum of Science (MoS) launched its first Web site in 1994. Over
      time the design was changed and more and more content was added. Major
      upgrades were done in 1996 and 1999.</p>
    <p>In 1997, MoS lauched the Leonardo DaVinci site to complement a physical
      exhibit developed by the Museum. The site is still active today and draws
      an impressive 40% of all MoS Web traffic. This popularity is caused by
      referrals from Google – when a user searches for Leonardo and/or
      DaVinci, the MoS site is the first search result returned.</p>
    <p>In 2001, MoS hired a manager and formally created a Web department. Later
      that year, the on-line ticket store, named MosTix, was developed and implemented.
      The site underwent a major facelift in 2004 that lasted until January 2007.
      In 2006, the site got an average of 108,000 unique visitors a week. These
      visitors viewed an average of 861,000 pages per week. The Leonardo DaVinci
      site was the most popular with 40% of page views. The Scanning Electron
      Microscope site, another top Google search, received 18% of total page
      hits. The on-line ticket store received 13% of page hits.</p>

    <p class="caption">Fig1: The Exhibit Halls page from the Web site in 2006
      before the redesign.</p>
    <p>By late 2005, the Web site had reached an inflection point. The design
      of the site needed to be updated with the Museum’s new brand elements,
      and the content on the site needed a complete overhaul. Many of the Museum’s
      exhibits and programs were underrepresented while the things that were
      represented well were not in line with visitors’ demands for the
      offering. Most of the Museum’s offerings were available in the educator
      section of the site as part of the Educator Resource Center (ERC) – but
      not available in the general visitor area of the site. Content on the home
      page wasn’t managed at all, and since departments considered the
      Web the least expensive marketing alternative, everyone requested the placement
      of their offerings on the home page. Without an established rubric for
      home page placement, these requests were always granted. Additionally,
      the rapid nature of Web updates was creating a workflow and time management
      issue – the Web team continuously received requests to put information
      about listings on the home page only a day or two before the event if the
      event wasn’t selling well. As a result, information was quickly coded
      on the site without much regard to maintenance and content quality. Highly
      skilled developers were doing much of the upkeep for the site, not those
      responsible for the content. Change was needed. The spark for this change
      came from the roll-out of the Museum’s new branding initiative.</p>
    <h1>Background Branding and Research</h1>
    <p>In late 2003 the Museum’s marketing department contracted with a
      local branding firm, Minelli, to devise a new brand strategy for the Museum.
      Through extensive research, including competitive audits and extensive
      focus groups, a new brand vision and architecture was outlined. Highlights
      of the new positioning included: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhancing visitor experience through new technology and new offerings </li>
      <li>Becoming a resource center for schools and educators across the nation </li>
      <li>Becoming a destination for adults – and serving new adult audiences
        outside of our walls </li>
      <li>Expanding our research on learning </li>
      <li>Developing vital partnerships</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The personality of the brand was also defined. The newly branded Museum
      was to be captivating (fun, charismatic, energetic and engaging), empowering
      (opening new worlds, conveying knowledge and transforming lives), and contemporary
      (forward- looking, relevant and vital). </p>
    <p>Implementation of the brand began in 2004. The ramifications of this new
      brand vision affected both the physical building and operations. Within
      the Museum, physical spaces were upgraded, including the café and
      Museum shop, and lobby signage was improved . New projects and departments
      were created to carry out these plans, focusing mainly on technology education
      in both the formal and informal setting. With this came the creation of
      many new Web sites, including the National Center for Technological Literacy
      (NCTL) site, Engineering is Elementary, and Power-Up, to name a few. At
      this time the Museum also created the Educator Resource Center (ERC). Targeted
      at educators, the ERC consisted of an on-line searchable database of all
      Museum offerings with curriculum connections to both state and national
      standards, along with a physical location in the Museum’s library
      to house curricular materials. All of these new sites had distinct styles
      but lacked a consistent level of quality.</p>
    <p>The overall organization and usability were also found to be lacking.
      Results from a usability test conducted by the American Institutes for
      Research (AIR) in April 2005 showed that the information architecture and
      design of the site needed to be upgraded and improved. The study found
      that while the site had overall appeal to visitors, there were a number
      of things that needed to be changed. Users had issues negotiating all of
      the text on the home page, didn’t find the search function was adequate,
      and were confused by the nomenclature used on the site’s primary
      navigation. </p>
    <h1>The Project</h1>
    <p>The project officially began in late January 2006 by forming a small Web
      advisory team consisting of individuals whose job it was to abstract the
      Museum for outsiders. Team members came from marketing, research, Web,
      and advancement. The project was managed by the Manager of Web Development
      and Operations. The project operated more like a cross-functional exhibit
      or program team instead of an IT project that dictated the way the Web
      site was to be used by the Museum. The team’s objective was to define
      the scope of the project and serve as champions of change and partnership
      within the Museum. After the team became familiar with the new brand architecture
      designed by Minelli and the AIR usability study, their first task was to
      write a mission statement for the Web. The team agreed on the following:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">The Web site exemplifies the Museum of Science as the
      science and technology center of the 21st century. The site embodies and
      integrates its physical and virtual resources to redefine the way people
      of all ages think about, learn about, and interact with science and technology
      and how it impacts our lives, our society, and the universe we live in.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Through the Web site we will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Project a world-class image of the Museum of Science</li>
      <li>Provide up-to-date information</li>
      <li>Inspire visits to the Museum</li>
      <li>Assist visitors in planning their visit</li>
      <li>Promote ticket and membership sales</li>
      <li>Immerse learners in science and technology</li>
      <li>Provide educators with teaching resources and professional development
        opportunities</li>
      <li>Encourage philanthropic support</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Next, the team outlined goals for the site. The list of goals was extensive
      and included many advanced features that were not possible without a solid
      content management and information architecture infrastructure. In an effort
      to reduce complexity and increase the likelihood of success, the team limited
      the scope and goals to what were considered a reasonable first phase. The
      list of goals included the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The site must group its content to target specific audiences</li>
      <li>The site must present the Museum in a manner that makes sense to Web
        visitors, not Museum employees who are organized along institutional
        lines that do not make sense to an outsider</li>
      <li>The site will be visually and experientially compelling</li>
      <li>The site will be a learning tool</li>
      <li>The home page will be simple and uncluttered</li>
      <li>The site should connect content from various Museum products. For example,
        if a user is viewing a page about the Gilliland Observatory, the site
        should ‘recommend’ an upcoming lecture about astronomy and
        a current Planetarium show.</li>
      <li>The site will be accessible for people of varied physical abilities</li>
      <li>A Plan Your Visit Guide will assist visitors through their visit planning
        process and will include ticket purchases and a printed itinerary of
        their visit</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It quickly became evident that to achieve these goals the Museum was going
      to have to work differently, more collaboratively, and staff members had
      to understand where their offerings fit into the overall scheme of the
      Web site. It was evident that this project was not simply a design project.
      The underlying data management and operational processes needed to be designed
      as well. </p>
    <p>A new content management system was needed to support the goals of the
      site and to support future growth. To play to everyone’s strengths,
      the advisory team decided to let the internal MoS Web team design the content
      management system while an outside design firm would tackle the site’s
      design. The outside firm and the Web team would collaborate on the information
      architecture, with the outside firm taking the lead. The project manager
      began drafting a RFP. </p>
    <p>The advisory team was concerned about the cost of an external design firm,
      given the budget the Museum had appropriated. This problem had a simple
      solution, however. To save money, the chosen design firm would provide
      MoS with Photoshop files only – they would not spend any time writing
      html or css code. The developers on the MoS Web team would perform this
      task, and since the developers were operationally funded, the budget would
      not have to increase.</p>
    <p>The mission statement and goals written by the advisory team along with
      Minelli’s brand architecture and the AIR usability study provided
      the foundation for a RFP. Twelve design firms received the RFP and all
      responded. Corey McPherson Nash (CMN) was chosen from the finalists and
      work began almost immediately.</p>
    <p>CMN began the project with an intensive research phase. They performed
      a competitive audit of related Web sites and conducted interviews with
      Museum employees, visitors, members, and educators. Together with the project
      manager, CMN also had hour-long meetings with more than 60 staff members
      representing seven different departments to discuss departmental Web needs
      and offerings. Since the Web advisory team wanted to create an environment
      of participation, this first step of soliciting ideas and advice from those
      affected by the change was vital to ensure the process and project would
      be widely accepted.</p>
    <p>At the end of their research, CMN presented the following set of recommendations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Represent the museum in a succinct, holistic way</li>
      <li>Create an offering and audience-based architecture</li>
      <li>Change the way we work in order to achieve success</li>
      <li>Enhance the “Planning Your Trip” section</li>
      <li>Be clear about who and what the museum is</li>
      <li>Create an on-line structure planning for frequent change</li>
    </ul>
    <p>CMN’s recommendations reinforced the project goals written by the
      Web advisory team. This project validation let to quick acceptance of the
      recommendations, and CMN began working on the site’s information
      architecture. </p>
    <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
    <p>Most of the goals and recommendations for the site were achieved through
      the new site’s information architecture. CMN presented their recommended
      architecture with wire frames. </p>
    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <p>CMN recommended an overall scheme that was both offering and audience
      based. An always-present navigation bar includes links to audience sections
      for members, adults, and educators. While educators and members had sections
      in the old site, the addition of the adult focus page was new. Falling
      in line with the new brand vision to become a destination for adults, the
      page serves as a focal point of all adult-related content and gives the
      adult initiative a concrete focal point and concise <em>url</em> for use
      in printed materials, radio spots, and eNews marketing initiatives. </p>
    <p>The main offering-based or functional navigational system included five
      main items: Visitor Info, Exhibits &amp; Shows, Events &amp; Activities,
      Support MoS, and Tickets. A sixth item, Topics, was added during implementation. </p>
    <p>Visitor Info includes all of the logistical information necessary for
      a trip to the Museum along with the ‘About the Museum’ section,
      HR related information, and the Museum Comment Card. </p>
    <p>The Exhibits &amp; Shows menu contains all offerings that typically take
      place during a visit to the Museum during the day. Here you’ll find
      exhibits, IMAX shows, Planetarium, 3D Cinema, Live Presentations, etc. </p>
    <p>The Events &amp; Activities menu combines all of the things available
      at the Museum during non-traditional Museum hours – usually in the
      evening. It also includes things that can be done away from the Museum – including
      videocasts, podcasts, archived lectures with video, and virtual exhibits. </p>
    <p>Support MoS includes advancement functions, membership, MoS in the Community,
      and Volunteering. On the old site both MoS in the Community and Volunteering
      were under Visitor Info, but CMN recommended that these items sit in this
      location because the contribution to the Museum by these two functions
      is on par with raising money.</p>
    <p>The Tickets menu includes links to the ticket store and the newly created
      Trip Planner.</p>
    <p>The Topics menu includes links to the subjects represented in the museum.
      This is made up of Life Sciences &amp; Natural World, Tech &amp; Engineering,
      Earth &amp; Space Science, Inquiry &amp; Connections, and Current Science &amp; Technology</p>
    <h3>Labeling</h3>
    <p>The labeling was the most difficult part of this process and revealed
      that the Museum does not share a common vocabulary for its offerings. The
      labeling of the new Web site was the first attempt by MoS to be consistent
      in naming its products. This process was met with resistance from many
      program managers who wished to differentiate their offerings from other
      offerings in different departments. </p>
    <p>While CMN performed usability testing based on the menus and labels, MoS
      staff were apprehensive about a few specific choices that were made. The
      term ‘Lecture’ was universally loathed although it tested as
      the most easily identifiable by people outside the Museum. To complicate
      matters, offerings typically known as lectures were marketed with a series
      of inconsistent names, and the creators of these offerings wanted to maintain
      their chosen descriptor. The list of names includes talks, events, programs,
      discussions, special programs, special events, and forums. The Web advisory
      team chose to call things that are most like lectures, typically a speaker
      in front of an audience, a lecture. The word ‘forum’ is reserved
      for offerings where the primary focus is on discussion between attendees.
      The label ‘special program’ was created for offerings that
      couldn’t be defined as anything else; it also serves as a catch-all,
      and is mainly used for offerings that are a group of disparate offerings.</p>
    <p>Another issue arose around the categories for Topics. For many years,
      the Museum worked under an internal exhibit paradigm that considered science
      an activity instead of a series of subjects to be learned. This played
      out in many exhibits that explored aspects of the scientific process. As
      a result, many staff members objected to classifying offerings by scientific
      topic. CMN’s research proved that visitors think otherwise, so the
      topics menu was created and the ‘science as activity’ offerings
      were classified as ‘Inquiry &amp; Connections’ topics. We did
      realize however that some offerings may have more than one topic – exhibits
      focused on biomedical technology, for example – so offerings can
      fall into more than one Topic area. </p>
    <h3>Related Offerings</h3>
    <p>One major aspect of the new information architecture is that all offering
      pages include other related offerings on the right sidebar of all pages.
      Under three headings, other offerings related by topic, audience, and offering
      type are accessible. The first heading, Get Curious, includes offerings
      found under the Exhibits &amp; Shows section of the site. Pass It On is
      content for educators. And Get Active includes offerings from the Events &amp; Activities
      menu. This cross-referencing of offerings is a central theme and a great
      motivator for Museum departments to classify offerings – we are attempting
      to draw more attention to other offerings – and increasing the visibility
      of the Museum’s diverse work. The ‘related’ content sections
      present the great breath and depth of the Museum and are intended to spark
      interest in other activities and create associations in the mind of users. </p>

      Fig 2: The Offering page wire frame.</p>
    <h3>Defining What Can Have A Separate Presence</h3>
    <p>The old site had a myriad of satellite Web sites, many of which shared
      the same goals of the MoS Website. CMN recommended that the rubric for
      what offerings can have a separate Web presence get solidified and enforced.
      They recommended that sites with similar goals to the main MoS site should
      not be allowed to remain or be built in the future. Sites that have a different
      goal can have a unique design. This allows content- heavy educational sites
      such as Leonardo and the SEM to remain. The satellite site for The Current
      Science and Technology Center (CS&amp;T), however, was appropriated into
      the main structure of the new site. The site was a repository for the popular
      podcasts and videocasts produced by the Center’s staff. Since the
      goal of the new main site was to cross-reference and highlight offerings
      to increase visibility, CMN believed the CS&amp;T content should be included
      in the main site. CS&amp;T is now a Topic page and the podcasts and videocasts
      are offerings pages under the Events &amp; Activities menu. As expected,
      this change was met with resistance. The CS&amp;T department had enjoyed
      a separate personality and an independence from the rest of the Museum’s
      Web presence. After many discussions and to their great credit, they agreed
      to be a part of the larger site.</p>
    <h3>Traffic Conversion</h3>
    <p>One of the goals of the Web advisory team was to convert Leonardo DaVinci
      traffic from the virtual exhibit to the main site. CMN designed a container
      for this and other educational content sites to drive traffic between related
      MoS content. The container, or clamp, is similar to the related offering
      section of the individual offering page in that other related offerings
      are listed.</p>
    <p class="caption"><a href="bottis.fig3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="bottis.fig3.jpg" alt="Fig 3" width="400" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 3: Container design for educational content sites.</p>
    <h3>Trip Planner</h3>
    <p>Trip planning was considered an area that was greatly lacking on the existing
      site. Both the Web advisory goals and CMN’s recommendations included
      improving this area of the site. CMN designed a flash-based map of the
      Museum that serves as a visual listing of offerings that can be added to
      a ‘trip’. Web visitors can create a daily itinerary made up
      of exhibits, live presentations, IMAX films, planetarium shows, etc. The
      system allows for personalized itineraries for up to twenty guests and
      notifies users of a conflict if two selected shows overlap for a visitor.
      After creating a trip, users can opt to purchase tickets or print an itinerary
      to purchase tickets once at the Museum. Creating this application required
      many discussions with operations staff, the expert source of information
      about visitors’ expectations and follies, to make sure the planner
      was accurate and wouldn’t create issues for front line staff once
      implemented. </p>

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>Once the information architecture was finalized, CMN presented the advisory
      team with five different design directions based on the creative brief
      written by CMN. Each was dynamic and unlike anything the team members had
      seen before. Although all five were excellent, one design jumped out immediately
      as the favorite for everyone in the group. The design was meant to embody
      the way people &#34;of all ages think about, learn about and interact
      with science and technology, and how it impacts our lives.&#34; In other
      words, it is mean to be visually powerful, using images that are diverse
      (show breadth and depth), accessible (make science and technology relevant
      to our lives), and interactive (experientially dynamic, mirroring actual
      experience of the visiting museum). The design creates objects in a 3 dimensional
      space as a way of drawing you in. Once you interact with one of those objects,
      you can drill down, but also access related material, reinforcing that
      science and technology is everywhere and affects everything.</p>
    <p class="caption"><a href="bottis.fig5.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="bottis.fig5.jpg" alt="Fig 5" width="400" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 5: The new home page design. <a href="../http://www.mos.org/" target="_blank">http://www.mos.org</a></p>
    <p>Everyone believed this design fit the new brand personality perfectly.
      Just as important, it was uncluttered, had enormous creative possibility,
      and was dynamic in movement and educational potential. Each of the objects
      in the main pane move forward and present the user with information about
      more than one offering associated with the object.</p>
    <p>The home page design made it easier to be more intentional as an institution
      to decide what should go on the home page. This page is expected to change
      every two months, and a new ‘home page’ advisory group was
      created to decide what items would go on the home page. The home page group
      is made up of people from exhibits, programs, education, the adult initiative,
      and marketing.</p>
    <p>The design of the individual offering page was considered one of the most
      vital of the project as it needed to open up the Museum to visitors and
      serve as a source of related content. CMN’s design includes a large
      image on the top of each offering page. The image allows visitors to see
      inside the physical Museum. This allows for great visual explanation of
      offerings – especially when some offering names are confusing to
      a Web visitor. The related content fits nicely in three vertical boxes
      on the right side of the page.</p>

    <h3>Content Management</h3>
    <p>While CMN was working on the design of the site, the MoS Web team was
      busy reviewing the content management needs of the Museum. Three issues
      quickly emerged from the review process:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The site did not have enough content about all Museum offerings for
        the general audience second; </li>
      <li>Museum staff were not able to update their own offerings and content;
        and </li>
      <li>Content was factually and grammatically incorrect and was not consistent
        with printed materials.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Content Quantity</h3>
    <p>Although the site contained more than 1600 Web pages, many of the Museum’s
      offerings were not represented at all. Permanent exhibits were the least
      represented offerings, yet are the main attraction of the Museum and take
      up an overwhelming majority of floor space. While big traveling exhibits
      usually got a separate Web presence, the site contained only one page dedicated
      to permanent exhibits, and it hadn’t been updated or verified since
      1999. The project manager met with the exhibits department about the lack
      of content. They were very upset at being underrepresented on the site
      and felt that the site favored the more obviously revenue generating items
      such as IMAX films and memberships. If the site was going to fulfill the
      goal of becoming a learning tool, the exhibit content developers were going
      to need to write content. Luckily, they wanted to write content and quickly
      volunteered to do the job. This meeting quickly dispelled the myth that
      the exhibits department did not want content on the Web for fear of losing
      visitation. Within a month, they wrote content for 32 permanent exhibits.
      The information architecture of the site rewarded this work by giving each
      its own page with associated media. Work also began for additional media,
      audio slide shows and video trailers, for three exhibits.</p>
    <h3>Content Management System</h3>
    <p>Museum staff was unable to update content reliably. A site-wide content
      management system did exist, but it was not easy to use. It was used primarily
      by the Web developers to create new pages and update content. It was not
      user friendly enough for general Museum staff without technical skills
      to use. The system centered on creating new pages, and as the Web team
      didn’t want Museum staff to have the ability to create new pages
      wherever they wanted, it could not be used by staff despite the lack of
      user-friendliness. The data stored by the system didn’t have any
      metadata attached, so topic or audience type tagging was not possible.
      The system was unable to support the goals and information architecture
      of the new site. </p>
    <p>The Educator Resource Center (ERC) section of the site was managed by
      a separate content management system that contained most of the Museum’s
      offerings. The system was rich with metadata – including formats,
      educational standards, and topic areas. It was also very easy to use and
      popular with staff. The only shortcoming of the system was that it contained
      educator-related content only. </p>
    <p>A decision was made to stretch the ERC database into a syste- wide content
      management system. It was built in house and called the Offerings Management
      System (OMS) because the data was entered in as offerings and not as Web
      pages. This allowed the Web team to tie the information architecture directly
      to offering types within the OMS. For example, the new site had listing
      and individual pages for IMAX films, permanent exhibits, and lectures.
      Individual offerings entered into the OMS appear directly on the listing
      page and then when clicked, the individual offering page. Since metadata
      such as topic and audience are also collected, we are able to ‘recommend’ other
      offerings as the information architecture of the site called for. Thus,
      the technical issues of creating the Web site are completely removed from
      the end user. Offering owners are able to concentrate on what they know – information
      about the offerings – instead of making Web pages and determining
      where in the site their offering should go.</p>
    <p>The OMS also shows, archives, and expires offerings automatically with
      a set of date fields – this ensures that offerings that have already
      happened are either moved to an archive page or deleted. With the old site,
      the Museum’s call center received a lot of complaints about old offerings.
      Some visitors even showed up believing a traveling exhibit was still at
      the Museum long after it had left. The new OMS prevents this.</p>
    <p>Another new feature offered by the OMS is the accessibility reference
      page. Each offering contains properties explaining its accessibility features.
      For example, if an exhibit has Braille components, the icon will show on
      the offering page. Consequently, there is a look-up for all offerings by
      an accessibility type – a user can search for all and see in one
      place all offerings that have Braille components and other accessibility
      properties.</p>
    <h3>Content Quality</h3>
    <p>With many people submitting information that was moved on to the Web by
      developers, the content lacked a consistent voice and level of quality.
      The managers of the publications department and the Web team got together
      and convinced the administration that Web content was equal to printed
      material and needed editing on a regular basis. The administration agreed,
      and an On-line Content Editor was hired to review and edit all site content.
      The editor will also manage and update the site pages (About the Museum,
      Hours, Directions, etc.) that are not tied into the OMS. Since these pages
      are typically static in nature, the changes are infrequent and very manageable
      for one person.</p>
    <h2>Hardware/Software</h2>
    <p>Other changes that are not visible to surfers of the site but are incredibly
      important for improved maintenance and uptime include new hardware and
      operating systems.</p>
    <p>While most of the site was coded with PHP and MySQL, the overall environment
      operated on a series of machines with a mix of Linux, Solaris, and Windows
      installed. Some of these machines were donated and could not be upgraded
      to the latest versions of PHP and MySQL. There was only one person in the
      Museum who could administer the Linux box, and the Museum’s IT department
      was completely on Windows machines. To leverage in house knowledge and
      ensure against redundancy, the decision was made to move all Web boxes
      to Windows. </p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>At the beginning of the project it was considered a given that certain
      departments and groups within the Museum would not participate or write
      content for the new site. Others believed certain departments would revolt
      if their own Web sites were ‘taken away’ and appropriated by
      the main MoS site. In the end, after explanations of the benefits of the
      new site structure and design, most MoS departments realized the benefit
      to the Museum and participated.</p>
    <p>The site was launched in January 2007, three months later than planned
      because the popular and sold-out exhibit Body Worlds 2 was at the Museum
      and most ticket sales were done on the Internet. We decided not to launch
      a new Web site during such a high level of traffic to prevent confusion
      for both visitors and support staff. Initial statistics show that the site
      is just as popular as before. The Leonardo site is still the top draw.
      Some new pages, especially the Current Exhibits page with all of the content
      provided by the exhibits department, is viewed with much greater frequency
      than the old and outdated exhibits page. </p>
    <p>Plans have begun for a large second phase of the site. It will be more
      personalized, with user accounts and custom created pages. Educators will
      be able to save their field trips for use in the future. General visitors
      will be able to save and share their trip planner itineraries. And members
      will be able to update their member accounts on-line. These changes will
      use the same advisory team and methods used by the first phase. We still
      have a long way to go to create our ideal Web environment, but the first
      phase of the project has created a fantastic foundation, both technically
      and organizationally, for future growth. </p>
