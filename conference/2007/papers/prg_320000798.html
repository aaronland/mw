      <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="abstractText">In mid-2006 the Powerhouse
          Museum launched a new on-line catalogue <a href="../http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database" target="_blank">http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database</a>).
          Inspired and informed by the explosion of Web2.0 sites and services,
          the new collection database aimed not only to provide a &#39;better,&#39; more
          usable museum catalogue, but also to  explore ways to leverage user
        interest and community knowledge.</p>
      <p class="abstractText">Internally called OPAC2.0, the new catalogue put 
        more than 70% of the Museum&#39;s collection on-line. In order to operate 
        effectively, OPAC2.0 collects detailed information about search terms 
        and object relationships as well as tagging and controlled vocabulary 
        usage patterns. With these and other evaluation tools built in to the 
        structure of the site from day one, OPAC2.0 has been conceptualised as 
        an ongoing project requiring continual enhancements and usability modifications.</p>
      <p class="abstractText">This paper examines the OPAC2.0 project and its
         impact on the Museum. It presents initial usage patterns, search trends,
         and social tagging trends over the first 6 months of operation (from
          June 14 to December 31, 2006). In particular, the paper explores
        the  impacts of opening up and the driving of traffic down the &#39;long
        tail&#39; of the Museum&#39;s collection; tag structures submitted by users using
        the  folksonomy engine; and the internal Museum changes that have come
        about  as a result of unprecedented user access and, importantly, user
        input  and engagement. </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Museum collections are increasingly being digitised and made available 
      to the public on-line. Whilst many organisations make their collections 
      available, most have been slow to implement or consider the user-centred 
      navigation and exploration tools that have been available on many consumer 
      Web sites such as Amazon for years. Even fewer have optimised their collections 
      for Google (<a href="../http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com</a>) 
      and other search engines. In many cases the lack of extra feature sets is 
      the result of using out-of-the-box software provided by collection management 
      system vendors whose primary functionality focus remains internal museum 
      record keeping. </p>
    <p>In many museums, too, the organisational focus on exhibitions and &#39;expert-led&#39; storytelling through narrative arrangement of objects remains a priority. 
      Translated to the Web, this often results in stand-alone, project-funded, 
      virtual exhibitions or small &#39;curated&#39; sets of objects deemed 
      to be of interest to the public, even though the space limitations of the 
      gallery are no longer present on the Web.</p>
    <p>In Sydney, the Powerhouse Museum (<a href="../http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/" target="_blank">http://www.powerhousemuseum.com</a>) promotes 
      itself as a museum of &#39;design, science and social history&#39; . 
      It hosts the annual Sydney Design festival, and in recent years its major 
      exhibition focus has been oriented around themes of design, technology and 
      contemporary &#39;popular culture&#39; . These factors, combined with 
      the sheer enormity of the collection (some 400,000 objects), are reasons 
      that there are many areas of the Museum&#39;s collection that have not 
      been accessible to the public.</p>
    <p>The Powerhouse Museum&#39;s Web site was relaunched in 2004 after a two-year 
      user study recommended that the new look Web site focus on the needs of 
      users wanting to visit the Museum (Sumption, 2003). Amongst the changes 
      were a visitor-centred navigation system and the inclusion of &#39;people-centric&#39; images of the Museum on the home page and subsequent page headers - visitors 
      enjoying the &#39;experience&#39; of the Museum rather than collection 
      objects, for example. Coinciding with the new Web site has been promotion, 
      both on-line and in traditional media, of the Museum as a &#39;destination&#39; and an &#39;experience&#39; .</p>
    <p>On the new look Web Site, usage of non-visit-related resources was seasonal 
      and influenced by high school semesters and key annual education dates, 
      such as state-wide examinations for which the Museum had developed specialist 
      but popular on-line study guides. Similarly, collection resources on the 
      Web site were limited to static pages with 150 key objects, 700 object records 
      held in our Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games collection microsite 
      (<a href="http:///www.powerhousemuseum.com/sydney2000games" target="_blank">http:///www.powerhousemuseum.com/sydney2000games</a>), 200 Tyrrell Collection 
      historical images (<a href="../http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/tyrrell" target="_blank">http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/tyrrell</a>), 
      and, most recently, 150 photographs and objects from the Hedda Morrison 
      collection (<a href="../http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/heddamorrison" target="_blank">http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/heddamorrison</a>).</p>
    <p>In June 2006, the Museum launched a new means for browsing and searching 
      almost all of its collection database. Although a large part of the Museum&#39;s 
      catalogue had been previously searchable through the museum-to-museum professional 
      portal Australian Museums On Line (now Collections Australia Network), object 
      records in this catalogue search had not been  updatable since 2001 and 
      were out of date, and lacked images. To optimise usage required a familiarity 
      with collecting and museological practice.</p>
    <p>Internally known by the rather dry project name OPAC2.0 (on-line public 
      access catalogue), the new collection search on the Powerhouse Museum&#39;s 
      own Web site implemented a number of key features aimed at making the Museum&#39;s 
      collection considerably more usable, &#39;browsable&#39; and &#39;discoverable&#39; .</p>
    <p>This paper examines the usage data accumulated and logged through these 
      features and explores the questions of where visitors actually go within 
      a diverse collection, and, how they use new features like folksonomies (user 
      keywords, tagging) and search recommendations.</p>
    <h2>About OPAC2.0</h2>
    <p>OPAC2.0 was built in-house using PHP and Microsoft SQL. The project developed 
      out of several internal experiments - an information kiosk in our permanent 
      design gallery (<em>Inspired! Design across time</em>) connected to the 
      Museum&#39;s collection management system KE Software&#39;s kEmu product), 
      the <em>Electronic Swatchbook</em> project which trialled user responses 
      to some basic user tagging, and an on-line virtual photographic gallery, 
      the Hedda Morrison collection, which trialled public access to an Emu-connected 
      collection and object-related user feedback. Development of OPAC2.0 has 
      been modular, experimental and &#39;unfinished&#39; , and for the first 
      6 months of operation the public site was still tagged as being in &#39;beta&#39; .</p>

    <h2>Back End</h2>
    <p>OPAC2.0 periodically harvests selected fields from objects records stored 
      in the Museum&#39;s collection management system (KE EMu). These records 
      are stored in a Microsoft SQL database with full-text indexing on all descriptive 
      fields (statement of significance, history, description, marks, credit line 
      and dimensions). Each record also contains reference pointers to associated 
      multimedia objects (currently zoomable images only, but the same application 
      is capable of video or other multimedia). These pointers point to multimedia 
      objects that are currently duplicated on a Web server, to add a layer of 
      security and enhance performance rather than serving them directly from 
      KE EMu. Whilst the KE EMu product does have its own Web interface, it was 
      decided to create a new one to allow for flexibility in terms of implementation, 
      additional user tracking and other features, and for speed and scalability.</p>
    <h2>Front End</h2>
    <p>The site&#39;s front end is comprised of three main pages - a home/search 
      page, a search results page, and an object view page. The site implements 
      a series of features to enhance navigability. Each page of these three base-template 
      pages is structured to maximise pivot or exit points (Vander Wal, 2006). 
      On each page is a large search box allowing searches to be performed at 
      any time and at any point in the site. The right hand column of the search 
      results page allows for further filtering of results, whilst the same column 
      position on the object view page can contain user keywords, related searches, 
      subject keywords and related objects, depending upon the object being shown.</p>

    <h2>User Tracking And Intentional Data</h2>
    <p>User tracking is a key component of the features to enhance discovery in 
      the collection. User tracking currently provides the basis of &#39;related 
      search&#39; recommendations and is being examined for application within 
      an enhanced future search ranking algorithm.</p>
    <p>When a visitor searches the database, intentional data is recorded – 
      the search term entered and the object selected by the user are recorded 
      in a search table along with a date stamp. IP address, session cookies or 
      other user data are currently not recorded. Only searches that result in 
      a view of an object record are recorded. Those that return no results, or 
      that do not result in the viewing of an object record, are currently not 
      recorded.</p>
    <p>When an object is viewed, a counter for that object record is incremented, 
      allowing for a continuous counter of view popularity. Whilst it is possible 
      to add extra granularity to user tracking, it was decided to slowly increase 
      logging capabilities to ensure future scalability.</p>
    <h2>Opensearch</h2>
    <p>In addition to search engine optimisation, the Museum&#39;s collection 
      is now directly searchable using the Opensearch (<a href="../http://www.opensearch.org/" target="_blank">http://www.opensearch.org</a>) protocol. Opensearch 
      allows Internet users to search the collection through their browsers or 
      a search aggregator such as A9.com without visiting the Museum&#39;s site. 
      Search results are available as an RSS<sup> </sup>feed, allowing users to 
      &#39;subscribe&#39; to be notified automatically of new objects in their 
      area of interest, as indicated by their search term. Although traffic using 
      this feature has been very low to date, it is expected that as new Opensearch 
      aggregators emerge and other similar organisations take up Opensearch, it 
      will grow in importance. Now, as it changes, the Museum&#39;s collection 
      can  be updated on Collections Australia as users can now use the OPAC2.0 
      Opensearch feed to return search results to their user bases, without needing 
      to harvest records.</p>
    <h2>Impact On Web Site Traffic To Powerhouse Museum</h2>
    <p>OPAC2.0 went live on June 14, 2006, and since then overall visitation to 
      the Museum&#39;s Web site has climbed from 228,246 visits in May to 571,432 
      in December. Of these total visitation figures, on-line collection visitation 
      was 17,394 (7.85% of total visitation) for May, which grew to 355,180 (62.15% 
      of total visitation) in December. The rapid visitor increase, the broadening 
      of content accessible, and the widening intentions of site visitors has 
      seen the average time spent on the site fall from 9:42 min in May to a still 
      sizeable 5:00 minutes in December.</p>
    <h2>Changing Geography Of Search Traffic</h2>
    <p>Coinciding with the launch of OPAC2.0, the Museum undertook an internal 
      exercise in search engine optimisation. As a result of this, the entire 
      collection database can be spidered by search engines. Since optimisation 
      and the exposure of the collection, Internet users searching for many common 
      topics and consumer items come across Powerhouse Museum objects in their 
      first page of Google search results. This has led to a considerable rise 
      in traffic to the Museum&#39;s Web site originating from Google and other 
      search engines, and a broadening of search terms used to arrive at the Web 
      site. </p>
    <p>From May to December 2006, total search traffic to Museum quadrupled from 
      45,873 to 193,655 visits. The geography of these searchers has also changed. 
      In May, Google Australia (<a href="../http://www.google.com.au/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com.au</a>) represented 51.21% 
      of search traffic, followed by Google USA (<a href="../http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com</a>) at 23.78%. By the end 
      of December this had changed. The origin of searches was now dominated by 
      Google USA (44.27%); Google Australia had fallen to 26.92%, and non-English 
      language Google searches had risen to direct a further 15.62% of traffic.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, in December, traffic from Google Australia was still dominated 
      by the search phrase “Powerhouse Museum”, making up 11.94 of 
      traffic, but on Google USA the same phrase is at the head of a very long 
      tail of different terms at just 1.22%.</p>
    <h2>Impact On Public Collection Enquiries</h2>
    <p>The increased interest in the Museum&#39;s collection has also translated 
      into a significant rise in public enquiries collected via emails, up from 
      266 in the 6 month period January-June 2006 to 670 for July to December 
      2006. The nature of these enquiries has changed, with an increase in requests 
      for valuations and identifications, as well as many  enquiries  providing 
      information about objects to assist the Museum in improving its collection 
      documentation. This has put increased pressure on scant curatorial and research 
      resources. Proportional to the collection visits, however, enquiries per 
      collection visit have actually decreased from 1 in 539.50 to 1 in 2310.29.    </p>
    <p>But the nature of enquiries has changed. Now, with considerably richer 
      collection information available on the Web site for a greater range of 
      objects, enquiries are often more detailed and require more research on 
      the part of curatorial staff. These enquiries can be as specific as locating 
      a highly specialised manufacturing code or serial number on the interior 
      of a piece of machinery, or the markings on a medal or coin – all 
      details of interest to collectors. Sometimes this information requires the 
      examination of the object out of storage, or retrieval from un-digitised 
      collection research files dating back many years. There are other instances, 
      for example in areas where specialist Museum staff have retired or no longer 
      work for the organisation, when the Museum is unable to offer assistance.</p>
    <p>The number of requests for valuations has also increased, largely as a 
      result of the popularity of private selling of antiques on eBay; the Museum 
      has had to clearly state on the Enquiry Form on the Web site that valuations 
      cannot be given.</p>
    <p>Occasionally, however, the exposure of these records, and their increased 
      searchability, especially through Google, has led to the Museum receiving 
      additional contextual information about objects, or corrections to research. 
      Sometimes this additional information comes from international experts, 
      collectors and researchers, but at other times, as was the case with a convict 
      love token, it comes through community members researching their family 
      histories – and simply searching for a series of family names in Google. 
      Whilst this kind of interest in the collection is extremely valuable to 
      the Museum, the time required to validate and check additional material 
      evidence can place strain on resources that are geared towards exhibition 
      production and other areas of research.</p>
    <h3>Serendipity and OPAC2.0</h3>
    <p>Serendipity is the art of chancing upon things, of making unexpected discoveries. 
      The design of an environment can be made so as to encourage or discourage 
      serendipity. In many areas of research, serendipity is a key factor in advancing 
      knowledge. When a visitor to a museum or library browses along shelves or 
      showcases, serendipity plays a considerable role in the &#39;user experience&#39; . 
      Even in highly specialised exhibitions and in fine-grained Dewey Decimal 
      System library bookshelf browsing, visitors inevitably come across objects 
      or publications that are of interest to them but that they were unaware 
      of prior to visiting. Whilst most on-line catalogue searches present users 
      with opportunities for serendipity on their search results pages, very few 
      do so at an object view level. With increasing percentages of visitors using 
      third party search applications such as Google to find deep content (Nordbotten, 
      2000), it is increasingly important to offer visitors opportunity for serendipity 
      at the object record level, to retain their attention and encourage them 
      to explore the Web site.</p>
    <p>The Powerhouse Museum&#39;s OPAC2.0 enhances serendipity in three key 
      ways: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> object and subject taxonomies </li>
      <li> augmented serendipity – user keywords or &#39;tags&#39;</li>
      <li> frictionless serendipity – user tracking.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Object And Subject Taxonomies</h3>
    <p>Object and subject taxonomies developed over the past 20 years for the 
      Museum&#39;s collection management system, are utilised to recommend related 
      objects to users on the basis of formal museum classification systems. This 
      allows users to be confident that an object classified as a chair is also 
      related to another object classified as a chair and belonging to the same 
      higher level category of &#39;furniture&#39; . More than 90% of objects 
      searchable through OPAC2.0 are classified in this way.</p>
    <h3>Augmented Serendipity – User Keywords</h3>
    <p>Tagging, or the ability to add user created keywords to data, has been 
      popularised over the past few years by Web sites such as Flickr (<a href="../http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com</a>) 
      with images and Delicious (<a href="../http://del.icio.us/" target="_blank">http://del.icio.us</a>) 
      with hyperlinks. Collected together, user tags form folksonomies, dynamic 
      community-created classification systems. Seeing the potential in this, 
      trials have begun using tagging in museum contexts, most notably in the 
      steve project (Trant, 2006) and with the Smithsonian Photography collection. 
      Each Web site that uses tagging does so in different ways and for different 
      purposes. Marlow, Naaman, Boyd &amp; Davis (2006) propose a useful framework 
      for understanding the different implementations of tagging and their use.    </p>
    <p>In the case of OPAC2.0 the use of user keywords to tag collection objects 
      has been conceived of as a means to achieve better resource discovery. In 
      this sense, &#39;augmented serendipity&#39; is provided by user added 
      keywords (or &#39;tags&#39; ) which allow the recommendation of related 
      objects by their classification by other users of the Web site. </p>
    <p>This type of serendipity is described as &#39;augmented&#39; because 
      it is explicitly provided by other users of the site and has the effect 
      of a publicly editable and dynamic thesaurus. These user keywords most often 
      are generally descriptive, allowing users to discover objects that are difficult 
      to discover through the Museum&#39;s formal classification systems.</p>
    <p>For example, a search for &#39;model train&#39; would usually neglect 
      to find objects formally classified as &#39;model locomotive&#39; . However, 
      as users have tagged several of these model locomotives as &#39;model 
      train,&#39; they are now discoverable using that search term. This sort 
      of tagging can be described as community synonym generation. Other objects 
      such as some of the Museum&#39;s numismatics and weapons collections have 
      been tagged using the specialist languages of coin and gun collectors, allowing 
      them to be discovered more easily by fellow collectors. Furthermore, these 
      tags can be spidered by search engines as pointers to object records, allowing 
      for their discovery and use outside of the OPAC2.0 site itself.</p>
    <p>A particularly memorable user keyword for a Sylvester the Cat soft toy 
      is &#39;puddy tat&#39; (<a href="../http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=11831" target="_blank">http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=11831</a>). 
      A museum&#39;s official collection system would be highly unlikely to 
      employ such a term; however, an Internet searcher can easily make the semantic 
      connection between this object and its user keyword.</p>
    <p>In total, 3,928 tags were submitted between June 14 and December 31, 2006. 
      Of these, 537 were deleted, edited for spelling, or removed by other users 
      and the system administrator. In the time period under study, 2,246 objects 
      were tagged with 3,391 tags (avg=1.51, sd=1.01, n=3391).</p>
    <p>OPAC2.0 offers only a basic instruction to users wishing to add keywords 
      to objects: “Tagging helps others locate this material more easily. 
      Please check your spelling. Use comma to separate multiple tags”. 
      Tags are immediately visible after being added, and any user can remove 
      tags, including those submitted by other users. Tags appear on the site 
      as hyperlinks and can be clicked to trigger a search for that user keyword.</p>
    <p><em>None of the most tagged objects are on public display within the Museum. 
      </em></p>
    <p>The most tagged object, a badge commemorating Lambton Bowling Club&#39;s 
      75th Anniversary (registration number 89/591), has been tagged 10 times 
      with a mix of aesthetic (kangaroo, marsupial, parrot, rosella), material 
      (enamel), descriptive (membership badges, bowling club, anniversary, badge) 
      and social (Australiana) terms. The formal object record for this badge 
      has two images but no statement of significance, no production or history 
      notes, and only a very basic one-line description and dimensions. In this 
      case, the user keywords offer alternative means to discover the object given 
      the lack of other object data.</p>
    <p>The two objects tagged with 9 user keywords each are equally sparse in 
      terms of their formal collection object records. A mantel clock dating from 
      1881 (registration number H8942) has a collection object record copied from 
      a paper stockbook entry dating from before the 1960s, a singular black and 
      white image, dimensions and the most bare of descriptive statements. It 
      has been tagged with keywords suggesting that the taggers hold additional 
      or updated aesthetic and material information about the object (Belgium, 
      black 1882, black, black face, gold face, lions head, rams head) and only 
      two descriptive tags (roman numerals, chime clock).</p>
    <p>The Flutina, forerunner of the accordion (registration number H3788), has 
      a sparse collection record but 4 images, descriptive text, and dimensions. 
      This object has useful descriptive tags (squeezebox, accordion, instrument, 
      decorative), social tags (music, play) and material tags (wood, mother of 
      pearl) provided by users.</p>
    <h3>Frictionless Serendipity – User Tracking</h3>
    <p>&#39;Frictionless serendipity&#39; is provided by user tracking; the aggregate 
      behaviour of visitors to the site is used to make further recommendations 
      based on actual behaviour. This is described as &#39;frictionless&#39; because the 
      visitor/user need do nothing other than navigate the site to lay trails 
      of &#39;intentional data&#39; for recommendations to occur. Aggregating this intentional 
      data allows for search term recommendations, building dynamic relationships 
      between terms, that reveal both aggregated synonyms and free associations. 
      Thus a searcher for &#39;minton&#39; currently gets suggestions for other searches 
      of &#39;mintons&#39; , &#39;bone china&#39; , &#39;british&#39; , &#39;porcelain&#39; and &#39;peacock&#39; , based 
      on the terms other searchers of the term &#39;minton&#39; have used and the objects 
      they have viewed.</p>
    <p>Frictionless serendipity also allows the site to distinguish between different 
      meanings of homonyms based on user behaviour. Thus a searcher of the term 
      &#39;cricket&#39; is offered other words associated with popular Australian 
      sports such as &#39;football&#39; and &#39;rugby&#39; , rather than 
      terms associated with &#39;cricket&#39; as a term for a grasshopper. 
      In simple terms, this is possible because at this time, the majority of 
      users who have searched for &#39;cricket&#39; have chosen to look at 
      sport-related objects which have also been looked at by other users searching 
      for &#39;football&#39; and &#39;rugby&#39; . These relationships 
      are dynamic and change over time.  If OPAC2.0 were to be implemented in 
      a natural history museum with a collection of grasshoppers, then the associated 
      homonyms would change.</p>
    <p>User tracking is currently processing 26,078 unique terms and relationships 
      derived from 2,811,540 successful onsite searches since June 2006. </p>
    <p>It should be reiterated here that OPAC2.0 only counts successful searches. 
      This is defined as a search that results in the viewing of an object record. 
      Searches that display no results or show a result listing but are not followed 
      by the selection and viewing of an object record are not counted. Google 
      searches are not included either. Term/object relationships are based on 
      an aggregate figure of user selections by search term. As search results 
      are displayed in an order generated by Microsoft Search which is used for 
      full-text indexing, these term/object relationships are biased by the Microsoft 
      search algorithm. </p>
    <h2>Top Onsite Searches</h2>
    <p class="Style1">Other than external entry to an OPAC object, users can search 
      the database directly by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> free text searching by typing, including the typing of user keywords 
        and subject keywords </li>
      <li> following a hyperlinked user keyword, or </li>
      <li> following a hyperlinked subject keyword. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of the 2,811,540 successful on site searches since June 2006, there were 
      :</p>
    <ul>
      <li> 1,262,269 (44.90%) free text searches </li>
      <li> 1,129,177 (40.16%) user tag searches, and</li>
      <li> 420,094 (14.94%) subject keyword searches. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>User keyword and subject searching require less user effort than a free 
      text search, and this may explain their popularity as navigation devices. 
      All three options are available at an object level.</p>
    <h2>Narratives Of Search</h2>
    <p>Anyone who watched the outcry over the release by AOL of semi-anonymous 
      data about their subscribers&#39; searches in 2006 knows the value of 
      search data (Hoover, 2006). Likewise, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft all use 
      information gathered from searches performed through their Web sites to 
      generate revenue through targeted advertising.</p>
    <p>With user tracking data it is possible to examine the different paths taken 
      by users for particular search terms and type of search. Whilst Doolan, 
      Peacock and Ellis (2004) are correct in their assertion that “keyword 
      search is often barely adequate as a way of finding information”, 
      when combined with an interface that allows for multiple pivot or exit points 
      as well as serendipitous discovery of closely and partially related content, 
      the user experience can move from one of dead-ends into one of many paths.</p>
    <p>Whilst individual Web users create their own, often highly personal &#39;search 
      narratives,&#39; when these are aggregated it is possible to observe usage 
      trends and patterns of behaviour. </p>

    <p>As expected, results are dominated by objects by designers well known both 
      locally, within Australia, and internationally. Generally one would expect 
      that search engine users will select results that appear towards the top 
      of a result listing, and that if presented with a choice between an item 
      with a thumbnail image preview over one without, the thumbnail will be chosen.</p>
    <p>However this is not the case, suggesting users are scanning results or 
      filtering them using other means. The highest placed object appears in 8<sup>th</sup> 
      position on a search, and one does not appear on the first page of results 
      at all. </p>
    <h2>Other Emerging Search Patterns</h2>
    <p>Fig 3.3 lists the most popular objects by view. The top 5 are dominated
       by those for whom external search engine traffic is the greatest source,
       and suggests a broad general audience arriving on the site with very diverse
       intentions. That three of the top five are evening dresses, none of which
       are on public display, might indicate their high ranking in Google for
      general  Web users looking to purchase such a garment on-line. The locomotive
      and  Catalina flying boat are iconic Powerhouse Museum objects and on permanent
       display.</p>

    <h2>Search Narratives Case Study : Lisa Ho Dress Worn By Delta Goodrem</h2>
    <p class="caption"><img src="chan.fig4.1.jpg" alt="Fig. 4.1 Dress designed by Lisa Ho, worn by Delta Goodrem. Collection: Powerhouse Museum, Sydney. Photographer: Jean-François Lanzarone, Powerhouse Museum." width="400" height="379"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig. 4.1 Dress designed by Lisa Ho, worn by Delta Goodrem. 
      Collection: Powerhouse Museum, Sydney. Photographer: Jean-François Lanzarone, 
      Powerhouse Museum.</p>
    <p>The most viewed object, a dress designed by Lisa Ho and worn by Australian 
      pop star and celebrity Delta Goodrem (registration number 2005/1/1), is 
      almost twice as popular (11,142 views) as the next most viewed object, an 
      evening dress designed by Melbourne designer Jenny Bannister (6,248 views). 
      Of these 11,142 views, only 1,124 (10.09%) have been the result of searches 
      within OPAC, with the remainder of traffic coming from external Web links 
      and Google searches. </p>
    <p>The Delta Goodrem dress was collected by the Museum as an example of contemporary 
      fashion and in particular the influence of &#39;celebrity&#39; on style, 
      and thus it is entirely appropriate that this object be discovered by users 
      searching in Google or linked from Goodrem fan sites. It also has a relatively 
      complete object record with three available zoomable images (including one 
      of Delta Goodrem wearing the dress), a full statement of significance, object 
      description, production notes and history notes (totalling 865 words) written 
      by curator Glynis Jones. The object has never been on public display. However, 
      this is not the whole story.</p>
    <p>This object has had many user keywords attached to it - the names of other 
      celebrities (Nelly Furtado, Nicole Kidman, and &#39;Fiona Biggest Loser&#39; which has been subsequently deleted by another user) who we might assume 
      may have worn a similar or the same garment. Amongst the keywords is &#39;tennis&#39; which is possibly associated with this object as a result of Goodrem&#39;s 
      former relationship with Australian tennis player Mark Philippoussis. &#39;Delta 
      Goodrem&#39; also has been added as a user keyword. It also has four subject 
      keywords attached to it - &#39;Australian Music Awards&#39; , &#39;Australian 
      music&#39; , &#39;Australian Television Personalities&#39; and &#39;The 
      Powerhouse Museum Sydney Morning Herald Fashion of the Year&#39; .</p>

    <p class="caption">Fig 4.2 Most frequently search terms for object 2005/1/1

      (Lisa Ho dress worn by Delta Goodrem)</p>
    <p>Four of the top ten searches for this object are user keywords, representing 
      a total of 377 (33.54%) searches. The remainder are words or phrases that 
      feature prominently in the object description and text.</p>
    <p>In the case of the Delta Goodrem dress, user keywords operate as an important 
      way to discover the object once users are already on the site. However, 
      the majority of traffic to this object is from Google searching and external 
      links. Whilst it is not currently possible to break down these external 
      referrals in specific detail, the search terms &#39;dress&#39; and &#39;dresses&#39; represent over 40,000 external search referrals to the Museum&#39;s Web 
      site; &#39;delta&#39; and &#39;goodrem&#39; are not represented 
      in the top 200 referrals from June 2006 to December 2006.</p>
    <p>The tagging of this object is an example of a community of users, in this 
      case, likely Delta Goodrem fans, using the tagging facility as a means of 
      adding associated information to the object record, and in so doing making 
      it more discoverable. Within the Delta Goodrem community it would appear 
      from looking at fan sites and forums that information on this particular 
      dress is highly sought after – and that the Powerhouse Museum is the 
      known holder of this information.</p>

    <p>Examining the object most searched for using free text search, a 1923 Carnival 
      glass bowl (2004/36/1 Bowls &amp; compotes, (15), &#39;Carnival&#39; ), a different 
      user profile emerges. </p>
    <p>The bowl has a long collection record of 1,423 words with detailed statement 
      of significance, history notes, production notes and description. It has 
      been tagged with three user keywords (candle holders, carnival glass, piping) 
      and is associated with three subject areas (Australian flora and fauna in 
      applied art, Glass manufacture, Australian commercial glass).</p>
    <p>This bowl has been searched for 1733 (85.24%) times out of 2033 views, 
      indicating a much greater proportion of site-specific traffic and a comparatively 
      low interest level externally through Google or external site linkages. 
      Of these searches, 1238 (71.43%) were free text, the remainder from user

    <p class="caption">Table 5.2 Most frequently search terms for object 2004/36/1 
      (1923 Carnival glass bowl)</p>
    <p>This object is typical of an object whose interest is currently confined 
      to a niche or specialist audience, and, it seems, one accustomed to visiting 
      a museum Web site and collection database with the intention of searching.</p>
    <p>The top search terms are heavily weighted towards one term: glassware, 
      with other additional thematic and subject terms featuring prominently (Carnival 
      glass, Glass manufacture, Australian commercial glass). These are normal 
      terms for subject specialists, researchers, and those who traditionally 
      would be expected to use a collection search facility on a museum Web site. 
      Strangely the search term &#39;interesting&#39; also scores highly, 
      perhaps indicating that other audiences are also discovering this object 
      in their own ways.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion And Further Research</h2>
    <p>The Powerhouse Museum&#39;s OPAC2.0 project demonstrates the importance 
      of museums making their collections accessible through major search engines. 
      It also demonstrates the possibilities for audience research and improved 
      navigation of collections through the detailed recording and analysis of 
      user traffic and behaviour data beyond traditional logfile data. User tagging 
      and folksonomies can be used to improve navigation and discoverability but 
      work most effectively when matched with detailed collection records and 
      balanced with the structural benefits of formal taxonomies. When combined 
      with these features, search tracking can provide a means to improve serendipitous 
      discovery and enhance the ability of users to find related objects and explore 
      deeper into a collection. </p>
    <p>However this raises many new questions.</p>
    <p>Significant further research is required into the specifics of how users 
      search museum collections and the impact of information architecture and 
      visual design on their behaviour. Comparisons with projects such as Steve.museum 
      and their open data sharing models offer much in this regard. This research 
      needs to be matched against other research examining the influence of Google 
      and other large search engines on museum collections.</p>
    <p>The Powerhouse Museum hopes to continue to work and share data with other 
      organisations and researchers to assist in the development of shared data 
      about how museum users search and discover in these vast collections, and 
      how, in some instances new audiences and traditional museum audiences might 
      use these collections to create meaning.</p>
