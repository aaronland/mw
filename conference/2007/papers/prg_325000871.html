      <p class="abstract">This case study discusses the processes and best practices
        for enabling community contributions to Web products. We compare community
        involvement in the National Archives of England and Wales (TNA) migration
        Web site Moving Here: 200 Years of Migration to England to Library
        and Archives Canada&#39;s immigration Web site Moving Here, Staying Here:
        The Canadian Immigrant Experience. TNA worked directly with different
        communities, whereas Library and Archives Canada worked indirectly with
        them, via genealogy centers, historical societies and subject experts,
        to develop similar Web sites on common subjects. What was involved, what
        could we have done differently? These are but a few of the questions
        we aim to answer. </p>

    <h2>Introduction </h2>
    <p>With the interest surrounding Web 2.0 and community involvement in museum,
      library and archives Web products, we hope, with this presentation, to
      bring some attention back to the essential requirements of this new trend.
      Community involvement on the Web is unmistakably on the cutting edge, as
      you will see with the example of the Moving Here project. But it
      may not be suited to every historical Web site. When deciding how to utilize
      community involvement, influencing factors should include the purpose of
      the product, availability of people and Web resources, and managing the
      expectations of users and contributors. This presentation will demonstrate
      how two Web sites with comparable subjects (and similar titles!) chose
      to incorporate community contributions. </p>
    <h2>The Background of Moving Here, Staying Here and Moving Here Web
      Sites </h2>
    <h3>Moving Here, Staying Here: the Canadian Immigrant Experience </h3>
    <p>In 2006, Library and Archives Canada (LAC) launched a flagship Web exhibition
      and mass digitization project entitled Moving Here, Staying Here: the
      Canadian Immigrant Experience. Funded by the Department of Canadian
      Heritage through its Canadian Culture On-line initiative, the project tells
      the exciting story of immigration to Canada from the early 19th century
      to the outbreak of the Second World War through documents held at LAC.
      Visitors to the site not only learn the trials of immigration through first-hand
      narratives, original manuscripts, publications and visual material, but
      also are encouraged to discover their own families&#39; histories through the
      databases of digitized documents such as passenger lists and land patents. </p>

    <h2>Moving Here: 200 Years of Migration to England</h2>
    <p>Using archives and objects, Moving Here (http://www.movinghere.org.uk)
      is a site that explores, records and illustrates the story of migration
      to England. It provides free access to on-line material such as photos
      and passenger lists. The site is led by The National Archives of England
      and Wales (TNA), and has partnerships with over 35 archives, museums and
      libraries and 45 community groups providing content for the site. The partnership
      has created a single point of access to digitized content about migration
      history to the UK. The content is being used to empower minority ethnic
      groups and communities to record their own history and enrich archives,
      museums and libraries around England. </p>

    <p class="caption">Fig 2: Landing page from Moving Here (http://www.movinghere.org.uk)</p>
    <p>Moving Here was conceived by The Public Records Office (now TNA)
      in 2001, and launched on-line in 2003. It was funded by The Big Lottery,
      a state-run funding scheme for heritage, culture and capital projects.
      The site had a limited focus on four migrant community groups: Jewish,
      Caribbean, South Asian, and Irish. When the site launched, it consisted
      of several sections, mainly of interest to the family history user. These
      included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Migration Histories: historical background on migration to the
        UK written by academic advisors </li>
      <li>Tracing Your Roots: tips for researching family history for
        users with a history of migration </li>
      <li>The Catalogue: over 200,000 digitised and searchable items from
        30 English archive, museum and library collections relating to migration
        history </li>
      <li>Stories: an opportunity for individuals to share their own story,
        using items from our catalogue or adding their own photos </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Objectives and Goals </h2>
    <p>In 2004, the National Archives of Canada and the National Library of Canada
      originally defined four separate projects about immigration to Canada:
      two projects highlighting the journey to Canada, a project telling the
      story of early life in Canada, and a project interpreting immigrants&#39; accounts.
      With the merging of the two federal institutions and the creation of the
      new Library and Archives Canada, these projects were transformed into one
      ambitious project entitled Moving Here, Staying Here: the Canadian Immigrant
      Experience. This Web site was developed with three key goals in mind.
      The first was to facilitate improved access for genealogists and other
      researchers to some of LAC&#39;s frequently used immigration and genealogy
      documents. The second was to provide Canadians with a unique history of
      Canadian immigration for the years 1800-1939. The third was to give immigrants
      a voice by digitizing and making available diaries and memoirs of early
      immigrants who settled in Canada. </p>
    <p>As ambitious as the scope of this project was, it quickly became obvious
      that the subject was too vast and the interpretive possibilities too numerous.
      The project team recognized early on that the site could not cover all
      topics, eras or collections of interest to those attracted to immigration
      history. Also, given the large number of very good sites on the history
      of Canadian immigration, what unique strategy would LAC employ to complement
      existing resources? </p>
    <p>After thorough investigation, the team decided on the following objectives.
      First, in response to client needs, it decided to focus on digitizing one
      of LAC&#39;s most frequently used collections, the Passenger Lists, and to
      make it available on-line.. The Passenger Lists would be complemented by
      an on-line selection of immigrant diaries and photographs, and would provide
      the foundation for a wide-ranging, researcher-oriented section entitled <b>Find
      an Immigrant</b>, which incorporated an
      expanded Western Land Grants database, new databases of Lower Canada Land
      Petitions, and The Port of New Westminster Registers of Chinese Immigration,
      with explanatory texts on how to use these records. </p>
    
    <p>To complement these digital holdings, the team decided to organize a virtual
      exhibition that reflected the strengths and uniqueness of LAC&#39;s collection
      and LAC&#39;s role as the official national government repository. Focusing
      on government legislation that affected immigration to Canada also gave
      the team a starting period – the nineteenth century, when the first
      Passenger Acts were introduced in Britain. Although the decision to conclude
      in the 1930s was defined by modern copyright laws, the team recognized
      that, to do justice to the topic, a relatively narrow timeframe was required. </p>
    <p>Like LAC&#39;s Moving Here, Staying Here, TNA&#39;s Moving Here was
      originally conceived as a digitization project. Thirty project partners
      digitized 200,000 items of interest to those with an interest in migration
      history. After its launch, TNA and its partners worked to identify the
      best way forward to develop the site and engage new users with the museums,
      libraries and archives sector. Evaluation of the site, involving both users
      and non-users, indicated that the Stories section and the Search
      function features were the most valuable and significant innovations
      that the Web site offered. Feedback from evaluation told us that users
      and non-users wanted to see more migrant communities represented on the
      site and to see the site used in schools. </p>
    <p>TNA coordinated the development of a project with old and new museum,
      library and archive partners to meet these objectives. In 2004, a successful
      bid to The Heritage Lottery Fund launched a new partnership with 10 museum
      and archive partners to develop a new project focused on outreach and education.
      Our aims for this phase of the project were: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>to overcome barriers to the direct involvement of minority ethnic groups
        in recording and documenting their own history of migration </li>
      <li>to ensure that this history is passed on to the next generation through
        the schools. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The project consortium identified that working with different minority
      ethnic groups around England was crucial to ensure that voices of diverse
      migrants were heard. Our goal was to empower users to share their migration
      story. Moving Here, as a Web site, did not have the necessary contacts
      with individuals and community groups to do this alone. Initially the museum,
      library and archive sector was approached. They crucially had the contacts,
      established relationships, capacity and experience. Five main museums worked
      with us to develop the Schools site. Five main museums worked with us to
      develop the community outreach programming and Stories site development.
      In this paper, I will be focusing on the Stories site development. </p>
    <p>When the project was developed, museums had established relationships
      with community groups. Libraries came on board as service providers. Many
      have specially dedicated computer suites where participants can access
      the Web site. This People&#39;s Network was established by the Museums, Libraries
      and Archives Council in the UK. Archives are playing a crucial role. Most
      material produced by participants will be accessioned by local archives
      and kept for permanent preservation in the community. </p>
    <h2>Different Approaches </h2>
    <p>Both Moving Here and Moving Here, Staying Here strive to
      document and tell the story of migration to England and Canada respectively.
      Both aim to give a voice to individuals and provide an opportunity for
      immigration history to be explored on-line. Using different approaches,
      this has been achieved through community engagement. </p>
    <h3>Approach 1: Using Collections On-Line: Moving Here, Staying Here </h3>
    <p>When the project&#39;s managers, content experts and client services specialists
      (representing the genealogy community) began to create a detailed scenario
      for this site, they were forced to develop strategies that answered a number
      of difficult questions: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the best way to organize a manageable history of immigration
        in a nation built largely, but not solely, by immigrants? Was it by ethnic
        group, or chronologically, or thematically? </li>
      <li>When drawing on a vast national collection, what is the best way to
        select the stories and documents while providing multiple points of view
        on various topics in Canadian immigration history? </li>
      <li>Who should be involved in the development of this content? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>With the timeline set, a content strategy could be developed. In the end,
      the team decided not to shy away from Canada&#39;s controversial past with
      respect to immigration policies, and a critical curatorial approach was
      adopted. Due to the historical nature of the project and its focus on records,
      direct community contribution as used in Moving Here, or interactive
      strategies such as a wiki or message board, were not pursued. Instead,
      experts from LAC and from various universities and historical societies
      across the country were challenged to write on pre-selected themes that
      reflected key events, periods or legislative decisions in the nation&#39;s
      immigration history. They were also asked to illustrate each contribution
      with a selection of key documents from LAC&#39;s collection. </p>
    <p>Going one step further, the team also asked the experts to complement
      every theme with sections that reflected the impact these directives had
      on people, including the debates they fueled among the Canadian public
      and how immigrants&#39; experiences were affected by them. Newspaper articles,
      House of Commons debates, photographs, diary pages and letters were all
      used to illustrate this personal perspective. This strategy helped ensure
      the development of a more complete, compelling and human history, while
      providing users with much needed context to a more diverse sampling of
      LAC&#39;s rich collection. This content appears in the section entitled Traces
      of the Past. </p>
    <p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.collectionscanada.ca/immigrants/021017-2000-e.html" target="_blank"><img src="alain-fig3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="400" height="510" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 3: The introduction page of the Traces of the Past
      section from Moving Here, Staying Here (<a href="../http://www.collectionscanada.ca/immigrants/021017-2000-e.html" target="_blank">http://www.collectionscanada.ca/immigrants/021017-2000-e.html</a>)</p>
    <p>Finally, the experts suggested continuing to focus on LAC documents by
      offering, in a section called The Documentary Trail, additional
      information on the variety of documents used during the Canadian immigration
      process. From advertisements that encouraged immigrants to make a new life
      in a new land, to the land grants that were offered to them upon their
      arrival, these records created a trail that followed immigrants throughout
      their tumultuous voyage. </p>
    <h3>Approach 2: Giving A Voice, Sharing Knowledge: Moving Here </h3>
    <p>Moving Here collections have been used as stimuli to engage new,
      non-users to interact with our site and share their stories, their own
      unique experiences of migration. As a partnership, hundreds of targeted
      events and training opportunities were organised around England, engaging
      with both recent and long-term migrants. </p>
    <p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.movinghere.org.uk/stories/story72/story72.htm" target="_blank"><img src="alain-fig4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="400" height="225" border="0"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 4: Memories from the Islands – Sugar Cane (<a href="../http://www.movinghere.org.uk/stories/story72/story72.htm" target="_blank">http://www.movinghere.org.uk/stories/story72/story72.htm</a>) </p>
    <p>This story from the Moving Here stories site shows how a participant
      has responded to a photo in our collection about Sugar Cane in Jamaica,
      breathing life into the archive by adding memories about using and enjoying
      sugar cane. </p>
    <p>Moving Here identified a number of barriers to participants sharing
      their stories. These included lack of computer skills,  English language
      skills and  recording skills. Using Moving Here as a stimulus,
      our partners created programmes to address these barriers. Crucially, a
      large collection of on-line material was digitised before we began to ask
      for community contributions. After that foundation was built, the content
      began to engage users in an interactive experience. An example of this
      outreach is the computer training sessions that were conducted in Boston
      Library in Lincolnshire. In the last five years, some rural communities
      in Lincolnshire, England, have seen a large influx of migrants from Portugal. Moving
      Here has been working with Lincolnshire museums and libraries to engage
      with these new migrants. In the town of Boston, it is estimated that up
      to 5,000 of the 55,000 residents are from Portugal. The arrival of many
      migrant workers from Portugal has been a recent phenomenon, occurring in
      the last few years. In consultation with the community, the museum and
      library developed a programme of computer literacy training that used the Moving
      Here Web site. Participants were made of aware of the training at local
      factories. Training was scheduled around factory working hours and delivered
      at Boston Library. Participants learned basic computer skills using the Moving
      Here Web site. The end aim was for participants to tell their stories
      of migration on the Moving Here Web site. Many did. These stories
      are now live on the Web site and will be permanently preserved by Lincolnshire
      Archives. The result of using this model and conducting skills training
      was that participants were then able to create their own records. </p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="alain-fig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="400" height="300"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 5: Computer literacy training, Boston Library, Lincolnshire </p>
    <p>The sessions were oversubscribed, and participants have requested that
      more be run. Participants were happy to use Moving Here because
      they found material on the site that was personally relevant to them. Further,
      they were empowered by being able to add their own stories of migration
      for preservation in their local archive. </p>
    <p>Moving Here encourages users to share their stories in a format
      that they feel comfortable with. Participants in our current outreach projects
      have contributed original works of poetry, art and stories. They have submitted
      photos, digitised photos of objects, original films and audio recordings. </p>
    <p>Half of the contributions on our site come from Internet surfers. Half
      are generated by specific, targeted outreach projects, such as the ICT
      training sessions I have just described. At this time, audio and video
      cannot be uploaded instantly, but photos and words can be submitted and
      appear on the site within 10 days. </p>
    <p>Example of stories that you can find at <a href="../http://www.movinghere.org.uk/stories">http://www.movinghere.org.uk/stories</a>include
      items such as this poem, England&#39;s Cold, composed for the Moving
      Here site by Denniston Stewart, a member of the Writers without Borders
      group in Birmingham: </p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"><b>England&#39;s cold </b><br/>
      Oh boy, England is cold! <br/>
      It is so cold! <br/>
      Frost in the morning, snow at midday and black fog at <br/>
      night time. England is so cold! <br/>
      I left hot Jamaica to die of cold here? <br/>
      Frostbite is killing my fingers and when I walk I slip <br/>
      and tumble in the snow many many times, <br/>
      inside the house it is worse, <br/>
      I have to wrap up with hot water bottles, hat, socks, <br/>
      dressing gown, two sheets and twist and turn all night <br/>
      long. In the morning when I lift my head from under <br/>
      the sheets the amount of smoke that come out my mouth <br/>
      you would think that I was on fire. <br/>
      In the kitchen four people have one ring each on the <br/>
      stove to cook on. I have to put money in the meter to <br/>
      get a bath and the Indian man who I rent from is <br/>
      watching me closely. I thank God that they deliver <br/>
      milk to your door, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to cope <br/>
      because England is cold cold cold. </p>
    <p>Many participants wish to describe their journeys from their native country
      to England. Wolverhampton Museum and people with a history of migration
      in an area of Wolverhampton called Whitmore Reans came together to record
      migration stories for the Moving Here Web site. In this excerpt
      a recent immigrant from Iraq tells about his journey to England. </p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">The traffickers placed me in a lorry, hidden
      between large boxes and crates. I was not allowed to carry any food or
      water, so that the lorries did not have to make any stops. There were strict
      instructions that we could not talk. After a few days of travelling, the
      lorry stopped. The driver simply told us to get out of the lorry. It was
      cold and raining, I only had clothes appropriate for Mediterranean climate,
      a thin shirt and polyester slacks. It was raining and it was freezing.
      There were not many people around and the ones I tried to talk to, they
      could not understand what we were saying. Eventually we were arrested and
      taken to a police station. I arrived in Wolverhampton on 12th
      October 1999.</p>
    
    <h2>Next time around: Community Engagement In The Future </h2>
    <p>Like most on-line initiatives, both projects encountered a number of challenges.
      For Moving Here, Staying Here, the most important challenge was
      finding diverse immigrant voices. Historical context and focus on original
      narratives expressed in the documentary heritage collections at LAC ensured
      that the voices and experiences of Canada&#39;s immigrant communities defined
      the content and character of this project. However, most diaries and letters
      preserved in LAC&#39;s collection are written by immigrants from the British
      Isles or France. These are decisive points of origin for many Canadians,
      but they are not entirely representative of Canada&#39;s population. In addition,
      a large number of photographs of immigrants in LAC&#39;s collection were taken
      by photographers working for the Department of the Interior who neglected
      to identify the subjects of their photos. If the project team were to build
      this immigration Web site again, these factors alone would be compelling
      reasons to develop a community contribution component. </p>
    <p>A community contribution component could compensate for gaps in documentation
      in LAC&#39;s collection. Not only would the presence of a message board or
      similar feature encourage new acquisitions and potential donations of historical
      sources, but it would also provide a space where descendants of immigrants
      could share their family&#39;s stories and experiences of immigration to Canada. </p>
    <p>Two recent LAC Web projects provide models for incorporating community
      involvement. </p>
    <h3>Project Naming </h3>
    <p>The goal of Project Naming is the identification of Inuit portrayed
      in some of the photographic collections of Library and Archives Canada.
      It is an ongoing initiative, which enables Nunavut youth to connect with
      Elders and to better understand their past. It also helps to bridge the
      cultural differences and geographical distances between Nunavut and the
      more southern parts of Canada. As participants identify subjects in the
      LAC photos, the identities are recorded in the Web site on a &#34;Naming
      Continues&#34; form which visitors email to LAC. This information is made
      into captions and then added to the records in the database. </p>
    <p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.collectionscanada.ca/inuit/054309-e.html" target="_blank"><img src="alain-fig6.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="400" height="815" border="0"/></a></p>

    <h3>Faces of War </h3>
    <p>This virtual exhibition features photographs of men and women who served
      in the Canadian Forces during the Second World War. The photographs, taken
      from the Department of National Defence (DND) collection at LAC, depict
      every aspect of military life during the Second World War. Visitors to
      the site can search a database of almost 2,500 images from the DND collection,
      or they can browse small galleries of images representing each branch of
      the Canadian Forces. An interactive component allows visitors to add comments
      to a particular photograph from a link present in the description. The
      intent is to encourage visitors to share their memories of the Second World
      War and to add any further information they might have about the photograph.</p>

    <p>Similar interactive options would have given the Find an Immigrant section
      of Moving Here, Staying Here a whole new meaning by enabling users
      to share their knowledge and actively contribute to item level descriptions.
      That said, the site does include a comments link, where visitors can ask
      questions or provide us with any information they may have on archival
      material. </p>
    <p>Even in the absence of a fully-developed community contribution component,
      the site&#39;s curatorial and interpretive approach has attracted positive
      feedback. Moving Here, Staying Here helped fill a void of interpretive
      and contextual information about government policy, legislation and administrative
      documentation relating to immigration. One of the users said:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">This tool provides an extremely well-organized
      and informative overview of the complex history of Canadian immigration
      policy and practice. As such, it provides our users with the context that
      they need in order to understand the records they find in the LAC collection.</p>
    <p>Moving Here was successful in its aims to breakdown barriers to
      the direct involvement of minority ethnic groups in recording their own
      stories. Getting participant &#39;buy-in&#39; was important from the start, and
      this was achieved through providing activities, training and opportunities
      that suited the needs and interests of the targets non-users. The project
      team set out to collect 400 new stories – that number has been surpassed.
      Our aim was to engage people in training and encourage participants to
      become new museum and on-line users. Over 500 people took up the opportunity
      and attended sessions. Over 1000 new people were introduced to museums,
      libraries and archives and the Moving Here Web site. Many have indicated
      that they will use the service, or the Moving Here Web site, in
      the future. </p>
    <p>Moving Here faced a number of challenges. The site exists as a
      &#39;niche&#39; site
      – it is not directly linked to archive or museum catalogues. This
      means that the knowledge that users have contributed needs to be directly
      sought out by users. The project was very resource intensive. Significant
      people and financial resources were spent on community consultation with
      over 20 community groups, programme development and delivery with 20 museums,
      libraries and archives, and Web site development with two Web development
      companies. </p>
    <p>Participants were sometimes disappointed that the material they produced
      for the site would not be visible for up to 6 months, as parts of the Web
      site were being built at the same time as active programming and outreach
      to collect stories in the communities. Also, when the project was conceived,
      it was the vision to launch all the material at once, rather than as the
      public contributed it. Recommendations for the future include the instant
      sharing of stories. </p>
    <p>The National Archives has developed a new Web site called Your Archives
      (<a href="../http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/" target="_blank">http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk</a>),
      where participants can contribute their knowledge about our collections
      instantly. </p>

    <p class="caption">Fig 8. Your Archives Homepage: using wiki technology to

      contribution to knowledge about archive collections<br/>
      (<a href="../http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/" target="_blank">http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk</a>)</p>
    <p>Your Archives is based on wiki technology which allows users to
      edit and create pages directly from their browser. We hope in the future
      to use Your Archives as an opportunity to link the knowledge people
      have shared about Moving Here&#39;s collection to this new social networking
      site. Your Archives provides for the first time a two-way conversation
      between users and TNA to develop more comprehensive knowledge about collections.
      It is an exciting project that may provide a key to revealing how users
      can work side by side with curators and archivists in the development of
      our knowledge about collections, history, and its interpretation. </p>
    <h2>Conclusion </h2>
    <p>We have compared how these two Web sites, dedicated to immigration history,
      have given a voice to previously silent communities. Both Web sites have
      provided on-line access to material that has not been available on-line
      before, allowing those with a history of migration to explore their heritage. Moving
      Here, Staying Here and Moving Here have shown that in order
      to enable community involvement, content and curatorial expertise in building
      a solid foundation of digitised archives is crucial. Both projects have
      spent significant time building sustainable relationships with community
      members in order to ensure that their contributions are recognized and
      relationships are preserved. Moving Here has shown that in order
      to break down barriers to the direct involvement of minority ethnic groups
      in sharing their history on-line, specialized and appropriate training
      must be provided. Both projects wish to embrace social networking in future
      to give users a higher profile voice to enable their knowledge to be passed
      down to the next generation. </p>
