    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The Museum of the Moving Image and software developer Whirl-i-Gig recently
      developed and implemented Web-based museum collections management and presentation
      software called<em> OpenCollection</em>. The development of <em>OpenCollection </em>was
      paid for with funds and resources from the Museum&#39;s operating budget and
      with a 2004 grant from the Institute for Museum and Library Services. In
      addition to realizing expected benefits from the implementation and use
      of this software, there have also been several unexpected benefits, as
      well as some unforeseen challenges.  </p>
    <p>Though made for the Museum&#39;s use, OpenCollection has always been
      envisioned as software that could be shared with other institutions via
      an open source model. In 2007, the source code was put on-line. However,
      for the software to truly be of use to the Museum community, and not just
      to those with large technical staffs and an itch for do-it-yourself software,
      more needs to be done. Moving Image and Whirl-i-Gig are now engaged in
      activities, and exploring various models, to ensure the future sustainability,
      integrity, and utility of OpenCollection.</p>
    <p>Additionally, as a result of this project, we believe that thin-client,
      Web-based collections software can forge dynamic, multi-directional links
      between museum collection functions, normally focused internally (back
      office), and Website functions, normally focused externally (front office).
      This has implications for how the Web is utilized within the Museum enterprise.
      It also suggests that changes to museums&#39; organizational structures are
      necessary in order to take full advantage of an expected emerging class
      of Web-based museum software applications.</p>
    <h1>About the Museum &amp; Whirl-i-Gig </h1>
    <p>The mission of the Museum of the Moving Image is to advance public understanding
      and appreciation of the art, history, technique and technology of film,
      television, and digital media. It does so by collecting, preserving, and
      providing access to moving-image related artifacts; screening significant
      films and other moving-image works; presenting exhibitions of artifacts,
      artworks, and interactive experiences; and offering educational and interpretive
      programs to students, teachers, and the general public.</p>
    <p>The Museum is located in Astoria, Queens, on the site of the Astoria Studios,
      one of the largest motion picture and television production facilities
      in the United States. Currently, the Museum maintains a collection of over
      125,000 moving image artifacts, one of the largest and most important such
      collections in the world. The collections include artifacts from every
      stage of producing, promoting, and exhibiting motion pictures, television,
      and digital media, including exceptional holdings in television sets, licensed
      merchandise, rare photographs, and video games. The Museum is characterized
      as mid-sized, with approximately 40 full-time employees. During the development
      of OpenCollection, the Museum had one part-time IT/MIS consultant,
      Remy Ching, and one Assistant Curator of Digital Media, Tim Schwartz, who
      is also the Museum’s Webmaster.   </p>
    <p>Founded in New York in 1995, Whirl-i-Gig is a two-person software development
      firm specializing in software applications for museums, archives and biological
      research and conservation. Since its inception, Whirl-i-Gig has developed
      a succession of Web-based collections management and dissemination applications,
      of which OpenCollection is the latest and most advanced. </p>
    <h1>How OpenCollection Happened</h1>
    <p>A 2002 grant from the New York State Council for the Arts (NYSCA) was
      used to establish a plan to create a collection database and make the information
      available online. Moving Image originally planned to use a standard, off-the-shelf
      collections management software package. Towards that end, the Museum conducted
      a comprehensive software review, in order to determine which of ten software
      packages was the best option for the Museum. After a thorough review, it
      was determined that no available product met the museum’s functional
      requirements. Further, the applications reviewed were expensive and encumbered
      with restrictive licensing. Their closed source nature meant that all but
      the most superficial customization was impossible, and many packages were
      designed in ways that made migration or sharing of collections data costly
      and difficult. The Museum decided to utilize Microsoft Access as an interim
      collection database. </p>
    <p>At the same time, the Museum hired Whirl-i-Gig to study the possibility
      of devising a custom, Web-based application to present collection information
      online. In addition to off-the-shelf Museum collection software, we had
      seen and been intrigued by the possibilities of Whirl-i-Gig&#39;s prior Web-based
      database work for the American Museum of Natural History and the Cooper
      Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.   Existing digital
      asset management programs, rather than museum-specific collections management
      packages, were an additional source of inspiration. Whirl-i-Gig recommended
      building a single Web-based system, built especially for the purpose of
      Museum collection management and cataloging and based upon a foundation
      of code that had been successfully employed in previous projects. </p>
    <p>In 2004, the Museum of the Moving Image received a two-year grant from
      the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) to develop OpenCollection, using a
      test bed of 700 items from its collection.   At that time, the
      bulk of the Museum&#39;s collection documentation was captured primarily in
      paper accession files, and in the Access database developed in 2002. The
      complex nature of moving image-related materials meant that not only did
      the new collections management system need to support the description of
      a vast range of artifacts, but it also needed to capture the relationship
      of these objects to various people, corporations, and productions.</p>
    <h1>Development – Cataloging Interface</h1>
    <p>A basic version of the design for the Moving Image cataloging interface
      of OpenCollection was included in the 2004 grant proposal to the
      IMLS. This design included a field-by-field description of the cataloging
      module of the database, along with specifications for separate databases
      to hold authority records for people, corporate bodies, and productions.
      The database design was based on the Visual Resources Association&#39;s (VRA)
      Core set of metadata elements (3.0), and required, among other things,
      separate records for objects and their digital surrogates.</p>
    <p>During the grant period, OpenCollection moved from a list of
      specifications on paper and smaller modules already created by Whirl-i-Gig
      to a working collections management model. Early versions of the software
      were created and tested by the collections staff at the Museum, with updates
      to the software made on a weekly basis.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the project, much of the data that the curatorial
      and collections staff was working with was housed in the Museum&#39;s temporary
      Access database. Once enough of the cataloging interface was completed,
      the Museum was able to migrate the 20,000+ records in its Access database
      to OpenCollection, where they could be updated to conform to the
      Museum&#39;s new standards of description. </p>
    <p>The first large-scale test of the software came in the summer of 2005,
      when the Museum hired four full-time graduate level interns as catalogers.
      The interns possessed backgrounds in both library sciences and the humanities,
      and assisted with not only artifact cataloging, but also in the continued
      refinement of the software. This included streamlining the addition of
      records with tombstone-level information, and the ability to duplicate
      catalog records of similar objects.</p>
    <p>Since the summer of 2005, OpenCollection has been the sole collections
      management system in use at the Museum of the Moving Image. Not only the
      collections department, but also curatorial, exhibitions, development,
      and public relations staff use it. A rudimentary public front end was made
      available in August 2006, and has since been upgraded to the version now
      online at http://collection.movingimage.us.</p>
    <h1>About OpenCollection</h1>
    <p>OpenCollection is a general-purpose system designed to be applicable
      to a wide variety of collection types. Key features include:           </p>
    <h2>A completely Web-based user interface</h2>
    <p>All access
      to OpenCollection is via a Web browser-based user interface. No
      other software is required. Thus any operating system that can run a modern
      Web browser is supported, including Mac OS X, Windows 2000/2003/XP, Linux,
      the various BSD OS’s and Solaris. The lack of specialized software
      and hardware requirements — virtually any internet-capable computer
      will do — makes remote access for both data entry and search simple.</p>
    <h2>Configurable type-specific metadata system </h2>
    <p>In addition to the
      standard set of OpenCollection fields representing concepts applicable
      to anything that can be catalogued — things like &#34;accession
      number&#34; — sets of custom fields may be defined. These sets can
      map to established metadata standards such as Dublin Core, Darwin Core,
      VRA Core 3.0, CDWA Lite, etc. Custom fields may be type-specific: they
      can be defined such that they are only available for specific types of
      catalogued items (ex. photographs, video tapes, films). They may also be
      repeating, and it is possible to impose controls on input formats.</p>
    <h2>Support for a wide variety of digital media types</h2>
    <p>OpenCollection understands
      and can process, convert, and display digital media files in many formats,
      including: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Imagery: JPEG, JPEG-2000, GIF, PNG, TIFF, PSD (Photoshop), BMP, Tilepic</li>
      <li>Multi-page documents: Microsoft Word, PDF, PS (Postscript), DjVu</li>
      <li>Video: QuickTime, RealMedia, WindowsMedia, FLV (Flash), MPEG-2, MPEG-4</li>
      <li>Audio: MP3, AIFF, WAV</li>
      <li>Multimedia: SWF (Flash), QuickTime VR</li>
    </ul>
    <p>OpenCollection can auto-convert non-Web-viewable formats such
      as TIFF into Web-friendly formats (such as JPEG) at various sizes. The
      original format can be retained and made accessible for download. For small
      files, conversion and resizing may be done in near-realtime. For larger
      files, which can take a considerable amount of time to process, conversion
      tasks can be queued for later processing on a designated media processing
      server. Whatever the uploaded file size, catalogers are never forced to
      stop working while media files are processed. Support for individual media
      types are implemented using a modular architecture, which makes it possible
      to add support for new media formats without requiring modifications to
      the core, OpenCollection system. </p>
    <h2>Automatic extraction of metadata from uploaded media files</h2>
    <p>Metadata
      embedded in uploaded media files in EXIF, IPTC, IRB and XMP formats can
      be extracted for search or display.</p>
    <h2>Batch upload of media files</h2>
    <p>The &#34;File Space&#34; is a holding
      area for media files to be added to catalog records. Using a browser-based
      user interface, media may be uploaded to the File Space in large batches
      (as ZIP, Tar-GZip or GZip encoded archives) for later cataloging. In most
      cases this is considerably faster than uploading media file-by-file. </p>
    <h2>Flexible search engine</h2>
    <p>The built-in search engine supports full
      text searching over all fields in database, field-limited searches, wildcards,
      stemming, phonetic matching, spell correction, Boolean combinations, exclusion
      (Boolean &#34;NOT&#34; operator), phrase searches, synonymy and more.
      Both simple Google-like and advanced search interfaces are offered. </p>
    <h2>Built-in Web-based high resolution &#34;pan-and-zoom&#34; image viewer</h2>
    <p>Images
      may be viewed at any resolution, and with continuous zooming and panning,
      using OpenCollection&#39;s built-in Tilepic viewer. Tilepic is an
      open multi-resolution image format designed by the University of California
      Berkeley Digital Library Project (http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/tilepic/).
      Uploaded images can be automatically converted to Tilepic from any supported
      image format.</p>
    <h2>Extensive support for authority lists</h2>
    <p>OpenCollection has
      a full set of tools for managing and cataloging with the following types
      of authority lists: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Entities authority: Authority list for individuals and corporations. </li>
      <li>Place name authority: Hierarchical authority list for geographic place
        names. Supports an unlimited number of independent place hierarchies,
        enabling side-by-side usage of established authorities such as the Getty
        TGN and self-built authorities for local areas. </li>
      <li>Occurrences authority: Flexible authority for &#34;things&#34; that
        are not entities or geographic place names. The list of possible occurrence
        types is configurable, allowing the creation of any number of very specific
        authority lists. Typical applications of occurrences are to support authorities
        for film productions, expeditions, exhibitions and events such as wars,
        storms, elections, etc. </li>
      <li>Collections authority: List of collections into which catalogued objects
        are organized. Each collection can have contextual information, which
        may be displayed to end-users. </li>
      <li>All authorities support any number of assigned synonyms for each authority
        item, as well as configurable metadata fields. Tools for management of
        authority lists are restricted to specific users. When constructing new
        authority lists, it is often desirable to create new records &#34;in
        stream&#34; with cataloging, rather than attempt to anticipate all needed
        records prior to cataloging. OpenCollection supports this type
        of workflow with the authority &#34;quick-add&#34; feature. When &#34;quick-add&#34; is
        enabled, a cataloger may add new authority records directly from cataloging
        screens. These records contain a name only and are tagged as &#34;quick-added.&#34; The
        tagging allows authority maintainers to later review quick-added records
        and modify them as necessary. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Controlled vocabularies </h2>
    <p>An unlimited number of hierarchical controlled
      vocabularies may be loaded into the system and used side-by-side for cataloging.
      Management tools allow selected users to edit existing vocabularies or
      create new ones from scratch. Tools have been implemented to import Getty
      Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) data files into OpenCollection.
      It should be possible to load other thesauri into OpenCollection without
      modification to the core system. </p>
    <h2>Reporting</h2>
    <p>The search engine&#39;s support for Boolean combination,
      exclusion, wildcards and field-level limiting makes it possible to pose
      very specific queries suitable for reporting. The result of any search
      in OpenCollection may be downloaded as a tab-delimited file suitable
      for import into Microsoft Excel or similar applications for reporting purposes.
      The list of report fields and their output order may be customized. </p>
    <h1>Benefits &amp; Challenges for the Museum</h1>
    <p>In developing and implementing <em>OpenCollection, </em>the Museum has
      realized benefits that one would expect from full-fledged collections management
      software. The collections department at the Museum has exponentially increased
      its control over the more than 125,000 artifacts in the Museum&#39;s collection.
      With the migration of data from the old inventory database, staff are now
      able to quickly and accurately identify what artifacts they have, where
      they are, and what condition they are in. </p>
    <p>Researchers have benefited from the software in several ways. First, collections
      staff are able to do searches for outside researchers quickly and efficiently.
      In many cases, simply checking the records attached to a particular authority
      file can give a researcher a quick snapshot of the Museum&#39;s holdings related
      to any given person, corporation, or production. With the launch of the
      collection catalog online, researchers may also perform independent collections-based
      research. Full-text catalog records that allow for keyword searching, zoomable
      high-resolution images, and linked subjects combine to amplify the value
      of the artifacts themselves.</p>
    <p>Internally, OpenCollection has allowed the physical collection
      to grow beyond the walls of the storage room. Exhibition staff, curators,
      development, and public relations can all access the system to learn about
      donations, download images, and plan exhibits. OpenCollection&#39;s
      simple interface enables staff to use the system, only rarely needing the
      intervention of the collections department. A system of permissions and
      access control enables collections staff to determine who can see records,
      and who has the ability to change them.</p>
    <p>The Web-based nature OpenCollection has brought the Museum many
      unexpected benefits.  The Museum underestimated the value of being
      able to perform off-site cataloging. So far, the Museum has used this ability
      to allow interns to continue working on the digitization and access initiative
      after they have returned to school or moved on to jobs elsewhere. In the
      future, this capability will provide subject area experts to access detailed
      collection information and work directly with catalog records. </p>
    <p>Implementing and supporting <em>OpenCollection </em>presented some challenges
      to the Museum. The software’s “LAMP”(Linux, Apache, MySql,
      and php) orientation placed the burden of implementation/technical support
      squarely in between two different staff functions. The person responsible
      for supporting back-office applications specialized in Windows-based client-server
      applications, and was not familiar with the Linux-based computing environment.
      Alternately, our Webmaster, while knowledgeable about the LAMP environment
      and excited by the underlying do-it-yourself ethos of the project, was
      not oriented towards supporting Museum staff use of internal software applications.
      He was instead oriented outwards, towards external users of our Website.
      The adoption and implementation of <em>OpenCollection </em>challenged the
      Museum to alter its organizational structure to take advantage of the potential
      benefits of the software.</p>
    <h1>Sharing OpenCollection</h1>
    <p>The nature of the Museum of the Moving Image&#39;s collection required that OpenCollection be
      flexible enough to handle a wide array of physical, analog, and digital
      item types; enable the description of structured relationships beyond those
      of a work and its maker; and be able to work with multiple metadata schemas
      and controlled vocabularies. This flexibility makes the software suitable
      for use by a wide variety of collection-holding cultural heritage organizations.</p>
    <p>OpenCollection has now reached a turning point. The Museum is
      using the software for its own needs, and will continue to do so as part
      of its ten-year digitization project. By March 1, 2007, the OpenCollection code
      will be made available online through www.opencollection.org. While some
      institutions with a do-it-yourself ethos and internal development capabilities
      will be able to download the software and modify it to fit their needs,
      other, smaller institutions will require a greater level of support. It
      is precisely these smaller institutions that may stand the most to gain
      from free, Web-based collections management software. </p>
    <p>Next steps for Moving Image and Whirl-i-Gig include working to develop
      the infrastructure necessary to administer and nurture <em>OpenCollection </em>as
      a generalized software application distinct from its utility to the Museum’s
      own collection. While the software has been in use at Moving Image and
      shared with several other institutions, there is still no formal documentation
      for installation, administration, or front-end use. Until now, the staff
      of Whirl-i-Gig has been sufficient to handle both development and support
      for OpenCollection within the small user community, but additional
      developers will need to become involved in both maintenance and support
      in order to support a wider user community.</p>
    <p>If adopted and supported, <em>OpenCollection’</em>s ease of use
      and the fact that it is free will enable organizations to direct their
      financial resources towards the research, cataloging, and digitization
      of their collections, rather than towards the purchase of software licenses
      and service contracts. In addition, by using open and widely known technical
      standards, Museum users can work with a potentially deep pool of technical
      talent that can provide support, extensions, and modifications, and a user
      community that can provide advice and expertise. We especially hope that OpenCollection (and
      other software of its kind) will encourage, or at least not discourage,
      collaborative and multi-site/distributed research and cataloging, collection
      sharing, federated search, and the incorporation of user/researcher-generated
      information, something that cannot be accomplished with non-Web-based software. </p>
    <p>Museums and the Web 2007 is the first public presentation of OpenCollection.
      The landscape for Museum collections management software has changed in
      the five years since the Museum and Whirl-i-Gig set out to develop OpenCollection, and
      other approaches to collections management software are now available to
      Museums that were not available to the Museum of the Moving Image in 2003.
      Such strategies include customization of open-source content management
      systems and other types of ‘roll-your-own’ approaches. However,
      we are receiving a steady stream of requests for the software just from
      the www.opencollection.org Web page and word-of-mouth from some informal
      demonstrations. As of this writing, several organizations, ranging from
      the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin to the Coney
      Island History Project, are testing versions of the software for their
      own collections.  </p>
    <p>The Museum is currently seeking assistance and support to establish a
      formal effort to fuel the continued evolution of OpenCollection.
      Planned activities include forming a working group, conducting a formal
      test-bed, and possibly establishing a private foundation. The Museum and
      Whirl-i-Gig hope to remain at the center of these developments, but also
      recognize that open source projects, to be successful, must take on a life
      of their own. </p>
