   <h3 class="abstract">Abstract</h3>
   <p class="abstract">Large applications, lasting a long time and requiring 
    a sizable budget, play important roles in cultural heritage institutions 
    for functions such as cataloguing objects, and presenting the institutions. 
    They are less suitable for promoting things like events or temporary exhibitions: 
    the information loses validity and interest in a short time. Another issue 
    is the ‘communication focus’: large applications are like 
    broadcast TV, speaking simultaneously to a lot of users (with different 
    backgrounds, attitudes and interests), and therefore needing to be ‘generic’. 
    Small applications can instead focus on specific targets.</p>
   <p class="abstract">We came to the conclusion that small cultural institutions 
    could use their (in general limited) budgets more effectively by developing 
    small, focused, and well targeted applications, rather than large ‘institutional’ 
    applications. In addition, they should make good use of the technology, 
    making sure that content (images, audio, text, etc.) can be easily moved 
    from one channel (device) to another with minimum effort.</p>
   <p class="abstract">This paper describes how the above principles have been 
    applied to the Civic Archaeological Museum of Milan, a small but very 
    important institution owned by the City of Milan, in Italy. An overall 
    plan has been drafted and a number of needs have been identified; for 
    each of the needs, a specific solution (and technological ‘channel’) 
    has been identified. Though implementation of the plan is still underway, 
    some low budget - good quality applications have already been developed. 
    A very effective methodology (including a slender design methodology, 
    a very precise workflow and some easy-to-use technological tools) makes 
    the production process very quick and cost-effective. This paper describes 
    the plan, the strategic choices and the initial set of developments.</p>

   <h2 class="PaperTitle">1. The Civic Archeological Museum in Milan</h2>
   <p>The Archaeological Museum of Milan has its roots in the 
     19<sup>th</sup> century. A very important Milanese cultural Institution, Accademia 
     di Brera (now a famous fine arts museum) began to gather objects coming from 
     private collections, recently-abolished ecclesiastic institutions, or demolished 
     historic buildings once in the Milanese historical centre. In 1862 the Ministry 
     of Public Education founded the Museo Patrio di Archeologia (Archaeological 
     Native Museum), whose task was to put together documents from all ages, starting 
     from prehistory. From 1877, the Milanese Municipality established the Museo 
     Artistico Municipale (Municipal Art Museum); the museum gathered collections 
     donated to the civic government up until that time. These museum institutions 
     were then merged into the Museo Artistico e Archeologico (Archaeological Artistic 
     Museum), opened in the Ducal Court of the Milanese castle (called Sforza’s 
     Castle) in 1900. The archaeological collections grew thanks to many prestigious 
     private collections. </p>
   <p>After the Second World War, Sforza’s Castle proved inadequate 
     to house the large number of objects gathered until then. The Great Benedictine 
     Monastery of Saint Maurice, in a nearby historical street (Corso Magenta), 
     was chosen as new location for the Museum, which was inaugurated on 11<sup>th</sup> 
     December 1965. </p>
   <p>Today the museum still has two locations: the Prehistoric 
     and Egyptian sections are housed in the Sforza’s Castle, whereas the other 
     sections are in the location of Corso Magenta, in the Benedictine Monastery 
     of Saint Maurice.</p>

   <p class="caption">Fig 2: The Great Monastery of Saint Maurice, 
     the other beautiful museum’s location </p>
   <p>This latter location (on which we shall focus our attention 
     from now on) is very evocative: the monastery ruins and Roman remains are 
     combined with the modern buildings. The objects lie upon visible strata of 
     history… it is a museum within a museum. The monumental entrance leads to 
     the first cloister of the ninth-century Benedictine monastery, which has now 
     disappeared. There, Roman sarcophaguses and headstones with epigraphs are 
     shown. From the hall of the museum you can enter the second cloister, where 
     the remains of a first-century Roman <em>domus</em> (house) are preserved. In 
     the little garden two towers rise up. The first is the circus tower has been 
     subjected to several changes across the centuries, but still conserves a base 
     and nucleus from Roman times. It was initially part of the fourth century 
     Roman Circus; the horses set off from it and ran along the circus seven times 
     before arriving at the finish line. In the eighth century, a monastery was 
     built over the Roman Circus. The tower was integrated into the monastery as 
     church bell tower. The other tower is the polygon one, tied to a line of walls 
     that once surrounded the city. It was emperor Maximian who, at the end of 
     the third century A.D., decided to enlarge the city walls into which the beautiful 
     polygonal tower was incorporated. Frescoes dating back to the fifteenth century 
     can still be seen in its inner walls, from the time when the tower was turned 
     into a chapel inside the monastery.</p>

   <p>The ground floor of the museum houses the Roman Section. 
     Beside objects used in everyday life there are unique pieces, such as the 
     Trivulzio ‘Cage’ Cup, which is considered one of the most rare and beautiful 
     Roman archaeological findings (only two such caps in the world have been preserved 
     intact until today). Its manufacturing technique still remains a secret even 
     from modern day glass manufacturers. Another precious object is the Patera 
     of Parabiago, a big silver plate dedicated to the cult of the goddess Cybele. 
     The plate shows goddess Cybele and her mortal lover Attis at the centre of 
     a cosmogony map, with symbols of life, death and rebirth. This ritual object 
     is especially valuable since it belongs to a time when pagan cults, like the 
     ones dedicated to Cybele, coexisted with the rising Christian religion. There 
     are also beautiful mosaic floors and statues, such as the torso of Hercules 
     or the Head of Zeus.</p>

   <p class="caption">Fig 6: The Patera of Parabiago, a silver plate 
     portraying religious myths </p>
   <p>There is also the Medieval Section, in which Goth and Longobard 
     objects, mainly jewellery and arms, are displayed.</p>
   <p>In the underground is the Greek Section. A selection of 
     important finds produced between the third and the first millennium B.C. in 
     the Mediterranean area are revealed, together with a very rich collection 
     of Greek and native vessels and votive potteries coming from the south of 
     Italy. Since 2001, the rich nineteen-century collection La Gioia has been 
     shown. More than 600 objects belong to it and are organized in a thematic 
     path on life and death. There is also an Etruscan Section, where the objects 
     are ordered according to specific aspects of Etruscan culture, such as trade, 
     everyday life, the feminine figure, religion. The last section is quite unique 
     in a civic archaeological museum: it is the section on the art of Gandhara, 
     a region which encompasses today’s North-West frontier of Pakistan and North-Eastern 
     Afghanistan. Its importance is due to its strategic position, which made it 
     a crossroads of peoples along the centuries. Indian, Iranian and classical 
     Hellenistic elements characterize, together with local elements, the Buddhist 
     art of the region. The art of Gandhara is documented mainly by reliefs and 
     statues in stone and modeled material which decorated the typical Buddhist 
     monument, the stupa. Since this art follows a religious language, every image 
     answers a precise formal code, making every gesture and feature of the figures 
     meaningful to the faithful. </p>

   <p>As can be seen, the collections of the Museum appear to 
     be very rich and varied, and bear witness to artistic native production, but 
     also contain rare and outstanding objects. Moreover, the Archaeological Museum 
     distinguishes itself because of rich scientific activity and accurate publications.</p>
   <h2>2. Communication Strategy and Technology</h2>
   <p>The Museo Archeologico until 2005 did not have a well-defined 
     strategy about how to use technology for improving its communications. At 
     the same time it had an overall requirement: to develop focused communication 
     for different segments of the potential audience, rather than developing a 
     general (or generic) communication aimed, indifferently, at all potential 
     users at the same time. In a very simplified manner the potential segments 
     of users are the following:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>
       Foreign tourists, arriving in small groups 
      or as families</li>
   <li>
     School groups, arriving mainly in the morning 
     and with previous arrangements</li>
   <li>
     Italian tourists arriving as families or in 
     small organized groups, and </li>
   <li>
     Local people (often not very young) coming 
     back often to the museum</li>
	  </ul>
   <p>Lacking specific expertise on the sue of technology, the 
     Museum, while it was redefining its own organization and its own communications, 
     asked the HOC-LAB, of Politecnico di Milano to investigate what could be done 
     with technology with a double goal in mind:</p>
   <ul>
     <li> 
       To improve the effectiveness of public visits, 
      and </li>
   <li> 
     To widen the audience of people who were aware 
     of the museum and its value; whether this larger audience would also increase 
     the number of visitors was a different issue, not taken as an immediate goal 
     for the time being. (While the museum has some items of international relevance, 
     in a country like Italy, full of archaeological sites, it is not a top star.)</li>
	  </ul>
   <p>The first joint analysis of the users started also from 
     the observation that, as far as familiarity with technology is concerned,
     age plays an important role, and middle-aged visitors (Italian ones in particular)
     are not very aware of modern technology. (According to a January 2007 investigation
     by a Masters student of TEC-CH (<a href="../http://www.tec-ch.ch/" target="_blank">http://www.tec-ch.ch</a>), the majority 
     of Italian visitors, outside of school groups, are middle aged or more,
     and  do not expect technology in the Museum, while foreign visitors are
     younger  and do look for technological support while visiting the Museum.
     (Branbilla,  2007)). This consideration made it unlikely that the category
     of local museum  repeat visitors would be the early adopters of museum technology.</p>
   <p>A further analysis of the Museum’s assets made it evident 
     that just ‘listing’ the objects belonging to the museum, with corresponding 
     descriptions, would not convey the message. First of all the museum (the branch 
     located in Corso Magenta) is organized in different sections, and each section 
     has a different focus and different potential interest. The main sections 
     are the Roman Section, the Greek Section, the Etruscan Section, the Medieval 
     Section and the Gandhara Art section.</p>
   <p>Secondly, the location of the museum is in itself a major 
     reason to raise interest and curiosity, as noted earlier. The Museum is located 
     in the spot where the Roman Circus (built in the IV century A.D.) was located, 
     and the fact that Milan had a Circus is not known by most visitors (and most 
     citizens of Milan as well). Even more interesting, in the courtyard of the 
     Museum there is one of the towers of the entrance gate of the circus, and 
     there is a large remnant of the walls built by emperor Maximiam (III century 
     A.D.). Later all the area became a monastery, and later still (in the 19th 
     century) it assumed today’s organization, with the building where the Museum 
     is sited, and the wonderful St. Maurizio church.</p>
   <p>A consequence of this historical development is that the 
     museum staff is very knowledgeable about the city’s urban development, from 
     a pre-Roman city, to a provincial Roman city (i.e. up to the III century A.D.), 
     to an imperial city (from the 4th century Milan, was one of the capitals of 
     the Western Emperor), up to the 19th century.</p>
   <p>The <em>analysis of the requirements</em> was conducted using 
     C-AWARE (Bolchini et al., 2007), a variant of a generalized analysis method, 
     AWARE (Bolchini &amp; Paolini, 2004). The most relevant stakeholders were 
     the Director of the museum (Donatella Caporusso, a co-author of this paper), 
     and the curators of the different sections. The conclusions of the analysis, 
     as far as using technology for communication is concerned, can be summarized 
     as follows:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>
       Subjects of interest are the different sections 
       of the museum, the history of the building on its own (from pre-Roman time 
      to today) and the urban development of ancient Milan in general.</li>
   <li> 
     Technology to be used included the Web, CD-ROMs 
     (for merchandising at the counter or for promotional distribution), pod-casting 
     (both for remote users and actual visitors) and mobile devices (not yet identified 
     with a specific technology) for visitors.</li>
   <li> 
     The styles of communication had to be varied, 
     in order to reach different audiences:</li>
	  </ul>
   <p class="MsoListContinue"><strong>Type A</strong>: 
     Introductive-narrative: for users (not necessarily visitors) with a generic 
     interest, in order to raise curiosity and to pinpoint the most interesting 
     aspects.</p>
   <p class="MsoListContinue"><strong>Type B</strong>: 
     Detailed narrative: for visitors actually touring the museum.</p>
   <p class="MsoListContinue"><strong>Type C:</strong> Promotional-Brand: to convey (both to remote users and actual visitors) 
     the general message about the museum and its relevance.</p>
   <p class="MsoListContinue"><strong>Type D:</strong> Information providing: to provide detailed selected information about 
     the most relevant aspects of the museum</p>
   <p class="MsoListContinue"><strong>Type E:</strong> Catalogue-like information providing: providing (most likely to students 
     or scholars) a reference description for each specific item hosted by the 
     museum.</p>
   <p>Two aspects were also considered of specific interest: reusability 
     of content, that could be moved among the different applications, and the 
     possibility of getting intermediate results that could be deployed one by 
     one.</p>
   <p>Another important decision was to start experimenting with 
     the new approach that Politecnico was defining: instant multimedia, i.e. developing 
     small, relatively inexpensive applications, based on standard ‘engines’, rather 
     than embarking on a large, all-inclusive project.</p>
   <p>On the basis of the above, the following major steps were 
     designed:</p>
   <ul type="disc">
     <li><strong>STEP 1</strong>: Developing a number 
       of Type A applications for creation of “narratives” describing the main 
       sections of the museum. Different channels (Web, podcast and CD-ROMs) had 
      to be supported.</li>
    <li><strong>STEP 2</strong>: Developing corresponding 
      informative sections, of Type B, for providing more traditional information.</li>
    <li><strong>STEP 3:</strong> Reusing narratives 
      of STEP 1, integrating them in such a way that a rich and varied visitor 
      interactive experience (Bolchini &amp; Paolini, 2006) could be provided.</li>
    <li><strong>STEP 4</strong>: Creating a global 
      communication (over the WEB) to convey the museum <em>brand </em>and typical 
      practical information.</li>
    <li><strong>STEP 5</strong>: Creating detailed 
      information (over the Web) for each relevant item of the museum - the most 
      cumbersome task. In the following paragraph we describe how we designed 
      and implemented the “step 1” activities.</li>
     </ul>
   <h2>3. Step 1 Activities: Telling ‘Stories’ About History And Art</h2>
   <p>In spring 2006, we started building 2 applications about 
     two of the museum’s sections: the Roman section and the Gandhara Art section. 
     We decided to address two of the most relevant segments of users: the Italian 
     tourists and the foreign tourists (the applications are in Italian and English), 
     with specific attention to ‘hungry minds’ rather than to ‘(systematic) information 
     seekers’. Our aim was in fact to raise cultural curiosity and highlight the 
     museum’s value rather than to provide an organized set of information. In 
     order to achieve this goal, we selected the narrative style most apt to engage 
     the reader. As far as technology is concerned, the application had to be multi-channel, 
     so as to assist further segments of (potential) users and support different 
     scenarios of use, ranging from consultation from home via the Web, <em>before</em> 
     the visit, to fruition via iPod (while in some way or another ‘moving’; for 
     example, during a train trip), to consultation from home again, but <em>after</em> 
     the visit (CD-Rom). An audio guide version, to be used while on the museum’s 
     premises, is currently under way.</p>
   <h2>3.1 The ‘OneThousandandOneStory’ Technique</h2>
   <p>In order to develop the ‘narrative’ applications about the different museum’s 
     sections, we decided to adopt an Instant Multimedia methodology for producing 
     multimedia, multi-channel applications: the ‘OneThousandandOneStory’ technique.   </p>
   <p>By <strong>Instant Multimedia</strong> we mean all those techniques that allow quick, 
     effective, low cost (why not) production of good quality applications; examples 
     of these technique are Pachyderm (LaMar et al., 2005; Samis, 2005) and MEDINA 
     (for informative applications; see Garzotto, 2006).</p>
   <p>In the case of the museum’s sections, we selected a particular Instant Multimedia 
     technique, called OneThousandandOneStory (see Di Blas et al. 2007), especially 
     apt for building <em>narrative</em> applications. The OneThousandandOneStory 
     technique (already used by HOC lab for 11 applications) helps generate multimedia 
     (with videos, images, audio files and textual content), multi-channel applications; 
     it is characterized by a set of simple and ‘pleasurable’ interactions for 
     the users (ranging from automatic navigation to manual navigation) and by 
     a strong role of visual and audio communications with respect to texts (that 
     can be seen on demand, but are not immediately offered to the users). Users 
     can thus sit and relax, enjoying the slideshow of images and listening to 
     the narratives, letting the application lead them into a pleasant journey 
     through the content.</p>
   <p class="caption"><img src="caporusso.fig9.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 9: The Roman Section application on an iPod" width="400" height="519"/></p>
   <p class="caption">Fig 9: The Roman Section application on an 
     iPod </p>
   <p>The OneThousandandOneStory technique consists of a design pattern, a production 
     workflow, a content production method, and finally an engine, that will hence 
     be shortly described (a detailed description can be found in Di Blas et al. 
     2007).</p>
   <h3><strong>The Design Pattern</strong></h3>
   <p>The design pattern consists of a set of ‘topics’, revolving around a theme, 
     each developed in a set of sub-topics. Topics are selected so as to create 
     an overall interesting, fascinating story around the theme and are NOT meant 
     to be informative/exhaustive. </p>

   <p class="caption">Fig 10: The Home Page of the Roman Section

   <p class="caption">Fig 11: Roman Section application: the topic 
     ‘Epigraphs’ and its list of sub-topics - on the left </p>
   <h3>Production Workflow</h3>
   <p>The workflow is strictly fixed and it is organized roughly into 4 main parts:   </p>
   <ol>
     <li>
       gathering and refining the content (images and texts followed by registration 
      of audio files), </li>
   <li> 
     implementing the first version, </li>
   <li>
     doing a quality check, followed by </li>
   <li>
     producing the final version. </li>
	  </ol>
   <p>When exploited ‘at full speed’, the workflow can lead to a final middle-sized 
     application in a week’s time (our lab’s record!).</p>
   <h3><strong>Content Production Method<em> </em></strong></h3>
   <p>One of the innovative aspects of this technique (it has successfully been 
     used in the case of the Archeological Museum) is the way content is gathered. 
     The best method is to<em> interview an expert</em> on the theme: the interview’s 
     transcript is refined and organized into small chunks (of approximately 100 
     words), according to the set of topics and sub-topics (the ‘editorial plan’). 
     Possible gaps (for example, missing data) are filled in afterwards. A 2-hour 
     interview can provide the final content for a middle-sized application!</p>
   <h3><strong>The Engine</strong></h3>
   <p>OneThousandandOneStory goes with a very easy-to-use engine (bearing the same 
     name). Its main components are <strong>Data Entry</strong>, <strong>Preview</strong> and <strong>Generation</strong>. Data entry allows editing the 
     editorial plan (i.e. the set of topics and sub-topics) and entering all the 
     content: images (or videos or animations), texts (and also short texts like 
     captions), and audio files. The preview function allows checking the work 
     in progress, to see ‘how it feels’; eventually, generation leads to the final 
     version of the application for the different channels (Web, iPod files and 
     CD-Rom). The generation of the applications (for the different channels) takes 
     virtually no time.</p>
   <h2>3.2 Tales about the Roman Section</h2>
   <p>The Roman section of the Archeological Museum hosts real masterpieces, along 
     with interesting findings and remains; moreover, as mentioned, the museum’s 
     location is in itself related to the Roman history of Milan. The editorial 
     plan of the application (fig. 12) reflects the above considerations: one topic 
     is dedicated to the Museum itself (Roman remains in the Museum Space), stressing 
     the peculiarity of the museum’s location (“the museum is literally built upon 
     strata of history…”). The following two topics are about two amazing masterpieces: 
     the Patera of Parabiago, a big plate dedicated to the cult of the goddess 
     Cybele (fig. 6), and the Trivulzio Cage Cup, a glass cup considered one the 
     rarest archeological findings from Roman time, of exquisite making, very likely 
     an imperial gift (fig. 5). The following topics introduce groups of findings 
     (epigraphs, statues and mosaics), dealing with interesting examples. </p>
   <p class="caption"><a name="fig12" id="fig12"></a><a href="caporusso-fig12.html"><img src="caporusso.fig12.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 12: The editorial plan of the Roman Section application" width="400" height="237" border="0"/></a></p>
   <p class="caption">Fig 12: The editorial plan of the Roman Section 
     application </p>
   <p>The editorial plan highlights the narrative style of the application: the 
     theme (the Roman section) is dealt with in a non-systematic way: the most 
     beautiful or peculiar things are put in the foreground (i.e. the fact that 
     the museum itself hosts Roman remains and the two masterpieces); anecdotes, 
     whenever possible, are told. </p>
   <h3>Example of anecdotal text: sub-topic 2.3, “The Cult 
     of Cybele”</h3>
   <p class="BlockQuote">In Greek mythology, Cybele, the mother of the gods, was 
     in love with Attis, a shepherd. When Attis betrayed her with a shepherdess, 
     Cybele was driven mad by jealousy. When he was asleep, she either castrated 
     him or, according to a different version, drove him mad and he castrated himself. At this point she realized what she had done 
     and, repentant, asked Zeus to bring him back to life; her request was granted. 
     The cult of the goddess Cybele was thus dedicated to the idea of rebirth and 
     life after death. It was very diffused in the IV century pagan world, at the 
     same time as the pagan cult of Mitra, but also as the Christian religion.</p>
   <p class="BlockQuote">Where the main topic does not address a single item (for 
     example, in the case of the topic ‘epigraphs’), the list of sub-topics provides 
     a general introduction, but then immediately focus on specific instances.</p>
   <h3>Example of instance – related text: sub-topic 4.3, 
     “The Sarcophagus of a Lawyer”</h3>
   <p class="BlockQuote">Within the collection of the museum there is the sarcophagus 
     of a young lawyer. It goes back to the third century A.C. and was found 
     intact inside the church of Saint Dionigi, founded at the time of Ambrose, 
     in the second half of the IV century. The decoration of the sarcophagus 
     was dedicated to the young man by his father, who expresses his regret 
     at his son’s death at an early age. The lawyer is depicted immersed 
     in his activity, near a basket full of rolled papyrus and while speaking 
     in public. On one side of the sarcophagus the lawyer is depicted immersed 
     in studying a book, and on the other in court, pleading. This is an example 
     of how an epigraph tells the story of a life as it was lived in Ancient 
     Milan.</p>

   <p>The narrations (derived from a compelling interview with Donatella Caporusso) 
     literally give life to the findings and overall create a fascinating frame 
     for the section.</p>
   <h2>3.3 Tales about the Gandhara Art</h2>
   <p>The application about the Gandhara Art Section stem from 
     an interview with the section’s curator, Anna Provenzali. The Gandhara Art 
     needed a special treatment: while for the Roman section it was possible to 
     count upon some background knowledge from the visitors (especially Italian 
     visitors), the Gandhara Art is definitely less renown, therefore “cultural 
     bridges” with the common ground of the visitors as well as an introduction 
     (from an historical and cultural points of view) were needed.</p>
   <a name="fig14" id="fig14"></a><p class="caption"><a href="caporusso-fig14.html"><img src="caporusso.fig14.thumb.jpg" alt="Fig 14: The editorial plan of the Gandhara Section application" width="400" height="185" border="0"/></a></p>
   <p class="caption">Fig 14: The editorial plan of the Gandhara 
     Section application </p>
   <h3>Example of introductory text: sub-topic 1.2, “Cultural 
     Syncretism”</h3>
   <p class="BlockQuote">The peculiarity of the region of Gandhara 
     is its composite cultural base. Alexander the Great (356-323 BC) reached the 
     borders of Gandhara. The region was then lost by his successors, but a Hellenistic 
     kingdom - the Bactrian Kingdom - developed and persisted in the contiguous 
     region (ancient Bactria, between modern Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Tagikistan). 
     This kingdom remained autonomous for about 70 years after the death of Alexander 
     the Great. The Greeks from the Bactria moved to Gandhara at the end of the 
     2nd century BC and were then replaced by the Iranian populations Saka and 
     Parthians from the 1st century BC. Hellenistic, Indian and Iranian iconographic elements and traditions 
     were thus put together and re-developed in a totally original way, in service 
     of an artistic  expression of the Buddhist faith.</p>
   <p>As it can be seen in the editorial plan (fig. 14), the main 
     links with western culture were identified in Alexander the Great (who actually 
     determined the birth of this kind of art, when he reached those far-away regions 
     bringing Hellenistic culture) and classical Greek art. The whole application 
     is built on the ‘dialogue’ between 2 cultures, the Western and the Eastern 
     ones.</p>
   <h3>Example: Hellenistic influence on the Gandhara Art: 
     sub-topic 3.4, “A Classical Figure” </h3>
   <p class="BlockQuote">A fragment from a relief, preserved in 
     the museum and portraying a female figure, is an example of how the classical 
     element is present in the art of the region of Gandhara. 
     In this feminine figure, we can notice that the dress and the hairstyle are 
     of classical style, though modified according to local fashion. It 
     is possible that the inspiration was due to relations with the Roman world, 
     but we can also think of a persistence of classical Hellenistic iconographies, 
     circulating in the region after Alexander the Great’s expedition.</p>
   <p class="caption"><img src="caporusso.fig15.jpg" alt="Fig 15: Gandhara Art, a classical figure, in which the influence of Hellenistic elements is evident" width="197" height="366"/></p>
   <p class="caption">Fig 15: Gandhara Art, a classical figure, 
     in which the influence of Hellenistic elements is evident </p>
   <p>The application literally acts as a gateway to the East, 
     leading the visitor step by step on Alexander the Great’s path to Gandhara, 
     and the discovery of this cultural ‘melting pot’.</p>
   <h2>4. Conclusions And Future Work</h2>
   <p>The work of the Archaeological Museum is still underway, 
     but an initial set of applications has been developed with little effort and 
     a small budget. This initial result has been made possible by the combination 
     of two factors: the willingness of the Museum to experiment with innovative 
     approaches, and the desire of a technological University (Politecnico di Milano) 
     to use technology in a new way, different from the usual track.</p>
   <p>As far as the future is concerned, a number of new developments 
     are envisioned:</p>
   <ul type="disc">
     <li>Developing the narrative versions for the remaining sections 
      of the Museum.</li>
     </ul>
   <ul type="disc">
     <li>Starting an effective pod-casting strategy, using the 
      material already developed, in order to make the museum more ‘visible’ world-wide.</li>
     </ul>
   <ul type="disc">
     <li>Developing more traditional ‘informative Web sites’ for 
       each of the sections. This will be based upon the (Instant Multimedia) engine 
       Medina (Garzotto, 2006), developed by the HOC-LAB 
      of Politecnico di Milano.</li>
     </ul>
   <ul type="disc">
     <li>Transforming the current ‘narrative files’ into interactive 
       video-guides for visitors, based on MP3-MPEG4 technology. Visitors will 
       be able to upload the guides to their devices (MP3 players, iPods, …), either 
       as they enter the museum, or from the Web site. Politecnico is modifying 
      the OneThousandandOneStory engine for this purpose.</li>
     </ul>
   <ul type="disc">
     <li>Creating a new set of interactive audio-visual guides 
       using the same engine, aiming at specific niches of visitors and based upon 
      an innovative experience design approach.</li>
     </ul>
   <ul type="disc">
     <li>Creating an ‘umbrella’ Web site holding the different 
      pieces together.</li>
     </ul>
