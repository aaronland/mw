<p>The phrase Web 2.0, now so well-known as to be generally considered mainstream, has taken hold on-line, first as a catch phrase and now as a way of life to many of the bigger, content rich providers. No longer are users content to just consume content; instead they want to take part in it, to personalise, it and to share experiences with others. In the museum sector, however, uptake has typically been low. Some notable exceptions exist, of course, but key questions remains. Why has deployment of this “new” approach to content been slow? What barriers exist in museums? How can we go about addressing these?
</p><p>This paper attempts first to identify why Web 2.0 is of particular importance to our sector; next, to examine common barriers in our particular context; and finally, to find ways practitioners might go about addressing these barriers in their organisations.</p>
