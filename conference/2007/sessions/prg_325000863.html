<p>From September 19, 2007 to January 21, 2008, Centre Pompidou is presenting
  the exhibition called ‘Erice – Kiarostami: correspondences’ suggesting
  travels through the two directors’ films, exploring relations between
  films, photos and paintings and presenting ‘video correspondence’ exchanged
  by the two directors. Although the exhibition has been presented previously
  in Barcelona and Madrid, the Paris edition features a radically new experimentation
  performed by the newly founded Centre Pompidou Research and Innovation Institute.
  The experimental set-up is built around new film annotation software called
  Lignes de temps (Timelines) bringing a graphical representation which immediately
  reveals the inner ‘rhythm’ of the movies, be it based on technical
  features (shot, sequence, camera moves, audio elements ...) or on narrative
  features (characters, landscapes, flash-backs ...). Also, Lignes de Temps may
  be superimposed to reveal co-occurrences, repetitions or mirror effects in
  one film or across several. For the exhibition, visitors are fitted with PDA
  and encouraged to write and record notes during their visit. By the end of
  the exhibition, a dedicated place called ‘Espace critique’ (a place
  to criticize) offers 8 computers where the comments recorded on PDA may be
  reworked, synchronized with the films and shared with other visitors.</p>
