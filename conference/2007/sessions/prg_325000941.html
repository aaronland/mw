<p>This paper reports upon the findings of a seven-month project (funded by a HIRF Innovations Fellowship award) to build, demonstrate and evaluate a prototype of an editable, wireless, in-gallery digital label system that uses a Web-based authoring tool. The partnership between the University of Leicester and Simulacra worked with three UK museums to test the viability of building and sustaining such a system. The paper places the use of such dynamic &#39;labelling&#39; in the longer historical context of museum interpretation and the relationship between museums&#39; on-site and on-line channels. It considers the findings of both  visitor observation and the impact of different &#39;generators&#39; (authors) and &#39;triggers&#39; (events) of the labels&#39; live content. However, what is brought into particular relief is the range of assumptions made by the curators involved – assumptions with particular implications for the way both Web-based and gallery-based content and interpretation were seen to be valued within the respective institutions. </p>
