<p>The aim behind the museum’s new Web site is for all visitors to be able to approach the content in a way which attracts their interest. We want to inspire our users to find out more and develop an interest in the subject. We want them to be able to understand what they read and form their own opinions about history, archaeology and how history is written and created. The museum’s Web site is there for all its visitors.
</p><p>The primary objective of the Web project has been to increase traffic even more and encourage visitors to stay longer. A secondary objective has been to raise the status of the Web within the organisation and make the Web site a priority for the whole museum. With this aim in mind, the Web project has helped to improve the coordination of basic operational issues and acted as a catalyst for discussions of common values in the organisation. Below is a description of how the Web project was carried out and the conclusions we drew while it was in progress – a case study.</p>
