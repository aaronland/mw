	  <p class="Author">Nancy Proctor and Chris Tellis, Antenna Audio, United Kingdom 
		and USA<b> </b></p>
	  <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
	  <p class="AbstractText">This paper examines the rapidly changing state of 
		museum handhelds from both a technology and content perspective. The paper 
		will also discuss the component parts for a successful museum installation: 
		content, user interface, applications, form factor, positioning and the 
		challenges to integrating these components. Specific examples will be 
		demonstrated from the 2002 Tate Modern installation and the authors&#39; own 
		research.</p>

	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction: The Evolution of the Museum Handheld</h1>
	  <p class="normal">In museum technology we are now at a major crossroads with 
		the advent of next generation handhelds (PDAs). As described in previous 
		papers (Tellis and Proctor, 2002; Tellis 2001), the 37 year history of 
		audio guides in museums has seen a slow evolution from reel to reel tape 
		to cassette to digital RAM, MP2 and now MP3 systems. In the first 35 years 
		there were only two major technology shifts, the first being compact cassette 
		in 1980 which greatly reduced the size of the players and the second being 
		the transition from analog to digital systems in 1994. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The transition to digital was by far the most revolutionary 
		as it freed the portable audio experience from the 45-minute time limit 
		and single, forced path to a new experience offering unlimited capacity 
		and free roaming. In the late 90s, with visitors able to choose their 
		own routes and listen as long as they liked, museums began to accept audio 
		guides as an increasingly versatile and desirable visitor accessory. Suddenly, 
		it was possible to provide multiple languages and custom guides for specialized 
		audiences. The opportunities for broad acceptance by diverse museum audiences 
		led to the emergence of audio guides as a standard museum accessory. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Now, at the beginning of 2003, virtually every major and 
		middle-sized art museum in the world has an audio guide for its permanent 
		collection, often in several languages. Acceptance of portable information 
		appliances in museum has also expanded well beyond art museums. We now 
		find ourselves working in 2003 on productions as diverse as guides for 
		The Statue of Liberty, the Spy Museum and the Museum of Sex.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Broad application has also sparked an interest in universal 
		distribution. More than half the audio guides in the world now are bundled 
		into the ticket price and given away to all visitors. Although this is 
		just one of many distribution formats, the combination of random access 
		and universal distribution has emerged as the audio guide format most 
		favoured by museum visitors. Visitors greatly appreciate the ability to 
		control the sequence and pacing of the tours, particularly for the permanent 
		collection. With audio guides normally renting for five and six dollars, 
		the low, universal per-visitor fee, usually around a dollar, incorporated 
		within the general admission fees, gives the impression of a valuable, 
		free educational service.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The development path of handheld computing is now bringing 
		us to remarkable new multi-media players. At the same time, the current 
		generation audio-only MP3 players have become highly sophisticated digital 
		devices with tremendous capabilities. The range of features includes the 
		ability to track and download visitor usage patterns, respond to visitor 
		queries, carry multiple languages, provide linear and random access tours, 
		and synch multi-lingual sound tracks to films and videos. Improvements 
		in compression are dramatically expanding the capacity of the players 
		and challenging wireless for the ability to offer unlimited content. This 
		spring Antenna Audio is introducing a player that will allow two gigabytes 
		of memory, enough for 125 hours of high quality sound. At the other end 
		of the spectrum, RSF has introduced a near disposable low cost wand with 
		minimal features eliminating, for instance, the recharging facility.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Museums are also becoming more sophisticated consumers. 
		Whereas in the past the institution might simply ask for an audio guide, 
		now it will request linear or random access, MP3 players, wands, headset 
		devices, radio systems or PDAs.</p>
	  <p class="normal">A surprisingly energetic debate still flourishes around 
		the subject of headsets vs. wands. Conflicting studies show visitor preference 
		for both options (British Museum Study, 2000; Edinburgh Castle Study, 
		2001; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston Study 2002; Xerox Parc, 2001). Objections 
		to headsets usually focus on the potential to affect the social aspect 
		of a museum visit. Beverly Serrell (1996), for instance, acknowledges 
		the advantages to learning that comes from simultaneous use of ears and 
		eyes, but notes the isolating effect of headsets. The background for this 
		concern is often based on research conducted by Dr. John Falk and Dr. 
		Lynn Dierking at the Institute for Learning Innovation. Falk and Dierking 
		argue that the educational context is enhanced by the social aspect of 
		the museum visit and that interchange among companions leads to an important 
		form of collaborative learning. They identify the museum as an ideal context 
		for this &#34;free choice learning&#34; wherein visitors absorb ideas and connections 
		at random, based on personal interests and triggered lines of inquiry 
		(Falk and Dierking 2000). Drawing on this research, one might conclude 
		that headsets interfere with this dialogue.</p>
	  <p class="normal">However, recent research conducted at the Xerox Palo Alto 
		Research Center, now known as Parc, has refined this argument in the context 
		of new technologies in museum spaces. In the course of their research 
		into screen-based players, Paul Aoki and Allison Woodruff compared text 
		to headsets to built-in speakers as information sources for handhelds. 
		Their results supported other studies that showed that audio was preferred 
		over text as it allowed the visitor to stay focused on the museum display 
		(Woodruff et al. 2001). Visitors particularly liked sound played over 
		hand held speakers, but this was obviously not practical for indoor museums. 
		The Parc team later tested several kinds of headsets with a group of eight 
		Xerox employees and reported a preference for a single earpiece with headband; 
		sort of a telephone operator rig which combines the hands-free convenience 
		of the stereo headset with a &#39;free ear&#39; for companions (Grinter et al. 
		2002).</p>
	  <p class="normal">Clearly a headset-based solution will be the default for 
		screen-based players, as you will not be able to hold them up your ear 
		and also see the screen. But it is still possible to give visitors a choice 
		of headset or wand with their audio tour, as the same players now can 
		be used with excellent sound for either option. The preference of visitors 
		for this choice serves to underline that the museum is a center with many 
		different opportunities for personal learning – some benefit from 
		social interaction, while others require the ability to concentrate and 
		in fact be temporarily isolated from companions. Ultimately, the effectiveness 
		of these educational experiences is based on the appropriateness of the 
		technology used for the stated educational or interpretive goals.<span class="normal"></span></p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Centrality of the Visitor Experience</h1>
	  <p class="normal">With such a variety of technologies on offer, studies of 
		visitor needs and responses have taken on an even more crucial aspect, 
		not only to inform museums&#39; purchasing decisions today, but also to spur 
		development of visitor interpretation systems for the future. In this 
		spirit, Antenna Audio has introduced the &#39;TouchPol&#39; touchscreen visitor 
		surveying system into selected museum sites in order to gather visitor 
		response to the audio tour and related issues. In the context of audio-visual 
		handheld systems, CIMI has recognized the rising demand for consistent 
		and effective evaluation tools and is working with Professor Geri Gay 
		and the Cornell HCI Group&#39;s concept mapping procedure in the Handscape 
		program &#34;to collect and analyze visitor expectations, museum expectations, 
		potential use scenarios, and the like, as a means of establishing a firm 
		foundation from which future testing may be developed and evaluated.&#34; 
		(CIMI 2002)</p>
	  <p class="normal">Similarly, the Multimedia Tour pilot (MMT) conducted at 
		Tate Modern in 2002 took as its primary aim the evaluation of visitor 
		response to the technology and a wide range of approaches to multimedia 
		content design. At the same time, the MMT allowed both Tate Modern and 
		Antenna Audio staff to begin to consider how this technology might fit 
		within the larger interpretation strategy and alongside other interpretation 
		media such as audio tours, wall text, and educational events.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Jane Burton, Curator of Interpretation at Tate Modern, sees 
		the MMT as a sign of times to come for museum interpretation:</p>
	  <p class="BlockQuote">Audio guides have been part of the interpretation and 
		education strategy since Tate Modern opened in May 2000. Having established 
		a reputation for delivering excellent audio tours, Tate Modern would like 
		to remain at the cutting edge of educational technology by helping to 
		shape a new generation of multimedia tours. The advantages of the system 
		we have been testing include the ability to offer content directly in 
		front of the work of art without encroaching on the aesthetics of the 
		gallery space, the potential for creating individualized tours, and for 
		encouraging interactivity (the facility for users to email content home, 
		respond to questions etc). Developing the Tate Modern Multimedia Pilot, 
		in collaboration with Antenna Audio, revealed some pitfalls but predominantly 
		the amazing potential for this new technology, which, in the coming years, 
		will surely take its place alongside more traditional learning tools as 
		a key strand of museum interpretation. <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Burton, 
		2003)</span> </p>
	  <p class="normal">The extensive user feedback gathered during this project 
		at Tate Modern can therefore serve as a lens through which to view both 
		the state of the art in museum handhelds and the near future of museum 
		interpretation, as seen not only by the technologists, but more importantly 
		by the museum&#39;s visitors. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Tate Modern Multimedia Tour Pilot</h1>
	  <p class="normal">Sponsored by Bloomberg, Tate Modern&#39;s Multimedia Tour Pilot 
		was open to the public from July through September 2002. Developed with 
		Tate Modern by Antenna Audio, the multimedia tour was a 45-minute tour 
		of the <i>Still Life/Object/ Real Life</i> galleries, in which visitors 
		could experience audio, video, still images and a variety of interactive 
		applications on handheld iPAQ computers loaned by HP. The content of the 
		multimedia tour was delivered to the visitor through the museum&#39;s wireless 
		network, using location-based technologies powered by PanGo Networks. 
		Design support for the project was provided by Tate Modern&#39;s Web design 
		team, Nykris.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The pilot had a dual purpose: to test both applications 
		of wireless technology in the gallery, and to assess a wide range of approaches 
		to content design. The wireless network extended over fourteen galleries, 
		defining sixteen unique content zones by means of just seven access points. 
		In each gallery, a different approach to content design was applied to 
		the presentation of a selected object. After their tour, visitors were 
		asked to evaluate the different designs and provide feedback on the overall 
		impact of their experience of the technology.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The pilot was specifically designed to define the limits 
		of the current generation of wireless technology, and therefore involved 
		an ambitious combination of location-based and interactive applications, 
		namely:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> <b>Interactive survey and response:</b><i> 
		  </i>the system asked and recorded visitors&#39; opinions of a Nikki de Saint 
		  Phalle painting, both before and after they saw a video of its production;</span></li>
		<li><b>Creative play: </b>visitors could mix their own soundtracks to 
		  accompany their viewing of visual collages by Edoardo Paolozzi;</li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> <b>Location-specific content delivery:</b> 
		  content was delivered to visitors according to their location in the 
		  gallery.</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> <b>Visitor tracking: </b>the Proximity 
		  Platform™ tracked visitors&#39; locations in the galleries, relaying 
		  them to a digital map at the distribution desk. This system also alerted 
		  staff if a device failed or the visitor otherwise appeared to be in 
		  need of technical assistance.</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> <b>Visitor paging: </b>staff could 
		  page visitors <i>ad hoc</i> through the PDAs, as well as send out pre-programmed, 
		  timed alerts, e.g. regarding the start of a video program in the gallery.</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> <b>Visitor profiling:</b><i> </i>the 
		  wireless system tracked visitors&#39; use of the content with a record of 
		  which exhibits they visited.</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> <b>Visitor e-mail facility:</b><i> 
		  </i>visitors were able to e-mail themselves further information on objects 
		  and artists on the tour in order to follow up on artists and artworks 
		  of interest through the Tate Web site.</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p class="SubHeaderSmall">Visitor Feedback</p>
		<p class="normal">A wealth of visitor responses was gathered from the pilot: 
		  852 visitors took the pilot tour and completed evaluation forms recording 
		  their experiences. These responses were analyzed in a comprehensive 
		  database. In addition, the software system used in the trial logged 
		  all uses of the MMT and provided a statistical picture of how the tour 
		  was utilized, which rooms were visited, and how the visitor e-mail system 
		  was used. Not least, Antenna Audio staff demonstrated the tour to a 
		  wide range of visitors and specialists, including curators, educators, 
		  museum directors, artists, technologists, and wireless solution integrators. 
		  In conversation with these experts in their fields, we gained valuable 
		  and detailed feedback on the MMT technology, the experience, and ways 
		  of improving both.</p>
		<p class="normal">Although this technically innovative pilot often pushed 
		  the technology to its limits and beyond, visitors were enthusiastic 
		  about both the service and the tour. Visitors generally see this technology 
		  as an exciting and inevitable part of the future landscape in museums. 
		  The British Academy of Film and Television Arts agreed that the multimedia 
		  tour enhanced the visitor experience at Tate Modern, remarking in its 
		  award to Tate Modern and Antenna Audio for Technical Innovation that:</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">Genuinely groundbreaking, this was an exciting demonstration 
		  of how new technology can be used to enhance museum and gallery visits. 
		  Using a hand-held wireless device that knows just where you are on the 
		  tour, this offers a stimulating array of material to add to, but not 
		  confuse, the experience of a gallery visit. Commendably, Tate Modern 
		  is working with day-to-day feedback from visitors to develop a system 
		  that complements an already stunning physical learning space. (BAFTA 
		  2002)</p>
		<p class="normal">In this respect, the trial was a resounding success in 
		  demonstrating how such cutting-edge technology can be implemented today 
		  in a museum&#39;s interpretation program. It achieved its goals of mapping 
		  both the strengths and weaknesses of wireless handheld solutions; however, 
		  the true judges of the success or failure of this new technology will 
		  be the museum visitors. As a result, the visitor responses gathered 
		  during the trial are our most valuable roadmap towards development of 
		  handheld technologies for museums in 2003 and beyond.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeaderSmall">Visitor Demographics</h1>
		<p class="normal">A primary tool in the collection of visitor response to 
		  the MMT was a questionnaire that was completed by all visitors taking 
		  the tour: 852 questionnaires were completed by visitors from around 
		  the world.</p>

		<p class="normal">The comparison of this sample with the overall demographics 
		  of visitors to Tate Modern indicates that audio-visual tours will be 
		  particularly popular with North Americans:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> The MMT attracted more than double 
		  the percentage of North American visitors at Tate Modern in this period 
		  (18% of MMT users were North American, compared to an overall visitor 
		  ratio of only 7%);</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> The MMT attracted fewer UK visitors 
		  than the average in this period (56% of MMT users were British, compared 
		  to an overall of 70% UK visitors to Tate Modern);</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> The MMT attracted a similar percentage 
		  of European and &#39;Rest of World&#39; visitors to the Tate Modern standard;</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> The MMT attracted more male visitors 
		  than the average at Tate Modern: 58% compared to a usual audience of 
		  41% men at Tate Modern;</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> The MMT attracted fewer visitors 
		  aged over 60 than the Tate Modern average, but 3-5% more visitors in 
		  the under-60 age bracket.</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p class="SubHeaderSmall">Visitor Satisfaction</p>
		<p class="normal">The average amount of time visitors spent taking the tour 
		  was 55 minutes.</p>
		<p class="normal">Over 70% of visitors spent longer in the gallery, and 
		  a similar percentage said that the MMT had improved their visit to Tate 
		  Modern.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="normal">Approximately 61% of the visitors 
		  gave their email addresses in order to be able to use the e-mail feature. 
		  The overall content rating the tour received was nearly 7 marks out 
		  of 10. The clear conclusion from user response to the tour was that 
		  visitors enjoy the tour more when the content is tailored to their interests 
		  and ability level. As a &#39;sampler&#39; of content design approaches, the 
		  MMT was geared for a generalist audience with interest in the art on 
		  display, but no prior knowledge. Unsurprisingly, then, we found that 
		  visitors with extensive art backgrounds were less satisfied by the content 
		  on the tour, and would have preferred more research-oriented content 
		  and facilities.</span></p>
		<p class="SubHeaderSmall">Main Difficulties</p>
		<p class="normal">In general, older visitors found the technology more difficult 
		  to use than younger visitors. Overall 55% of visitors found the MMT 
		  easy to use, while 45% found it difficult. </p>
		<p class="normal">Regardless of age, nearly all visitors experienced technical 
		  difficulties in using the new technologies of the MMT. The most requested 
		  improvements for the system were making the content easier to access 
		  (i.e. by improving the user interface), and making the PDA more reliable.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Technical Findings</h1>
		<p class="normal">The technical performance and ease-of-use of a handheld 
		  tour are in fact determined by seven different elements that must work 
		  together in order to provide a positive user experience. These are: 
		</p>
		<h2>The PDA, including:</h2>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> <b>Processing Speed:</b> the current 
		  generation of PDAs have very slow processors, and are roughly comparable 
		  to 6-10 year-old desktop computers. They are the &#39;bottleneck&#39; in the 
		  wireless system&#39;s ability to delivery media-rich, processor-demanding 
		  content to visitors;</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> <b>Operating System Stability:</b> 
		  PocketPC was not originally intended for rich multimedia content and 
		  so is not yet optimized for this use; however, there is huge pressure 
		  from the PDA manufacturers on Microsoft to make Internet Explorer 5 
		  available on the Pocket PC. A major rewrite and upgrade is expected 
		  within the next 6 months (.NET). In addition, alternative operating 
		  systems are available, including Pocket Linux, Palm OS 5 and C++ content 
		  delivery engines.</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p class="SubHeaderSmall">The Wireless Network</p>
		<p class="normal">The 802.11b protocol used at Tate Modern provides an embarrassment 
		  of bandwidth - effectively 5mB per second data transfer rate (up to 
		  11mB per second in lab conditions). This is more than twice the speed 
		  of a T1 Internet connection. However, the processor in the PDA was not 
		  always up to handling the quantity and complexity of files being delivered 
		  to it. Delays, therefore, in the playing of content, etc., were due 
		  less to network issues than to processor weaknesses.<b></b><b></b></p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">&#39;Client Side&#39; Software </h2>
		<p class="normal">&#39;Client side&#39; software is stored locally on the PDA, and 
		  includes Internet Explorer for PocketPC 2002 and Macromedia Flash v. 
		  5, the file format in which the tour&#39;s multimedia content was programmed.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">&#39;Server Side&#39; Software</h2>
		<p class="normal">&#39;Server side&#39; software is stored on the network server, 
		  including the content delivery engine (PanGo&#39;s Museum Docent™) 
		  and its applications that allowed us to create content in industry-standard 
		  formats such as HTML and Flash and deliver it to the user. The Museum 
		  Docent™ software and its applications proved to be very stable; 
		  indeed, the software did not crash during the entire pilot period. </p>
		<p class="normal">Special features of the Museum Docent™ software include:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> <b>Full Screen Content Mode:</b> 
		  so that it was not necessary to sacrifice any screen real estate to 
		  the Internet Explorer browser window;</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> <b>Paging Service:</b> allowing 
		  the distribution desk to contact visitors using the tour through the 
		  PDA;</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> <b>Alerts Service:</b> automatically 
		  prompting the visitors before each start of the Jan Svankmajer video 
		  sequence;</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> <b>e-Phile Service:</b> allowing 
		  visitors to bookmark information of interest and e-mail it to themselves.</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p class="SubHeaderSmall">The Location-Based Service (LBS)</p>
		<p class="normal">The LBS provides location-sensitive content delivery and 
		  location-sensitive interactive maps of the gallery. PanGo&#39;s Proximity 
		  Platform™ calculates the location of the user by taking signal 
		  strength readings from a number of access points in the user&#39;s vicinity 
		  and effectively &#39;triangulating&#39; the user&#39;s position. In the MMT pilot, 
		  we were able to define 16 distinct content zones by using only 7 access 
		  points - a significant cost saving over earlier location-based systems 
		  in terms of network installation and maintenance. Limitations of the 
		  Proximity Platform™ include:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> Minimum location granularity of 
		  1 meter in ideal conditions; in practice, 3 meters;</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> Ambiguity in &#39;border spaces&#39; and 
		  overlapping content zone areas;</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> 2-3 second latency for accurate 
		  location identification.</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p class="SubHeader">Design </p>
		<p class="normal">Design issues include three aspects of the tour:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> Tour Experience Design;</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> Tour Interface Design;</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> Tour Content Design.</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p class="normal"> Each design element has not just a visual impact 
		  on the user, but also a logical impact: just as each message is structured 
		  according to an interpretive or pedagogical logic, so the navigation 
		  icons and their arrangement on the screen reflect basic assumptions 
		  about the use and the organizing principles of the tour experience. 
		  Together the interface and content should support the desired Tour Experience. 
		  It is important when evaluating feedback from users to distinguish between 
		  these two elements, and also to keep in mind that the tour was not conceived 
		  as a united &#39;Experience&#39;. Instead, the purpose of the pilot was to test 
		  a variety of approaches to the content design, as well as the technology 
		  and visitor feedback to it. </p>
		<p class="SubHeader"><b> </b>Human-Machine Interface</p>
		<p class="normal">The form factor and weight of the PDA, as well as the 
		  screen and battery life, also impacted the way the visitors interacted 
		  with the MMT. In particular, the following aspects presented challenges 
		  to the operations of the pilot project: </p>
		<p class="normal"> <b>Battery life and charging:</b> The iPAQ&#39;s screen drains 
		  enormous power from the PDA. Although HP provided very helpful guidance 
		  in setting up the PDAs for maximum power saving, we still had to leave 
		  the screen on constant, high brightness in order to provide the best 
		  possible user experience. As a result, the battery power and therefore 
		  performance of the iPAQ deteriorated after approximately 1.5 hours of 
		  use. The iPAQ would then need to be recharged for approximately one 
		  hour in order to reach full battery power again. This severely limited 
		  the number of uses each iPAQ could have in a day. </p>
		<p class="normal">Smaller, lighter devices with integrated wireless cards 
		  and greater battery life significantly improve the user experience of 
		  the PDA. The batteries used in the 3900 series iPAQs and the new 5000 
		  series provide both longer life and better power management. HP&#39;s new 
		  X-Scale-based 5000 series iPAQs with integrated wireless include a removable 
		  lithium polymer battery, so it&#39;s possible to keep spare batteries charged 
		  up in order to minimize down time during recharging. These iPAQs also 
		  include the better quality screen that is already in the 3900 series 
		  iPAQs, and the stronger X-Scale processor. Toshiba, Acer, and Symbol 
		  also offer PDAs with integrated wireless cards which improve not just 
		  the battery life but also the ergonomics of the device. Antenna Audio 
		  is currently developing mass charging facilities that will be compatible 
		  with industry-leading PDAs.</p>
		<p class="normal"> <b>Weight:</b> Many users found the iPAQ too heavy 
		  to carry for long periods. Although the large straps distributed the 
		  weight more evenly across users&#39; necks, the width made them uncomfortable 
		  with many people&#39;s clothing. Small children were not able to use the 
		  devices for very long because of their weight.</p>
		<p class="normal"> <b>Fragility:</b> In order to protect the PDA, it was 
		  given to the visitor in a rugged case which increased the weight of 
		  the PDA. However, we found that this level of ruggedization was sufficient 
		  to protect the device. In three months of use, we had no breakage, though 
		  several devices were dropped. </p>
		<p class="normal"> <b>Screen:</b> In general, users are happy with the size 
		  of the standard PDA screen, as long as the content is designed well 
		  for it. In particular, content design needs to take into account the 
		  screen&#39;s &#39;high contrast&#39; structure, designed to make the screen legible 
		  out doors, which can render extreme darks and light colors illegible. 
		  Resolution also helps the legibility of the screen enormously, and we 
		  saw a marked improvement in the screens used in the 3900 series.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Content Findings and Recommendations</h1>
		<p class="normal">In addition to testing the technology and visitors&#39; 
		  responses to it, the primary aim of the MMT pilot was to test a variety 
		  of approaches to content design. The content proved to be the primary 
		  draw of the MMT, and indeed it will be the quality of the content that 
		  ultimately determines the success or failure of the tour experience. 
		  In many respects each new object demands a new approach, so accumulating 
		  a design guide of what works and what doesn&#39;t is likely to take as long 
		  if not longer to develop than the technology.</p>
		The findings and recommendations made below regarding content design are 
		based on Antenna staff experiences, the questionnaires, and feedback from 
		Susie Fisher, the independent evaluator hired by Tate Modern. 
		<p></p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">What Worked</h2>
		<p class="normal">Interestingly, users did not seem to find multi-tasking 
		  and multi-tracking of different media (e.g. looking between screen and 
		  artwork) to be a problem as long as the message was well designed and 
		  the PDA was functioning properly. The multimedia tour clearly had the 
		  effect of making the visitors look longer at an object than they would 
		  have otherwise, even though the screen was also commanding attention. 
		  As Susie Fisher reported, &#34;Visitors can multi track with great ease, 
		  even when the input tracks (audio, screen, painting) are not synchronized 
		  with one another.&#34; (Fisher, 2002, Chart 34)</p>
		<p class="normal">In this regard, &#34;audio acts like a friend&#34;, and indeed 
		  more use could be made of the audio to direct the users&#39; eye movements 
		  between the object, and the screen, and to navigate through the gallery 
		  space.</p>
		<p class="normal">In both the questionnaires and Focus Groups, visitors&#39; 
		  favorite stops on the tour featured the following design approaches:</p>
		<p class="normal"> <b>Audio-Visual Coherence:</b> A strong logical link 
		  between the audio and the visual worked well in messages where an audio 
		  description of abstract paintings by Braque and Auerbach was accompanied 
		  by visual &#39;zooming&#39; into the details being discussed; however, it is 
		  important to note that at least in the case of the Braque message, the 
		  &#39;audio focusing&#39; of the message that explained the painting&#39;s various 
		  elements could have been accomplished with audio alone. The Auerbach 
		  painting, on the other hand, is more abstract and therefore really benefited 
		  from the explanatory visual details. Susie Fisher&#39;s advice here is apt: 
		  &#34;Use the visual to do things which can only be done visually&#34; (Fisher, 
		  2002, Chart 32).</p>
		<p class="normal"><b>Interactives:</b> Interactive messages, in which visitors 
		  had a chance to register their opinions about a <i>Shooting Picture</i> 
		  (by Niki de Saint Phalle) and create their own soundtracks to listen 
		  to while viewing collages by Edoardo Paolozzi, were very popular. Visitors 
		  asked that the interactivity be enhanced further, for example, by showing 
		  them how other visitors responded to Saint Phalle&#39;s work, and by allowing 
		  them to save or send their Bunk soundtrack combinations.</p>
		<p class="normal"> <b>Audio:</b> Visitors responded enthusiastically to 
		  messages that included interviews with artists, sitters, and related 
		  experts, as the speakers were relevant and interesting. A porno-movie-style 
		  soundtrack by the Chapman Brothers entertained with its shock effect, 
		  but it also alienated other visitors. It became clear that good audio 
		  navigational instructions are also a core skill, required by both the 
		  MMT and the traditional audio tour, since moving visitors around the 
		  galleries safely and effectively is fundamental to the success of any 
		  tour.</p>
		<p class="normal"><b>Video:</b> Perhaps surprisingly, video was not the 
		  focus of praise for the message that showed artist Niki de Saint Phalle 
		  creating a <i>Shooting Painting</i>. Instead, visitors most commented 
		  on how much they enjoyed the process of learning in this message, where 
		  they had the opportunity to give an opinion of the work both before 
		  seeing the video, and afterwards. Using the screen to explain the process 
		  of making a work was considered by several visitors to be a good use 
		  of the screen, but the video was also considered a potential distraction; 
		</p>
		<p class="normal"><b>Intuitive, Interactive Interfaces: </b>A message about 
		  Damien Hirst&#39;s <i>Pharmacy</i> used a 360 degree panorama of the installation 
		  as the interface for audio messages about the work, much in the style 
		  used by the Parc researchers at the Filioli Mansion. Although this room 
		  was de-installed early on in the project and therefore was not in the 
		  focus group analysis, it was very popular among visitors for the ease 
		  of use of its interface as well as for the interviews with the artist 
		  and a pharmacist which it included.</p>
		<h2>What Didn&#39;t Work:</h2>
		<p class="normal"> <strong>Long Messages</strong>: Visitors seemed to tire 
		  more easily from the interactive tour than from more passive audio tour 
		  experiences. In addition, the screen seems to make them expect more 
		  to happen, more quickly, than in an audio tour. It is likely, therefore, 
		  that multimedia messages need to be shorter than audio tour messages, 
		  but to offer the visitor more second level message options. The PDA 
		  screen, which can display several second level options, makes this possible, 
		  in contrast to audio tours where it is more difficult to offer multiple 
		  message &#39;layers&#39; because of the difficulty of remembering their number 
		  combinations. However, as in audio tours, second level options can be 
		  a useful way of dispersing audiences by directing them to related works, 
		  e.g., so that they don&#39;t spend a long time bunched in front of a few 
		  selected works in each gallery;</p>
		<p class="normal"> <strong>Blank Screens</strong>: We intentionally made 
		  the screen go relatively blank at selected points along the tour, in 
		  order to focus visitor attention on the art object. Visitor feedback 
		  indicated that we were probably too conservative in this: they found 
		  the blank screen confusing, and wondered if something were wrong with 
		  the PDA. The screen demands that at least a still image of the object 
		  being discussed appear on the screen at all times, as much to identify 
		  the object of discussion and reassure the visitor that the PDA is working 
		  as anything. Regarding our fears that visitors would spend their time 
		  in the galleries &#39;with their eyes glued to a small television screen&#39;, 
		  one visitor comment seemed to sum up the lack of danger: &#34;there is no 
		  way the small digital image of the object could be more compelling than 
		  looking at the real thing.&#34; Here, as ever, good content design is key 
		  to the tour, producing a beneficial rather than distracting visitor 
		  experience;</p>
		<p class="normal"> <strong>Text</strong>: Text had a mixed response: some 
		  - particularly more &#39;art experienced&#39; visitors, liked having wall labels 
		  in the palm of their hand, while others wanted more exciting content;</p>
		<p class="normal"><strong>Help Menu</strong>: The lack of a help menu was 
		  felt, as visitors needed to be able to refer to a key to the navigation 
		  icons throughout their tour, to remind them of the functions and options 
		  available to them.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">And Moreover:</h2>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> Visitors wanted MORE of everything: 
		  more objects on the tour, and more information about each.</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> Just as in audio tours, the multimedia 
		  tour can take attention away from other objects in the gallery, items 
		  which are not on the tour. Therefore careful tour design is essential. 
		  </span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p class="SubHeader">User-Interface </p>
		<p class="SubHeaderSmall">Interface buttons and Functio<span class="SubHeaderSmall">ns</span></p>
		<p class="normal">The MMT used the following interface buttons:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> Map</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> Information</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> What&#39;s Here</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> E-Phile</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> Rewind</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> Pause/More</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="normal">The icons and functions of these buttons were often quite 
		unclear to users, and there were several functions that users missed and 
		requested. This response pointed to the fact that this new technology 
		requires new functions that are not yet known, let alone intuitive, to 
		the general public. In response to this feedback from the Tate pilot, 
		Antenna Audio is redesigning the interface and multimedia tour functionality, 
		and will be working with Tate Modern to refine these further. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Content Menus</h1>
	  <p class="normal">In order not to interrupt or control the visitors&#39; experience 
		of the tour, the MMT was designed to leave the launching of content entirely 
		in the hands of the visitors; although the content could have been triggered 
		by the location of the visitor to play automatically, the visitor had 
		to press the &#39;What&#39;s Here&#39; button or choose a room from the map in order 
		to trigger its content to play.</p>
	  <p class="normal">We found, however, that there was demand for an automatically-generated 
		menu of content available in each gallery, to both respond to the visitor&#39;s 
		movements and prompt the visitor to explore new content. This demand can 
		be satisfied through the Proximity Platform&#39;s™ &#39;aggressive&#39; location 
		sensing mode. When a message stops playing on the device, and the user 
		is not receiving any content, the Proximity Platform™ will go into 
		&#39;aggressive&#39; mode, sending a Local Area Menu of information relevant to 
		the user&#39;s immediate area to the PDA&#39;s screen. This menu will not interrupt 
		any content the user is currently playing; it will only appear if the 
		user is not currently playing content. Alternatively, users can specifically 
		request the content menu for their local area at any point in the tour.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Customer Service Findings and Recommendations</h1>
	  <h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">Distribution Desk and Management Console</h4>
	  <p class="normal">At the distribution desk&#39;s computer terminal, the Museum 
		Docent™ displayed a map that tracked the location of users in the 
		gallery as they took the tour. This and the &#39;checking in/out&#39; system, 
		which allowed staff to associate a visitor&#39;s name and email address with 
		the PDA, and hence with the location on the gallery-tracking map, were 
		particularly useful for security and tour management. Similarly, the server-side 
		usage logs, which tracked where visitors went, which messages they accessed, 
		etc., proved particularly helpful in evaluating the success of the pilot. 
	  </p>
	  <p class="normal">The Museum Docent™ also includes a client-side log, 
		which sits on each PDA and tracks any problems that occur and why. This 
		performance log proved essential to monitoring PDA performance.</p>
	  <h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">Distribution and End-user training</h4>
	  <p class="normal">The MMT was emphatically represented to the public as a 
		pilot; by being given the tour for free, and being asked to fill in evaluation 
		forms, the public was reminded that the aim of the installation was to 
		gather information in order to improve and develop the service further.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The best way to distribute the PDAs and teach visitors how 
		to use them was a constant work in process. Even the distribution desk 
		underwent various permutations, as various storage and presentation facilities 
		became available.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The navigation button icons were difficult for visitors 
		to understand and remember, and posed a particular challenge to instructing 
		visitors in the use of the device. It could take upwards of 5 minutes 
		to teach each visitor how to use the tour.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Visitors&#39; credit cards or other major documents were held 
		as security for the PDA. With only 15 PDAs, keeping track of these did 
		not pose any difficulties for distribution staff.</p>
	  <h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">Security</h4>
	  <p class="normal">Despite the lack of equipment security at the distribution 
		desk, there were no equipment thefts during the trial. Nor were there 
		any breakages.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The location-sensitive map on the distribution desk proved 
		useful in tracking devices. On one occasion, a couple clearly left the 
		tour area and &#39;dropped off&#39; the tracking map on the distribution desk. 
		However, because the wireless network coverage extended beyond the tour 
		area, staff were able to send a page to the couple, asking them to return 
		to the distribution desk. They did so and returned the devices, explaining 
		that they had simply gone to the café and had forgotten to bring 
		the PDAs back first.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">A Glimpse of the Future for Handhelds and Museums: 
		The m-ToGuide Project</h1>
	  <p class="normal">The m-ToGuide (mobile tourist guide) project is funded by 
		the European Union as part of the IST (Information Society Technology) 
		programs, 5<sup>th</sup> Framework. In 2001, the IST commission made a 
		total of EU 25 million available for 5 projects to be conducted towards 
		the development of next generation telephone technologies and businesses 
		in Europe. The aim of these projects is to develop technologies and build 
		business for next generation telecoms, by creating consumer demand for 
		new services and hence jobs in the sector.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Motorola&#39;s research and development division, Motorola GTSS, 
		headquartered in Israel, assembled the m-ToGuide group, a consortium of 
		17 companies including Antenna Audio, to respond to this call. The team 
		was awarded a €5.5 million grant in April 2002. The m-ToGuide service 
		will integrate tourist content and services from a variety of providers, 
		delivering these to the end-users&#39; handheld terminals (PDA) via 2.5 and 
		3G telephone networks.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Currently, 3G networks are not truly available for the m-ToGuide 
		service, so initial trials will be conducted using a combination of locally-stored 
		content and the slower GPRS or 2.5G network infrastructure to transfer 
		low-bandwidth data to the terminal. Positioning will be provided by GPS, 
		but the system is designed to receive location information from a variety 
		of other inputs as well, including cell id, the system used by the current 
		generation of phones (GSM). Cell id is the least precise positioning system 
		available, locating the user only within approximately 500 sq meters, 
		while &#39;assisted GPS&#39;, using GPS plus positioning software, can achieve 
		up to approximately 3 meters accuracy.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The m-ToGuide service is intended to replace and enhance 
		the navigation and information services currently available to tourists, 
		via a handheld device, a kind of PDA, connected to high-speed telephone 
		networks (GPRS or 2.5G and UMTS or 3G). Equipped with location-sensitivity 
		(GPS and cell id), the m-ToGuide terminal will provide interactive navigation 
		services and personalized information, according to criteria established 
		by the users, on places of interest, monuments, stores, restaurants, hotels, 
		museums, opening hours, etc. It is also being developed to include m-commerce 
		facilities, allowing the users to buy tickets and make bookings. Trials 
		of the service will be carried out in Madrid, Sienna and London in summer 
		2003.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Antenna Audio is responsible for developing audio visual 
		and textual messages for the main points of interest of each city in the 
		project. This &#39;highlights tour&#39; of each city may be supplemented by other 
		tours, for example an audio-visual tour of a museum, current exhibition, 
		or other visual attraction. The tourist can then use a single handheld 
		device to tour both interior and exterior spaces, receiving both media-rich 
		interpretation of features and attractions as well as practical, navigational 
		support from maps and visitor information. A primary aim of Antenna Audio&#39;s 
		involvement in this project is to use the technology to develop new audiences 
		and means of reaching those audiences, as well as new revenues and commercial 
		opportunities, for our museum partners.</p>
	  <p class="normal">In addition to providing the London tour content, Antenna 
		Audio led the research that defined users&#39; needs and requirements for 
		this new city tour technology. In summer 2003, Antenna Audio will put 
		its learning from this and the Tate Modern pilot into action as it staffs 
		and runs the distribution operations and user support services for the 
		London field trial. As in the Tate Modern MMT, user surveying and evaluation 
		will be a main activity and goal for the m-ToGuide project.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusion</h1>
	  <p class="normal">The development of next-generation museum handhelds is being 
		informed by the experience gained from millions of audio guide users over 
		the past three decades. The fundamental benchmarks for successful mobile 
		learning experiences are now well known, allowing us to concentrate on 
		new features and opportunities.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Wireless interactive systems offer important tools and unique 
		opportunities for the development of in-gallery interpretation and education 
		programs, and the extension of these to a cultural experience of the wider 
		city that links many museums and visitor attractions. The visitor response 
		to the Tate Modern Multimedia Tour Pilot has given an unequivocal green 
		light to future development of these handheld solutions within the museum. 
		We now look forward to the results of the m-ToGuide project as cultural 
		tourists guide the development of mobile, interactive technologies beyond 
		the museum&#39;s wall as well.<span class="normal"></span></p>
