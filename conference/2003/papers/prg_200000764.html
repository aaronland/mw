		</p>
		<p class="Author">Kimberly Freeman, The Silk Road Project, Inc and John

		<p class="URL"><a href="http://www.silkroadproject.org/smithsonian">www.silkroadproject.org/smithsonian</a></p>
		<p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">The Smithsonian Institution&#39;s Center for Folklife 
		  and Cultural Heritage (<a href="http://www.folklife.si.edu/">www.folklife.si.edu</a>), 
		  the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery (<a href="http://www.asia.si.edu/">www.asia.si.edu</a>), 
		  and the Silk Road Project (<a href="http://www.silkroadproject.org/">www.silkroadproject.org</a>) 
		  collaborated to produce a Web site documenting the 2002 Folklife Festival 
		  which brought together the arts, music, and traditions of the Silk Road 
		  for over 1.3 million visitors on the National Mall in D.C. Although 
		  a foundation was laid ahead of time, the Web site was constructed on-site 
		  in a trailer as the Festival unfolded, taking in and responding to the 
		  textures, sounds, events, energy, and people that comprised the event. 
		</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">Building a festival site while the Festival unfolded 
		  left little room for error.  But producing the site during and within 
		  the Festival brought vibrancy and immediacy that would not have been 
		  possible had the site been fully designed before the event began.  The 
		  Web site was thus part of the live event, influenced and inspired by 
		  the colors of silk, sounds of music, smells of foods.  As videographers 
		  and photographers documented events, pages were designed, coded, and 
		  launched.</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">The festival brought people together from around 
		  the world.  We freely and openly shared knowledge, ideas, and resources 
		  becoming an example of collaborative exchange that the Silk Road symbolizes.</p>

		<h1 class="SubHeader">Background</h1>
		<p class="normal">The Silk Road Project is a not-for-profit music and 
		  cultural organization founded by cellist Yo-Yo Ma in 1998.  Through 
		  its programs — a two-year worldwide concert tour performed by an international 
		  group of musicians, music commissions awarded to Silk Road composers, 
		  and educational materials disseminated to schools — the Project furthers 
		  its mission of building connections and creating trust across cultures.  
		  Phase one of the Project&#39;s activities culminated in the two-week 2002 
		  Smithsonian Folklife Festival on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.  
		  The Festival brought together 400 musicians, artisans, and craftspeople 
		  from 25 countries along the Silk Road.  1.3 million people came to the 
		  Mall to hear music, taste food, and watch and talk to artisans.</p>
		<p class="normal">Part of the Silk Road Project&#39;s mission is to act as 
		  a catalyst for refining and defining collaborative work, often bringing 
		  disparate groups together to work with one another in imaginative ways.  
		  In planning for this event, the Project worked with not only the Smithsonian 
		  Institution&#39;s Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage which runs the 
		  annual Festival, but also the Freer/Sackler galleries, which organized 
		  a Silk Road exhibit to tie in with the 2002 Festival.  The Arthur M. 
		  Sackler Gallery and Freer Gallery of Art together form the national 
		  museum of Asian art as part of the Smithsonian Institution.  Each of 
		  these organizations shares a mission of encouraging an understanding 
		  of Asian art and culture to a wide audience — clearly a match with the 
		  Festival&#39;s theme of the Silk Road.</p>
		<p class="normal">The historical Silk Road, an exchange network of trade 
		  routes that crisscrossed Eurasia long before today&#39;s global economy 
		  (from about the 2<sup>nd</sup> century B.C.E. through the 14<sup>th</sup> 
		  Century C.E.), served as a major conduit for the transport of knowledge, 
		  information, and material goods between East and West resulting in the 
		  first global exchange of scientific and cultural traditions. Merchants, 
		  ambassadors, and pilgrims transported crafted goods and raw materials 
		  across political and cultural boundaries: spices, precious metals, musical 
		  instruments, rare medicinal herbs, objects used in worship and ritual. 
		  Silk, the most famous of these commodities, reached the Mediterranean 
		  by the first century B.C.E. from production centers in China (<a href="http://www.silkroadproject.org/silkroad/overview.html">www.silkroadproject.org/silkroad/overview.html</a> 
		  and <a href="http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/online/luxuryarts/default.htm">www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/online/luxuryarts/default.htm</a>).</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Web Site Preparation</h1>
		<p class="normal">Prior to the event, the organizations independently 
		  prepared Silk Road materials for the Internet: the Silk Road Project 
		  added information on instruments, musicians and composers of the Silk 
		  Road, as well as an historical overview and a detailed map of the Silk 
		  Road; the Freer/Sackler created a site compiling all of the Silk Road-related 
		  activities of the galleries.</p>

		<p><span class="normal">The Project had an established identity of bright 
		  warm colors and horizontal lines.  Long before the Festival materials 
		  were developed, the Project sent preliminary layouts to the Freer/Sackler 
		  so that their stripes and colors could be integrated into the galleries&#39; 
		  marketing materials.  As a result, the two organizations had independent 
		  identities that played off one another.  By sharing color palettes and 
		  general art direction, the resulting color schemes and visual themes 
		  brought unity to these separate projects.</span></p>

		<p>I<span class="normal">t&#39;s easy to believe that just providing links 
		  to one another means collaboration.  At this point, our work together 
		  was similar to other collaborations, not extending much beyond reciprocal 
		  links.   But, a true collaboration is an exchange that changes the outcome 
		  of both people&#39;s efforts and entails a deeper level of involvement.  
		  In the next stage of work, the collaboration became an exchange of ideas, 
		  ways of working, labor, and talent.  The efforts were no longer independent; 
		  we were working towards one goal.</span></p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">The Festival Web Site: Structure &amp; Goals</h1>
		<p class="normal">The Festival site became a collaboration out of necessity.  
		  Not one of the organizations had the resources required to launch a 
		  site on its own, but by pooling our resources we were able to put together 
		  the equipment and team to produce a site.  Much of the content that 
		  was being developed for the Festival (information signs, a  passport  
		  for children to use on their day&#39;s long journey through the Festival, 
		  etc.) provided the bulk of written material for the site.  A trailer 
		  on the Mall was set up with high-speed Internet connections, and outfitted 
		  with computers, digital cameras, video cameras, scanner, and a 360-degree 
		  photo lens.  A staff of Folklife photographers provided event photography.  
		  The trailer team consisted of a producer, programmer and editor who 
		  came to Washington a week prior to the event.  The Freer/Sackler Gallery 
		   loaned  a producer to help the team, who provided skills as a digital 
		  photographer, programmer, coder and designer.</p>
		<p class="normal">The respective Silk Road online presences that launched 
		  prior to the event provided only historical background and general information 
		  about the Festival and the Silk Road (visitor information, historical 
		  overviews, etc.).  However, the mission of a dedicated 2002 Folklife 
		  Festival site was not only to provide information, but also to convey 
		  the spirit and flavor of the event itself.  The challenge in translating 
		  that spirit online was that the event had yet to begin; there were diagrams 
		  and text and lists and outlines and a huge setting of tents and stages, 
		  pavilions, kanats (handmade fabric  walls  dividing sections of the 
		  site), yurts (small portable tents for living), even camels.  Only on 
		  opening day when performers danced, sung and played on those stages 
		  would we get an idea of the kind of chemistry that might be born out 
		  of the Festival. </p>
		<p class="normal">The goals of the Festival site were: </p>
	  </div>
	  <ol>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithnumbers">To impart the experience of the Festival 
			to those who might not be able to attend.  (Photos of the live Festival, 
			for example, as well as video clips of performances.)</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithnumbers"> To archive information and images. (Since 
			the volume of information was more than anyone could absorb on a day&#39;s 
			visit, the site would serve as an archive of the many signs  with 
			information on the history, geography, traditions, arts, religions 
			of the Silk Road.) </div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithnumbers"> To enhance and extend the experience of 
			those who did attend the event.  (Before coming to the Mall visitors 
			could download detailed schedules (updated every evening) of performances 
			for the following day, and after leaving they could explore areas 
			of interest, or see a video clip of their favorite performance.  Children 
			could download a passport to guide their journey through the Festival.  
			They could print it out, bring it to the Festival, and get stamps 
			at designated stations.  When they filled their passports, they would 
			receive a prize of a special commemorative Silk Road coin.) </div>
		</li></ol>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Planning the Site&#39;s Architecture</h2>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p class="normal">Five days prior to the opening, as the Festival unfolded 
		  in front of us, we met on the front steps of the Freer Gallery.  Inspired 
		  by what we saw, we came up with the basic architecture of the site, 
		  which would follow the organization of the physical site itself.  Five 
		   sentinels of arrival   (Venice, Istanbul, Samarkand, Xi&#39;an, Nara) which 
		  each had their own distinct design influenced by the regions they represented, 
		  would become five main sections of the Festival site along with a sixth 
		  area (Nomads).  </p>
		<p class="normal">The Festival designers struggled with what to include, 
		  how to achieve geographic and cultural diversity, how to strike a balance 
		  between comprehensiveness and still benefit from the clarity of fewer 
		  clear representations, above all, how to layout the information in a 
		  way that would make sense to a public that might enter the Festival 
		  from any direction on the Mall.  Much of the work of the Festival planners, 
		  benefited us.  The problems and needs of the physical site were paralleled 
		  in the Web site.  Visitors to both the Festival and Web site were presented 
		  clear paths to follow, but were in command of their own experiences 
		  and could be drawn by their interests to different areas.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Designing the Site: Opening Day Launch</h2>
		<p class="normal">The site architecture came from the layout of the physical 
		  space.  The character of the Web site came from hand-crafted materials: 
		  the bamboo gates became a textured background for Nara, Ventian paintings 
		  became a texture for that section of the site.  The positive side of 
		  our predicament (creating the site on the fly) meant that we were opening 
		  ourselves to react to the moment letting the inspiration come from the 
		  Festival itself.</p>
		<p class="normal">We took hundreds of photos and created a quick intranet 
		  site to reference them.  We were particularly interested in the textures 
		  of the various materials brought to the Festival — these  hand-crafted 
		  materials represented, to us, the essence of the Festival.</p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"><img src="freeman.fig5.jpg" width="375" height="279"/></p>
		<p class="MsoCaption">Figure 5. Textures of the 2002 Smithsonian Folklife 
		  Festival (clockwise: Chinese hand-painted porcelin, bamboo gate, wooden 
		  blinds, silk worm cocoon spiral). Photos taken on-site. (<a href="http://www.asia.si.edu/beta/textures/">http://www.asia.si.edu/beta/textures/</a>)</p>
		<p class="normal">Once we saw and captured this incredible material, we 
		  wanted to not only feature the crafts themselves, but to make them an 
		  intrinsic part of the site itself.  We integrated our favorite textures 
		  into the navigation for each main section of the site.  So, each artifact 
		  underwent a long journey: from the artisan&#39;s home country in Central 
		  Asia where it was brought to life at the artisans hands, it was brought 
		  to the National Mall in D.C. where its creation was demonstrated for 
		  crowds of visitors, and then captured digitally on our cameras and incorporated 
		  into the Festival Web site where it would be seen by a worldwide audience 
		  of millions.</p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"><img src="freeman.fig6.jpg" width="372" height="204"/></p>
		<p class="MsoCaption"> Figure 6. The site&#39;s navigation incorporated texture 
		  photos taken at the 2002 Smithsonian Folklife Festival, a different 
		  texture for each of the six main sections.  The navigation, thus, was 
		  of the Festival itself.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">The Spirit of the Festival</h1>
		<p class="normal">The Festival was inspiring.  Huge crowds braved the 
		  heat, and we saw fabulous music and dazzling performances.  We began 
		  to understand the Festival; it was no longer abstract.  Footage and 
		  pictures began flooding in.  We had a tremendous amount of visually-stunning 
		  material.  The challenge, with limited resources and staff, was to pick 
		  and choose the right ones to use.  </p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"><img src="freeman.fig7.jpg" width="318" height="238"/></p>
		<p class="MsoCaption">Figure 7. A video clip featuring a Tuvan throat singer.  
		  Being able to post footage of the opening ceremonies on opening day 
		  was thrilling.</p>
		<p class="normal">The idea of the Silk Road — individual exchanges between 
		  traders who could each gain from the interaction —  inspired our own 
		  methods of working together.  Participants from around the world gathered 
		  for two weeks to make art and music together.  Many performers and artisans 
		  had never left their own countries, but at the Festival they united 
		  to share their cultures and arts freely with each other and the world.  
		  In similar fashion, we were learning and sharing from one another — 
		  experiencing our own Silk Road story of exchange.</p>
		<p class="normal">The record-breaking heat of that two weeks meant that 
		  our  office,  the air-conditioned trailer, was a popular rest-stop for 
		  the over-heated Festival participants and performers.  It was a haven 
		  from the road, the sun, the heat, the electrical storms and the crowds.  
		  It was inspiring to have Yo-Yo Ma and the members of the Silk Road Ensemble 
		  practice in the trailer, and look over our shoulders as we coded the 
		  site.  Imagine producing a site with a live soundtrack of music from 
		  the region we were trying to represent playing in the background in 
		  our workplace!  We felt as much a part of the Festival as those on stage.  
		  There was never a doubt of what we were doing or why we were doing it.</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Reaching our Audience</h3>
		<p class="normal">As Web-workers, usually removed from our audience, it 
		  was exciting designing a site for a Festival that drew 1.3 million people 
		  over the course of two weeks.  We could just peek outside our trailer 
		  door and see the crowds, which was so different from our usually invisible 
		  online audience.  We would post something in the evening and see people 
		  reading print-outs of it on the train the next morning.  The site was 
		  more popular during the Festival itself than we had anticipated — we 
		  needed to upgrade for additional server space three times in the first 
		  two days to keep up with the rate of traffic of 8,000 visitors in a 
		  day.  And, that was just the beginning.  The site continues to receive 
		  a steady stream of visitors long after July&#39;s trampled grass on the 
		  Mall grew back, browned and was snowed over.</p>
		<p class="normal">The site remains an important source of information 
		  for visitors from the actual Silk Road, some of whom have reported back 
		  to us that they check-in regularly.  During the Festival one of the 
		  Mongolian translators bowed as he said,  You cannot know how grateful 
		  we are, in the Gobi desert, for your Web site.   He continued on to 
		  say that the site provided those in his country connection to the outside 
		  world that they craved, and the site gave family members of Festival 
		  participants a way to see and understand the event.  We were touched 
		  and motivated by what he shared with us.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Lessons Learned: Tips for Those Preparing a Site 
		  for a Massive Live Event</h1>
		<p class="normal">One of the peculiarities of doing this site was that 
		  there is no  next time.   We would joke,  <i>next time</i> we invite 
		  a million people to the Mall we should . . .  .  However, we would like 
		  to pass along our two-weeks-worth of wisdom, hoping this might be helpful 
		  for even smaller scale live event sites: </p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Build flexibility into your designs before 
			the event, so that you can respond to the inevitable changes that 
			will happen to the design and text.  (examples: Strip out approved 
			text before the event and use stylesheets.)</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Have one shared drive on site, with plenty 
			of space.  Triple what you think you need</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets">Network your computers so that you can easily 
			share files.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Automate calendar updates.  The schedule 
			of events <i>will</i> change during the course of the event.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Buy twice the estimated needed number of 
			media cards (or other storage) for digital cameras and video cameras.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Update everyone&#39;s software and fonts before 
			the event.  Use the same versions.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Devote one workstation to video/audio crunching.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Provide solid examples for art direction 
			for photographers and videographers before the event.  Give them examples.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Develop a system ahead of time for cataloging 
			images with standard naming conventions.  Share these conventions 
			with your photographers so they can name their files according to 
			your system.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Provide ample post-production time.  When 
			the event is over and everyone&#39;s going home and getting some rest, 
			plan on still being in high production mode, processing the volumes 
			of material that surely weren&#39;t able to launch during the event.</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p><span class="normal">While working so closely together, we learned 
		  new ways of working.  We each had enough experience in building Web 
		  sites that we had settled into our own methods of creating.  Working 
		  on a common project forced us to see and understand each other&#39;s process.  
		  Keeping flexible, we each forged new methods, from the influence of 
		  having someone there with an outside perspective to challenge assumptions.</span></p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusion</h1>
		<p class="normal">Collaboration means working together by sharing people 
		  and ideas, not just resources.  Often when two organizations meet to 
		   collaborate  online, the result is simply exchanged links.    Loaning  
		  a staff member to another organization, a sort of cultural exchange 
		  student program for professionals, results in a more profound collaboration.  
		  Just as the members of the Silk Road Ensemble learned from each other, 
		  listening to each other&#39;s styles, we improvised a new way of working, 
		  creating a unified whole from different talents and styles.</p>
