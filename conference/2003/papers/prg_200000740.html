		<p class="PaperTitle"><b>From Content Expert to Stakeholder: Using Online 
		  Tools to Bring Museum Staff to the Table</b></p>
		<p class="Author">Willy Lee, Webmaster, The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, 
		  USA</p>
		<p class="AbstractTitle"><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p class="AbstractText">As the Web has become more mainstream and institutional 
		  demand for web projects rises, can we turn non-technical content matter 
		  experts into stakeholders? With the advancement of simple authoring 
		  tools and the proliferation of database driven applications, can these 
		  experts create their own projects? This paper addresses these questions 
		  with a look at recent projects from simple ways to help non-technical 
		  staff to visualize new concepts to collections management system based 
		  authoring tools.</p>
		<p class="keywords">Keywords: Content Management, Distributed Authoring, 
		  Database tools.</p>
		<p class="SubHeader"><b>Introduction</b></p>
		<p class="normal">The days of clandestine web sites are numbered. More 
		  and more people are turning online for their always available source 
		  of information. As museums cut printing costs further, demand is shifted 
		  to the internet as a &#34;free&#34; resource. The model of one or 
		  two people managing the entire web site for a large museum is getting 
		  quickly outdated, but budgets are slow to follow. How can we involve 
		  more staff in the creation of web content and meet the growing demand 
		  with the same amount of resources?</p>
		<p class="SubHeader"><b>Templates and &#34;easy&#34; editors</b></p>
		<p class="normal">There are countless design firms waiting to sell you 
		  a set of templates you can easily fill with your content using &#34;easy&#34; 
		  editors like Macromedia DreamWeaver or Microsoft FrontPage. The templates 
		  would be customized for your own look and feel and you would be free 
		  to create the content. This solution would be fine for a small site 
		  that is not expected to grow at any appreciable rate. This method quickly 
		  gets complicated when these programs are used to create more features 
		  and content than originally accounted for in the initial design. Just 
		  as desktop publishing software led to a rash of unprofessional newsletters, 
		  this methodology is leading to a rash of unprofessional web sites. This 
		  often leads to sites that are fairly challenging to use and are poorly 
		  designed. </p>
		<p class="SubHeader"><b>Commercial content management solutions</b></p>
		<p>Content management systems promised to be the next big thing. They 
		  would allow an organization to create a web site simply using a design 
		  template and a database that would supply all the necessary content. 
		  By simplifying the technical aspect, these systems were to be managed 
		  by less technical editors using online forms to create web sites. These 
		  are not a panacea for organizations that want to have a larger web presence 
		  but do not want to keep a dedicated technical staff. It is tempting 
		  to think that you could buy one of these systems, spend some time with 
		  a design firm to customize the site for your use, and end up with a 
		  perpetual system for less than the cost of employing technical staff. 
		  For the most part, these content management systems are outside of the 
		  types of software that ISPs offer with shared hosting, so these require 
		  a dedicated or collocated server, further increasing costs for many 
		  museums. Server maintenance along with the management of user rights 
		  and passwords create a demand for staff that you may not have. These 
		  solutions can make sense in places where you have hundreds of content 
		  creators and sufficient staff to manage the content management solution. 
		  Even in cases like this, commercial content management systems may not 
		  make sense. There may not be a significant cost savings in such systems 
		  when compared to a robust system that draws data from existing internal 
		  databases and applications.</p>
		<p class="SubHeaderSmall"><b>The case for custom applications (even without 
		  technical staff!) </b></p>
		<p class="normal">A more manageable solution would be to create small 
		  scale custom applications. These can be written in one of many application 
		  languages like PHP, perl, ColdFusion, or ASP. These languages are often 
		  available with the fairly basic hosting packages that ISPs offer. These 
		  methods are even available to museums without dedicated technical staff. 
		  An experienced web programmer should be easily able to provide a solution 
		  that would be simple to manage in house. These applications can scale 
		  to the size of your vision and budget.</p>
		<p class="normal">Custom applications can also constrain content managers 
		  to simple structures. This may sound like a disadvantage, but it often 
		  helps keep a site clear and navigable. On the flip side, larger custom 
		  applications can create a comprehensive site that can draw data from 
		  internal systems like collections management systems, scheduling systems, 
		  and even ticketing. This is a big deal. Connections like these allow 
		  a single source of information to serve multiple audiences and insure 
		  that all these users get the most recent information.</p>
		<p class="SubHeaderSmall"><b>Case studies: Three different applications</b></p>
		<p class="normal">For items like the press releases, job opportunities, 
		  exhibition listings and events calendar, content holders use a series 
		  of online forms that allow them to add content to preexisting pages. 
		  There is no set number of pages, but the application dictates the section 
		  of the site it appears in and how links between sections work. The events 
		  section of the artsmia.org site follows this model. By moving from static 
		  web pages to a dynamic application, the site was able to remove events 
		  as they happened so the site didn&#39;t appear out of date. It also gave 
		  control of the content to those who were more connected with it while 
		  freeing up time for the technical staff. In addition, the system in 
		  place was able to use the same data to simplify other aspects of museum 
		  operations. So while the application took data for the web site, it 
		  also created the tour sign up sheet used by the docents eliminating 
		  a task that the tour schedulers were doing on a monthly basis.</p>
		<p class="normal">Another type of application can draw directly from the 
		  internal systems of the museum. many museum web sites are already using 
		  data from collections management systems to create large databases of 
		  online use. Custom applications can serve this purpose, but they can 
		  also extend this model. A function in The Museum System (TMS) allows 
		  users to save ordered groups of items for future use. These &#34;object 
		  packages&#34; are often used to keep track of projects within the museum.  
		  The Provenance reporting section of artsmia.org is managed in this fashion. 
		  Not only does it allow the curatorial staff to manage the data in an 
		  application they are already familiar with, it allows the public access 
		  to the most current data. In this case, the custom application was created 
		  not only to be used for this section, but so that it could be quickly 
		  and easily reused for other sections of the site.  This level of abstraction 
		  allows the technical staff to quickly create other projects like this.</p>
		<p class="normal">One solution often overlooked is staff use of public 
		  tools. With the success of artsconnected.org&#39;s Art Collector, we found 
		  that staff in the museum were using it as a slide library of their own, 
		  sometimes to organize a slide lecture and sometimes in place of slide 
		  lectures.  Staff use of these tools can also help publicize the tools 
		  to a greater audience. These tools are often justified bby their use 
		  for the public, but it pays to look for ways to use them internally 
		  as well.</p>
		<p class="SubHeaderSmall"><b>How do these models affect staff?</b></p>
		<p class="normal">These systems may seem like they simply shift the work 
		  from technical staff to the rest of the staff, but more often than not, 
		  they can be designed to reproduce the brochures, labels, and other printed 
		  matter that staff were already authoring for. Just as the first generations 
		  of web sites borrowed liberally from the existing printed matter, the 
		  model works in reverse, in fact, it often saves time since the content 
		  is already entered digitally and can be simply imported into other applications. 
		  From the simple example of docent sign up sheets mentioned above to 
		  complete catalogs, once authored, this content can be reused over and 
		  over again. In some cases, museums have eliminated printed pieces and 
		  moved to online publishing of certain materials to save on printing 
		  and mailing costs.</p>
		<p class="normal">Here&#39;s the secret. As staff become more involved in 
		  the process of creating content for the site, the site becomes deeper 
		  and richer. As staff become more involved, they come to see the site 
		  as another place to do their jobs and content comes more freely. Instead 
		  of seeing themselves as a resource used to make content, they feel like 
		  the end products as their own creations. There is nothing that can inspire 
		  a better product than ownership.</p>
