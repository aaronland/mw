		<p class="PaperTitle">Using the Web for Participation and Interactivity</p>
		<p class="Author">Gail Durbin, Victoria and Albert Museum, United Kingdom</p>
		<p class="URL"><a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/">http://www.vam.ac.uk</a></p>
		<p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">People developing museum websites need to avoid 
		  replicating traditional museums and creating sites that take little 
		  account of how people learn. In developing the British Galleries, the 
		  Victoria and Albert Museum identified eight audience types and their 
		  needs and four learning styles and used these to audit ideas for interpretation. 
		  &#39;Variety&#39; became a key to ensuring people with a wide range of backgrounds, 
		  needs and preferred learning styles found something they could relate 
		  to in the new galleries. We now wish to apply some of the lessons learnt 
		  in developing the British Galleries to the development of the V&amp;A 
		  website, although lack of research in the way people use museum websites 
		  to learn about objects is an obstacle.</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">The V&amp;A website needs more than simply collections 
		  information on the site. Using interactivity (where visitors have the 
		  power to influence outcome) and participation (where visitors can feel 
		  involved) can broaden the base of people who feel that the website has 
		  something for them that fits in with their own needs and learning styles. 
		  One means of creating variety and balance within the interactivity on 
		  the site is to provide a range of activity relating to a continuum that 
		  runs from the museum as expert through to putting the visitor in the 
		  role of expert.</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">Examples are taken from the V&amp;A website showing 
		  how different part of the site work. Some activities occur solely on 
		  the website and others have been generated as a combination of gallery 
		  activity and web activity. Some of the most successful events have been 
		  those where both museum and visitor have offered expertise. Other seemingly 
		  frivolous events have generated levels of creativity, commitment and 
		  enthusiasm entirely appropriate to the aims of the museum. We need to 
		  do more research and welcome collaboration with others to increase the 
		  variety of activity on our site.</p>

		<h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
		<p class="normal">One of our tasks as people running websites is to stop 
		  new media being used to replicate traditional museums. Even when traditional 
		  museums move on and find new ways of communicating with their audiences 
		  the website can retain a conservative air. There are various characteristics 
		  that I associate with traditional museums.</p>

		<p class="normal">Take, for example, the Ceramic Galleries on the top 
		  floor of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Due for an update shortly, 
		  these galleries are classic traditional displays. They cover over 3000 
		  square metres and are filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of 
		  examples of Asian and European ceramics arranged in rows. 95% of the 
		  collection is on display. Every object has a label naming the manufacturer 
		  and date. There are very few panels providing contextual information. 
		  Visitors would be pressed to find the difference between pottery and 
		  porcelain, would not find any help distinguishing between factories 
		  and would certainly not be told the purpose or significance of any of 
		  the objects. This is a gallery that requires the objects to speak for 
		  themselves. I find the galleries breathtaking, exciting and stimulating 
		  but only because I speak some of the language. Many of our visitors 
		  do not and the galleries are often empty.</p>
		<p class="normal">The web equivalent of these galleries is one with a 
		  large database of images of objects from the collection. There may be 
		  limited text so that it simply forms captions or there may have been 
		  a data dump from a collection information system that was originally 
		  designed for internal use in the museum. This is fine for the specialist 
		  but not so for casual museum users who have a general interest but do 
		  not know what to do after looking at the fifteenth teapot. Sometimes 
		  the inclusion of specialist vocabulary is ameliorated by allowing visitors 
		  to click through to a glossary. But from the visitors&#39; point of view 
		  it would be better if the terms were explained within the text, as looking 
		  up terms is disruptive to the train of thought and especially so to 
		  poor readers or visitors with sore feet.</p>
		<p class="normal">I am very conscious that, unlike gallery developments, 
		  there is a woeful amount of research available on the use of museum 
		  websites and or about learning about objects from websites. This is 
		  something we plan to start to address at the V&amp;A in the next financial 
		  year. I welcome the attempts by some of the people at this conference 
		  to start to fill these gaps and feel a lot more work is needed. In the 
		  mean time I am reduced to assertions based on empirical evidence.</p>
		<p class="normal">Many traditional displays are planned round what museums 
		  know and want to tell others. They might be defended as educational 
		  but they do not come out of understanding of educational theory and 
		  how people learn. One of my tasks is to encourage curatorial colleagues 
		  to generate web content. At the V&amp;A great emphasis is placed on 
		  expertise and there is a long and strong tradition of sharing that expertise 
		  through lectures and the publication of books and catalogues. All staff 
		  are committed to the idea that the museum serves an important educational 
		  purpose but the teaching model is one of telling people things. With 
		  the web, a broader range of possibilities is easily and rapidly available. 
		  Staff sometimes find it difficult to start to think about communicating 
		  their knowledge and understanding differently. They are reluctant to 
		  start a dialogue with visitors (partly because of the workload they 
		  think it might generate) and find it hard to think up approaches that 
		  use the web&#39;s capacity to generate participation. Instead the web is 
		  seen as another kind of book. Clearly it is my job to encourage new 
		  ways of thinking.</p>
		<p class="normal">My route to becoming the Head of the On-Line Museum 
		  at the Victoria and Albert Museum has been via teaching and museum education.Ô 
		  From 1996 to 2001 I was a member of the concept team for the British 
		  Galleries 1500 - 1900. I wrote the interpretative plan for the galleries 
		  and managed the educators on the gallery teams. I was also directly 
		  involved with the development of the computer interactivity in those 
		  galleries. It is my contention that galleries (and websites) fail to 
		  be as effective as they could when little account is taken of the needs 
		  of museum audiences and the way in which people use and learn from museums 
		  and museum objects. We attempted to deal with these issues in the British 
		  Galleries and I am keen to apply some of the methodologies and lessons 
		  of those galleries to our website.</p>
		<p class="normal">(I do not intend to go into great detail here about 
		  the British Galleries. People who would like an overview of the development 
		  of the British Galleries may like to look at Morris (2002). For more 
		  depth on the computer interactives see Durbin (2002). This article has 
		  an appendix that shows an analysis of audience needs which was used 
		  as a working document for the galleries. For a discussion of the process 
		  of producing the digital items in the galleries see Brod (2002).)</p>
		<p class="normal">In the British Galleries project &#39;variety&#39; became the 
		  watchword of our interpretation.Ô We identified eight audiences (schools, 
		  further and higher education, local visitors, independent learners, 
		  ethnic minority groups, specialists amateur and professional, families 
		  and visitors from abroad) and four learning styles (analytical, common 
		  sense, experiential and imaginative). (For further information about 
		  learning styles see McCarthy and Pitman-Gelles (1999).) We planned the 
		  galleries so that visitors in any of the audience categories or who 
		  favoured a particular learning style could come to the galleries and 
		  find material that appealed to them.Ô So, for example, families or people 
		  with an experiential learning style could assemble a replica eighteenth-century 
		  chair, from components stored in racks in the discovery areas, and learn 
		  about its structure.Ô Alternatively analytical learners could use the 
		  British Galleries Online database to study, for example, glass or costume 
		  of a particular period.Ô Imaginative learners could choose to contribute 
		  a story, about a painting on display, to a file of typed examples left 
		  in the galleries. Schools, on the other hand, might opt to watch a video 
		  about the Great Exhibition, in a film room large enough to seat a whole 
		  class. Study of the Great Exhibition is part of the national curriculum, 
		  and the video helps pull together the many objects from the displays, 
		  and look at the historical evidence that they provide.</p>
		<p class="normal">The British Galleries have been well received because 
		  they look beautiful but also because there is something for everyone. 
		  We used an analysis of different learning styles and the needs of different 
		  visitor types to audit our interpretative ideas and come up with galleries 
		  that appeal to many at different levels. People are not excluded because 
		  their learning style differs from the norm in the institution or their 
		  needs are different to the next person or, worse, the mythical &#39;average 
		  visitor&#39;.</p>
		<p class="normal">I wish to apply some of the same principles to our website 
		  so that we provide a site with approaches to the collections suited 
		  to all needs and learning styles. We want variety. Just as people who 
		  prefer to use an analytical learning style may be comfortable in traditional 
		  museums so they will happily find their way round web information databases. 
		  But people with other learning styles may need different approaches, 
		  including interactivity and participation, so that the wonders of the 
		  content of the museum are open to them.Ô </p>
		<p class="normal">Like &#39;access&#39;, the word interactivity is used loosely. 
		  For some it means anything in a museum context making use of new media. 
		  To me it is any use of new media where the user can influence the outcome, 
		  although the degree of interactivity may be limited by the programme. 
		  Participation in a web context is a particular kind of interactivity 
		  which encourages a sense of involvement. Here outcome is dependent on 
		  the opportunities individuals have to exercise their imagination and 
		  creativity. </p>
		<p class="normal">For museums, interactivity and participation throw up 
		  problems related to expertise. Some kinds of interaction allow museums 
		  to retain control and to limit people to the &#39;right&#39; answers. Other 
		  kinds are much more open-ended and sometimes allow visitors to become 
		  the expert in areas where the museum has no expertise. Interaction and 
		  participation allow visitors to express opinions and even make wrong 
		  statements of fact. This is problematic to museums especially those 
		  that place a very high value on collections expertise. As &#39;seekers after 
		  truth&#39; can they allow inaccuracies to appear? Educators might not be 
		  entirely comfortable with inaccuracy but might argue that the learning 
		  experience derives from process not output. In addition observation 
		  shows that the ability to express an opinion in such public spaces generates 
		  very high levels of motivation and commitment in visitors, which is 
		  a highly desirable learning outcome. Because we are working in a new 
		  field there is little research to show what is going on.</p>
		<p class="normal">It is useful in developing our website to think of interactivity 
		  and participation as falling somewhere along a continuum that runs from 
		  the museum as expert to the visitor as expert. It is inevitable and 
		  appropriate that the majority of content on the site of a great national 
		  museum will fall at the museum as expert end of the spectrum. But we 
		  need to check that we incorporate some material from the other end of 
		  that line because it is here that we create opportunities for people 
		  with less specialist interest to become actively involved with the content 
		  of the museum. The V&amp;A website already has a range of sites that 
		  fall at different points on this line but it still needs more variety 
		  and the model will help us audit proposals, check the balance of our 
		  site and suggest future developments.</p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"><img src="durbin.fig1.gif" width="395" height="101"/></p>
		<p class="MsoCaption">Figure 1</p>
		<p class="normal">It is worth looking at the detail of some of these sites 
		  to understand the different ways in which they function and what the 
		  outcomes might be. There are three series of videos from the British 
		  Galleries on the site (http://www.vam.ac.uk). <i>Object in Focus </i>concentrates 
		  on details that cannot be seen in a conventional museum display, such 
		  as the insides of objects. <i>How Things Were Made</i> looks, for example, 
		  at the processes in water gilding or wallpaper production in the nineteenth 
		  century and a miscellaneous series introduces more general topics such 
		  as <i>Taking Tea</i> or the history of a pleasure garden.Ô They provide 
		  information through text and images and give a context to the individual 
		  object records in the database. They offer no interaction and the only 
		  choice for the user is whether to turn them on or off. They are therefore 
		  high in the museum acting as expert and very low in participation.</p>
		<p class="normal"><i>Opinions on Line</i> is another video programme. 
		  Here curators concentrate on sharing the techniques they have for analysing 
		  objects; our first example focuses on oriental carpets. They show visitors 
		  what to look for in their own objects.Ô Visitors are offered only a 
		  few choices of routes through the material but the aim is to provide 
		  them with skills and ways of looking that they can apply to their own 
		  objects at home. This is an activity very slightly higher than the last 
		  one on participation and although it has a very practical intention 
		  it still places the museum in the role of expert.</p>
		<p class="normal"><i>Explore a Painting</i> uses more intriguing options. 
		  One programme focuses on a small portrait of the family of Thomas More. 
		  Visitors can choose to scan the image or to zoom in on it or they can 
		  select themes such as costume or architecture and ask for more detail.Ô 
		  Unlike the videos, with this programme visitors have control over their 
		  route through the information and can make selections suited to their 
		  needs but the museum controls content. This activity is high on the 
		  museum acting as expert but offers increased levels of participation.</p>
		<p class="normal"><i>Style Quizzes</i> offer visitors a greater degree 
		  of interactivity. There are twenty-one different quizzes, each related 
		  to styles that appear in the British Galleries. The theme might be Neo-Classicism 
		  and ten questions flash up in random order. Where possible the quiz 
		  is presented visually so visitors are asked to select three from six 
		  objects to place in a neo-classical room or to choose one out of three 
		  motifs that is the odd one out. There is feedback. Visitors can return 
		  and see if their understanding has improved. The programme is fun and 
		  the quizzes are surprisingly the most used screens in the British Galleries. 
		  We have yet to track their use on the web. The programme has been set 
		  up as a template so we can add to the list of styles and we are starting 
		  with a quiz on Art Deco to complement the major exhibition that opens 
		  this Spring. The museum remains the expert and the visitor can learn 
		  what the museum knows. The degree of participation, however, is quite 
		  high. The score is the result of the visitors&#39; knowledge but the questions 
		  are closed and there is only one right answer.</p>
		<p class="normal">Increased degrees of participation have been made possible 
		  where gallery events have been developed in combination with a web element. 
		  <i>Festive Footage</i> was a gallery event that turned into the beginning 
		  of a series of activities with a web element. A photography exhibition 
		  called <i>Imperfect Beauty: The Making of Contemporary Fashion Photographs</i> 
		  was run in the Canon Photography Gallery. As an experiment visitors 
		  were invited to photograph their feet using a video camera set up for 
		  the purpose within the exhibition. These shots were displayed on a monitor 
		  outside the gallery and an archive of 2001 shoe fashion was created.Ô 
		  We were amazed that in the three weeks of the event over 3000 people 
		  took part and we observed that visitors approached the task with humour 
		  and creativity.Ô We saw this as a hugely successful museum event even 
		  though at first sight it may appear a little insignificant and frivolous. 
		  It is part of the mission of the V&amp;A that visitors should derive 
		  enjoyment from the collections and should be encouraged to develop their 
		  own creativity. Observation shows people who involve themselves and 
		  make a commitment are more likely to return or follow up their interests 
		  later.</p>
		<p class="normal">The next year we built in a web element from the outset.Ô 
		  This time the exhibition wasÔ <i>Seeing Things: Photographing Objects 
		  1850 - 2001</i>.Ô Part of the motivation for the exhibition was the acquisition 
		  by the V&amp;A of the chair that featured in the iconic photograph of 
		  Christine Keeler by Lewis Morley. For those too young or too distant 
		  to remember the events, Christine Keeler was the 1960s British professional 
		  equivalent of Monica Lewinski. Many people have subsequently appeared 
		  in a similar pose including Bart Simpson and Dame Edna Everage. This 
		  was too good an opportunity to miss. Our event was called <i>Things 
		  and You</i>. Using a replica chair we invited visitors to choose their 
		  own pose and record themselves. We now have about 5500 of these images 
		  on our website.</p>
		<p class="normal">This is the kind of activity where visitors have to 
		  go through the same process that an artist goes through. Given a chair 
		  and a person (or a whole family in some cases), how can they be arranged 
		  to bring out some of the character of the participant/s? Lewis Morley&#39;s 
		  contact prints from his photographic session were included in the exhibition 
		  and together with some discussion about how he arrived at the final 
		  image.Ô </p>
		<p class="normal">The results are wonderful.Ô Some people really entered 
		  into the spirit of things and display huge enthusiasm and creativity. 
		  A first time visitor to the V&amp;A returned twice to take further pictures.Ô 
		  On the second occasion she came without a bra intending to replicate 
		  the original pose but felt intimidated by the proximity of a warder 
		  on duty and had second thoughts.Ô So she came back on the last day of 
		  the exhibition with props to create a variant.Ô Another young girl took 
		  150 images of herself! Perhaps she was set on a modelling career and 
		  was using the opportunity to develop her portfolio. The chance to see 
		  their images displayed in public was highly motivating for many people 
		  and some very conventional looking V&amp;A visitors were seen rushing 
		  out of the gallery to stand and wait for their pictures to appear on 
		  the monitor outside.Ô We know that people were pleased to be appearing 
		  on the web because they phoned us up when the site moved on the web 
		  from Current Exhibitions to Past Exhibitions and they couldn&#39;t find 
		  their images. They may have lacked the technical skills to display their 
		  own pictures in cyberspace and they liked the idea of their photographs 
		  being validated on a museum site and they wanted to e-mail their friends 
		  with the site address to share their work. They were animated about 
		  the experience and talked and joked about what they might have done. 
		  The event had made an impact. In this activity the control of the outcome 
		  lay with the visitors but within the constraints of the set task. Expertise 
		  is shared, the museum providing information about the original picture 
		  whilst the visitors were the experts on the character they wanted to 
		  project. </p>
		<p class="normal"><i>Going Graphic</i> was our first major digital activity. 
		  It was run as a drop-in acivity to coincide with an exhibition called 
		  <i>The Power of the Poster</i>. Visitors were lent digital cameras and 
		  asked to create a poster for the V&amp;A to be put on our website. Having 
		  visited the exhibition and then taken their shots elsewhere in the museum 
		  they were encouraged to manipulate their images and add text. It is 
		  interesting to see how many people chose to put themselves in the picture. 
		  Tutoring on this occasion focused on how to use the software whereas 
		  now we have learnt to use simpler technology in order to spend more 
		  time on the central task. A subsequent similar activity was based on 
		  the nineteenth-century photography of Clementina, Lady Harwarden. <i>In 
		  Wish You Were Here</i> we asked visitors firstly to observe specific 
		  aspects of her work, such as the use of light and reflections and the 
		  relationship between the sitters, and then to try to include these in 
		  their own creative interpretations which were to be designed as e-postcards. 
		  These were uploaded to the web and sent to friends and family. It was 
		  very clear from the work people produced that the activity had made 
		  them to look closely and critically at the exhibition. It was also an 
		  ideal drop-in event because people could join in at their own level. 
		  It appealed to adults as much as to children and the web element was 
		  motivating and encouraged people to complete the task. I believe that 
		  these kinds of activities broaden the appeal of the Museum. They give 
		  people with experiential or problem solving learning styles ways into 
		  understanding the collections that gallery panels or website databases 
		  do not offer and so contribute broadening access. This type of activity 
		  is not an alternative to collection databases. It is an example of the 
		  way that providing variety opens up our museums.</p>
		<p class="normal">There is another benefit from participatory web activities 
		  that should not be overlooked. It is very easy for those of us who work 
		  in museums to forget or to find it hard to get at what motivates our 
		  visitors. Images from open-ended activities help us see the diversity 
		  of motivations that drive visitors and sometimes they show aims and 
		  intentions very different to the one the museum anticipated when a facility 
		  was first set up. When people put themselves in the picture they are 
		  demonstrating a desire for personal connection with the collections. 
		  Whole families wanted to record the occasion and share it with others. 
		  The girl who took 150 pictures of herself used the museum for her own 
		  career development. The museum experience occurs at the point where 
		  the agenda of the museum meets the agenda of the visitor. The experience 
		  may be an aesthetic one or an intellectual insight but our website allows 
		  us little glimpses of the variety of other experiences that occur or 
		  reasons people may be stimulated by a museum.</p>
		<p class="normal">Sometimes the web is used simply as a reward for effort.Ô 
		  We have a project where Young People create a museum newsletter. For 
		  the participants it is a hugely important activity and they are highly 
		  motivated by the idea of their work going on line. Educationally the 
		  process is more important than the outcome and the final work may not 
		  be very exciting for people browsing the web to look at.Ô I believe 
		  there should be a place for such activity on the web.</p>
		<p><span class="normal">Some participatory events occur only on the web. 
		  Storytelling takes a museum object as the starting point but is not 
		  reliant on museum expertise as it moves rapidly into the realms of fantasy. 
		  It may benefit from curatorial information but, because it is not dependent 
		  on it, storytelling is one of those activities that can be done at any 
		  level. A 5-year-old will be able to do and enjoy it at their level whereas 
		  an adult student of creative writing will be able to do it at theirs.Ô 
		  Here is an example, probably from a schoolchild, with a strangely modern 
		  ending, from our Sikh site:ÔÔÔ</span>ÔÔÔÔÔ </p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">Once Maharaja Gulab Singh was at home counting all 
		  his money. Then he thought that was boring so he went out in the street. 
		  While he was out he forgot to shut the door. So the men who were wandering 
		  around saw the door open. They went inside and saw all the money. They 
		  went back home and got bags and came back and stole all the money and 
		  took it back to their house. When Maharaja Gulab Singh came back he 
		  was astonished. He said, surprised, &#39;Where is all my money?&#39; He called 
		  the police but they said they can&#39;t do anything about it.</p>
		<p class="normal">We have on the V&amp;A website some sites where the 
		  visitor is the expert and is also in complete control of the outcome.Ô 
		  In our <i>History Project</i> we are currently inviting visitors to 
		  tell us about the last piece of furniture they bought. What was it? 
		  Where did they buy it? What the experience was like? What will the next 
		  piece of furniture be? This is building a museum archive for future 
		  use.Ô We plan to change the topic to eating and fashion in future. Apart 
		  from removing anything abusive, incomplete or irrelevant there is no 
		  museum intervention. The activity is open-ended and no one other than 
		  the person responding knows better about the subject than they do.</p>
		<p class="normal">One of our most successful events and related websites 
		  where again the role of expert lies with the visitor not the museum 
		  is our <i>Day of Record: Tattoos</i>. The event was run as part of the 
		  Contemporary Programme that aims to introduce new ways of working as 
		  well as to change the image of the museum. We have strong collections 
		  of fashion and accessories and developing information about body arts 
		  was planned as an extension to this. On the day 1500 people came to 
		  the museum to have their tattoos recorded and we now have a highly visited 
		  site, well known in the tattooing world. A subsequent event and website 
		  focused on black hair and nail fashions.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusion</h1>
		<p class="normal">At the V&amp;A we aim to create a site that has the 
		  same shimmering inspirational quality of the museum itself and that 
		  offers to a multitude of ways into understanding the collections for 
		  people of all backgrounds, learning styles and needs. Variety is the 
		  key to a site that encourages visitors, real and virtual, in their own 
		  creative development and including activities where the visitor takes 
		  on the role of expert is an important means of maintaining variety. 
		  We need more information about the collections but we also want to create 
		  excellence in interactivity and participation. Web development in general 
		  is handicapped by lack of research into the way people use museum websites 
		  and how they learn from objects through them. We would welcome collaboration 
		  with other museums or educational institutions to further this work.</p>
