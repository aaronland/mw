		<p class="PaperTitle">Explaining One of Mexico&#39;s Most Vital Musical Traditions: 
		  <i>The Corridos sin Fronteras </i>Traveling Exhibition and Educational 
		  Web Site</p>
		<p class="Author">Evelyn Figueroa, Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition 
		  Services, and Tim Songer, Interactive Knowledge, Inc., USA</p>
		<p class="URL"><a href="http://www.corridos.org/" target="_blank">http://www.corridos.org</a></p>
		<p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">Museums are fundamental for communities to protect 
		  their identity and for their cultural preservation. By expanding outreach 
		  efforts and providing the community with access to knowledge and information, 
		  museums contribute greatly to strengthening the communities&#39; capability 
		  to confront the challenges that 21<sup>st</sup> century globalization 
		  presents. A traveling exhibition organized by the Smithsonian Institution 
		  Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES) titled, Corridos sin Fronteras, 
		  includes an educational web site that is designed to archive and explain 
		  one of Mexico&#39;s musical and historical traditions, &#34;the corrido&#34; 
		  a Mexican folk ballad.</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">The Corridos web site (<a href="http://www.corridos.org/" target="_blank">www.corridos.org</a>) 
		  was designed and developed by Interactive Knowledge (IK). The site is 
		  completely bilingual and designed to make the content from the Corridos 
		  sin Fronteras exhibition widely accessible. One critical goal at the 
		  outset of the web site design project was to make sure that the content 
		  was regarded as the Mexican cultural treasure that it is. In order to 
		  do that, SITES insisted that the English and Spanish languages be treated 
		  as equal in importance to visitors to the site. One result is that the 
		  language can be switched on any screen. There is an option at the top 
		  of each screen that allows users to switch languages at will. </p>
		<p class="AbstractText">In this fast changing world, technology and the 
		  use of multimedia experiences in museums are effective and accessible 
		  solutions that help museums achieve their goals of community outreach 
		  and meeting the community&#39;s demands. This paper will address philosophical 
		  principles and practical applications on the use of multimedia experiences 
		  in museums. By using the exhibition Corridos sin Fronteras: A New World 
		  Ballad Tradition as a model, panelists will analyze technological and 
		  outreach strategies and the public&#39;s response to new multimedia learning 
		  experiences, and how it can enrich the museum experience for a diverse 
		  community.</p>

		<h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
		<p class="normal">In an era of globalization and diversity, museums confront 
		  great challenges when performing their social function as institutions 
		  for the diffusion of knowledge. One of these challenges is how museums 
		  can outreach and provide access to knowledge and education to a diverse 
		  population with complex cultural characteristics and traditions. How 
		  do museums represent cultural issues that by nature are dynamic and 
		  in continuous evolution, into a rationally planned and statically ordered 
		  format, and at the same time, spark visitor&#39;s curiosity, engage their 
		  participation and interaction and be culturally accurate and respectful? 
		  What educational experiences can we provide to the public that can enrich 
		  their lives and increase their understanding and appreciation of the 
		  society where they live?</p>
		<p class="normal">Multimedia experiences are effective tools, yet challenging 
		  ones, that museums can use to face and respond to the demands of a dynamic 
		  and complex society. This paper discusses the traveling exhibition and 
		  Web site project <i>Corridos sin fronteras, A New World Ballad Tradition.</i> 
		  It discusses philosophical, cultural, and practical principles, involved 
		  in the use of multimedia technology to enhance and expand the museum 
		  experience for visitors and to outreach and engage a diverse community.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">The Exhibition Project</h1>
		<p class="normal"><i>Corridos sin fronteras: A New World Ballad Tradition 
		  </i>is a music-based, interactive traveling exhibition, organized by 
		  the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES), on 
		  tour throughout the United States until the year 2005. The exhibition 
		  explores the <i>corrido</i> tradition in the New World and the significance 
		  of this popular oral convention as an expression of community life, 
		  tracing its historical development in the New World over the past two 
		  hundred years. <i>Corridos</i> are narrative songs or ballads whose 
		  characters, events, and themes are representative of the values and 
		  history of local communities in Mexico and the United States. In <i>corrido</i> 
		  stories, topics range from the history of Mexican revolutionary heroes, 
		  to a woman who shoots her lover because he is about to leave her, to 
		  a local hero who dies attempting to save a town of thousands of people. 
		  These ballads have survived through centuries and will continue to be 
		  passed down to successive generations. </p>
		<p class="normal">Fully bilingual (Spanish/English), <i>Corridos Sin Fronteras</i> 
		  (Ballads without Borders) re-creates the historical development of the 
		  <i>corrido</i> through vintage and modern recordings, broadsides, photographs, 
		  posters, musical instruments, and other treasured memorabilia. <i>Corridos</i> 
		  recordings can be heard throughout the exhibition, through a state-of-the-art 
		  audio wand system and interactive units, allowing visitors to embark 
		  on a musical and visual journey through stories sung in Mexico and United 
		  States communities. </p>

		<p class="normal">Figueroa.fig1.jpg)</p>
		<p class="normal">SITES organized the exhibition in collaboration with 
		  the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center and the Smithsonian Center 
		  for Latino Initiatives. The exhibition goals are:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1"> <span class="normal">To increase knowledge and 
			understanding of the <i>Corrido</i> tradition as an important and 
			rich cultural expression of the largest Latino groups (Mexican, Mexican 
			American or Chicano) among the diverse population of the United States.</span></div>
		</li>
		<li><span class="normal">To outreach and provide access to the exhibition 
		  and the exhibition subject matter to Latino and non-Latino audiences 
		  in the United States and abroad.</span></li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1"> <span class="normal">Through education, cultural 
			knowledge, and creativity, stimulate and encourage among the younger 
			generations the cultural preservation of this important oral history 
			tradition for future generations.</span></div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p class="normal">To fulfill SITES&#39; educational mission, each exhibition 
		  is accompanied by an educational component to outreach broad national 
		  and international audiences. In many instances, these educational components 
		  follow traditional formats (education resource guides, education trunks, 
		  teacher and student manuals) which are distributed to exhibitors on 
		  the exhibition tour and used by them to plan and develop education and 
		  outreach programs for their local communities. As a music-based, multimedia 
		  exhibition, <i>Corridos sin fronteras</i> presented a great challenge 
		  for SITES: how to develop an education component geared toward national 
		  and international diverse audiences that would be creative, multi-sensorial, 
		  interactive, engaging, visually and linguistically accessible, multifunctional 
		  and rich in information, could provide a rich, engaging and complete 
		  exhibition experience for visitors, and would give longevity to the 
		  exhibition. While fulfilling all of these goals, its production would 
		  not exceed the project&#39;s limited budget. In addition, the education 
		  component needed to follow ADA requirements for accessibility and national 
		  education standards in order to be used by school systems throughout 
		  the country.</p>
		<p class="normal">To meet this challenge SITES decided to explore and 
		  use multimedia technology, a medium flexible enough to accommodate all 
		  the above requirements and capable of expanding the concept of a &#34;real 
		  museum visit&#34;. To that purpose SITES consulted, commissioned and worked 
		  very closely with Interactive Knowledge, Inc to conceptualize and create 
		  the educational multimedia interactive web site <i>Corridos sin Fronteras, 
		  </i>available at <a href="http://www.corridos.org/" target="_blank">www.corridos.org</a>.

		<p class="MsoCaption"> Fig. 2 The Home Page of the <i>Corridos sin Fronteras 
		  </i>web site. </p>
		<p class="SubHeader">Corridos sin Fronteras: The Web Site</p>
		<p class="normal">To kick off the development of the <i>Corridos</i> web 
		  site, Interactive Knowledge, Inc (IK)&#39;s Vice President for Design and 
		  Development, Chuck Barger participated in a 2-day exhibit design meeting 
		  in December 2000. This meeting included representatives from around 
		  the US who were working on any aspect of the project, including curators, 
		  public relations, marketing, exhibit designers, audiovisual consultants, 
		  fabrication, consultants on Latino issues, video producers, educators 
		  and the web site design and production. The meeting&#39;s goal was to examine 
		  all parts of the project components as a whole entity. IK left the meeting 
		  with a list of site requirements, a preliminary exhibit script, a CD 
		  of recorded music, and a variety of images and support text materials. 
		  (Note: This meeting took place on a consultation basis) </p>
		<p class="normal">Back in the office, the IK design team studied SITES&#39; 
		  requests and the initial content. In January 2001, IK produced an initial 
		  site flowchart, design document and budget. IK submitted the materials 
		  to SITES for review. Through phone conversations and e-mails the final 
		  design concept and budget were refined and agreed upon. </p>
		<p class="normal">In the months to follow, SITES concentrated on producing 
		  the exhibit and raising the financial resources needed for the production 
		  of the web site. When funds were secured, IK wrote a &#34;Statement 
		  of Work&#34; document and submitted it to SITES who began the contracting 
		  process. A contract was signed in September 2001 and work began immediately. 
		  IK traveled to Washington, at the invitation of SITES, to present the 
		  initial design, navigation, and sample interactions to the design team 
		  in October. (Note that because of funding issues and an adjustment of 
		  the exhibition traveling schedule the exhibition would open before the 
		  web site went live.)</p>
		<p class="normal">From October to March, IK continued work on the site. 
		  Through phone, e-mail and express mail services, SITES delivered text, 
		  music, video, and images to the web design team. SITES reviewed and 
		  commented on the process by viewing screen captures, presented as printouts 
		  and an &#34;under development&#34; web site. This method of virtual 
		  meetings worked well for both the developer and the client since it 
		  forced a high level of organization and accountability on the project. 
		  IK kept a running, numbered list of its information / image / translation 
		  requests and were able at any given time to know the status of content 
		  items still needed and sections that were ready for review. In February 
		  2002, IK traveled to DC for another design team meeting to present the 
		  web site and bring back the last batch of content.</p>
		<p class="normal">Throughout the project, text was first written and edited 
		  in English. When a final draft of the English text was available, IK 
		  created a Word document with two identical tables. One table held the 
		  English text sections. The other table was empty. The document was emailed 
		  to the Corridos Project Director, Evelyn Figueroa for final review and 
		  editing. Once Evelyn completed her final edit of the English text, she 
		  translated each section to Spanish. The Spanish text was inserted in 
		  the empty table directly opposite the translated English text. As each 
		  document received final sign off and translation from the client, it 
		  was returned to IK. These documents were copied into the web site&#39;s 
		  content management system and became the source of the dynamic, bilingual 
		  experience that visitors to the site enjoy. Every English word on the 
		  site was translated, including button text, all directions, instructional 
		  and informational text, photo captions, video subtitles as well as the 
		  lyrics to all twenty <i>corridos</i>.</p>
		<p class="normal">In the first week of April 2002, SITES conducted its 
		  sign-off review and the site went live the following week. A gala and 
		  media event were planned in the Smithsonian&#39;s Arts and Industry Building 
		  (where the exhibition was installed) for the launch. Since that time, 
		  the exhibit has traveled around the country. The web site has been an 
		  integral part of the museum experience at each venue. A number of goals 
		  were established for the web site project that are currently being evaluated.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">Web Site Goals</h2>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Develop an educational web site that prepares 
			visitors who will see the exhibit, but includes a rich and engaging 
			experience for those who will not </div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Create a fully bilingual site that includes 
			easy access to both English and Spanish text on every screen</div>
		</li>
		<li> Use the art and artifacts included in the exhibit as an integral 
		  part of the graphic and animation design</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Deliver high quality streaming audio and 
			video. This is a music site and requires high speed Internet access 
			(DSL or cable modem) or a reasonable amount of patience from users 
			who have 56K modems.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Create a user-friendly, expandable database 
			that can be the definitive source of both scholarly and popular information 
			on <i>corridos</i></div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Create an easy to use, password protected, 
			data base administration site where staff at each museum that hosts 
			the exhibition can add, edit and delete information about the exhibition 
			and public programs at their venue </div>
		</li>
	  </ul>

		<h2 class="SubHeader">Features of the <i>Corridos Sin Fronteras</i> Web 
		  Site</h2>
		<p class="normal">The site is divided into three major categories plus 
		  additional sections including a bilingual Glossary, lesson plans for 
		  Teachers and a growing Resources section.</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Learn about Corridos </h3>
		<p class="normal">This section opens with the option to view four short 
		  video clips that have been re-purposed from a documentary film that 
		  was produced for the exhibit. The clips introduce corridos as an art 
		  form and highlight the importance of corridos to the Mexican culture 
		  in the past and the present. The main activity in this section is viewing 
		  and interacting with an historical timeline that begins with the Spanish 
		  conquest of the New World and continues to the present day. The timeline 
		  features detailed information on over thirty critical events and concepts. 
		  Visitors to this section can learn about corridos by reading text, looking 
		  at photographs, hearing complete corridos, and viewing video. </p>

		  includes four corridos. Visitors to this section can read about each 
		  of the sixteen corrido&#39;s history, view photos and video related to the 
		  corrido, listen to the entire song, or choose an option titled Sing 
		  Along. The Sing Along feature plays the entire corrido using streaming 
		  audio while each stanza is displayed (in Spanish with an English translation) 
		  in time with the music. This unique approach assures that both English 
		  and Spanish speaking visitors to the site can understand and appreciate 
		  the wonderful stories told in each of the featured songs. </p>

		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Write Your Own Corrido</h3>
		<p class="normal">Anyone visiting the site will be inspired by the rich 
		  history and beautiful music of corridos. Because this art form is from 
		  the folk tradition, it is accessible to anyone who is moved by the struggles 
		  of common people. An important educational goal of the web site is to 
		  provide visitors with the experience of writing their own corrido. This 
		  section introduces an original, contemporary corrido that is used as 
		  a model for writing a new corrido. A visitor to this section of the 
		  site can review the corrido music and compose a corrido one stanza at 
		  a time. An easy to use online form displays the corrido structure and 
		  provides a simple word processor utility for budding composers to use. 
		  The final product of this section is one (or more) printed original 
		  corridos that can be sung accompanied by an instrumental corridos tune.</p>

		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Glossary</h3>
		<p class="normal">An online, bilingual glossary provides one-click-away 
		  information on 30 terms pertinent to the content of the site. In addition 
		  to providing background information, the glossary directs users to places 
		  on the site where they can get more information on the selected topic. 
		</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">For Teachers</h3>
		<p class="normal">This section contains lesson plans (PDFs) and suggestions 
		  on how to use the web site in the classroom. Lesson plans, for older 
		  elementary, middle and high school students, contain activities that 
		  integrate the content into the language arts, social studies and geography 
		  curriculum.  This section also provides practical suggestions that 
		  classroom teachers can use to incorporate the web site into classroom 
		  activities for ESL, EFL, and music.</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Resources</h3>
		<p class="normal">The Resources section is one of the most dynamic areas 
		  of this web site. Because the Corridos exhibit is scheduled to travel 
		  through 2005, SITES wanted to assure that current content was available 
		  on the site long after IK completed it&#39;s development work. The Resources 
		  section is a bilingual database that includes detailed information on 
		  a wide variety of topics related to Corridos including, Films and Videos, 
		  Musical Recordings, Speakers, Performers, Online Articles, Books and 
		  Publications, and Web Links. Visitors to the site can browse any of 
		  these topic areas and sort the list of information in a number of useful 
		  ways. The database includes hundreds of links to additional Corridos-related 
		  content that is available on the Internet. In addition, anyone can suggest 
		  a new resource from this section of the site. The database was initially 
		  populated with content suggested by the Chicano Studies Research Center 
		  at UCLA. New resources are being suggested weekly by visitors to the 
		  site. SITES staff review these suggestions and upload the most appropriate 
		  new resources using a convenient back-end site management tool.</p>
		<h2 class="normal"><i><span class="SubHeader">Corridos</span></i><span class="SubHeader"> 
		  Web Site and Public Access </span></h2>
		<p class="normal">One of SITES responsibilities is to provide cultural 
		  access through accurate interpretation of cultural issues in its exhibition 
		  projects and educational components. To that effect, it is crucial to 
		  include accurate representation of the voices of culture in order to 
		  achieve a successful exhibition presentation, provide an effective education 
		  service, and receive a positive response from the public and the community. 
		  Both, the <i>Corridos</i> exhibition and Web site were carefully developed, 
		  using primary community resources and extensive curatorial consultation 
		  to ensure the inclusion and correct interpretation of the <i>corrido</i> 
		  tradition and the cultural issues related to it, and as such, guaranteeing 
		  the access of correct cultural information for Latino and Non-Latino 
		  audiences. </p>
		<p class="normal"><i>Corridos</i> are songs, music, and oral history, 
		  full of life, drama, and passion that reflect complex layers of Latino 
		  history, cultural expressions and idiosyncrasies. The semantic expressed 
		  in these songs can&#39;t be constrained within the physical and sometimes 
		  static space of an exhibition. By creating a multimedia experience in 
		  both the exhibition and the Web Site component, SITES has been able 
		  to covey the complex cultural layers and identity of Mexican and Mexican 
		  American cultures contained in <i>corridos. </i>By using multimedia, 
		  SITES has been able to offer to the public, a multisensorial experience 
		  and at the same time convey many layers of cultural information. The 
		  use of multimedia also provides choices to visitors who respond to the 
		  experience based on age, education level, or cultural background.</p>
		<p class="normal">As in the exhibition, the Web site <i>Corridos sin fronteras</i> 
		  reflects the dynamic nature of <i>corridos</i> as a form of oral history 
		  and as expression of cultural evolution. It also translates the cross 
		  cultural similarities of the <i>corrido</i> tradition, providing a sense 
		  of place where visitors can go not only to find information about <i>corridos</i>, 
		  but also where they can find and experience something familiar or of 
		  interest to them, regardless of their cultural background or ethnic 
		  origin. The comments by a German visitor to the exhibition during its 
		  presentation at the Smithsonian Institution reflect very well this concept:</p>
	  </div>
	  <blockquote>
		<div class="Section1">&#34; I learned about the exhibition through the web site 
		  and it stroked a familiar cord, the music and the ways in which we [Germans] 
		  do things.  When I came to the exhibition I just wanted to dance and 
		  celebrate as I used to do in my country.&#34;<span class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> 
		  <i>(Corridos Visitor Comments Book, April 10, 2002)</i> </span></div>
	  </blockquote>
	  <div class="Section1">
		<p class="normal">Another level of access achieved by the <i>Corridos</i> 
		  Web site is the equal linguistic accessibility for visitors.  The Web 
		  site is fully bilingual (Spanish / English) and provides visitors with 
		  instant access to text in either language.  This linguistic element 
		  is crucial for reaching all levels of Latino population nationally and 
		  internationally.  Language is a common thread among Latino cultures 
		  in the United States and a large percentage of Latinos still face language 
		  barriers.  The <i>Corridos</i> Web site provides the opportunity for 
		  Latinos to &#34;feel closer to home&#34;, sparking their interest and facilitating 
		  a new learning experience among a population for which historically, 
		  museums have been outside of their life experience. </p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"><img src="songer_Figueroa.fig6.jpg" width="400" height="237"/></p>
		<p class="MsoCaption"> Fig. 6 Visitors to the <i>Corridos sin Fronteras 
		  </i>web site can view the site in English or Spanish   or switch between 
		  languages on any screen, instantly.</p>
		<p class="normal">The same linguistic barriers exist in countries in Latin 
		  America, where English as a language, is not included in traditional 
		  education systems.  During a visit to El Salvador in Central America 
		  in November 2002, we had the opportunity to exchange professional experiences 
		  with a large group of museum professionals from public and private museums 
		  who expressed their frustration when using the Internet, because &#34;everything 
		  is in English&#34; and therefore, not accessible for them as they don&#39;t 
		  know the language.  In an interview on November 5, 2002 with Mauricio 
		  Granados, Director of the Patronato Pro Patrimonio Cultural de El Salvador 
		  (Foundation for the Preservation of the Cultural Patrimony of El Salvador), 
		  he expressed:</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote"> &#34;In El Salvador and all Latin America we have a great 
		  need for bilingual Internet information. The great thing about the <i>Corridos</i> 
		  web site is that I could understand the information presented because 
		  it is also in the Spanish language.  I was able to identify myself with 
		  the subject of <i>corridos</i> because in El Salvador, we also have 
		  a <i>corrido</i> tradition. It was great to learn how similar are Mexico 
		  and El Salvador&#39;s oral history traditions.&#34; </p>
		<p class="normal">Access to information should not be limited only to 
		  the use of technology.  It must also provide linguistic accessibility 
		  to facilitate the understanding of the information.  The <i>Corridos</i> 
		  web site performs this function very effectively and it is a great tool 
		  to provide a &#34;<i>Corrido</i> museum experience&#34; to a bilingual worldwide 
		  community.</p>
		<p class="normal">In the world of cyberspace intricacies, the <i>Corridos</i> 
		  web site is a functional tool for technical access.  The graphic design 
		  of the site is simple, yet effective for a wide audience from sophisticated 
		  users to children and adults who are new to the Internet.  Many Corridos 
		  fans in the United States and Latin America are viewing the <i>Corridos</i> 
		  site because of their love for the topic, not because the Internet is 
		  a common source of information for them.  Interactive Knowledge has 
		  over fifteen years experience designing educational software for a broad 
		  audience from college students to low-literate adults.  Each screen 
		  on the <i>Corridos </i>site is designed to offer clear choices.  The 
		  navigation is simple and options are clear.  The addition of a bilingual 
		  option has opened this site to a much larger audience than other Smithsonian 
		  web sites have been able to reach.</p>
		<p class="normal">As part of a U.S. Congressional requirement, all exhibition 
		  projects produced by SITES must comply with the American Disability 
		  Act (ADA). SITES&#39; compliance with ADA accessibility requirements expands 
		  to the creation of Web sites.  The <i>Corridos </i>web site includes 
		  several features that greatly increase the accessibility of the site 
		  including, large font sizes in many of the sections; contrasting color 
		  palette for color-blind accessibility; and high contrast between text 
		  and background for readability.  The site uses pop-up windows extensively 
		  to allow access to a large amount of content with very little navigation.  
		  Whenever a pop-up window appears, the background is masked with a grey 
		  overlay to emphasize the content in the window and minimize any possibility 
		  of background/foreground confusion for visitors with poor eyesight.  
		  Though the site uses Flash, the lyrics to all of the <i>corridos </i>used 
		  in the site are available via HTML.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader"><i>Corridos</i> Web Site and its multiple educational 
		  functions</h2>
		<p class="normal">The primary purpose of the <i>Corridos </i>Web Site 
		  is to introduce a broad and diverse audience to the rich history, evolution, 
		  and cultural value of the <i>corrido</i> tradition in Mexican and United 
		  States communities.  As the educational component of SITES exhibition, 
		  it should be used both to expand and enhance the content of the exhibition 
		  and to bring a rich museum experience into the school classroom.</p>
		<p class="normal"><i>Corridos</i> Web site is fundamental to education, 
		  both supplementing on-site visits and making resources accessible for 
		  distance learning. In the museum context, the Web Site multimedia capabilities 
		  enhance the museum experience for the visitor by providing additional 
		  detailed information not included in the exhibition due to space constrains. 
		  It also extends the visitor&#39;s <i>corrido</i> experience outside the 
		  museum environment, allowing him/her to continue enjoying his favorites 
		  <i>corridos</i> as desired.  This extended enjoyable multimedia educational 
		  experience is also geared toward groups and families within the home 
		  environment.   </p>
		<p class="normal">Successful exhibitions are educational documents that 
		  make important intellectual statements on a particular subject.  As 
		  the first exhibition about <i>corridos</i> oral history tradition that 
		  has ever been produced, <i>Corridos sin fronteras</i> and its Web site 
		  are groundbreaking tools for research and for building upon the data 
		  they represent.  Moreover, <i>corridos</i> are a rich multimedia archive 
		  of information and a collection of oral history, available to national 
		  and international public. The collection of <i>corridos</i> included 
		  in <i>Corridos sin Fronteras</i> is a comprehensive compilation of the 
		  classic and best samples of this important oral tradition, represented 
		  within an accurate historical and social context.  The use of multimedia 
		  facilitates the growth of this collection as the music genre evolves, 
		  provides enough &#34;space&#34; for the augmentation of its rich historical 
		  and social context and documentation, and makes it available for public 
		  use.</p>
		<p class="normal">The <i>Corridos</i> Web site is an excellent multimedia 
		  resource center that provides access to academic research produced by 
		  the Chicano Studies Research Center of UCLA, scholarly research performed 
		  by scholars throughout the country, and many other academic resources 
		  that, otherwise, are scattered and inaccessible.  The Web site links 
		  these resources and makes them accessible to schools, students, universities, 
		  professors and many others who need to access basic information and 
		  resources on the <i>corrido</i> tradition for their investigation work 
		  on the subject.  A good model of the effectiveness of using multimedia 
		  in the academic environment is presented by the Department of Spanish 
		  and Portuguese of the University of New Mexico, where a new course of 
		  studies focusing on the <i>corrido</i> tradition was offered in the 
		  Fall 2002, for which both, the <i>Corridos</i> exhibition and its multimedia 
		  Web site were used.  By using this multimedia tool right in the classroom, 
		  the students had a great opportunity to learn about the <i>corrido</i> 
		  tradition from different perspectives and had a rich &#34;museum experience&#34; 
		  in the academic environment.</p>
		<p class="normal">By virtue of their nature, exhibitions have short lives 
		  -- <i>Corridos</i> has a three year tour with eleven 12-weeks presentation 
		  periods in each community until 2005.  The educational interactive Web 
		  Site plays an important role in extending the longevity of the exhibition 
		  after it closes by continuing to offer a &#34;multimedia museum experience&#34; 
		  to the communities throughout the nation.  This longevity factor is 
		  fundamental for schools where teachers and students will be able to 
		  still enjoy the exhibition and to learn about <i>corridos</i> through 
		  the multimedia website.  </p>
		<p class="normal">As schools in the United States and other countries 
		  move into a new age in the use of technology in classrooms, there is 
		  a need for high quality educational programs that can enrich the classroom 
		  experience and that can be multidisciplinary in function. Teachers are 
		  eager to get access to ready-to-use educational materials and new multimedia 
		  resources that can enrich and augment the classroom experience for their 
		  student.  The <i>Corridos </i>multimedia<i> </i>Web site offers an important 
		  multidisciplinary tool that provides contextual information, audiovisual 
		  materials, ready-to-use lesson plans, interactive activities and many 
		  other resources that meet national education standards.</p>
		<p class="normal">As an education resource, the use of the web site is 
		  applicable to music, history, social studies, Spanish, literature and 
		  many other disciplines that are taught from sixth-grade to university 
		  level. It is also a great resource for homework and extra-curricular 
		  activities for students.  The inclusion of the <i>Corridos </i>website 
		  in school curricula is a great alternative for teachers and educators.  
		  The site is designed for individualized instruction and can help teachers 
		  who are stretched to respond to class demands, constraint of time for 
		  lesson preparation, and school budgetary cuts that reduce the access 
		  to resources.   </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">Web Site Implementation and  Results from the Field    
		</h2>
		<p class="normal"><i>Corridos sin fronteras </i>opened at the Smithsonian 
		  Institution in February 2002, where it was presented for a period of 
		  ten weeks.  Since then, it has traveled, on a 12-week-showing period, 
		  to three institutions, the Mexican Heritage Plaza in San Jose, CA, the 
		  Museo de las Am ricas in Denver, CO, and to the Witte Museum in San 
		  Antonio, TX.   In each of these institutions the <i>Corridos</i> website 
		  was integrated as another component of the exhibition presentation, 
		  enhancing the visitor&#39;s multimedia learning experience and providing 
		  an additional interactive component. All of the institutions planned 
		  and implemented education programs around the web site to augment and 
		  enrich the &#34;museum experience&#34; for visitors.  </p>
		<p class="normal">At the Smithsonian Institution, the website was located 
		  in a section of the exhibition called &#34;Education Center.&#34;  Teachers 
		  and museum educators used this section to teach school groups about 
		  the <i>corrido </i>tradition during their visit to the gallery. Another 
		  successful program was the implementation of the Web site&#39;s &#34;Write Your 
		  Own Corrido&#34; section into a <i>Corrido</i> Children&#39;s Workshop.  During 
		  this event, children composed their own <i>corridos</i> and then, they 
		  performed their compositions during a <i>Corrido</i> Performance with 
		  a group of <i>corridistas</i> (corrido musicians), held at the Smithsonian 
		  Discovery Theater (children&#39;s theater) on March 23, 2002.</p>
		<p class="normal">During the exhibition presentation at the Mexican Heritage 
		  Plaza in San Jose, CA,  from May-August 2002, teachers developed special 
		  activity worksheets with questions and answers based on the <i>Corridos</i> 
		  website, which were to be completed by the students during their visit 
		  to the exhibition.   In addition, the museum has a permanent class schedule 
		  for classes that focused on the <i>corrido</i> tradition that were taught 
		  using the multimedia website.</p>
		<p class="normal">The C<i>orridos </i>website is now a permanent component 
		  of the regular schedule of education and outreach programs at the Museo 
		  de las Am ricas in Denver, CO.  The museum has created a computer room 
		  designated for the use of the <i>Corridos</i> website on a regular basis, 
		  where they provide access and a multimedia learning experience to students 
		  and teachers. </p>
		<p class="normal">At the moment of writing this article, <i>Corridos sin 
		  fronteras</i> is being presented at the Witte Museum in San Antonio, 
		  TX.  As part of this presentation, SITES has developed a precedent setting 
		  and unique collaboration with the Witte Museum and The Alameda Center 
		  for the development of a <i>Corridos</i> Teacher&#39;s workshop.  This collaboration 
		  will train teachers from the San Antonio region and other cities around 
		  the state of Texas, on how to use the multimedia <i>Corridos</i> website 
		  and integrate it in schools and classrooms.  Schools and a large amount 
		  of teachers and educators have expressed great interest and need to 
		  learn more about integrating the <i>Corridos </i>website and multimedia 
		  experiences in schools classrooms, libraries, cultural centers, and 
		  other educational institutions.  This response reflects how receptive 
		  and interested school systems are toward the inclusion of multimedia 
		  and interaction in the classroom in order to provide new alternatives 
		  for teaching and learning.  It also reflects the existent need on the 
		  part of schools and other educational institutions across the nation, 
		  to have access to high quality and engaging educational products that 
		  can outreach to students, diverse audiences and the community. </p>
		<p class="normal">The exhibition <i>Corridos sin fronteras: A New Ballad 
		  Tradition</i> and its educational web site are more than just an exhibition 
		  project.  They are engaging multimedia experiences that reaches out 
		  beyond the museum&#39;s walls in stimulating formats, increasing understanding 
		  and knowledge among the community about a the unique Latino cultural 
		  expression.  By conveying information using multimedia, the <i>Corridos</i> 
		  web site offers many layers of interpretive and contextual information 
		  that help a worldwide audience learn and understand about the <i>corrido</i> 
		  tradition from different perspectives.  The use of multimedia in its 
		  exhibition and educational products is a fundamental tool to help SITES 
		  achieve its mission of increasing and diffusing knowledge among a broad 
		  and diverse audience.  It is also a great element to improve and expand 
		  cultural understanding and encourage the preservation of Latino traditions.</p>
