		<p class="PaperTitle">Re-assessing Practice: visual art, visually impaired 
		  people and the Web </p>
		<p class="Author">Caro Howell, Tate Modern and<i> </i>Dan Porter, Freelance 
		  Web Developer/Art Historian, United Kingdom</p>
		<p class="URL"><a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/imap/" target="_blank">http://www.tate.org.uk/imap/</a></p>
		<p class="AbstractTitle"> Abstract</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">Interpretation for visually impaired people in art 
		  museums is dominated by an emphasis on the tactile and the physically 
		  immediate. In practice, this seemingly logical approach often keeps 
		  blind and partially sighted people at an intellectual distance from 
		  art works and their artistic context. For over-reliance on a tactile 
		  approach has the effect of making sculpture the primary vehicle for 
		  accessing art, despite the fact that &#34;touchable&#34; sculpture 
		  represents only a tiny fraction of Western art as represented in museums 
		  and galleries. Moreover, in this display context &#34;touchable&#34;, 
		  by definition, means robust, indicating traditional materials such as 
		  bronze and stone. Yet like traditional narrative and figurative subject 
		  matter, bronze and stone cease to hold sway in twentieth century art. 
		  How then can someone who is congenitally blind be given intellectual 
		  access to non-tactile artworks that are not artefacts, that do not have 
		  clear descriptive relationships to objects and experiences from the 
		  lived world and that refer to and are of an about themselves only?</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">This was the starting point for research that began 
		  four years ago at Tate Modern, London&#39;s new national museum of modern 
		  art. The latest development to come out of this on-going research is 
		  i-Map art resources for blind and partially sighted people that are 
		  delivered online. Currently i-Map explores the work of Matisse and Picasso, 
		  their innovations, influences and personal motivations, as well as key 
		  concepts in modern art. Aimed at partially sighted and blind people 
		  with a general interest in art as well as art teachers and their visually 
		  impaired pupils, i-Map incorporates text, image enhancement and deconstruction, 
		  animation and raised images. Importantly, i-Map transformed a gallery-based 
		  practice that involved intensive 1:1 delivery, into an entirely new 
		  way of deconstructing art online and one where the user has the necessary 
		  tools to work independently. Moreover, i-Map goes beyond straight description, 
		  attempts to simulate purely visual experiences and the usual focus on 
		  &#34;what?&#34; in favour of exploring the &#34;why?&#34; of art 
		  so that visually impaired users can make their own critical judgments.</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">Visually impaired people use the Web in conjunction 
		  with screen reader software to obtain information, visually impaired 
		  people often find travel complicated and stressful, visually impaired 
		  children are usually in mainstream education and all schools in the 
		  UK are online. The process of reassessing the parameters and definitions 
		  of art education for visually impaired people revealed the Web to be 
		  an ideal vehicle for increasing intellectual access and delivering effective 
		  interpretation in a format that offers autonomy of exploration. However, 
		  in order for a project such as i-Map to confidently defy received Web 
		  design wisdom and develop tailor made solutions, it&#39;s content needs 
		  to be the product of successful methodology and focussed research. It 
		  is possible to provide blind and partially sighed people with intellectual 
		  access to any artwork and the Web offers enormous potential to do assist 
		  in this process. In attempting to achieve this, i-Map can provide useful 
		  practical and pedagogical pointers.</p>

		<p class="SubHeader">Introduction</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">&#39;I was born blind, as a child I had a little sight, 
		  enough to see light and dark and a few colours, though not enough to 
		  see pictures or perceive any kind of object other than its mass.<i> 
		  </i>Therefore, the concept of visual art is quite new to me and, although 
		  I&#39;ve been through some of these descriptions a couple of times I don&#39;t 
		  think Io:&#39;ve grasped some of the finer points as some of the ideas strike 
		  me as very visual. I hope to be able to appreciate these concepts more 
		  in future by thinking about them and talking to other people.&#39;<i> </i></p>

	  <blockquote>
		<div class="Section1">This was a comment emailed to us via i-Map&#39;s feedback 
		  form. i-Map is an online project designed to give blind and partially 
		  sighted people access to the work of Matisse and Picasso. What is striking 
		  about this person&#39;s comment is the familiarity of the response. How 
		  many of us have had exactly that reaction when looking at art, especially 
		  modern art? The feeling that you&#39;re missing the point, but the sense 
		  that thinking it over and talking to others will clarify things. For 
		  Caro Howell and Dan Porter , the creators i-Map, this comment (and others 
		  like it) also suggests that our ambitions for the project have been 
		  realised, namely that a blind person has independently engaged with 
		  and thought about visual art without having to physically touch it. 
		</div>
	  </blockquote>
	  <div class="Section1">
		<p class="normal">i-Map came about as a result of work done by Caro Howell 
		  at Tate Modern with visually impaired people. Tate Modern is the UK&#39;s 
		  national museum of modern art. It opened in 2000 and Caro was part of 
		  a small team who in 1997 began developing a pre-opening public programme 
		  for Tate Modern and post-opening exhibitions, displays, education and 
		  interpretation. Part of her brief was to consider issues of physical 
		  and intellectual access. From experience she knew that traditional gallery 
		  education programmes for visually impaired audiences were not going 
		  to succeed at the new museum since they focused on touch, either through 
		  the use of dedicated handling collections, or, more often, through the 
		  supervised handling of artworks considered suitable by conservation 
		  staff. </p>
		<p class="normal">Tate Modern shows art from 1900 to the present day, so 
		  the number of robust sculptures suitable for handling and on display 
		  at any one time is very low. Moreover, the gallery is huge &#34; the building 
		  is a former power station &#34; and displays are shown over three floors. 
		  So cherry picking only &#39;touchable&#39; artworks would turn a visit into 
		  a forced march. Of primary importance though, was the issue of intellectual 
		  access. How were visually impaired people to engage with and understand 
		  the radical developments that have taken place in Western art since 
		  1900, if they were only ever to experience three dimensional works and 
		  then only in bronze and stone? </p>
		<p class="SubHeader">Project History</p>
		<p class="normal">In 1999 Caro began working with a group of visually impaired 
		  adults who had different degrees of impairment and different experiences 
		  of art, to explore language as an interpretative tool. In addition to 
		  guided tours, Tate Modern was planning self-directed audio tours for 
		  visually impaired visitors and Caro was interested in exploring different 
		  approaches to audio description. Traditional methods used in the theatre 
		  are neutral and objective. This approach is suitable if audio description 
		  merely fills in the contextualising gaps around the actors&#39; dialogue, 
		  but it&#39;s clearly unsuitable for describing even figurative art. </p>
		<p class="normal">The group worked with sculptures that could be explored 
		  through touch, but with the aim of creating a blueprint for interpreting 
		  art that couldn&#39;t be touched. Since the group&#39;s day-to-day experience 
		  of touch was pragmatic (as it is for most visually impaired people), 
		  initially their automatic descriptive responses to tactile sensations 
		  tended to be generalised and unimaginative &#34; warm, rough, big etc. So 
		  creative writers and performance poets were brought in to help them 
		  experiment with different structures and methods of description. These 
		  writers enabled the group to explore language as they explored different 
		  tactile sensations, to think, feel and articulate creatively. The challenge 
		  that emerged was how to describe with accurate particularity. In other 
		  words, identify quintessential qualities in an artwork and articulate 
		  them in ways that conveyed their uniqueness, but also made sense to 
		  others. It was this process that revealed the power of simile and metaphor 
		  as tools for enabling a group of people with disparate visual and personal 
		  experiences to reach quickly a shared point of understanding about something 
		  they couldn&#39;t see. However, metaphors and similes are also tricky to 
		  control. Their power to tap into people&#39;s imagination is itself a liability, 
		  because if not chosen correctly, they take the mind off on erroneous 
		  tangents that run counter to the artist&#39;s intentions. For instance, 
		  describing the surface of a sculpture as like candyfloss &#34; cotton candy 
		  &#34; when the piece is about mankind&#39;s survival post World War II, European 
		  occupation and the holocaust is clearly not appropriate, even though 
		  in many respects the suggested candyfloss similie was logical. </p>
		<p class="normal">So, rigorous thinking about language was one important 
		  result of the <i>Making Sense</i> project and this would provide useful 
		  guidance when it came to writing i-Map. Another revealing discovering 
		  was the ability of tactile stimuli to provide physical metaphors for 
		  an artwork&#39;s effect or an artist&#39;s intention. Sometimes, tactile sensations 
		  were found to be more revealingly than language in capturing the essence 
		  of an artwork. An example of this that always springs to mind is a silicone 
		  breast implant that is a handling object used to explore a particular 
		  painting by Salvador Dali. The implant manages to capture the painting&#39;s 
		  disturbing combination of attraction/repulsion, familiarity/surreality 
		  and in particular, the quality of the painting&#39;s central feature which 
		  is an entropic hunk of flesh that seems to simultaneously seep and yet 
		  hold its shape. </p>
		<p class="normal">The linguistic and tactile findings of the <i>Making Sense</i> 
		  project led directly to the formulation of Tate Modern&#39;s touch tours 
		  and, in turn, the methodology and philosophy of the tours informed i-Map. 
		  The Collection displays at Tate Modern are displayed not chronologically, 
		  but thematically across four large suites of rooms. The themes are based 
		  on the traditional genre of art &#34; history painting, the nude, landscape 
		  and still life. Any visitor to the gallery has to engage with this curatorial 
		  intervention, even if they engage with nothing else and Caro felt strongly 
		  that the same should be true for visually impaired visitors. So four 
		  touch tours were created, one for each of the suites. Each tour is designed 
		  to explore the theme as a whole, as well as engage with a particular 
		  aspect of that theme. For instance, the tour in the Still Life/Object/Real 
		  life suite explores still life painting as a genre, in addition to looking 
		  at the way artists&#39; use of materials has changed since 1900. When this 
		  tour was created is was considered by many to be the most challenging, 
		  as it contained almost not art that could be touched and included work 
		  by Picasso and Duchamp, artists who had previously been considered too 
		  &#39;difficult&#39; to study with visually impaired people. However, this tour 
		  has proved to be the most successful with visitors precisely because 
		  of its challenging content. Far from being obscure and meaningless, 
		  blind and partially sighted people find the visual complexity of Cubism, 
		  collage and ready-mades and the artists&#39; engagement with the conventions 
		  of art fascinating. As one blind woman put it at the end of the tour, 
		  having at first stated that she didn&#39;t like modern art; &#39;This makes 
		  sense to me because I think conceptually too.&#39; At the heart of Tate 
		  Modern&#39;s and i-Map&#39;s approach to working with visually impaired people 
		  is the belief that engaging with art is not simply a question of looking 
		  at it. If it was that simple, people wouldn&#39;t have a problem with modern 
		  art, many of us would be out of a job and we&#39;d all switch off the radio 
		  or put down the phone every time someone started talking about something 
		  we couldn&#39;t see.<i> </i>Looking at art is a process that engages the 
		  intellect, the emotions, personal lived experience as well as a phenomenological 
		  sense of self in relation to the object. Of course ocular acuity is 
		  an integral part of engaging with visual art and lacking sight does 
		  have a profound impact on one&#39;s relationship to art, but blindness alone 
		  doesn&#39;t negate or preclude engagement. In fact the notion of the ideal 
		  eye is itself a flawed one. It is said that one in 20 men are colour 
		  blind, Monet was painting with cataracts and all those people who don&#39;t 
		  wear contact lenses or glasses, when was the last time you had your 
		  sight tested? Are you sure you&#39;re seeing perfectly? In reality, a substantial 
		  proportion of visitors to our museums and galleries must, by the law 
		  of averages, not be seeing in physical terms what the artist saw, let 
		  alone the mediating curators and interpreters. So there&#39;s a case to 
		  argue that if visually impaired people can&#39;t look at art in public museums 
		  and galleries the fault lies with us, museum professionals, and our 
		  lack of commitment, imagination and ambition, not with the visitor. 
		  The the word &#39;look&#39; is used deliberately, as it&#39;s used by visually impaired 
		  people, to mean to engage with and to understand. </p>
		<p class="normal">The touch tours had revealed that no art was out of bounds, 
		  be it painting or video; installation or sculpture; figurative or abstract. 
		  More importantly, the traditional fixation with touch &#34; &#39;if we can&#39;t 
		  touch it we can&#39;t use it&#39; &#34; was successfully challenged. After all, 
		  what would be the point of touching Duchamp&#39;s &#39;Fountain&#39;, which is a 
		  urinal when it&#39;s not the original urinal (that got lost and this is 
		  one of fifteen replicas), it&#39;s not in the original porcelain, but glazed 
		  earthenware painted to look like porcelain and more importantly, the 
		  work isn&#39;t about the urinal, but the nature of art and the role of the 
		  artist. Nevertheless, the numbers of visually impaired people visiting 
		  Tate Modern and having touch tours is small, perhaps one hundred and 
		  fifty a year. This is due in no small part to the logistical difficulties 
		  blind and partially sighted people face when planning a visit. Moreover, 
		  provision in art museums for visually impaired people has historically 
		  been poor, so there&#39;s not the expectation that a visit will be rewarding. 
		  So it takes a remarkable level of inquisitiveness for a visually impaired 
		  person with no previous relationship to art to decide to visit Tate 
		  Modern, on the off chance that contemporary art will be their thing. 
		  The challenge was therefore to find a way to bring the pedagogy of the 
		  touch tours to a wider visually impaired audience who may never come 
		  to the gallery. One group that was identified was visually impaired 
		  children. In the UK the majority of visually impaired children, if they 
		  have no other disabilities are in mainstream education. Many of them 
		  decide to study GCSE and A-Level art alongside their sighted classmates. 
		  However, they are taught by art teachers who have often little or no 
		  specialist training in teaching the curriculum to students with little 
		  or no useful sight. As a result, many visually impaired children end 
		  up being sidelined because they&#39;re set projects that bear no relation 
		  to the work their peers are undertaking, or that engage critically with 
		  the history of art. A graphic example of this was a GCSE class that 
		  was brought to the gallery by their teacher. The students were all coming 
		  to see examples of artists who use strong colour, as they were studying 
		  Fauvism. All that is except the one visually impaired student. She had 
		  lost her sight at the age of seven and had limited visual memory, so 
		  she was doing a project about dragons. The attitude towards this pupil 
		  was very much &#39;can you entertain her whilst the rest of the class studies 
		  the art.&#39; It had clearly never occurred to the teacher that her pupil 
		  could be included in discussion about Fauvism or that she, like most 
		  visually impaired people including congenitally blind people have a 
		  sophisticated conceptual sense of colour. </p>
		<p class="normal">Naturally, this lack of involvement at an early age will 
		  often lead to a complete alienation from the world of visual art. Perhaps 
		  the most telling comment we heard when testing i-Map came from a blind 
		  man who, after struggling to extract some meaning from a description 
		  of Matisse&#39;s Moroccans said, &#39;to be honest, I&#39;m just not interested 
		  in art, I guess I&#39;ve always thought it just wasn&#39;t for me.&#39; Indeed, 
		  he seemed confused as to why we were even pursuing the project. Given 
		  that he had always felt vaguely excluded from art, and thus had no contextual 
		  framework through which to interpret it, this lack of engagement should 
		  not have come as a surprise. Yet the touch tours at Tate had proved 
		  that elsewhere, there were visually impaired people with a hunger to 
		  learn more. As Caro had found, these individuals often presented a different 
		  challenge. Keen to develop ways of understanding art for themselves, 
		  they would often arrive with ill informed or half-understood notions, 
		  overheard from sighted descriptions and knitted together with uncertainty. 
		  On one hand, expert accounts of artists and styles made no allowances 
		  for visual impairment, while on the other, the accounts of helpers, 
		  friends and family were usually non-expert. Either way, outside of specialist 
		  schemes such as touch tours, curiosity was most often repaid with a 
		  confused and distorted perspective on art. To help break this cycle, 
		  we were committed to producing informed professional explanations in 
		  deliberately inclusive, non-visual terms. But in addition to the visually 
		  impaired users themselves, i-Map clearly needed to educate those whose 
		  descriptions and definitions were so often relied upon. </p>
		<p class="SubHeader">The Development of i-Map</p>
		<p class="normal">To summarise then, the concept of i-Map was developed 
		  in the knowledge that a considered linguistic approach, complimented 
		  by ancillary tactile materials, could and had made conceptually and 
		  visually complex art accessible. Yet for i-Map, the touch tours were 
		  the starting point rather than the model. Touch tour users were rare 
		  cases, and arguably motivated as much out of curiosity for the touch 
		  tour process as for the art itself. As an online project, i-Map could 
		  reach a far wider audience. It would be easily available at home and 
		  in schools, removing the logistical burden of a gallery visit. And it 
		  would bypass the censorship of sighted people presuming visual art to 
		  be off limits to the visually impaired. While touch tours relied on 
		  interested parties to book an appointment, i-Map, it could be hoped, 
		  would awaken in visually impaired Web users an interest in art where 
		  none had previously existed. It was in no way a replacement for the 
		  touch tours. Indeed, as a web site it would inevitably lack some of the 
		  most powerful elements of the Touch tour methodology; the dialogue, 
		  the instant response to questions, the guiding hand of a specialist 
		  to keep the inquiry focused and so on. i-Map would have to generate 
		  an entirely new set of learning tools, albeit tools with the pedagogical 
		  breakthroughs of the touch tours inherent in their design. </p>
		<p class="normal">The &#39;Matisse Picasso&#39; exhibition at Tate Modern offered 
		  a perfect launch pad for a pilot project. Not only did the show have 
		  huge, worldwide public interest, but it also featured two artists who 
		  had traditionally been both physically and conceptually out of bounds 
		  to visually impaired people. In promising to stimulate an engagement 
		  with Matisse and Picasso across the entire spectrum of visual impairment 
		  we were, in effect, promising intellectual access to concepts such as 
		  modernism and cubism, not only to the user who has limited useful sight 
		  but also to the user who has never seen: a user, potentially, who has 
		  no visual perception of colour whatsoever and no understanding how three-dimensionality 
		  might be represented on a flat surface. So even to suppose that it was 
		  merely Matisse and Picasso that needed elucidating was to jump the gun 
		  considerably. Many of our projected users would need an understanding 
		  of picture-making, let alone these relatively late developments in its 
		  evolution. </p>
		<p class="normal">We began by identifying themes that would serve to unite 
		  pairs of artworks, one by each artist. Like the exhibition itself, these 
		  pairings would allow us to explore both the commonalities and the differences 
		  between the work of Matisse and Picasso. But under the generous umbrella 
		  headings of &#39;Primitivism&#39;, &#39;Space&#39; and &#39;the Nude&#39; we could also begin 
		  to build up a broad sense of the techniques, traditions and ideas that 
		  are crucial to the interpretation of any modern artwork, and especially 
		  so when providing the user with a frame of reference from scratch. To 
		  these three headings we would also add &#39;Cut-Outs.&#39; Though perhaps not 
		  a classic genre, this provided a good opportunity for the visually impaired 
		  user to identify with some of the more tactile, spatially expressive 
		  works, as well as being an elegant synopsis of ideas expressed in more 
		  intricate ways elsewhere. Wherever possible we tried to select paintings 
		  and sculptures owned by Tate, in order that visually impaired people 
		  in the UK had a better chance of visiting them. This would also go some 
		  way towards alleviating the copyright difficulties we faced. </p>
		<p class="normal">The structure and functionality of i-Map had still only 
		  been explored tentatively at this stage, but these thematic pairings 
		  did at least provide a backbone to the project. Online visual art projects 
		  aimed at the visually impaired were virtually unprecedented, though 
		  we were offered a glimpse at a possible way forward by a web site created 
		  by the Finnish National Gallery which explored the work of symbolist 
		  painter Hugo Simberg. The method they had used was to isolate and describe 
		  in turn various sections of a painting. By studying a section at a time, 
		  the visually impaired user was never overwhelmed by detail as they would 
		  have been if confronting the whole. They were able to accumulate detail 
		  at their own pace and arrive in their own time at an understanding of 
		  the complete image. In accessing these descriptions the user was offered 
		  a choice of text and audio. Obviously text, easily enlarged or accessed 
		  with screen reader software, was a prerequisite of I-Map too. Audio 
		  was also discussed, and would indeed have provided a welcome alternative 
		  to the expressionless, synthesised drone of the screen reader. Unfortunately, 
		  budgetary restrictions eventually prevented us from including it, but 
		  it is very much planned as part of our next wave of iterations. </p>
		<p class="normal">This Finnish example however, could only take us so far. 
		  Simberg&#39;s works are figurative and strongly narrative, so describing 
		  them was a relatively straightforward task. i-Map, on the other hand, 
		  was aiming to provide a critical engagement with works that were stylistically 
		  radical, non-narrative and requiring an understanding of art&#39;s conventions 
		  in order to discover their importance. If the work of Matisse and Picasso 
		  were to remain legible to the mind&#39;s eye, we would need to build into 
		  i-Map an ability to communicate the conceptual as well as the concrete, 
		  a strategy for text and image which moved beyond the literal descriptiveness 
		  of the Simberg site. </p>
		<p class="normal">Drawing upon the touch tours, Caro was aware that one 
		  of the most successful methods of communicating complex pictorial concepts 
		  was the use of tactile diagrams, or raised images. These are essentially 
		  simple line drawings in which the line has been raised, by means of 
		  specialised equipment, to stand in relief against the surface in order 
		  to be touch-read. Caro had been developing sets of raised images in 
		  which components of the painting were isolated, as stand alone tactile 
		  objects, to be interpreted one at a time. Generally, once each element 
		  had been explored and understood, the user would be introduced to a 
		  raised image that brought these now familiar forms together, representing 
		  the artwork as a whole. Given the intentional contradictions and tactics 
		  of disorientation characteristic of much modern art, this final step 
		  could place heavy demands on the concentration. And yet as a challenging, 
		  often-ambiguous interaction it could, with careful guidance, become 
		  an equivalent to a sighted engagement with the artwork, and furthermore 
		  one in which certain key conceptual milestones would necessarily have 
		  been passed. </p>
		<p class="normal">i-Map would make use of this approach in two ways. Firstly, 
		  we would include sets of line drawings available as downloads from the 
		  site. Once printed and processed as raised images they could be used 
		  in conjunction with the text content of i-Map, extending beyond the 
		  hermetic confines of the computer screen to create a further tactile 
		  dimension. Secondly, the step-by-step use of raised images became the 
		  starting point for an animated component of the site. From a teaching 
		  point of view, Caro&#39;s method had relied on some all important acts of 
		  intervention: the deconstruction of the image into key areas, the emphasis 
		  or avoidance of certain details, the flow, over time, through different 
		  levels of understanding. Animation could offer a similarly selective, 
		  time-based movement through the artwork, which would be supported by 
		  text as the touch tours were supported by dialogue. Obviously, animation 
		  would be of no value to a blind user. But we were convinced that gentle 
		  transitions from one simplified element of an image to another could 
		  be an important tool for those with limited useful sight, and significantly, 
		  for those sighted people who&#39;s own understanding is crucial to the understanding 
		  of the blind people they assist. </p>
		<p class="normal">Any web site which cropped, dissected and animated the 
		  works of Matisse and Picasso was bound to overstep copyright restrictions 
		  by some distance, so we created a mock-up version of one work, Matisse&#39;s 
		  <i>The Moroccans </i>, that could be used to demonstrate our intentions to the 
		  artists&#39; estates. To my mind, the result betrays the struggle to reconcile 
		  the unique demands of i-Map with the wealth of Web accessibility advice. 
		  The page is split into two frames. On the right, a text description 
		  of the work contains keywords and phrases, which, as JavaScript links, 
		  act as triggers to corresponding animated sequences in the frame on 
		  the left. The image section was built in Flash and fundamentally serves 
		  to pan and zoom in on relevant areas, mask peripheral detail and occasionally 
		  introduce diagrammatic elements to make explicit some of the more subtle 
		  structures at work in the painting. As such, the image of <i>The Moroccans </i> 
		  is virtually ever-present, but other than as a point of departure, is 
		  only ever revealed in its entirety at the end. Above the image itself, 
		  a control panel of sorts provides the user with sound-coded buttons 
		  to view the full image or to return to the main menu. A third symbol, 
		  a flashing M, appears at points in the sequence where a raised image 
		  is to be used (<u>M</u>inolta is a trade name for the raised images). 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">It is a design that tries to be all things to all users. 
		  For example, a blind person, reliant solely on text and raised images, 
		  would nonetheless have to contend with the distracting presence of the 
		  animation &#34; and this, presumably, after having to download a Flash plug-in 
		  for which they had little use. Meanwhile, the user with some sight was 
		  expected to follow the text, the animation and the raised drawings simultaneously 
		  &#34; a challenge even for a (fully sighted) person. Dan Porter was keen 
		  to keep the design uncluttered to give the user the best possible chance 
		  of seeing what was onscreen, but this would be impossible for as long 
		  as we tried to contain the whole project within the same interface. 
		  Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, it had also not occurred to us at this 
		  stage that a user that required noises to alert them to the presence 
		  of buttons would be highly unlikely to be operating a computer with 
		  a mouse. But the steep learning curve was steep, and, as in any design 
		  process, identifying these early faults would be prove crucial to the 
		  future development of the project. Furthermore, this prototype version 
		  of i-Map helped to convince the families of Matisse and Picasso of the 
		  integrity of the project, when we visited them in Paris to discuss copyright 
		  permission in February 2002. </p>
		<p class="normal">Having been granted permission to proceed with i-Map, 
		  Dan was at a natural point at which to reassess the usability of the 
		  site. It also meant , we were now forced to think about i-Map in relation 
		  to the Tate web site as a whole. Beginning with a typical page from the 
		  Tate site, Dan attempted to transform it from a Webpage accessible to 
		  blind and visually impaired users to one that was ideal. He did not 
		  have complete freedom to redevelop the page. He had to maintain some 
		  design continuity with the rest of the Tate site and the sponsor&#39;s logo 
		  was also obligatory, but in some ways these were helpful constraints. 
		  Having removed the search facility, an animated graphic and the bold 
		  strip of colour at the top of the page, a working version of the page 
		  was tested by Paul Porter, a blind Web expert at the RNIB. We asked 
		  him to list any obvious design faults but interestingly, this information 
		  proved difficult to extract. Paul tended to set acceptable rather than 
		  optimal usability at the top end of his scale, presumably a mindset 
		  of one accustomed to using products designed in the sighted world, and 
		  in particular to web sites &#39;made accessible&#39; post-design. However, text 
		  reader software is a fantastic tool for disclosing inconvenient or badly 
		  prioritised content. Unlike the trained eye, it cannot skip automatically 
		  to the most relevant content, and after hearing the synthesised voice 
		  recite Tate&#39;s standard navigation links a number of times, the decision 
		  to shift them from the top to the foot of the page was an obvious one. 
		  Testing with a screen reader also allowed me to realise, belatedly, 
		  that blind users relying only on text and raised images would be best 
		  served by pages devoted to that purpose. i-Map&#39;s themed pairs needed 
		  to be presented in two formats, text only and text and animation, and 
		  it was important that at the gateway to these sections we made the intended 
		  users explicit. </p>
		<p class="normal">Meanwhile a pattern of working had emerged . We would 
		  begin by storyboarding a journey through the artwork, which would provide 
		  us with a sequential blueprint both for the animation and for a set 
		  of raised images. Given the range of artistic approaches within our 
		  four pairs, it would have been impossible to find a single methodology 
		  to produce a narrative for each. Where we thought a sense of the construction 
		  of the painting was important, like the Picasso still life or <i>Nude in an Armchair </i>1932, we used a layer-by-layer approach. <i>The Moroccans </i> 1916, 
		  on the other hand, is a painting in which three very noticeably distinct 
		  areas of detail exist; we wanted to examine each of these areas in turn 
		  before discussing the spatial conflicts between them and the shapes 
		  and colours that gave them unity. So in this case it made more sense 
		  to begin with a circuit of the painting, selecting details to act as 
		  stepping-stones in a clockwise movement around the work. Our treatment 
		  of detail was in itself an important point of discussion. As is it was 
		  important that i-Map allowed a visually impaired person to reach the 
		  same level of understanding as any sighted person, we could not omit 
		  intricate or obscure detail if we deemed it significant to the overall 
		  interpretation. In both the animations and the raised images we would 
		  find ways of clarifying difficult-to-read areas without damaging integrity 
		  of the work, redrawing them in a bolder, simpler fashion, and making 
		  sure to state in the text that the artist intended an element of ambiguity. 
		  In our storyboarding sessions we were also careful that such attention 
		  to detail was not immediately followed by a much wider view, as dramatic 
		  leaps in scale would be likely to cause confusion. </p>
		<p class="normal">Of course, these decisions had a significant impact on 
		  Dan&#39;s approach to the animation. While his first attempt had, quite 
		  literally, revolved around a single, electronic reproduction, it became 
		  clear that this could only ever allow us to work on the surface of the 
		  painting. For us, the artwork itself only represented the most detailed, 
		  final frame or the top layer in a sequence. If, using some creative 
		  license where necessary to complete outlines and forms, we could break 
		  the image down into a series of independent layers -each wholly legible 
		  in its own right- we could build up to a final image through a series 
		  of coherent, unobstructed steps. Just as the first raised drawings in 
		  a set needed to be intelligible independently of last, so the animation 
		  turned the image into a fully articulated object: made up of overlapping 
		  elements with the potential to be moved, developed and seen independently 
		  of each other. This approach was applied to all the works, but is perhaps 
		  best exemplified by Picasso&#39;s still life, <i>Bowl of Fruit, Violin and Bottle</i>, 1914.<i> </i>Though a painting, it is very much based upon Picasso&#39;s 
		  use of collage, itself a layer-upon-layer technique. So it seemed very 
		  appropriate to give the user the experience of building up the work 
		  by arranging cut-out elements on top of each other. The image builds 
		  piece by piece as the user hits the spacebar, while the use of sound 
		  acts as confirmation that they are affecting change.<i> </i></p>
		<p class="normal">Entirely recreating the works had the added advantage 
		  of enhancing their clarity. They were built in Flash rather than painted 
		  with oil on canvas, and so, for our purposes, they benefit from bolder 
		  colour and cleaner lines. There were other important changes from the 
		  prototype version. The simpler interface was now fully operable with 
		  a keyboard, although it remained possible to use mouse if preferred. 
		  And the relationship between the animation and the text had switched 
		  from being text-led to animation-led. Key points in the animation were 
		  now catalysts for changes in the text, rather than vice versa. Technically, 
		  this was a much more reliable method than the first, which, even in 
		  the prototype had been prone to faults and cross-platform difficulties. 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">The preliminary storyboarding involved detailed discussion 
		  between us and mutual<i> </i>clarification of the key points we wanted 
		  as the focus of each work and how they&#39;d be revealed.<i> </i>So the 
		  final storyboard reflected the narrative structure of the text which 
		  Caro wrote in response to the completed animation.<i> </i>The text was 
		  passed between us for editing and improving, but you&#39;ll notice that 
		  its language, tone and flow is very different from anything else on 
		  the Tate&#39;s web site and from most written interpretation one sees in 
		  a gallery.<i> </i>This is because in order for aural information to 
		  be absorbed, particularly when it&#39;s being spoken by a synthesised voice 
		  that lacks cadence and emphasis, sentence structures must be short and 
		  simple, information has to be delivered systematically and incrementally, 
		  and meaning has to be clear even when delivered in a monotonous deadpan 
		  voice.<i> </i>Moreover, using common written terms like &#39;the latter&#39; 
		  or &#39;the previous point&#39; only confuse because the ear cannot dart back 
		  over previous text to remind the listener what the latter point was.<i> 
		  </i>This commitment to clarity meant that i-Map&#39;s texts are very long, 
		  which goes against our instincts as curators and Web designers.<i> </i>However, 
		  visually impaired people are used to listening attentively and prefer 
		  detailed explanations to hasty summations that often fail to put them 
		  fully in the picture. The text only version is even longer because of 
		  course each raised drawing had to be introduced before it can be put 
		  to use in the service of the overall exploration of a work. </p>
		<p class="normal">Obviously, in building a project specifically for visually 
		  impaired users, a Web designer would be foolish to ignore the now well-established 
		  tenets of Web accessibility, and we like to think we could claim to 
		  have complied with those. But we would also hope that i-Map illustrates 
		  the limited significance of that claim when providing Web access to 
		  visual art. In testing the site with blind users particularly, we saw 
		  confirmation of the fact that technical accessibility does not mean 
		  intellectual accessibility. Indeed, art museums are frequently reprimanded 
		  for forgetting to include ALT tags, for example, to identify an image. 
		  But in simply naming an image, a museum does little more than give the 
		  blind or visually impaired user an idea of what they are missing. In 
		  following accessibility guidelines alone, we do not provide access to 
		  artworks, but to information about them. And although as sighted people 
		  we are often barely aware of it, much of that information is deeply 
		  rooted in the visual experience. The Tate web site, for example, provides 
		  access to a vast range of texts and data about artworks and exhibitions, 
		  and a blind user should have no problems in navigating it. But the amount 
		  information coded in such a way as to include the visually impaired 
		  is minimal. It is obviously not feasible for a visual art web site to 
		  author all its from a visually impaired perspective, though its arguably 
		  a good exercise for art history students. It is only through specialised 
		  provisions like i-Map that visual art on the Web can become truly accessible, 
		  so museums and galleries need the time and the resources to make these 
		  available. </p>
