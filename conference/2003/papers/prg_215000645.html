		<p class="PaperTitle">The SEE Experience: Edutainment in 3D Virtual Worlds.</p>
		<p class="Author">Nicoletta Di Blas and Paolo Paolini, Politecnico di Milano,

		<p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">Shared virtual worlds are innovative applications 
		  where several users, represented by Avatars, simultaneously access via 
		  Internet a 3D space. Users co-operate through interaction with the environment 
		  and with each other, manipulating objects and chatting as they go. Apart 
		  from in the well-documented online action games industry, now often 
		  played out in real-time over the Internet, the success stories of virtual 
		  worlds and shared VRML environments have been sporadic. Interest wanes 
		  from an enthusiastic beginning: the 3D world looks both enticing and 
		  promising, but the attention curve drops sharply as the users find the 
		  space either too difficult to navigate or not satisfyingly engaging. 
		  The key to the success or failure of these environments relates directly 
		  to the content offered and the ability of the environment to<i> hold</i> 
		  a critical mass of users in real time. This is the desperately sought 
		  after magic social glue that determines the experience to be meaningful 
		  and actively keeps the users under its virtual spell.</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">The paper will present an innovative project, a 
		  shared virtual world geared to schools in an educational and highly 
		  structured,environment. SEE, Shrine Educational Experience, is a co-operative 
		  project developed jointly by Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum, 
		  Jerusalem, and the Politecnico di Milano, Italy, offering a pioneering 
		  educational environment based on a shared 3D virtual world, where classes 
		  from all over the world meet in order to learn and discuss issues related 
		  to the famous Dead Sea Scrolls and the tiny community (probably of Essenes) 
		  who once lived by the Dead Sea.</p>

		<h1 class="SubHeader">3D Worlds: A New Challenge to Museum Communication</h1>
		<p>Exactly two years ago, at Museums and the Web 2001 in Seattle, Susan 
		  Hazan of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, and Professor Paolo Paolini and 
		  his team sat down for a micro-brain-storming session to think of a way 
		  to harness the impressive technology developed for their &#34;Leonardo 
		  da Vinci&#34; project (Barbieri, T., P. Paolini et al,. 1999) for the 
		  Israel Museum in Jerusalem. The teams soon focused on the idea of a 
		  real-time, educational scenario that would extend the museum&#39;s mission 
		  to educate and interpret collections for its online community, and the 
		  seed was sown.</p>
		<p>The Education Department of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, is proud 
		  of its track record of innovative, online educational activities. In 
		  1996, during the exhibition, <i>Children of the World Draw Jerusalem 
		  at 3000</i>, the department developed an ambitious project to provide 
		  a unique opportunity for children from all parts of the globe to take 
		  part in a drawing contest on the theme of Jerusalem (Hazan, 1996). For 
		  the duration of the exhibition, the department set up three Macintosh 
		  computers. For six weeks they were staffed by high school students from 
		  our Multimedia Education Unit with a specially designed Web site that 
		  offered remote visitors the opportunity to upload their own artworks, 
		  to be displayed online, as well as to play an interactive trivia game 
		  to learn about Jerusalem, its history, geography and religions. A further 
		  opportunity to &#39;visit&#39; the exhibition was made possible through a video 
		  window. Using the software CUSee-Me, the exhibition, with local visitors 
		  as spontaneous players on the live stage, was broadcast from the gallery 
		  for 8 hours a day for the full six weeks of the exhibitions, at the 
		  same time receiving remote visitors to the museum in real-time.</p>
		<p>The exhibition <i>In the Light of the Menorah: Story of a Symbol</i>, 
		  was launched in 1998, a photo-realistic 3D gallery tour streamed at 
		  15 frames per second over standard dial-up modems with embedded hyperlinks 
		  enabling students to interact with the movie (Hazan, 1999). This was 
		  an adaptation of a major temporary exhibition held at the Israel Museum, 
		  one which traced the manifold incarnations and interpretations of the 
		  seven-branched candelabrum from Biblical sacred object to national emblem, 
		  as represented in objects from the Museum&#39;s extensive collections of 
		  archeology, Judaica, and the fine arts. In the same year the Israel 
		  Museum forged a partnership with the Hebrew University and a number 
		  of Israeli cultural institutions in order to develop a specially devised 
		  Web site, <i>Galim,</i> meaning waves. Via the Museum@school project 
		  ,<i>Galim</i> students navigated the 3D environment through online games, 
		  quizzes and self-directed exploration, delivering a new museum experience 
		  straight into the classroom.</p>
		<p>The museum was confident that if these two components, the real-time 
		  excitement of the video window and the challenge of wandering a 3D gallery 
		  online searching for clues, could be combined, the result could be a 
		  novel way of extending the museum&#39;s mandate to enhance and interpret 
		  its collections for remote visitors. The magic created by the Politecnico 
		  world for the Leonardo project appeared to present exciting new possibilities.</p>
		<p>Games too turned out to be a powerful source of inspiration. <i>MechAssault</i>, 
		  billed as <i>fierce tactical combat and destruction, 31st-century style, 
		  </i>is now <i>Live</i>-enabled, meaning that the real-time component 
		  allows users to play with each other online as many of the action games 
		  already do, and even if youngsters are not out there shooting each other<i>, 
		  </i>or forming online strategies to blast each other out of the game, 
		  many of the online activities are just as superficial. The popular<i> 
		  The Sims Deluxe</i> (http://thesims.ea.com/), the latest and wildly 
		  popular version of the original <i>The Sims</i>, is promoted as 
		  <i>Create an entire neighborhood of Sims and run or ruin their lives,</i> 
		  while NFL Fever, the best-selling football game on X-Box, boasts <i>some 
		  of the most bone-crunching, realistic animation of any football video 
		  game to date</i>. Many less virulent environments have been developed 
		  using VRML. Clearly &#34;<i>being there</i>&#34; in a real-time interaction 
		  with other users does hold a potent attraction, but performing specific 
		  activities in shared 3D spaces has proved to be difficult and sometimes 
		  frustrating. Once users have negotiated the technological obstacles 
		  to enter the online environment, (with a fairly robust computer and 
		  speedy communication), the key to the success or failure of these environments 
		  directly relates to the content offered and the ability of the environment 
		  to <i>hold</i> a critical mass of users in the same space at the same 
		  time. This is the desperately sought after magic glue that makes the 
		  experience meaningful and actively keeps the users under its (virtual) 
		  spell. Clearly the museum is not considered a player in this ballpark 
		  but on the other hand, should the museum even want to be there? What 
		  can a content rich provider such as the museum, with an impressive track 
		  record for &#39;holding&#39; its visitors in compelling educational scenarios, 
		  possibly offer this industry?</p>
		<p>The Israel Museum made a decisive move into this new arena, selecting 
		  the most valuable and compelling of its wide ranging collections as 
		  the thematic core of the activity the world renowned Dead Sea Scrolls. 
		  The Dead Sea Scrolls are on permanent display at the Israel Museum, 
		  Jerusalem, in a stunning building designed by the American architects 
		  Armand Bartos and Frederick Kiesler. Dr Adolfo Roitman, Head of the 
		  Shrine of the Book and Curator of the Dead Sea Scrolls, brought together 
		  a team of museum educators and curators, as well as staff of the New 
		  Media Department, to explore the curatorial content of the SEE project 
		  developed from his museum expertise as author of the exhibition, <i>A 
		  Day at Qumran: The Dead Sea Sect and Its Scrolls </i>(Roitman, 1997) 
		  and in his role as gatekeeper of the precious collections<i>. </i>The 
		  Shrine of the Book is located at the heart of the political and cultural 
		  center of the State of Israel, close to the <i>Knesset</i>, (Parliament), 
		  government offices, the Hebrew University, and the Supreme Court Building. 
		  A white, ceramic covered dome covers the galleries, which are two-thirds 
		  below the ground and house the permanent collection. The striking juxtaposition 
		  of the gentle curve of the dome and the black, angular, basalt wall, 
		  both stark yet opposing geometrical shapes, creates a stunning vista 
		  and contributes a unique architectural phenomenon to the Jerusalem horizon. 
		  This was the portal selected for the online virtual world, a space for 
		  the social and educational interaction to be staged. The magic of the 
		  virtual world was that other worlds could be brought into the constellation 
		  of this experience ,and so the ambience of Qumran could be brought into 
		  the historical narrative and into a new reality.</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="diblas.fig1.jpg" width="378" height="252"/></p>
		<p class="MsoCaption">Fig. 1: The Shrine of the Book with the Knesset (Parliament)</p>
		<p>The curatorial and educational team of the Shrine of the Book at the 
		  Israel Museum, Jerusalem, is concerned with preserving not only the 
		  material evidence of the scrolls themselves but also, just as important, 
		  the message contained within them. The SEE project, perhaps one of the 
		  first museum virtual worlds to be developed, is an exciting new and 
		  dynamic environment where objects can be manipulated and hidden portals 
		  accessed while avatars move around the shared space while socializing 
		  with each other in a real-time.</p>
		<p><span class="SubHeader">The <i>Virtual Leonardo</i> Project: Lessons 
		  Learned</span></p>
		<p><i>Virtual Leonardo</i> was deployed for the first time in 1999 (Barbieri, 
		  Paolini et al ii, 1999; Barbieri &amp; Paolini, 2000} with a new version 
		  launched in 2001; it was developed by Politecnico di Milano for the 
		  Museum of Science and Technology, Leonardo da Vinci, in Milan.</p>
		<p>The original objectives and the main features of the project are perceived 
		  as follows:</p>
		<h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">A 3D graphic environment to be used as a &#34;container&#34; 
		  to display &#34;objects&#34; of the museum. </h4>
		<p>Specific choices in our case were an &#34;idealized&#34; rendering 
		  of the cloisters of the museum (hosted in a former monastery) as the 
		  container, and the &#34;Leonardo machines&#34; the objects. The latter 
		  are 3D interactive objects, representing actual wood machines on display 
		  in the museum; the machines were built several decades ago in order 
		  to &#34;render&#34; ideas and concepts developed by Leonardo in several 
		  of his drawings.</p>
		<h4 class="SubHeaderSmaller">Users are encouraged to visit the &#34;virtual 
		  museum&#34; in groups</h4>
		<p>The users are encouraged to visit the virtual museum in groups: a family, 
		  a group of friends, a school, and few visitors with or without an expert. 
		  This creates a sense of &#34;not being alone&#34; while visiting the 
		  museum, a factor that increases fun, engagement, and interaction, while 
		  making the overall visit more effective and rewarding.</p>
		<h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">Avatars represent users who are visiting the 
		  &#34;virtual museum&#34;</h4>
		<p>Users &#34;visiting&#34; the museum are actualized through avatars, 
		  i.e. graphic objects that appear as either real persons, or graphic 
		  renderings. The purpose of using avatars is twofold: it allows the users 
		  to perceive their own physical positions in the virtual space as well 
		  as to recognize other avatars&#39; positions within the museum. Users move 
		  their Avatars in order to change their position within the museum or 
		  to make contact with the objects.</p>
		<h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">Advanced functions allow users to cooperate 
		  in several fashions</h4>
		<p>We realized, since the inception of the project, that providing &#34;traditional&#34; 
		  interaction mechanisms within the virtual museum was not sufficient. 
		  Traditional 3D environments allow users to chat, to interact with objects, 
		  and to wander around (using &#34;real world&#34; limitations, in general). 
		  We observed that in most 3D environments the above possibilities did 
		  not encourage a great deal of &#34;cooperation&#34; among users: chat 
		  was the main instrument of cooperation with the others, making avatars 
		  almost useless (i.e. not exploiting the spatial cooperation). We strongly 
		  felt this concern: how could we get the visitors to actually interact 
		  with each other, besides chatting? We therefore introduced the notions 
		  of &#34;cooperation capabilities&#34; and &#34;cooperation metaphors&#34;. 
		  A cooperation capability defines something that users can do: e.g. move, 
		  speak to everybody, whisper to a few, change visualization point of 
		  view (using fixed cameras, for example), make hyper jumps, look through 
		  the eyes of someone else, etc. A cooperation metaphor (Barbieri &amp; 
		  Paolini, 2001 the term &#34;metaphor&#34; is not really appropriate, 
		  but this was the term that we historically used)) is a combination of 
		  cooperation capabilities assigned to the different users, in order to 
		  obtain a specific overall behavior: e.g. during an &#34;explanation&#34; 
		  the &#34;guide&#34; can &#34;speak&#34; to all the visitors, while 
		  each visitor can speak only to the guide and not to the other visitors, 
		  and hyper jumps are not allowed. Cooperation metaphors were understood 
		  through the experience of <i>Virtual Leonardo</i>, but not fully exploited 
		  within it (more advanced use of cooperation metaphors has been introduced 
		  in later applications developed by Politecnico).</p>
		<h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">A &#34;museum guide&#34; takes the visitors 
		  around</h4>
		<p>We did realize very quickly that a group of &#34;visitors&#34; in 
		  a virtual museum, without a specific goal in mind or a task to perform, 
		  very likely would &#34;hang around&#34;, without actually knowing 
		  what to do. Therefore we introduced the notion of &#34;museum guide&#34;, 
		  with a number of duties:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> stimulating the curiosity of visitors</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> organizing the visit</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> providing additional information </div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> answering questions</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="normal"> 
		<p>If audio guides and &#34;physical&#34; guides are a popular option 
		  in a real museum, they are indispensable in a virtual museum for a number 
		  of reasons that are probably obvious to all virtual visitors who have 
		  experimented the feeling, &#34;what am I going to do next?&#34; and 
		  even more obvious when a group of visitors must be kept together for 
		  a meaningful visit.</p>
		<h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">Visiting a &#34;virtual museum&#34; becomes 
		  a &#34;social&#34; activity</h4>
		<p>Thinking about all these factors together and understanding that visiting 
		  a real museum alone is a different experience from visiting with other 
		  people (with family, friends, experts), made these lessons insightful 
		  in our future development of shared virtual worlds.</p>
		<p><i>Virtual Leonardo</i> has raised the interest of practitioners, researchers 
		  and the general public. Its simple idea is appealing to all: &#34;<i>at 
		  this museum you can bring a date</i>&#34;, proclaimed the title of 
		  an article on New York Times online (Mirapaul 1999). So, the idea of 
		  visiting a virtual museum evolved rom a &#34;one at a time&#34; activity 
		  to a social activity.. Many users have visited <i>virtual Leonardo</i>, 
		  but we realized that there were some flaws regarding the three main 
		  aspects of the application: the interaction, the content, and the reproduction 
		  of the real world limitations. More specifically, we noted the following 
		  problems: </p>
		<h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">About the interaction:</h4>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Visitors mainly interacted with the guides and the 
			objects; there was little reason for a visitor to interact with another 
			visitor.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> There was an inherent tradeoff between having the 
			visitors spend their time interacting with the world and the objects 
			or having them interact with each other.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Despite the power of cooperation metaphors, it was 
			still difficult (except in demos) to avoid avatars hanging around, 
			while the focus of the interaction was the chat.</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="normal"> 
		<h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">About the content:</h4>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> The 3D environment was not appropriate to deliver 
			either large quantities of information or high quality visual information.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> If the main emphasis of the visit were to acquire 
			new information, there would be limited opportunities to get to know 
			other visitors.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Whenever the visit was geared to emphasize discussion 
			among visitors, clearly users should be supplied with enough material 
			beforehand to be able to engage with the material during the session.</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="normal"> 
		<h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">About the reproduction of the real world constraints:</h4>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Mimicking the physical limitations of the real world 
			turned out not to be useful in general, and quite boring in the end.</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>

		<p>If the virtual visit to a museum is to provide a meaningful and forceful 
		  experience, something more structured and compelling is needed. Therefore, 
		  when the Israel Museum asked Politecnico to start to investigate a new 
		  project targeting high and junior high school pupils and focused around 
		  the Dead Sea Scrolls and Qumran, the Politecnico staff decided to create 
		  a completely new kind of experience built on the foundations of the 
		  <i>Virtual Leonardo</i> project.</p>
		<p class="SubHeader">The Shrine Educational Experience</p>
		<p>For the new application, baptized &#34;SEE&#34; (Shrine Educational 
		  Experience), we chose high school and junior high school students as 
		  our target group. In the future, we are considering other target groups: 
		  such as tourists who are interested in the Holy Land, scholars who want 
		  to <i>meet</i> in the virtual world to discuss an issue related to Qumran 
		  and the Dead Sea Scrolls, or simply well educated <i>surfers. </i>The 
		  SEE experience is based on the interaction of four classes, from different 
		  parts of the world, virtually <i>meeting</i> in real-time in a 3D virtual 
		  environment, together with the museum guide. The 3D world consists of 
		  several different settings, including (Fig. 2) the internal and external 
		  (real) spaces of the Israel Museum&#39;s Shrine of the Book where the Scrolls 
		  are on display, while reiterating the potent symbolic metaphors of the 
		  buildings themselves (Fig. 3) set in contemporary Jerusalem, with a 
		  hyperlink to the Qumran desert, and the historical setting of the Essene 
		  community.<a name="fig2"></a><a name="fig3"></a></p>

		<p class="MsoCommentText">The students are represented by avatars and move, 
		  play and interact in the virtual world. Meetings last about an hour, 
		  where content (made available in advance to schools via a tutorial Web 
		  site) is recollected and applied in the &#34;cultural games&#34;. 
		  SEE thus offers an <i>edutainment </i>experience, where students engage 
		  with the cultural content while enjoying themselves at the same time. 
		  The entire SEE experience consists of 3 interactive sessions, where 
		  students are led to discover respectively (1) the Shrine of the Book 
		  Campus in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, (2) the Essene community who 
		  once lived in Qumran, and (3) the connections between the Qumran community 
		  with other religions and culture.</p>
		<p>When SEE was designed, four major requirements were considered:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ol>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> The relevance of the cultural content, the knowledge 
			about Qumran, and related issues,(religious, historical, technical, 
			social, etc.).</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal">The inter-cultural exchange through <i>meetings</i> 
			in the virtual space, with students of different countries and/or 
			of different cultures.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal">The interaction between physically remote participants 
			in an innovative and engaging experience, through the virtual environments. 
			The games that the students are invited to perform in also consolidate 
			&#34;team-ship&#34;, while forging new relationships and ties among 
			different schools.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal">An acquaintance with state of the art Information 
			and Communication Technologies and the possibility of integrating 
			modern multimedia, graphic, Web and Internet technologies into the 
			school program.</div>
		</li>
	  </ol>
	  <div class="normal"> 
		<p>The design improvements were adapted while accommodating the above 
		  self-subscribed goals as well as through what we had learned through 
		  the <i>Leonardo</i> experience and consequently integrated into the 
		  SEE application.</p>
		<p><b class="SubHeader">From <i>Leonardo</i> to SEE</b></p>
		<p>In this section we go through the three &#34;weak points&#34; spotted 
		  in the Leonardo project; that is, how to promote the interaction, how 
		  to deliver the content, and what constraints of the real world should 
		  be reproduced, showing how we tried to overcome them in planning the 
		  SEE experience.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Promoting the interaction</h2>
		<p>One of the well-known drawbacks of 3D worlds is that visitors very 
		  so<span class="normal">o</span>n get bored of moving around the environment 
		  when there is little motivation to do so. If their time is spent simply 
		  chatting with the others, this becomes an overall unsatisfying experience. 
		  Therefore we decided to carefully plan a set of activities through a 
		  storyboard to be acted out during the SEE experience, in order to avoid 
		  wasting precious online time or avatars hanging around aimlessly in 
		  corners.</p>
		<p>Basically, each online session is divided into four main phases:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ol>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal">A brief moment of <i>Introduction</i>, during which 
			students meet each other in the virtual environment and are welcomed 
			by the Guide.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal">An <i>Exhibition</i> phase, in which either new content 
			is delivered or already known material is recollected through boards 
			(that is, pop-up browser windows showing multimedia content in a traditional, 
			readable 2D format).</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal">Two <i>Cultural Games</i> where students, divided 
			into two teams, have to prove their ability in a multiple-choice quiz 
			(one student per team must perform an ability-game in order to win 
			the right of answering first for his team; fig. 4) as well as a Treasure 
			Hunt (fig. 5) or matching-pairs game, both taking place within a specifically 
			dedicated space, similar to a labyrinth.</div>
		</li>
		<li> Finally, the Guide gathers the students for a short <i>Wrap-up</i> 
		  where the key issues of the session are summed up, homework is assigned, 
		  and the next session&#39;s main theme is briefly anticipated.</li>
	  </ol>
	  <a name="fig4"></a><a name="fig5"></a>

		</tbody></table>
		<p class="normal" align="left">Our preliminary tests in schools have demonstrated 
		  that the <i>discipline</i> of the storyboard has the positive effect 
		  of offering students a sequence of tasks to perform, alternating with 
		  games and brief lectures and the question-answering sessions with the 
		  guide. The whole experience therefore is about following a brief - and 
		  is competitively exciting.</p>
		<p>While we succeeded with <i>Virtual Leonardo</i> when visitors interacted 
		  with the objects, we failed in that they did not interact with each 
		  other apart from the chat. Therefore in planning the SEE experience, 
		  one of our most important issues was to compel avatars to interact (1) 
		  with the environment, (2) with the objects, as well as (3) with each 
		  other.</p>
		<p>As regards points (1) and (2), all the games were planned so as to 
		  compel students to actively use the environment features, even the most 
		  advanced of the virtual world. Avatars may fly, see from another avatar&#39;s 
		  point of view (using his or her own <i>eyes </i>or another&#39;s), or view 
		  the site from fixed cameras. For example, in the Treasure Hunt students 
		  move around in the environment and find the sets of objects related 
		  to each other. In the brief time allotted to this challenge, looking 
		  through another&#39;s eyes and from another&#39;s point of view can be very 
		  useful, and even imperative, in order to be able to compare the objects 
		  to see whether they match or not before their time is up. In the quiz, 
		  students have to perform ability games (such as jumping from one platform 
		  to another without falling, pushing geometrical objects into holes), 
		  to win the right to answer to the questions.</p>
		<p align="center"><a name="fig6"></a><a href="diBlas.fig6.html"><img src="diblas.fig6.t.png" width="395" height="123" border="0"/></a></p>
		<p class="MsoCaption">Fig. 6: Screenshot of the Quiz Space, an environment 
		  dedicated to one of the Cultural Games</p>
		<p>In order to encourage avatars to collaborate with each other (point 
		  3), to gain advantage in the games, students have to exchange opinions 
		  and really put their heads together. In the Treasure Hunt, for example, 
		  they have to check whether the object they&#39;ve found matches the others, 
		  as all of the objects that the team needs to collect are semantically 
		  linked by a clue (i.e. <i>find all the objects that were used during 
		  the community&#39;s communal meal</i>). The quiz also encourages cooperation, 
		  for the right answer among three has to be spotted.</p>
		<p>Tests in schools have shown that students love collaborating a team 
		  and interact not only for <i>strictly business</i> reasons as time is 
		  so short (find the correct answer, check the objects), but also to encourage 
		  their teammates with friendly messages to urge them on in the game.</p>
		<h2>Delivering cultural content</h2>
		<p>3D worlds are clearly not appropriate architectures for disseminating 
		  large amount of information, as neither lectures nor expansive documents 
		  work well with new means of communication. These limitations ironically 
		  encouraged creative cooperation and interaction among the visitors. 
		  Our challenge became therefore to match this simple observation with 
		  the educational goal of the application: how to deliver robust cultural 
		  content appropriate for a museum experience to students. Making background 
		  material available to schools through a <i>traditional</i> 2D site appeared 
		  to provide the solution, and the 2D site now functions as a gate to 
		  the 3D environment.</p>
		<p>The background material provided consists of:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Interviews with experts of the Dead Sea Scrolls and 
			the Qumran community.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Editorial insets explaining issues, events or characters 
			in detail, mentioned by the experts in the interviews</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> An anthology collecting all the excerpts from the 
			Scrolls, the Bible, historical sources or other texts mentioned or 
			quoted in the interviews</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Auxiliary didactic material providing background 
			information on historical and geographical issues that may be obvious 
			to some parts of the audience, and rather obscure to others (e.g. 
			Israeli students know quite well where the Dead Sea is; for remote 
			students this is not obvious at all).</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="normal"> 
		<p>Both the boards accessible though the 3D environment as well as the 
		  games themselves recall the relevant concepts and themes of the background 
		  material, summarizing a few key points and provoking online discussion 
		  with both the other participants and the guide.</p>
		<a name="fig7"></a><a name="fig8"></a> 
		<table width="80%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" align="center">

		<p>The core of the background material consists of interviews with scholarly 
		  experts on the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Qumran community. Interviews 
		  are readily available both in full text and in summary. The interview 
		  format was selected for a number of reasons:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> The format is more immediate and straightforward, 
			if compared to standard schoolbooks.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Interviews provided a platform for different ideological, 
			religious and cultural points of view. We have already interviewed 
			(and plan to interview in the future) experts representing all different 
			cultural and religious points of view on Qumran and related issues: 
			Hebrew, Christians of all denominations, Arabs, lay scholars. Students 
			are thus allowed to compare different approaches on the same topic.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> The <i>virtual </i>debate among scholars in the interviews 
			enhances critical thinking. In fact, many issues concerning the Dead 
			Sea Scrolls are currently under debate (for example: is the Q7 fragment 
			an early testimonial of the Gospel?). Instead of arbitrarily presenting 
			and promoting one opinion among the others, we decided to create a 
			sort of &#34;virtual panel&#34; among experts on the hottest topics.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Students may compare different opinions of a number 
			of experts while realizing that many issues have not yet been resolved. 
			In &#34;normal&#34; schoolbooks, students are led to think that 
			all the issues are settled once and for all, whilst real historical 
			and scientific research presents large fields still to be explored!</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Students may discover the typical dynamic of research. 
			This is the result of the above points.</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>

		<h1 class="SubHeader">Reproducing the Real World</h1>
		<p>The observation that students tend to interact mainly via chat has 
		  recently brought us to some theoretic developments concerning what we 
		  called &#34;proxemics semiotics&#34;; i.e. the investigation of the 
		  &#34;signals&#34; that human beings exchange in the real world, often 
		  because of the physical limitations of the real world itself. &#34;Proxemics&#34; 
		  derives from the Greek verb <i>pros-semaino</i>; that is, &#34;to mean 
		  together with&#34;, to mean <i>a cot</i> of the main communication 
		  channel, that is, the verbal channel. Proxemics semiotics is being developed 
		  by a joint effort of USI (University of Italian Switzerland) and Politecnico 
		  di Milano, with the goal of creating a new generation of more effective 
		  3D virtual spaces (Di Blas &amp; Paolini, 2003). For example, if we 
		  enter a room in a museum and see that all the visitors are gathered 
		  around a specific work of art, we are led to think that this must be 
		  an especially important work, possibly the most important in the room. 
		  In the virtual world, we can eliminate any physical limitation: but 
		  in doing so, we also cancel all those signals that in the real world 
		  are so meaningful! If avatars can look at a board from any part of the 
		  environment, all the others will never notice that they are interested 
		  in that particular board, unless motivated to do so by the others via 
		  chat. Otherwise, if the avatars were compelled to approach an object 
		  or a board or another avatar in order to interact ,this intention would 
		  be made clear immediately to all the others. This is one of the reasons 
		  that the use of chat during the experience is so thick: many of the 
		  things that in the real world are self-evident, because of the proxemics, 
		  ihave to be stated explicitly in the virtual world through a verbal 
		  message (that is, via chat). Avatars wanting to attract the attention 
		  of another must first say: <i>I&#39;m looking at board 3, near the stairs</i> 
		  before declaring the reason of (<i>the meaning of the white dome is 
		  amazing</i>!).</p>
		<p>We are currently considering which of the physical limitations of the 
		  real world should be maintained (or maybe somehow <i>translated</i>) 
		  in the 3D world, in order to enrich the overall communication and also 
		  to move it from the now almost exclusive chat-channel to the proxemics 
		  channel .We look forward to developing this exciting project in the 
		  near future.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusions</h1>
		<p>SEE provides an educational experience centered on a Museum, with a 
		  number of distinctive features and innovative aspects: </p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> There is a blend of offline activities (background 
			preparation, homework, etc.) and online activities.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Online activities are a blend of &#34;traditional&#34; 
			one-at-a-time navigation and cooperative activities.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Cooperative activities emphasize the engagement of 
			meeting other people and interacting with them. Information gathering 
			is performed either offline (reading downloaded documents) or online.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Background material is mainly based upon interviews, 
			therefore purposely non systematic, possibly incomplete and inconsistent 
			(sometimes experts have different opinions about interpretations or 
			facts). The goal is to encourage students to understand the contradictions 
			and the inconsistencies of the &#34;real world&#34; as opposed to 
			the apparent and fictitious &#34;cleanness&#34; of textbooks.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Via the background material and online experiences, 
			students are led to correlate museum objects (i.e. the scrolls) and 
			ancient culture to contemporary life, beliefs and experiences.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> The 3D environment is used with a well-defined storyboard 
			(defining the sequence of scenes and of actions within the scenes), 
			in order to keep the students &#34;engaged&#34; and under control.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Competition (with the natural desire of winning) 
			is used in order to encourage cultural preparation of the students.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Gaming ability is also necessary to win; therefore 
			students (rather than teachers) are encouraged to learn how to use 
			advanced 3D-cooperation features.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="normal"> Last, but not least, the interaction among students 
			of different cultures and backgrounds (with all the dangers of conflict 
			always possible) is a major goal of the overall experience.</div>
		</li>
