		<h1 class="PaperTitle">Introduction</h1>
		<p class="normal">This paper presents an overview of the process used 
		  to evaluate the design and implementation of museum-supported videoconferencing 
		  and demonstrate selected videoconference used and outcomes for both 
		  museum educators and classroom teachers. Over the past several years, 
		  severe budget cuts and growing safety concerns have impacted the typical 
		  classroom&#39;s ability to physically access the rich resources available 
		  in museums, environmental centers, and active learning centers. Paradoxically, 
		  the mission of many museums, as reflected by their mission statements 
		  and their subsequent allocation of staff and resources, have changed 
		  to reflect a growing emphasis on service to educational settings. Project 
		  VIEW, a federally funded Technology Innovation Challenge Grant, (United 
		  States Department of Education Award Number R3030A000002) located at 
		  Schenectady City Schools, has developed an innovative program that has 
		  as its objective the sharing of museum resources by bringing the museum 
		  to the classroom via interactive, point-point videoconferencing. Under 
		  this model, core groups of museum educators and teachers collaboratively 
		  develop curriculum units that integrate museum staff and supporting 
		  artifacts into classroom instruction through the use of videoconferencing 
		  via the web. In addition to designing a method of developing curriculum, 
		  the project also has designed a professional development program that 
		  trains classroom teachers and museum educators in point-to-point videoconferencing 
		  and has established a method of evaluating the efforts that support 
		  the program and the resulting outcomes to teachers and students. (Geehan, 
		  &amp; Meuwissen, 2001). Utilizing a stakeholder based participatory 
		  model of evaluation, the project has been able to provide program staff, 
		  local educators, and museum teams formative and summative information 
		  on the process of designing and implementing videoconferences as well 
		  as information on the direct outcomes and systemic organizational changes 
		  that have occurred as a result of participation. (Newman, Spaulding, 
		  Catapano, 2002). </p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Background of the project and related literature</h1>
		<p class="normal">Computer and information technologies play increasingly 
		  important roles in education at all grade levels and within all subject 
		  areas. From Internet-based research to telecommunications exchanges, 
		  learners and instructors have, at their disposal, an abundant and expanding 
		  base of resources that bring information into classrooms, libraries, 
		  and homes quickly and efficiently. Videoconferencing, for example, is 
		  a medium through which great potential exists for interaction among 
		  students, educators, and the subject matter. Unlike distance learning, 
		  which features a teacher at one location and students at another, videoconferencing 
		  maintains direct interaction between educators and students in a classroom 
		  setting while allowing content experts or other educators to become 
		  part of the classroom through audio and video communication. Moreover, 
		  videoconferences foster an environment in which ideas can be exchanged 
		  through a variety of means including: 1) point-to-point communications, 
		  in which one site establishes direct audio and video interactions with 
		  another site; and 2) multi-presence communications, in which one site 
		  acts as a hub for communications that take place among multiple locations. 
		  (Berg, 1999, Hildebrand, 1995; Klemm, 1998).</p>
		<p class="normal">Prior research has shown that computer networks are 
		  model channels for fostering collaborative learning and the expansion 
		  of educational resources (Hardwick, 2000). As a medium that utilizes 
		  computer networking for instant communication, videoconferences are 
		  means of collaborative education through which valuable resources can 
		  be brought into classrooms. Nonetheless, studies have concluded that 
		  interactive, computer-based environments are sometimes prone to inefficient 
		  delivery of information (Furst-Bowe, 1997), with that, when compared 
		  with student and teacher anxiety, and a lack of motivation to master 
		  the subject matter and manipulate the learning environment, they frequently 
		  lead to a lack of participation (Bures, 2000). Moreover, some argue 
		  that the benefits of educational technologies are hindered by a lack 
		  of collaboration among practitioners, researchers, decision makers, 
		  and subject matter experts (Clark &amp; Estes, 1999) and overgeneralizations 
		  with regard to perceived advantages, such as improved student learning, 
		  multicultural awareness, skill mastery, and future economic possibilities 
		  (Fabos &amp; Young, 1999). In the past, it was assumed that the mere 
		  presence of computers and other information technology within classrooms 
		  was a testimony to their effectiveness as instructional aides. Today, 
		  however, educators must be able to justify the acquisition of new technologies 
		  by demonstrating that it overtly facilitates student attainment, performance, 
		  participation, and retention.</p>
		<p class="normal">The role of videoconferencing as one of these technologies 
		  is increasingly important. Prior to the development of infrastructure 
		  that is capable of transmitting both video and audio data over analog 
		  and digital telephone and cable lines, text-based electronic conferences 
		  were used for educational purposes. This medium has been shown to be 
		  an effective means of education, provided the instructor: 1) ensures 
		  that students are comfortable with and able to use technology; and 2) 
		  solidifies the connection between learning course material and effectively 
		  utilizing the medium (Bures, 2000). With the ability to transmit video 
		  and audio, the &#34;virtual classroom&#34; has become a reality, where teaching 
		  and learning take place within a computer-mediated communication system 
		  (Hiltz, 1994). This learning environment, compared to the environment 
		  that is solely text-based, provides greater opportunity to learn through 
		  exploration and inquiry and to communicate and cooperate with others. 
		  (Edelson, 1999; Mioduser, 2000).</p>
		<p class="normal">Specifically, the utilization of the videoconference 
		  as an educational medium is reported to have a variety of benefits. 
		  Included among these benefits are: 1) the provision of equity of access 
		  to subject matter experts and other instructional resources (Omatseye, 
		  1999); 2) the potential for in-depth collaboration of participants from 
		  various backgrounds (Wilson, 2000); 3) the ability for students to adopt 
		  a more collaborative, contextual environment in comparison to other 
		  forms of distance education (Peplow, 1996); 4) increased student interest 
		  in and understanding of the perspectives brought to the videoconference 
		  by other participants (Peat, 2000); and 5) the potential to reproduce 
		  a multimedia learning environment, incorporating video, discussion, 
		  activities, texts, and graphics, by videotape (Paul et al., 2000).</p>
		<p class="normal">Nonetheless, critics have proposed that videoconferences 
		  pose unique difficulties that traditional learning environments do not. 
		  For example, exchanges can lead to confusion or non-participation due 
		  to cultural or communication barriers, anxiety, and technological incompatibility 
		  (Telg, 1996). Moreover, it was reported that the time and energy required 
		  to prepare and implement effective videoconference-based instruction 
		  greatly exceeds those elements in comparison to a more traditional classroom 
		  setting, regardless of the style of instruction (Boettcher, 1997). In 
		  addition, no conclusive evidence exists that connects videoconferencing 
		  with improvements in student achievement, and there is little understanding 
		  of or research about the most effective methods of utilizing conference-based 
		  education technology (Ess, 2000). Thus, educational videoconferencing, 
		  particularly in relation to student performance and longitudinal impact, 
		  is an area that would benefit from further research.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Methodology</h1>
		<p class="normal">A multiphase, mixed methodology plan, which included 
		  the collection of both formative and summative data from multiple stakeholder 
		  groups, was developed and employed to support the evaluation of this 
		  program. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed as 
		  means of meeting the needs of project decision makers. Data from stakeholders, 
		  consisting of educators, content provider personnel, students, and project 
		  staff, were solicited through paper-pencil surveys, interviews, and 
		  observations. Formative data were used to identify key strengths and 
		  concerns and recommend programmatic improvements based on stakeholder 
		  needs and program objectives. Summative data served as a means of: 1) 
		  documenting the number of products created, the number of videoconferences 
		  implemented, and the outcomes of those processes; and 2) establishing 
		  a foundation for studying longitudinal systemic change across the lifetime 
		  of the program.</p>
		<p>The following is a summary of the data sources and collection methods 
		  used, as well as target stakeholders from whom information was gathered, 
		  for the evaluation:</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Building Capacity for Videoconferencing:</h2>
		<p>Archival data were obtained from project staff to document the number 
		  of schools and content providers supported through the project and the 
		  extent to which resources were provided to each. These data assisted 
		  the evaluation team in documenting the establishment of foundations 
		  for change in schools&#39; and museums&#39; awareness and utilization of videoconference 
		  technology and their assessments of its value.</p>
		<p> Interviews were conducted with project staff to verify the approaches 
		  utilized to build capacity for videoconferencing and the impacts of 
		  those activities. These data were utilized to document the channels 
		  by which resources in schools and content providers were changed to 
		  accommodate the use of videoconferencing technology in classroom settings.</p>
		<p>Interviews were conducted with content provider and district-level 
		  support personnel to document the resources that were currently being 
		  instated or utilized that had not been available before the implementation 
		  of Project VIEW capacity building efforts. These data were employed 
		  to document the impact of videoconferencing technology on participating 
		  districts and informal education providers.</p>
		<div class="normal"> 
		  <p>Paper-pencil surveys were distributed to district-level technical 
			support staff who attended project-sponsored training in videoconference

		Sample Videoconferences Employed Through Project VIEW</span></p>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> 
			<p class="normal"> To date over 200 point-to-point videoconferences 
			  were implemented through Project VIEW, all of which targeted elementary, 
			  middle school, and high school students. Overall, approximately 
			  5,000 students have participated directly in the videoconference 
			  experiences.</p>
		  </div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Teachers brought various institutions into 
			their classrooms through videoconferences, including museums, zoos, 
			and scientific research centers. While several of the broadcasts were 
			direct results of the process of videoconference and curriculum development 
			discussed in Section Two of this report, Project VIEW also solicited 
			participation from other institutions with established videoconferencing 
			programs, thus increasing educators&#39; access to rich content and resources.</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusion</h1>
		<p class="normal">Throughout the first three years of program implementation, 
		  Project VIEW has effectively linked a consortium of demographically 
		  varied school districts with multiple diverse, content-rich informal 
		  education providers to establish the groundwork for educational videoconferencing 
		  that brings unique resources to students who may not otherwise have 
		  access to them. The multifaceted nature of the project, which seeks 
		  to both increase access to videoconferencing as an educational tool 
		  and improve the use of that tool, has served as a foundation for initiating 
		  comprehensive change in educational technology integration. In general, 
		  stakeholders perceived that educational videoconferencing served to 
		  benefit schools by increasing their access to authentic and exceptional 
		  resources, from historic and scientifically unique locales, while informal 
		  education providers were endowed with the means to publicize their unique 
		  resources and provide greater access to the public. Moreover, Project 
		  VIEW has begun to build collaborative partnerships among institutions 
		  with varied interests, promoting a common purpose for the utilization 
		  of informal education providers through educational videoconferencing.</p>
