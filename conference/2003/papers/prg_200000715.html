		<p class="PaperTitle">Five Become One: how five Manchester museums developed 
		  a shared web portal</p>
		<p class="Author">Pauline Webb, Museum of Science &amp; Industry, Manchester, 
		  United Kingdom</p>
		<p class="URL"><a href="http://www.msim.org.uk/" target="_blank">www.msim.org.uk</a></p>
		<p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">This paper will describe how and why five Manchester 
		  museums  the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester (MSIM), Manchester 
		  Art Gallery (MAG), the Manchester Museum (MM), the People&#39;s History 
		  Museum (PHM) and the Whitworth Art Gallery (WAG)  developed a shared 
		  web portal for the delivery of information about their collections. 
		  The launch of the web portal in May/June 2003 will be the fruition of 
		  a four-year collaboration between the five museums. The rationale behind 
		  the portal is that, for historic reasons that are unknown to most real 
		  and virtual museum visitors, Manchester has five major separately constituted 
		  museums, whose collections relate and overlap in a number of ways. 
		  By offering a single access-point to information about the combined 
		  collections of the partner museums, the web portal will improve public 
		  understanding of the collections of all five museums and will enable 
		  the museums to work together more effectively through greater knowledge 
		  of each other&#39;s collections.</p>
		<p class="keywords">Keywords: collaboration, Manchester, museum portal</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Background</h1>
		<p class="normal">Manchester is unusual amongst the large British cities 
		  outside London in having five museums with outstanding collections that 
		  are separately constituted and governed.In most other cities of similar 
		  size, such as Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool, the major museums and 
		  art galleries are united through common governance and jointly cover 
		  the full range of museum disciplines. In Manchester, the existence 
		  of multiple museum bodies and the nature of their disciplinary specialisms 
		  may be confusing to users. For example, actual and potential users 
		  may be unclear as to what characterises, distinguishes or, indeed, conjoins 
		  the art collections of the Manchester Art Gallery and the Whitworth 
		  Art Gallery. Similarly, it is not immediately obvious from their names 
		  that the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester covers only the 
		  physical sciences, whereas the Manchester Museum covers the natural 
		  sciences. </p>
		<p class="normal">An opportunity to address these issues arose when the 
		  Museums and Galleries Commission (subsequently reconstituted as Resource, 
		  the Council for Museums, Libraries and Archives) introduced the Designation 
		  Scheme for collections held by non-national English museums in 1997. 
		  This scheme provided a method of assessing collections and determining 
		  which collections could be deemed to be of pre-eminent national and 
		  international importance. The five Manchester museums successfully 
		  applied for Designation of parts or all of their collections. The purpose 
		  of the Designation Scheme was not simply to formally acknowledge the 
		  existence of such collections, but also to provide a basis for channelling 
		  national funding to support them. Accordingly, the Designation Challenge 
		  Fund was introduced for a three-year initial term in 1999 and extended 
		  for a further two years in 2002. </p>
		<p class="normal">All five Manchester museums were keen to take advantage 
		  of this new funding stream to improve the recording and management of 
		  information about their collections. They decided to collaborate on 
		  the procurement of a collections management system and the commissioning 
		  of two interrelated research reports: a feasibility study into the potential 
		  for shared access to collections information and audience research relating 
		  to the delivery of collections information via the web. The collections 
		  management system was procured through a joint tendering process, at 
		  the end of which the partners were unanimous in opting to purchase KE 
		  Software&#39;s EMu collections management system. The partnership yielded 
		  both tangible and intangible benefits, chief amongst which was the saving 
		  of about a third of the costs of the license fees and hence the annual 
		  support charges of a new collections management system. This was achieved 
		  through the partners successfully negotiating to be treated as one client 
		  group. Other benefits have included the pooling of skills and knowledge 
		  in both the selection and the development of the system.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Great Expectations </h1>
		<p class="normal">From the beginning, all five partners were committed 
		  to making collections information available via their web sites and 
		  thus required the chosen collections management system to provide a 
		  web interface facility. Hence, in order to be able to develop web interfaces 
		  that succeeded in meeting the needs of their users, the audience research 
		  project was carried out in parallel with the procurement process. As 
		  the partners were also investigating the feasibility of shared hosting 
		  arrangements, the market research contractor was specifically briefed 
		  to include multi-museum sites and portal sites, such as Australian Museums 
		  On Line, amongst the test web sites.</p>
		<p class="normal">The resulting audience research report, titled <i>Great 
		  Expectations, </i>proved to be extremely informative, in terms of both 
		  web site design and content issues. It also provided strong support 
		  for the concept of the Manchester museums web portal, as shown by the 
		  following extracts:</p>
	  </div>
	  <blockquote> 
		<div class="Section1">General visitors would welcome a portal site featuring 
		  a cluster of quality museum and gallery users. </div>
		<div class="Section1">the web encourages a fluidity in how users search 
		  for, find and consume information.</div>
		<div class="Section1">Museums and galleries may attract more hits (and 
		  more real visits) if they were to launch a collective portal site.</div>
	  </blockquote>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p class="normal">The report identified three behavioural types of museum 
		  user - characterised as browser, searcher and researcher - according 
		  to the way that they engage with information, a model that is equally 
		  applicable applies to both the &#39;real&#39; museum audience and the &#39;virtual&#39; 
		  museum audience. However, it is the distinctions between these audiences 
		  that support the case for the web portal:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Web sites tend to attract more passing traffic 
			(browser-type users) than their physical equivalents, demonstrated 
			by the typical statistics whereby hits far outweigh visits. An accidental 
			hit may be more likely to turn into a visit if the web site has broader 
			appeal. </div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithbullets"> Regular web users have sophisticated expectations 
			- as searchers or researchers, they expect the web to circumvent the 
			physical constraints of the real world and to provide information 
			more flexibly and seamlessly. </div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p class="normal">Thus the target audience for the portal site includes 
		  all types of user. </p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">The rationale for the web portal</h1>
		<p class="normal">Although shared hosting proved to be unfeasible in the 
		  short term for a number of logistical reasons, the partners remained 
		  committed to the concept of providing &#39;one-stop&#39; access to their combined 
		  collections. By its capacity to attract a cross-section of the combined 
		  web audience of the five museums, the portal site would increase awareness 
		  of and access to all of Manchester&#39;s Designated collections. This is 
		  expected to increase audience for the museums individual web sites 
		  because of the potential for audience crossover. As the <i>Great Expectations 
		  </i>report found that visits to museum web sites were not seen as a 
		  substitute for real visits, increased awareness of the partner museums 
		  and their collections is expected to result in an increase in real visits 
		  as well as virtual visits. The portal would assist the planning of 
		  a physical visit by making it easier for both local and remote web users 
		  to identify the museum or museums that hold the material that they are 
		  interested in. </p>
		<p class="normal">This rationale was sufficiently persuasive to result 
		  in the award of a grant of £30,000 from the Designation Challenge Fund 
		  to develop and evaluate the web portal over 2002-2003. </p>
		<h1 class="SubHeaderSmall">The web portal model</h1>
		<p class="normal">While much of the data structure of KE EMu, the shared 
		  collections management system, is fixed, disciplinary variations are 
		  allowed for and have been applied in the partners&#39; individual systems. 
		  This means that the data sets are not automatically compatible for cross-collection 
		  querying and an intervening process is required. In order to save time 
		  and effort, the partners agreed to adopt a tried and tested mechanism 
		  for museum data exchange  the extended set of Dublin Core metadata 
		  elements that was developed for the CIMI Dublin Core testbed project. 
		  Before opting for this approach, they undertook a preliminary exercise 
		  of mapping their EMu data fields to the 15 CIMI Dublin Core elements 
		  to ensure that it would be a workable format. The only problem that 
		  emerged was that a few of the metadata elements would have required 
		  additional data development, so those elements have been omitted from 
		  the model.</p>
		<p class="normal">The process of developing the web portal model has been 
		  greatly assisted by KE Software&#39;s decision to develop a generic web 
		  portal facility for EMu. This decision was prompted not only in response 
		  to the Manchester museums web portal proposal, but also in response 
		  to the desire of other client museums for EMu to be in some way interoperable 
		  with other collections management systems. For example, one of KE Software&#39;s 
		  major clients is the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, which, for 
		  obvious reasons, wanted to be able to exchange data with other branches 
		  of the Smithsonian that use different systems.  The generic EMu portal 
		  facility exports data from the collections management system in XML 
		  format to the EMU portal, which can also receive data in XML format 
		  from other sources, as illustrated in the diagram below. The configuration 
		  of the portal query interface, which can be set up to meet the client 
		  museum&#39;s requirements, determines how the data is accessed and presented. 
		  Query formats and display records are created using the generic set 
		  of PHP tools developed by KE Software for the EMu web interface function.</p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"><img src="webb.fig1.gif" width="396" height="161"/></p>
		<p class="MsoCaption">Figure 1</p>
		<p class="normal">In the case of the Manchester web portal, the dynamic 
		  cross-collection query interface is the core of portal, but it is supported 
		  by static web pages that assist users to get the most out of the site. 
		  These supporting sections include an &#39;About Us&#39; section that will provide 
		  background information on each museum/gallery and its collections, a 
		  &#39;Query Tips&#39; section that will provide additional guidance on how to 
		  format an effective search and a &#39;Contact Us&#39; section for emailed enquiries 
		  and feedback. The web portal resides on the dedicated EMu server shared 
		  by the Manchester Museum and the Whitworth Art Gallery, which are both 
		  part of the University of Manchester.  All partner museum servers have 
		  the appropriately mapped Dublin Core filters installed. As shown in 
		  the diagram below, the way that the portal query interface works is 
		  that the query is sent to each museum&#39;s server, where it is translated 
		  through the Dublin Core filter so that matching data is identified in 
		  the EMu database. The query results are then returned, back through 
		  the Dublin Core filter, to the portal. Users will have the choice of 
		  a basic keyword query that will search all fields or an advanced query 
		  featuring selected individual fields.</p>
		<p class="normal">As the data fields that are accessible through the web 
		  portal are restricted to the Dublin Core elements, the level of data 
		  available to users is less comprehensive than the data available through 
		  the museums&#39; individual web sites. Therefore, the portal data display 
		  screens have a link to the individual web sites, so that a user who 
		  wants more information is directed to the source of the fullest available 
		  matching record. For example, to reduce storage demands and data transmission 
		  times, the portal web site will only contain thumbnail images, whereas 
		  larger images may be available on the individual web site. </p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Where next?</h1>
		<p class="normal">Assuming that the findings of the planned evaluation 
		  demonstrate that the Manchester museums web portal provides a valuable 
		  service to users, there are various ways in which it might be extended 
		  and enhanced. The current phase has followed a &#39;no frills&#39; approach, 
		  as the first stage of the portal development inevitably needed to focus 
		  primarily on the &#39;nuts and bolts&#39; of the portal functionality. As any 
		  further development depends on funding availability, the partners have 
		  currently focused on ways forward that would meet the objectives of 
		  two new funding streams: Renaissance in the Regions and Culture Online. 
		  The first of these initiatives, Renaissance in the Regions, is a nationally 
		  funded programme that will establish nine regional museum hubs in England. 
		  The primary mission of the regional hubs is to increase access to museums 
		  for sectors of the population that are currently under-represented amongst 
		  museum audiences. It is perceived that this objective can best be achieved 
		  through museums working together more effectively on a regional basis. 
		  Extending the Manchester museums web portal to include other hub museums 
		  in North West England would provide a means of improving understanding 
		  of the region&#39;s collections.</p>
		<p class="normal">The second initiative, Culture Online, is another nationally 
		  funded initiative, with a budget of £13 million. Its vision is to use 
		  digital technologies to &#34;build a bridge between learners of all ages 
		  and the rich resources of the cultural sector&#34;, the cultural sector 
		  being defined as encompassing museums, galleries, libraries, archives, 
		  theatres and orchestras. Culture Online is still at the formative stage, 
		  but the Manchester museum partners have already submitted an &#39;expression 
		  of interest&#39;, which is the first stage of the funding application process. 
		  The premise for the Manchester bid is that the Manchester museums web 
		  portal could be extended to incorporate more partners and then functionally 
		  enhanced by developing a series of interactive components, which would 
		  make the content more appealing to a wider audience. Two examples of 
		  ways in which collections information could be presented in a way that 
		  is more responsive to user interests and offers greater user participation 
		  are: virtual exhibition tours led by avatars, which could be pre-configured 
		  but also custom-built; a &#39;curate your own exhibition facility&#39;, whereby 
		  users choose what they want to put in the virtual exhibition and the 
		  type of setting, and develop their own interpretation.</p>
