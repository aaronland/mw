	  <p class="Author">Steve Dietz, Walker Art Center, USA</p>
	  <p class="URL"><a href="http://walkerart.org/" target="_blank">http://walkerart.org</a></p>
	  <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
	  <p class="AbstractText">&#34;Interfacing the Digital&#34; presents work 
		at the Walker Art Center focusing on new physical interfaces, particularly 
		for the presentation of digital art. Some examples include a freestanding 
		revolving door portal for the exhibition <i>Art Entertainment Network</i>; 
		a telematic table resulting from an international design competition; 
		and a &#34;temporary autonomous sarai&#34; developed collaboratively 
		by the new media artists Raqs Media Collective (New Delhi) and the architectural 
		practice Atelier Bow-Wow (Tokyo). These and other projects are prototypes 
		for new, interactive social spaces and functions being developed for the 
		Walker&#39;s new building expansion, designed by the architects Herzog &amp; 
		de Meuron. </p>

		Raqs Media Collective (New Delhi), Atelier Bow-Wow (Tokyo), telematic 
		table, Walker Art Center</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Background</h1>
	  <p class="normal">In the last 5 years, especially following Documenta X 
		(1997), the Whitney Biennial of 2000, and <i>Net_Condition</i> at ZKM 
		(2000), there has been at times heated debate not only about how best 
		to present digital and specifically networked art in an institutional 
		context but also whether to do so at all.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> 
		[i] </a> Not all of the discussion revolves around issues of physical 
		interfaces to such works, but their onsite presentation is a critical 
		concern for both museums and artists—and their audiences</p>
	  <p class="normal">This paper is informed by these discussions, mostly online 
		in the archives of nettime, rhizome, thingist, and CRUMB, but focuses 
		on personal experiences in curating 10 exhibitions over the past 5 years 
		that have included network-based art, including <i>Beyond Interface: net 
		art and Art on the Net </i>at Museums and the Web in 1998.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> [ii] </a></p>
	  <p class="normal">Finally, while working with art that is &#34;born digital&#34; 
		is a special case for most museums, I would argue that the many of the 
		issues and lessons are transferable to the digital contextualization of 
		any work in a museum&#39;s collection.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Challenge of Context</h1>
	  <p class="normal">One of the challenges of presenting digital art, is that 
		the context and the work are generally displayed via the same means: the 
		screen. How to differentiate between the metadata and the experience? 
		One strategy is simply to open the project in a new window. This was the 
		strategy of <i>Beyond Interface.</i> </p>
	  <p class="normal">The complaint from artists about such a strategy is that 
		it creates a curatorial gateway that viewers must pass through before 
		getting to the heart of the matter, the actual experience. If you think 
		of the example of video games, for instance, there may be a narrative 
		introduction to the game — but often there isn&#39;t and generally you 
		can skip through it — and then you&#39;re in game play mode. If you need/want 
		help you specifically open the FAQ or Help screens, but they are not the 
		main way of starting the game. Even with a painting exhibition, while 
		there is reams of research about the best length, tone, style, etc. for 
		didactics, the working assumption is that most people look at a painting 
		first and then read the label — the help file, so to speak — 
		if they want more information. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Even when net art exhibitions present the artwork first, 
		it is often because the only curatorial context is a list of links, which 
		is an equally unbalanced approach.</p>
	  <p class="normal">With <i>Art Entertainment Network</i>, I tried to finesse 
		this issue by making the interface part of the experience itself — 
		it is a portal to art projects but to find out more information, you must 
		go to the context (<a href="http://aen.walkerart.org/" target="_blank">http://aen.walkerart.org</a> 
		).</p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><a name="fig1"></a><a href="dietz.fig1.html"><img src="dietz_fig01_aen.t.png" width="395" height="327" border="0"/></a></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 1 : Screenshot Art Entertainment Network</p>
	  <p class="normal">And more recently, with <i>Translocations</i>, I integrated 
		functions of various projects into the interface, so that from the contextual 
		pages, you could directly &#34;modify&#34; the text (via an artist project 
		called <i>OPUS</i>), send an email about it in any language anywhere (via 
		an artist project called <i>Translation Map</i>), create your own soundtrack 
		to browse to (via an artist project called <i>Translocal Mixer</i>) or 
		pop up the video window of the <i>Translocal Channel</i>.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> [iii] </a></p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Challenge of Ghettoization</h1>
	  <p class="normal">Related to the issue of context is ghettoization. There 
		is a conundrum. On the one hand, it can be valuable to provide a focus 
		on a particular set of practices, whether they are photography or performance 
		or digital art. It is easier in such focused contexts to meaningfully 
		differentiate between, say, documentary, fashion, abstract, and conceptual 
		photography, each of which has its own distinct — but intermingled 
		— histories, methods, presentational contexts, etc. At the same time 
		it doesn&#39;t make sense to completely divorce photography from the visual 
		arts; to not include it in a thematic show, whether about modernist art 
		in America or America in the modern age. </p>
	  <p class="normal">At the Walker, my answer, as is my wont, is both/and, 
		not either/or. Gallery 9 is a virtual gallery for network-based art. At 
		the same time, with a project like <i>Shock of the View</i>, we specifically 
		chose to compare a physical artwork with a digital artwork. In the example 
		below, for instance, the guest curator chose to compare a John Frederick 
		Kensett painting of Mount Washington with a ski resort webcam of the same 
		view, arguing that Kensett was the board-of-tourism-promotional-guy of 
		his day. In another case, I compared Ken Goldberg&#39;s <i>Memento Mori</i>, 
		with the ephemeral <i>Sisyphus</i> of Luciano Fabro.(<a target="_blank" href="http://www.walkerart.org/salons/shockoftheview/">http://www.walkerart.org/ 
		salons/shockoftheview/</a>.)</p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><a name="fig2"></a><a href="dietz.fig2.html"><img src="dietz_fig02_shock.t.png" width="395" height="286" border="0"/></a></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 2 : Screenshot Shock of the View</p>
	  <p class="normal">Comparisons are odious, and in the end, the interesting 
		point is not that digital artist x is as good as artist y, but to bring 
		their contexts into collision and see what happens. Sometimes this is 
		best done in a digital only show. In the same way that Douglas Fogle at 
		the Walker might do a painting only show, such as <i>Painting at the Edge 
		of the World, </i>which explores diverse ideas about painting at the moment, 
		in the Walker&#39;s expansion there will be a &#34;mediatheque&#34; devoted 
		to the presentation of new media art (http://www.walkerart.org/programs/vaexhibpainting.html). 
		We will continue, however, to do crossover shows, such as <i>How Latitudes 
		Become Forms</i>, the current Walker exhibition curated by Philippe Vergne, 
		which incorporates performance, new media, and film directly into the 
		gallery exhibition (<a href="http://latitudes.walkerart.org/" target="_blank">http://latitudes.walkerart.org</a>).</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Challenge of Medium</h1>
	  <p class="normal">In this post-medium, post-studio world, the idea of a 
		medium may seem slightly antiquated and naïve. It&#39;s all just art, 
		right? </p>
	  <p class="normal">Personally, I believe there is a cinema and video practice 
		tradition that cannot be fully subsumed in installation art. The same 
		with photography. And, I would argue, digital art.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Perhaps more to the point, however, is that we tend to 
		talk about most digital art through the prism of visual arts, perhaps 
		with a nod to video art, but in many ways the more fruitful comparisons 
		are with the performing arts. Digital art is time-based, often performative, 
		often ephemeral, often done in/by groups, process-oriented, and so on. 
		The burning issues of collectability and ownership and authenticity take 
		on a whole different tone when viewed against the history of music, its 
		notation system for replaying a core experience that is nevertheless different 
		every time; and the by-now acceptance of live and recorded performances 
		as different but not merely derivative.</p>
	  <p class="normal">With <i>386 DX</i>, Alexei Shulgin — shown here in 
		Athens in a show I co-curated with Jenny Marketou for Medi@terra 2000 
		- plays computer-generated covers of hits such as <i>Purple Rain</i>, 
		an inspiration, I would argue, to a whole generation of digital performance 
		artists that transgress the boundaries of the art world&#39;s disciplines 
		(<a href="http://www.mediaterra.org/mediaterra2000/en.cgi?opensource" target="_blank">http://www.mediaterra.org/mediaterra2000/en.cgi?opensource</a> 
		and <a href="http://www.easylife.org/386dx" target="_blank">http://www.easylife.org/386dx</a>).</p>

	  <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 3 : Alexei Shulgin performing as part of the 
		Open Source Lounge at Medi@terra 2000, Athens</p>
	  <p class="normal">The point in terms of interfacing the digital is to pick 
		our models appropriately. Many of the issues of displaying digital work 
		may be better solved working from a tradition of theater (think of object 
		theater in history museums, for instance) and performance than rigid adherence 
		to the traditional gallery experience. </p>
	  <p class="normal">In the Walker&#39;s new expansion, we have built in this idea 
		by putting the mediatheque galleries literally in the balcony level of 
		the new performing arts studio. While there is no specific plan to always 
		integrate the spaces, the assumption is that at some point artists will 
		insist on their integration, building out the potential of the conjunction 
		experimentally.</p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><a name="fig4"></a><a href="dietz.fig4.html"><img src="dietz_fig04_mediatheque.t.png" width="395" height="319" border="0"/></a></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 4 : Computer model of the new performing arts 
		studio as part of the Walker Art Center expansion. At the back of the 
		2nd level balconies will be a series of mediatheque spaces.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Challenge of Expectations</h1>
	  <p class="normal">One of the reasons why the computer and the network have 
		become not only subjects but also means of making artwork is that they 
		are so ubiquitous in our daily lives. That very ubiquity, while it may 
		provide a certain familiarity, also creates a whole set of expectations, 
		starting with &#34;user friendliness.&#34;</p>
	  <p class="normal">Try telling Matthew Barney, he should be more user friendly. 
		Or Jasper Johns that his references are too obscure. </p>
	  <p class="normal">In this picture of <i>BangBang</i>, a work by the Bureau 
		of Inverse Technology, which was presented in a traveling show I curated 
		<i>Telematic Connections</i>, the Bureau disturbs our expectations of 
		interactivity. The viewer can do nothing to make the work &#34;happen;&#34; 
		it is dependent on environmental triggers outside of the gallery space 
		(http://telematic.walkerart.org/ and <a href="http://telematic.walkerart.org/telereal/bit_index.html">http://telematic.walkerart.org/telereal/bit_index.html</a>). 
		This was extremely frustrating for many visitors but too often the response 
		was based on a false notion of &#34;good interactivity,&#34; not, really, 
		whether they liked or understood the work on its own terms.</p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><a name="fig5"></a><a href="dietz.fig5.html"><img src="dietz_fig05_bangbang.t.png" width="395" height="254" border="0"/></a></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 5 : &#34;BangBang,&#34; 2000, Bureau of Inverse 
		Technology. Installation view from &#34;Telematic Connections: The Virtual 
		Embrace&#34; at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art</p>
	  <p class="normal">Interactivity and user-friendliness are just a couple 
		of the expectations with which we view digital art. On the museum side 
		of the equation, there are a whole set of parallel issues to do with touch/don&#39;t 
		touch, how much time you spend with a time-based work, and other learned 
		gallery behaviors. All of these are concerns that both the artist and 
		the presenter must take into consideration when interfacing the digital, 
		but the answer is not always obvious — to make things &#34;easier&#34; 
		to do, for instance. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Challenge of Infrastructure</h1>
	  <h1 class="Header" align="center"><a name="fig6"></a><a href="dietz.fig6.html"><img src="dietz_fig06_henshaw.t.png" width="395" height="253" border="0"/></a></h1>
	  <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 6 : David Henshaw, a friend of the author who 
		just &#34;dropped by&#34; to see the installation of Telematic Connections 
		at the San Francisco Art Institute, who was drafted to splice cables.</p>
	  <p class="normal">There is not really too much to say about infrastructure 
		except that it is absolutely necessary, vital, critical. Yet, in every 
		single installation I have done over the past 5 years, no matter where, 
		the level of support has been less than for a comparable contemporary 
		art exhibition at that institution. Not out of malice or design but largely 
		because of the history of the space and the personnel. Nevertheless, it 
		should be just as easy to plug-in a network connection as it is electricity, 
		as just one small example. But it&#39;s not, and until it is, institutions 
		will only be compounding their problems — and their audiences — 
		when interfacing the digital. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The problem is totally solvable, but perhaps primarily 
		in the design of new facilities. No facility should be built today that 
		does not assume that significant network and computing resources will 
		be required in potentially any area of the institution at one time or 
		another.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Challenge of Legal Bug</h1>
	  <p class="normal">A &#34;legal bug&#34; is a concept that the artist group 
		Knowbotic Research coined when their installation for <i>Open Source Art 
		Hack</i>. <i>Minds of Concern </i>was shut down not because of infrastructure 
		issues, exactly, but because of a contractual obligation — supposedly 
		— on the part of the institution hosting the show.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> [iv] </a></p>

	  <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 7 : &#34;Minds of Concern,&#34; 2002, Knowbotic 
		Research. Installation view at the New Museum, New York.</p>
	  <p class="normal"><i>Minds of Concern</i> uses port scanning, a technique 
		that is sometimes used by hackers to determine whether there are any weaknesses 
		in a server. Knowbotic&#39;s use was simply the scanning, no hacking. After 
		extensive consultation with legal experts around the United States, it 
		was determined that this is essentially like looking in a window or open 
		door from across the street. As long as you don&#39;t enter, there is no crime. 
		For Knowbotic&#39;s use, they were alerting various non-profits when there 
		was an insecurity in their system. It did not matter that this was a legally 
		protected activity — or at least not illegal activity — the 
		museum&#39;s &#34;shrinkwrap&#34; contract with its upstream Internet Service 
		Provider included a blanket clause — apparently standard - that no 
		port scanning was allowed, regardless of intent. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Knowbotic&#39;s point was that there is the possibility — 
		and necessity — of a public domain in the digital realm, but that 
		regardless of the public law around the issues, which in itself is problematic, 
		the standard operating practice of shrinkwrap licenses and their equivalents 
		was severely restricting the actual scope of the public domain. Legal 
		bugs, so to speak, are undermining public space in the digital realm.</p>
	  <p class="normal">My point is that institutions, while often overwhelmed 
		by the financial burden of litigation, understand and can protest cogently 
		and strongly an artist&#39;s right to fair use, to parody, etc. But in the 
		digital domain, it is often terra incognita, and so much easier to simply 
		say &#34;it&#39;s in the contract,&#34; and let the lights go dim. As the 
		digital sphere becomes increasingly privatized, interfacing it becomes 
		increasingly compromised.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Challenge of Presentation</h1>
	  <p class="normal">One can list dozens of other challenges to interfacing 
		the digital, but I would like to end with three examples of the presentation 
		of work in physical space. These are not intended, naturally, as universal 
		solutions, but as case studies of attempts to solve particular issues 
		in specific situations.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Let&#39;s Entertain and Art Entertainment Network </h2>
	  <p class="normal">As I said earlier, the interface that we created for the 
		online exhibition <i>Art Entertainment Network</i>, was designed as a 
		portal; a format &#34;native&#34; to the network. Once we had decided 
		on this exhibition design, we commissioned Antenna Design in New York 
		to create a physical interface, which could be used in the galleries as 
		part of the parallel exhibition of visual arts, <i>Let&#39;s Entertain (</i><a href="http://www.walkerart.org/va/letsentertain/le_content.html">http://www.walkerart.org/va/letsentertain/le_content.html</a>).</p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><a name="fig8"></a><a href="dietz.fig8.html"><img src="dietz_fig08_door.t.png" width="395" height="533" border="0"/></a></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 8 : Door-Portal for Art Entertainment Network 
		as part of Let&#39;s Entertain, Walker Art Center</p>
	  <p class="normal">Antenna designed a freestanding, revolving door, which 
		acted as a kind of portal between the physical space of the exhibition 
		and the virtual space of the online artworks. As you push the door around, 
		it automatically calls up the home page of each project. A touchpad allows 
		you to interact with the work. </p>
	  <p class="normal">This door could hold its own, so to speak, with the other 
		installations in the exhibition. At the same time, it was appropriate 
		to the concept of the online interface — as a portal. It also didn&#39;t 
		assume that the goal of the interface was to create a comfortable browsing 
		situation for hours of enjoyment. Like much gallery behavior it was designed 
		for more casual browsing. A holder next to the didactic label contained 
		printed bookmarks, which visitors could take and use to later log on to 
		the site at their convenience and in their favorite viewing position.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Architecture for Temporary Autonomous Sarai</h2>
	  <p class="normal">The Walker&#39;s most recent commission is a collaboration 
		between Raqs Media Collective from Delhi and Atelier Bow-Wow, an architectural 
		practice in Tokyo, <i>Architecture for Temporary Autonomous Sarai</i>, 
		which is part of the <i>How Latitudes Become Forms</i> exhibition, currently 
		on view. </p>
	  <p class="normal">From a visit to Raqs Media Collective&#39;s Sarai project 
		— first online and then in Delhi — I was very impressed with 
		their genealogy of the idea of the sarai as well as with the energy, levels 
		of interaction, and quality of output. This is how Raqs described Sarai 
		in a conversation with myself, Yukiko Shikata, and Gunalan Nadarajan that 
		undergirded the parallel online exhibition, <i>Translocations</i>. </p>
	  <p class="BlockQuote">&#34;. . . for us, the creation of a <u>sarai</u> was 
		to create a åhome for nomads&#39; and a resting place for practices of new 
		media nomadism. Traditionally, <u>sarais</u> were also nodes in the communications 
		system (horse-mail!) and spaces where theatrical entertainments, music, 
		dervish dancing, and philosophical disputes could all be staged. They 
		were hospitable to a wide variety of journeys—physical, cultural, 
		and intellectual. In medieval Central and South Asia, <u>sarais</u> were 
		the typical spaces for a concrete translocality, with their own culture 
		of custodial care, conviviality, and refuge. They also contributed to 
		syncretic languages and ways of being. We would do well to emulate even 
		in part aspects of this tradition in the new media culture of today. . 
		. . This might create oases of locatedness along the global trade routes 
		of new media culture.(Transcript, Translocations, full transcripts at: 
		<a href="http://latitudes.walkerart.org/translocations/" target="_blank">http://latitudes.walkerart.org/translocations/</a>)</p>
	  <p class="normal">A sarai was exactly what was needed for the <i>How Latitudes 
		Become Forms </i>exhibition — a place for social intercourse, both 
		onsite and translocally; a place for the investigation of both artists&#39; 
		work and the exhibition context. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Another artist group in the exhibition was the Tokyo-based 
		architectural practice Atelier Bow-Wow, Yoshiharu Tsukamoto and Momoyo 
		Kaijima, who are proponents of what they have named <i>da-me </i>or no-good 
		architecture. Multilayered structures with varied uses (underpass + cinema 
		+ bar + barbershop + store, for example), these buildings epitomize, for 
		them, a new creative, adaptive aesthetic. </p>
	  <p class="normal">We decided to ask Raqs and Bow-Wow to collaborate on a 
		&#34;Temporary Autonomous Sarai&#34; — something that was physically 
		modest, intended to be temporary, and programmatically could function 
		as a sarai for the exhibition.</p>

		Autonomous Sarai by Raqs Media Collective and Atelier Bow-Wow, realized

	  <p class="normal">I see the cross-disciplinary collaboration and the physical, 
		social space for presenting net art and its context as an exciting experiment, 
		which will inform future practice at the Walker.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Telematic Table</h2>
	  <p class="normal">As I said, we believe that artist practice can and should 
		inform institutional practice. One of the projects the Walker has commissioned 
		for the opening of our new spaces is a &#34;telematic table.&#34;</p>
	  <p class="normal">The core idea of this interface is to use the format of 
		the table to create a social learning platform that is different than 
		the typical nose-to-screen kiosk experience.</p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><a name="fig10"></a><a href="dietz.fig10.html"><img src="dietz_fig10_table.t.png" width="395" height="254" border="0"/></a></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 10 : Design for Telematic Table by Marek Walczak, 
		Michael McAllister, Jakub Segen, and Peter Kennard; commissioned by the 
		Walker Art Center</p>
	  <p class="normal">In 2001, after receiving a grant from the NEA, we held 
		an international design competition, inviting over 30 artists, designers, 
		and architects to submit designs for a telematic table with only this 
		for criteria:</p>
	  <p class="normal">&#34;We are envisioning a human-scaled interface that 
		is neither a standard desktop computer nor a public kiosk, but which viscerally 
		engages the user; encourages social interaction among groups of people, 
		can be networked and adapt to a variety of situations and museum spaces. 
		Like an ordinary table, the telematic table is a space of gathering and 
		exchange. It will give its users access to the Walker&#39;s multidisciplinary 
		collections and resources, foster curiosity and inquiry into the museum&#39;s 
		information assets, and create a setting for social interaction and dialogue 
		among groups of visitors.&#34; (Walker Art Center, 2001)</p>
	  <p class="normal">Of the responses, we selected 5 for further paper prototyping 
		and from those selected a proposal by a virtual group composed of Marek 
		Walczak, artist/architect; Michael McAllister, furniture designer; Jakub 
		Segen, Bell Labs researcher; Peter Kennard, programmer. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The core idea of the table is very simple. Using gesture 
		recognition software developed by Segen, which allows for a multiple-touch 
		interface, users drag digital assets from a &#34;pond&#34; to personal 
		&#34;puddles.&#34; Relationships with related works in other puddles 
		are automatically highlighted, encouraging, hopefully, cross-tabletalk 
		and interaction. In any case, just the shoulder-to-shoulder layout of 
		the table, we expect to lead to at least social situations, if not direct 
		conversations. Naturally, more information is available about each selected 
		object; objects can be &#34;collected&#34; on a postcard printout; and 
		URLs for even deeper investigation from home will be provided.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusion</h1>
	  <p class="normal">Even though the Turing Machine — the computer — 
		is defined as a universal black box that can do anything — follow 
		any instruction set — it is important not to confuse and conflate 
		the flexibility of <i>computation</i> with the physical interface of computers 
		as they are currently sold by most corporations. Interfacing the digital 
		can and should be as varied as the situations in which it is called for; 
		the audiences being sought; and the artwork being presented. This will 
		take imagination and ingenuity, but it is time for museums to stage their 
		own version of the infamous Apple ad that threw a &#34;monkey wrench&#34; 
		into the Orwellian screen of IBM computing and be as creative interfacing 
		the digital as they are with every other exhibition installation they 
		present.</p>
