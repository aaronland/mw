		<p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">In real museums, visitors may seek the help of a 
		  human tour guide in order to guide them through the exhibition and present 
		  information tailored to their interests. Accordingly, online museums 
		  could also benefit from digital§ &#34;life-like&#34; characters in order to 
		  guide users to virtual tours and to customize the tour information to 
		  user&#39;s interests. Digital characters have been explored in online museum 
		  websites with different degrees of interaction and modes of communication 
		  (Bertoletti et al., 2001; Adams et al., 2001; Doyle, P. and Isbister, 
		  K. 1999). Such researches, however, do not explore interactive &#34;conversational&#34; 
		  characters. Our main interest is in a tour-guide character that provides 
		  tour information through dialogue with the user. Our research developed 
		  an interactive conversational character that establishes a &#34;character-user&#34; 
		  dialogue while guiding the user through the virtual tour. The tour-guide 
		  character provides tour information and responses to users&#39; textual 
		  inputs by speaking through audio output and gesturing accordingly. Moreover, 
		  the tour-guide character attempts to provide adaptive guidance, to perform 
		  engaging storytelling and to promote user&#39;s participation through the 
		  virtual tour. In this paper, we describe the experiment focusing on 
		  the systems implementation, the dialogue creation process and the character&#39;s 
		  ability to detect user&#39;s interests. We further describe and analyze 
		  the system&#39;s evaluation. We hope lessons learned could serve as a base 
		  for developers of interactive characters as tour guides.</p>

		<h1 class="SubHeader">1. Introduction</h1>
		<p class="normal">In real museums, visitors may seek the help of a human 
		  tour guide in order to guide them through the exhibition and present 
		  information tailored to their interests. Accordingly, online museums 
		  could also benefit from digital interactive &#34;life-like&#34; characters in 
		  order to guide users to virtual exhibitions and to customize the virtual 
		  tour information to users interests. </p>
		<p class="normal">Digital characters have been explored in online museum 
		  websites with different degrees of interaction and modes of communication 
		  (Bertoletti et al., 2001; Adams et al., 2001) However, these researches 
		  have often limited their use to embodied alternatives to traditional 
		  menu or prompt-driven mechanisms for performing simple tasks such as 
		  searching for files or providing help information embedded in webpages. 
		  (Bertoletti et al, 2001; Adams et al 2001) Closer to our goals is Isbister&#39;s 
		  research where an agent guide tracks users words in a chat environment 
		  and provides more detailed or less detailed tour information accordingly. 
		  (Doyle, P. and Isbister, K. 1999) Our interest is, however, in an interactive 
		  conversational character that establishes a customized person-to-person 
		  dialogue while guiding the user through the virtual exhibition.</p>
		<p class="normal">In recent years, due to technological advancements, 
		  interest on interactive conversational characters has sharply increased 
		  mainly in response to e-market strategies. E-service providers explore 
		  their potential as sale assistants that perform intelligent like behaviors 
		  such as greeting users, answering questions and suggesting personalized 
		  products. Some famous examples are: Linda (by Extempo), Julia (by Virtual 
		  Personalities), Nicole (by Native Mind), Lucy Mcbot (by Artificial Life). 
		  Such characters not only instruct, guide, advice and perform tasks on 
		  user&#39;s behalf, but also enhance the communication with users through 
		  both verbal and non-verbal interactions such as hand gestures, facial 
		  expressions and gaze movements.</p>
		<p class="normal">Likewise, research on conversational characters in learning 
		  environments has concluded they not only facilitate the user experience 
		  with the learning environment but also highly improve the computer&#39;s 
		  ability to engage and motivate students. (Lester, J. et al 1997)</p>
		<p class="normal">Traditional complaints about interaction with conversational 
		  characters highlight that their reactive, context-free conversation 
		  and their lack of goals and motivation for interaction inevitably lead 
		  users to interact for a short period of time as well as increase the 
		  potential for unmet expectations regarding the character&#39;s intelligence. 
		  Thus, researchers on character development have focused attention on 
		  the design of motivational structures, emotional and personality traits 
		  and behavior control systems for characters to perform in context-specific 
		  environments, with well-defined goals and social tasks. (Hayes-Roth 
		  1998; Doyle, P. and Isbister, K. 1999; Lester, J. and Rickel, J. 1999) 
		  Emphasizing the importance of the social context for shaping user-character 
		  interactions, Doyle has suggested that in social tasks, in contrast 
		  to mechanical tasks, uncertain goals or goals of satisfaction rather 
		  than correctness, and dialogue rather than command-structured interactions, 
		  shape a good domain where an interactive conversational character may 
		  work well (Doyle, P.1999).</p>
		<p class="normal">Within this framework, our research attempts to shape 
		  dialogue interactions between an interactive conversational character 
		  and the user in the specific context of a guided tour to a virtual exhibition. 
		  We hope to examine features of conversation tracking and interest monitoring 
		  in order to improve the dialogue process and to identify some features 
		  that could serve as a framework for developers of interactive characters 
		  as tour guides.</p>
		<p class="normal">By observing the qualities of a human tour guide in 
		  a real museum, we developed a virtual tour guide to a virtual exhibition. 
		  A human tour-guide is expected to provide general information about 
		  the tour, to highlight curiosities about its objects, to tell stories 
		  related to the tour and to answer most frequent questions regarding 
		  tour and exhibition topics. Moreover, a tour guide&#39;s performance must 
		  include abilities to provide adaptive guidance and engaging storytelling, 
		  to stimulate visitors&#39; participation and interest in the exhibition 
		  and to reincorporate information from previous tours.</p>
		<p class="normal">Considering such qualities, we developed an experiment 
		  with an interactive character as a tour guide to a virtual exhibition. 
		  In the experiment, the user explores a virtual XVI Century Portuguese 
		  ship and objects inside while talking with and receiving information 
		  from the tour guide. In this paper, we describe the experiment focusing 
		  on the system implementation, the dialogue creation process and the 
		  character&#39;s ability to detect user&#39;s interests. We further describe 
		  and analyze the system&#39;s evaluation.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">2. Guiding a Tour-Exhibition</h1>
		<p class="normal">In real museum exhibitions, curators display objects, 
		  technical information, and narrative in space in order to convey the 
		  exhibition message. (Roberts, L. 1997) Tour guides often reinforce such 
		  narrative by conveying information that can be roughly divided in two 
		  levels: a presentation level, conveying general contextual information 
		  about the group of objects and their meaning, and an object-specific 
		  level, conveying information about the displayed object such as how 
		  it was made, by whom, why, when, how it was used, etc. </p>
		<p class="normal">Presentation level information is normally introduced 
		  prior to the viewing of objects, at the beginning of the tour and/or 
		  at the entrance of each exhibition room, in order to contextualize them. 
		  Human-guides often present such information in a compulsory, non-interactive 
		  way in order to establish the atmosphere for conveying the exhibition 
		  message. </p>
		<p class="normal">For object-specific information, on the other hand, 
		  human-guides are more susceptible to visitors&#39; interests. They are more 
		  likely to adopt a reactive approach in which the content of their speech 
		  will depend on how visitors interact with the exhibition material. </p>
		<p class="normal">Moreover, besides these levels of information flow, 
		  a human tour guide must also have engaging storytelling abilities to 
		  stimulate visitor&#39;s participation and exploration of the exhibition 
		  environment. Telling about curiosities and calling visitor&#39;s attention 
		  to interesting details are some of the techniques used to shape an engaging 
		  guidance. </p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">3. The Experiment </h1>
		<p class="normal">Our experiment developed a virtual tour guide that leads 
		  a tour to a XVI century Portuguese ship. Users are invited to visit 
		  four rooms of the ship in a pre-defined sequence (Figure 1). Inside 
		  each room, room-related objects are exhibited. (Table 1) The rooms are 
		  HTML pages with images of objects (Figure 2).</p>
		<table width="75%" border="1" class="normal" cellspacing="0" align="center">
		  <tbody><tr> 
			<td width="33%">Rooms</td>
			<td width="67%">Objects</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr> 
			<td>1. The Deck</td>
			<td>a sailor, a cabinboy, a toilet basket</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr> 
			<td>2. The Pilot Room</td>
			<td>a compass, an astrolabe, the Pilot</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr> 
			<td>3. The Storage Room</td>
			<td>barrels of wine, biscuits, water and ammunition</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr> 
			<td>4. Captain&#39;s Room</td>
			<td>the Captain, a route map, the Cross of Christ</td>
		  </tr>
		</tbody></table>
		<p class="MsoCaption">Table 1: Rooms and exhibited objects</p>
		<p class="normal">The virtual tour guide provides information about each 
		  room and its objects. As the user enters the room, the virtual tour 
		  guide presents the room telling how it was used and what kind of objects 
		  the user can find there. Next, the user explores the objects in the 
		  room by looking at their images and reading their detailed textual information 
		  in a small window that pops-up when the mouse is over the object. After 
		  that, the tour guide makes some comments about what the user saw. Such 
		  comments will serve to start a dialogue that gives the tour guide tips 
		  on the amount of the user&#39;s interest on the room&#39;s objects and topics.</p>
		<p class="normal">Topics for the guides comments and stories were generally 
		  divided according to the room and the objects exhibited inside. In this 
		  way, the &#34;Deck&#34; would lead to conversation and stories related to sailors&#39; 
		  sanitary conditions, crew and food. The &#34;Pilot room&#34; would lead to conversation 
		  and stories related to sailing instruments, the helm, pilot responsibilities, 
		  etc. The &#34;Storage room&#34; covered information on food, armaments, diseases, 
		  animals on board, etc. And, finally, the &#34;Captain&#39;s room&#34; would cover 
		  information on the captain&#39;s responsibilities, the objectives of the 
		  discovery voyages, political and economical interests of the time, Portugal 
		  and India, etc.<a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a></p>

		<p class="MsoCaption">Figure 2: Screen of the Pilot room</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">3.1 System Description</h2>
		<p class="normal">The virtual tour guide system consists in two components: 
		  a computer keyword spot program with a natural language processing system 
		  that delivers pre-scripted statements from a knowledge-content database 
		  and an MS-Agent character that performs such statements as gesture-choreographed 
		  dialogue pieces.</p>
		<p class="normal">The tour guide&#39;s remarks are delivered both, through 
		  textual balloons and audio output. User&#39;s inputs were textual entries 
		  in a textbox. (Figure 2)</p>
		<p class="normal">The dialogue plan and the knowledge-database were designed 
		  and scripted with ImpCharacter Editor 2.1 developed by Extempo Systems 
		  Inc. (<a href="http://www.extempo.com/">http://www.extempo.com</a>) (Figure 3).<a name="fig3"></a></p>
		<p class="MsoCaption"><a href="almeidafig3.html"><img src="almeidafig3.t.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="0"/></a></p>
		<p class="MsoCaption">Figure 3: Authoring the Guide&#39;s Dialogue and Knowledge</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">3.2 The Tour Guide Knowledge-Database</h2>
		<p class="normal">§The tour guide knowledge-content database stores the 
		  dialogue steps, keywords (of three types: general keywords, room specific 
		  keywords and after-dialogue keywords), pre-conditions for the delivery 
		  of dialogue pieces, as well as the tour-guide personal history and mood 
		  settings. </p>
		<p class="normal">By using pre-condition features, the tour guide can 
		  personalize the dialogue by tracking each dialogue piece and visited 
		  room in order not to repeat given information. In this way, even if 
		  the user asked to go back to a specific room, the tour guide would not 
		  offer the same dialogue pieces. Pre-conditions were also valuable for 
		  triggering extra-stories whenever the user was interested in more detailed 
		  information.</p>
		<p class="normal">Also, the ability to arrange keyword schemes allowed 
		  the tour guide to make some &#34;intelligent&#34; inferences. For 
		  example, through the schema: [food] = [biscuits, bread, lunch, dinner, 
		  meat, fruits, eat], the following dialogue is possible:</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="Section1"><b><span class="BlockQuote">Visitor:</span></b><span class="BlockQuote"> 
		What would sailors eat for dinner?</span></div>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p><span class="BlockQuote"><b>Guide:</b> We will get detailed information 
		  on the sailor&#39;s food as soon as we get to the storage room!!</span></p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">3.3 Dialogue Creation and Detecting User&#39;s 
		  interest</h2>
		<p class="normal">Planning the dialogue flow for the tour-guide was the 
		  main work of our experiment. We wanted the guide to give information 
		  following the exact flow of a tour and exhibition visit. Moreover, we 
		  wanted the guide to detect user&#39;s interest in an indirect way. We feared 
		  that generic questions such as &#34;Are you interested in this?&#34; Or &#34;Would 
		  you like more information about that?&#34; would not sound natural and would 
		  not differ from a traditional multimedia menu-like environment. </p>
		<p class="normal">The key moment to detect user&#39;s interest was during 
		  the dialogue triggered by the guide&#39;s comments after the user had explored 
		  the room. As we said, according to user&#39;s reactions to the tour guide 
		  comments, the tour guide would provide (or not) extra-stories about 
		  the room. The comments are, thus, supposed to be very instigating and 
		  provocative. Some examples of comments are:</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">&#34;Did you see the rope just beside the toilet basket? 
		  Do you know what it was used for?&#34; (Deck)</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">&#34;Do you like olive oil and vinegar?&#34; (Storage Room)</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">&#34;Can you guess any spice that could be found in Indian 
		  markets?&#34; (Captain Room)</p>
		<p class="normal">During the dialogue triggered by the tour guide comments, 
		  the tour guide checks for some supportive words (such as &#34;nice&#34;, &#34;cool&#34;, 
		  &#34;interesting&#34;, &#34;really?&#34;, &#34;you bet!&#34;, &#34;definitely&#34;, &#34;sure&#34;,…) 
		  according to the dialogue piece. On finding such words, the tour guide 
		  assumes the user is interested and provides more information on the 
		  room.</p>
		<p>The piece of dialogue below illustrates ho<span class="normal">w indirect 
		  the detection of user&#39;s interests is.</span></p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">Guide:§ Did you see the rope just beside the toilet 
		  basket?</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">Visitor: Yes</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">Guide:§ Can you guess what it was used for?</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">Visitor: It seems a brush</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">Guide: Yeah. This rope with a fayed end was used as 
		  toilet paper. It was kept under water and pulled up when someone needed 
		  it!</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">Visitor: Yuck!!! I would never use it!!</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">Guide:§ Yeah, people were not very clean those days 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">In this example, the supportive word was &#34;yuck&#34;(along 
		  with several possible others such as disgusting, terrible, dirty, God, 
		  etc). The guide assumed the user had a good reaction to this story and 
		  will provide further stories.</p>
		<p class="normal">Another way to detect user&#39;s interest was from user&#39;s 
		  questions. Keywords for possible questions and their answers were pre-defined.§ 
		  Each question was related to a specific room. Whenever the user asks 
		  a question, the guide provides the answer and tells extra stories when 
		  the user reaches the room related to the question.</p>
		<h1 class="Header">4. Evaluation &amp; Analysis</h1>
		<p class="normal">We conducted preliminary tests to our experiment with 
		  eleven university students. We used both the tour&#39;s dialogue transcripts 
		  and user evaluation questionnaire data to determine how effective the 
		  tour guide was as a way to convey adaptive guidance and storytelling 
		  to virtual exhibitions. </p>
		<p class="normal">In the evaluation questionnaire, students were asked 
		  to grade the experience with the tour guide using a scale from &#34;very 
		  good&#34; = 4 to &#34;not good&#34; = 1.</p>

		<p class="MsoCaption">Table 2: Evaluation Results</p>
		<p class="normal">As shown in Table 2, in regards to an entertaining experience, 
		  the average value suggests that visitors found the experience of dialoguing 
		  with a virtual tour guide character really enjoyable. (Avg=3.38) Data 
		  shows also that the tour guide was effective in motivating users to 
		  explore and learn more about exhibition topics. (Avg=3.3) Yet, visitors 
		  were slightly less sure about the extent to which the character&#39;s remarks 
		  helped them better understand the exhibition topics. (Avg=3.15)</p>
		<p class="normal">In regards to the quality of dialogue interactions and 
		  the tour guide ability for adaptive guidance, users felt the character 
		  satisfactorily encouraged them to speak and interact with exhibition 
		  material. (Avg=3.05) Yet, regarding the character&#39;s ability to respond 
		  to users&#39; questions, the average achieved a regular level. (2.35) This 
		  data suggests that more work should be done to improve the character 
		  knowledge, that is, more keywords to its database. Users also hardly 
		  recognized the ability of the character in providing further information 
		  when they were interested. (2.15) This data shows that our decisions 
		  for capturing users&#39; interests (based on &#34;supportive words&#34; and questions) 
		  were not perceived as the character natural ability to provide further 
		  information. This could be highly alleviated by language tips such as 
		  &#34;Since you asked about….&#34;, &#34;Since you seem interested in…&#34;. 
		  In our experiment, such introductory remarks were nonexistent. The tour 
		  guide simply provided extra stories when she detected user&#39;s interest. 
		  Also, users easily confused this programmed choice with the tour guide&#39;s 
		  inability to respond certain questions.</p>
		<p class="normal">The last question of the questionnaire was an open question 
		  regarding the presence of the character. The question was: &#34;If you could 
		  choose the same virtual exhibition with or without the tour guide, which 
		  one would you choose?&#34;. All users with no exception chose <i>with</i> 
		  the tour guide. In general, users reaction to the experiment showed 
		  the experience of talking to the tour guide was highly different from 
		  individual multimedia exploration and it played an important role in 
		  motivating them to explore the exhibition material.</p>
		<h1 class="Header">5. Lessons Learned &amp; Future Work</h1>
		<p class="normal">As a result of the evaluation process, some preliminary 
		  (and relatively simple!) corrections were evident and would highly increase 
		  the tour guide performance. We hope they may serve for future developers 
		  of tour guide characters. </p>
		<p class="normal"> <b>More knowledge in her knowledge–database, especially 
		  exhibition-related vocabulary.</b> The experiment shows that the universe 
		  of questions is highly limited to the exhibition information. Though 
		  a hard work, it is less hard than one might think!</p>
		<p class="normal"> <b>Better use of personal introductions.</b> Her personal 
		  introduction and personal questions to users could be used to &#34;break 
		  the ice&#34; and to determine user&#39;s interests.</p>
		<p class="normal"> <b>Tension alleviation when she does not understand questions.</b> 
		  She must provide a way out of the tense cycle created whenever she does 
		  not understand questions. Rather than only ask to rephrase or say she 
		  is sorry, she must offer a different conversational topic.</p>
		<p class="normal"> <b>User&#39;s prompt understanding of an &#34;exhibition-like&#34; 
		  information flow. </b>Users should be told they are about to experience 
		  the context of an exhibition visit and that they will receive information 
		  and are expected to behave accordingly.</p>
		<p class="normal"> <b>Clear names or numbers for exhibition objects.</b> 
		  Users may want to ask about objects and they need clear ways to identify 
		  them.</p>
		<p class="normal">We are now making the corrections listed above and we 
		  plan to conduct further tests that may compare students&#39; interactions 
		  with the virtual exhibition in environments with and without the virtual 
		  tour guide.</p>
		<h1 class="Header">Conclusions</h1>
		<p class="normal">In this research we developed an interactive character 
		  as a virtual guide to an online museum exhibition. Features such as 
		  adaptive guidance, engaging storytelling, stimulation of user&#39;s participation 
		  were attempted while building the character&#39;s knowledge and dialogue 
		  creation process. Though evaluation results show some limitations of 
		  the tour guide as a successful dialogue-builder, we believe this was 
		  highly due to the experiment&#39;s preliminary stages and could be substantially 
		  alleviated with the corrections listed in section 5. Moreover, despite 
		  such limitations, the experiment successfully proved the potential of 
		  conversational interfaces to motivate users to interact with the multimedia 
		  material. We hope lessons learned may serve as a foundation for developers 
		  of interactive characters as virtual tour guides.</p>
