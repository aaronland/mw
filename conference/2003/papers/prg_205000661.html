	  <p class="PaperTitle">Having fun or finding information? Usability for kids 
		sections of Web sites</p>
	  <p class="Author">Céline Arseneault, Montreal Botanical Garden &amp; 
		École Polytechnique de Montréal and Jean-Marc Robert, École 
		Polytechnique de Montréal, Canada</p>
	  <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
	  <p class="AbstractText">Kids aged 6-12 use the Internet more and more as a 
		resource for finding information for school projects. Teachers also include 
		web content in their curriculum. Many museums&#39; Web sites include a kids&#39; 
		section, either as a separate website (such as the J@rdin des jeunes branchés 
		at the Montreal Botanical Garden) or a corner dedicated to fun activities 
		and interactive learning (such as the Canada Science and Technology Museum). 
		In an educational environment, content-enriched Web sites should be designed 
		to be user-centered taking into consideration this young audience. Situated 
		cognition of kids applied to the Web reveals important aspects in the 
		design and evaluation of educational Web sites. Concurrent review of available 
		literature, analysis of ergonomic criteria applied to kids&#39; Web sites 
		and usability studies with children demonstrate the need for a better 
		consensus on the way we develop and evaluate the user-interface of online 
		products for children. An integrated and iterative model is proposed to 
		bring a structured and analytical perspective on kids&#39; Web sites that 
		can be applied to museum Web sites. </p>

		Web sites, heuristic evaluation, usability tests, model, user-centered 
		design, situated learning</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
	  <p class="normal">In January 2003, while preparing for this conference, I 
		read in the newspaper that a school board in the Eastern Townships (about 
		250 km east of Montreal), was about to buy a couple thousand laptops for 
		their students, certainly at a cost of few million dollars. Their reasoning 
		was probably that they wanted to integrate the powerful content of this 
		tool in the curriculum and to develop new expertise for kids as young 
		as 8 years old. This way of thinking assumes that putting a PC in the 
		hands of a child will produce instant magic and that this child, even 
		with the guidance of his teachers, will become &#39; in a click &#39; an expert 
		in using the many interfaces that she or he will face. It&#39;s just a matter 
		of time before she or he will be aware that not everything is perfect 
		in the marvelous world of electronic data. Or is it?</p>
	  <p class="normal">At the same time as they are being exposed to the computer 
		at school, children themselves are eagerly using the Internet, not only 
		for communication and leisure, but also for assistance with homework and 
		school projects. For instance, an Environics Research Group survey done 
		for the Media Awareness Network (Young Canadians In A Wired World) and 
		published in June 2001 shows that the majority of young Quebecers (56%) 
		and Canadians (50%) seem to know more about the Internet than their parents; 
		99% of the children have used the Internet at least once. They are left 
		to themselves when consulting the Web. Almost half of them use it every 
		day. Though the virtual activities conducted by young people are diversified, 
		i. e. music downloading and listening, e-mail and chat, online games, 
		etc. , they are usually associated with leisure, thus being more in the 
		fun department of Web use. This would surprise their parents, who think 
		that kids primarily use the Web for academic purposes. In fact, it is 
		true that academic use is important but less popular than the parents 
		and the teachers would suppose (only 38% in 2000). However, Internet is 
		the winner as the primary resource for schoolwork and projects (82% in 
		Quebec and 71% in Canada), ahead of public libraries (64% in Quebec and 
		60% in Canada) and school libraries (55% in Quebec and 57% in Canada) 
		(Environics Research, 2001). </p>
	  <p class="normal">In 1999, Internet was already widely used in Canadian schools 
		(up to 88% of the students in primary schools and 97% in secondary schools). 
		However, learning the use of the computer is not generally seen as a separate 
		subject, such as math or history. It is often seen as a part of the general 
		educational domain in which efficient learning takes place in a contextual 
		environment.computer literacy, particularly applied to Web technologies, 
		seems to be missing as a specific subject, even though teachers have asserted 
		that &#34;the computerized tool, in its conceptual form, can become a 
		powerful pedagogical lever at a meta-cognitive level&#34; (Lemieux, 2000), 
		i. e. in the search, retrieval and organization of information. </p>
	  <p class="normal">As webmasters and/or museum professionals, we cannot ignore 
		the propensity of our educational specialists to integrate diverse skills, 
		or as it is called in Quebec, develop &#39;transverse competencies&#39;, for example, 
		incorporating math into literature, geography into math, or computer skills 
		into natural sciences. So much of the information on our Web sites will 
		eventually be found and used by children, that a study about how kids 
		react to information on the Web would be useful for further development 
		of Web projects. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Web masters have to be humble when thinking of their popularity 
		among young virtual visitors, and the assessing satisfaction of children 
		using their Web sites, because this use is often associated with assigned 
		schoolwork. Nonetheless, content-enriched Web sites should be designed 
		to be user-centered, taking into consideration this young audience (and 
		their teachers and parents). </p>
	  <p class="normal">Sites expressly designed for a youthful clientele can be 
		classified according to various criteria. The first is the anticipated 
		use - purely playful (one is amused), informative (one looks things up 
		without the goal of learning anything), search (surfing the Web), play-educational 
		(one is amused while playing or what Demner (2001) calls &#39;edutainment&#39;) 
		and finally educational (learning-oriented). To these must be added or 
		included sites extolling parallel activities that are related to the Internet&#39;s 
		potential: chatting, editing, communicating, etc. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Certain sites unfold on more than one level and thus command 
		a larger audience. Some sites that are not specifically designed for youth 
		find that a large proportion of their traffic is composed of young people, 
		either because of the type of activities they offer (music, search engine) 
		or because of their content. Museum sites often fall under this category. 
		But should they try harder to specifically target a young clientele? If 
		yes, how should they do it?</p>
	  <p class="normal">Many publications and the many papers presented at this 
		conference suggest that the search for guidelines for a better design 
		and use of Web sites designed for kids is happening at the right moment, 
		because the next boom will be the complete integration of the new technologies 
		in the school curriculum. Our cognitive ergonomic approach is designed 
		to help us to draw some perspectives for evaluation and use of educational 
		Web sites in science (though it is likely to be of value for other subjects 
		as well). In particular, we have established that usability tests conducted 
		with children with both real and plausible contextual problems relative 
		to their level of learning and interests at school, could offer the necessary 
		situated learning perspective to enable additional analysis. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Web usability evaluation methods</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Our goal was to review current multidisciplinary literature 
		(available in the spring of 2002) that discussed the development, use 
		and analysis of Web sites dedicated to children aged 6-12. Choosing 53 
		Web sites from a potential list of few hundred, we proceeded with a heuristic 
		evaluation. We selected 30 of them for their content in context. Usability 
		testing followed in a cognitive learning situation with pre-determined 
		scenarios, both fun and educational. Eight children, 3<sup>rd</sup> to 
		6<sup>th</sup> graders, from a private elementary school in Montreal, 
		Quebec, Canada, were subjected to an hour-long session, including a questionnaire 
		and videotaping. Questionnaires were also sent to parents, prior to the 
		tests, asking for permission to film and requesting information about 
		their children&#39;s knowledge and use of the Internet at home. At school, 
		these children had access to computers and the Internet in their classes, 
		without formal training. Only one child did not choose Internet as his 
		primary source of information for school projects. Analysis from both 
		of these methods helped us to extrapolate recommendations for science-related 
		educational Web sites. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Situated learning of children</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Jean Piaget took his inspiration from cognitive sciences 
		as the comprehensive science for describing children&#39;s developmental stages(Inhelder 
		&amp; Piaget, 1970). In cognitive ergonomics, the mental structures and 
		thought of children are represented as a system and an information process. 
		Piaget and other cognitive developmental scientists have seen children 
		as active agents who construct their own understanding of the world (Fischer 
		and Lazerson, 1984). The applicability of this concept to the educational 
		use of computers in learning depends on intelligent didactic programs 
		able to interact with the children in the most natural and constructivist 
		way. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Constructivist learning theory allow us to divide children 
		according to their ages and the stage at which the sense of the concrete 
		is associated and applied. The 7 to 11 year old group coincides with the 
		concrete operational stage (elementary and early adolescence). In this 
		stage, intelligence is demonstrated through logical and systematic manipulation 
		of symbols related to concrete objects. Operational thinking develops 
		(mental actions that are reversible). Egocentric thought diminishes. Applied 
		to computer usage behavior, this translates into:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Aptitude to surf the content (browsing). (Does this show the lack 
		  of literacy to actively search the information or is it a sign of a 
		  budding intellectual curiosity?) 
		</li><li>Aptitude to work in teams in front of a screen (which will be useful 
		  when conducting the tests) 
		</li><li>Easy learning of metaphors and semantic concepts</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="normal">Recent research on contextual learning seems to demonstrate 
		that even very young children at the concrete operational stage (8 years 
		old) are able to develop sophisticated strategies as a means to react 
		to complex situations. Reasoning and decision-making strategies are, at 
		this age, anchored deeply to the specific usage context and cannot be 
		judged solely on the basis of Piagetian learning (Blaye et al, 1999). 
		Therefore, children demonstrate an elevated cognitive adaptability according 
		to the task that is to be accomplished, an interpretation of situations 
		and, more precisely, an analysis of the answer according to the pertinence 
		of the elements appropriate to each of these situations. This may lead 
		one to a different interpretation of the results when doing an ergonomic 
		analysis. This approach based on situational cognition would tend to justify 
		our procedural method when it comes to usability tests that are tailored 
		for children&#39;s educational sites. Therefore, in order to better perceive 
		their reactions with regards to virtual interfaces, we have contextualized 
		this learning process by developing scenarios of real research, which 
		are applicable to the educational milieu for children of different primary 
		levels. We have nevertheless decided that it was important to choose questions 
		with a degree of abstraction in line with Piagetian theory and the pedagogical 
		objectives of the school. For instance, dinosaurs for 3<sup>rd</sup> graders 
		and the solar system for 6<sup>th</sup> graders. </p>
	  <p class="normal">More than an intellectual working tool, a computer is a 
		cognitive mirror: it encourages students to reflect on their cognitive 
		functioning and verbalize strategies, and thereby to better comprehend 
		the process of learning and to objectify the process. A computer both 
		reveals the competency and the knowledge of the student, and the mechanisms 
		by which they acquired this knowledge and attitudes (Bibeau, 1997). </p>
	  <p class="normal">In a separate study, Robert (2002) tested children and teenagers 
		on some of the sites selected in a group-setting environment. For the 
		purpose of situated-learning scenarios, we therefore grouped students 
		into teams of two so as to encourage an exchange of information. This 
		falls under the &#34;interactionist&#34; movement, which prioritizes 
		the human and social dimension during the learning process. The idea is 
		that one always learns something for and with someone (Kiledjian, 2001). 
		One must also take into account the role played by interactions between 
		students. Learning activity is thus social and affective before being 
		logical and functional. Many researchers in the educational sciences take 
		this dimension into account in assessing the place of educational technologies 
		in the learning process. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The absence of methodology specific to the utilization of 
		the Internet for researching information coupled with the multiplicity 
		of available information and the anarchy of design of educational sites 
		imposes a renewed cognitive effort by children when they want to use the 
		Internet for school work and even more effort once they finally get to 
		that site. We therefore put the selected sites into bookmarks, in order 
		for the kids to choose them from a restricted list. </p>
	  <p class="normal">When educational sites are employed in a school context, 
		it appears that one must also take into account cognitive styles. The 
		cognitive style defines the organizational and representational approach 
		of the information that the individual prefers when placed in a learning 
		situation. Chen and Macredie (2002) tried to better define the perception 
		and effect of hypermedia systems according to different styles of students. 
		Two particular types of cognitive styles were distinguished when they 
		were adapted to hypermedia, namely &#34;field-independent individuals&#34; 
		and &#34;field-dependent individuals&#34;. When learning through hypermedia, 
		the learner possesses control of the route already proposed by the navigation 
		system. For that matter, most Web sites offer their visitors multiple 
		navigational tools and exploit different approaches that are inherent 
		to cognitive styles. Field-independent individuals have a tendency to 
		favor the search options, to increase the opportunities for discovery 
		through the proposed links and to organize a certain informational structure 
		throughout their virtual course. Field-dependent individuals, however, 
		prefer a more linear navigational route or they prefer to use already 
		existing tools for presenting structured information (site plans, glossaries, 
		etc. ) These individuals are dependent on these tools without which they 
		would easily become confused and could learn less well, they could become 
		discouraged at not having found what they were looking for and have a 
		tendency to abandon their search. It is difficult in designing usability 
		tests, to define cognitive styles in advance so as to have a representative 
		sampling of these two cognitive styles. However, these styles will reveal 
		themselves during testing sessions and they will balance themselves out 
		somehow. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The child&#39;s mental model of the Internet is also important 
		to this study. Some authors have reported on the &#34;broken Internet&#34; 
		image that children may develop when a problem arises, either during connecting, 
		downloading plugins or following a broken link (Lewis, 2001). On the other 
		hand, it would appear that children are also influenced by the results 
		of their actions, which may lead to efficiency and a satisfactory solution. 
		For both these reasons, schools use of portals or search tools as a preliminary 
		to the retrieval for the information necessary for a schoolwork is a limiting 
		factor. Bilal (200, 2001) has explored the cognitive and physical reactions 
		of young adolescents (approx. 13 years old) when using Yahooligans!, a 
		portal which is enormously popular among young Americans and English Canadians. 
		During these studies, he noted the efficacy, effort and efficiency of 
		the hypermedia movements versus search strategies and he then arranged 
		these criteria in a numerical order. He deduced that these youth demonstrated 
		much more difficulty with research tasks than with tasks based on facts. 
		This study is particularly interesting even for content-rich sites that 
		offer a search option for retrieving information from the site itself. 
	  </p>
	  <p class="normal">With a portal like Yahooligans!, the overwhelming size of 
		the result set also gives us a glimpse of the constraints influencing 
		which one to choose. Just as for adults, the children decide to make do 
		with a satisfactory solution (‘satisfacingü) which flows from a bounded 
		rationality and not from an optimal solution. Agosto (2002) revived Simon&#39;s 
		postulate that an individual will make a decision with temporal and cognitive 
		limitations that will hinder him from evaluating all of the possibilities 
		involved in decision making. When applied to the Web and experimented 
		on children, this behavioral theory has permitted us to identify time 
		constraints, information overload and physical discomfort that play major 
		roles in attaining a satisfactory solution. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Closely related to the satisfactory solution, the problem 
		of the pertinence, quality and authority of the information is relevant 
		to cognitive studies of Web youth. Lorenzen (2001) in his study of high 
		school students has underlined the weak judgment that young people seem 
		to have regarding the quality of information. He reports that in the absence 
		of supervision or of filters, most youth did a poor job of evaluating 
		the contents of the websites they visited. It is possible that the problem 
		resulted from their lack of tools to evaluate the information or because 
		they are using deficient evaluation criteria. This lack of critical judgment 
		with regards to the validity of the recovered information make the Web 
		both a best friend or a worst enemy of educational research projects for 
		a clientele which is younger and less advanced in critical thinking according 
		to Perry. For example, while older students might judge the quality of 
		the spelling to evaluate a site, it is almost a sure bet that this will 
		not be noted by young grade school students. During the tests of usability 
		it is crucial to attempt to evaluate the validity of information. The 
		Media Awareness Network of which we have already spoken has concluded 
		that their priority should be the development of critical thinking with 
		regards to the new media (Thibault, 2002). </p>
	  <p class="normal">Among the other cognitive elements which fall under the 
		category of subjectivity, curiosity among children 6-12 years old is a 
		non-negligible factor because it depends on capturing their interest and 
		awakening their sense of discovery (Dumas and Brooks, 2001). It&#39;s already 
		been stated that children are naturally curious. A tour of educational 
		sites which answer children&#39;s questions (Ask Dr. Universe, Le J@rdin des 
		jeunes branchés, Les Débrouillards) leads us to understand 
		the sort of questions that they can ask, as much of their parents as of 
		their educators, as well as the degree of complexity of these questions 
		and the juxtaposition of elements often totally disassembled that they 
		present. A site that doesn&#39;t interest young people, in spite of having 
		a potentially captivating interface, is not fulfilling its objectives. 
		In addition, children are very aware of new trends, be it subject treatment 
		(for example, the phenomenon of &#34;grossology&#34;, or &#34;grossing 
		one out&#34; that is, whatever&#39;s really repugnant but attracts children&#39;s 
		curiosity) or by multimedia presentations (&#34;in&#34; colors, graphic 
		styles, music, etc. ). </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Designing the Net for children</h1>
	  <p class="normal">If we consider that an analysis of children&#39;s Web sites 
		falls under the field of multidisciplinarity, it is even more so when 
		conceiving technological interfaces that will be attractive to the young. 
		Some authors, such as Allison Druin, even advocate developing new products 
		for children in cooperation with children (Druin, 2002). Such a design 
		approach could extend from a simple test of usability to full technological 
		immersion in which children participate fully in creating an interface 
		that interests and stimulates them. Learning is centered on the design, 
		the results of which Druin calls the process of cooperative enquiry, which 
		is the most participative format of the largest number of adults, and 
		children who create interfaces. Web designers are offered copious advice 
		when designing sites for children. CNETbuilder.com stresses such diverse 
		aspects as privacy policy and tests for children (Wimpsett, 1998). Never 
		being condescending and treating children with respect is certainly a 
		premise when designing a new Web application. Other aspects of user-centered 
		design may appear when dealing with content-enriched Web sites, especially 
		if educational goals are to be attained. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Ergonomics of the &#34;Youth Web&#34; </h2>
	  <p class="normal">Web ergonomics<b> </b>or web usability aims to create an 
		interface that is effective for content delivery and efficient for use 
		by its targeted clientele. The Museums and the Web Conferences have demonstrated 
		that content-enriched Web sites are an important key to success. Our own 
		experience at the Montreal Botanical Garden has shown that diversified 
		and rich content will help attract virtual visitors and will also contribute 
		to a repeated experience, which contributes towards building a virtual 
		community (Arseneault, 2002). Shneiderman (1997) states that enriched-content 
		Web sites are more dependent on their developers&#39; experience, but that 
		this experience, however valid, is not enough to use as guidelines. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Any web application is only as good as its usability (Helinki, 
		1997). Nogier (2002a) defines usability as an associated concept to the 
		fact that a tool like Internet is more or less usable. Usability is therefore 
		an important factor in a successful and quality website. Web ergonomics 
		in a young people&#39;s website is more crucial because of the combined effect 
		of the learning process and fun components associated with its use. Whatever 
		the audience is or the clientele targeted by a website, a set of ergonomic 
		principles (or usability guidelines) can be applied. Our task was defining 
		if the criteria used in most heuristic evaluations would be the same for 
		children&#39;s Web sites. </p>
	  <p class="normal">System acceptability is inclusive of the process in which 
		usability is part. Information architecture, homepage, pages&#39; graphic 
		presentation, and navigation are some of the elements of the website system 
		and effective observation of how these elements are used can bring valid 
		keys to its improvement. Other user-oriented design takes into account 
		the efficiency and accessibility of the website. </p>
	  <p class="normal">For this study we have integrated two methods of ergonomic 
		evaluation: expert or heuristic evaluation and usability testing. A cognitive 
		walk-through was helpful in the preliminary selection of the Web sites. 
		More than half of the Web sites selected were from museums or governmental 
		agencies. </p>
	  <p class="normal">How can &#34;traditional&#34; usability principles be 
		adapted to children&#39;s Web sites? Nogier (2002a) has established a set 
		of eleven easy-to-ask questions when trying to diagnose major problems 
		on a website, with regards to aspects such as conversational level, user 
		language level, and memory charge. </p>
	  <p class="normal">These questions are very pertinent for kids&#39; Web sites, 
		even if they become intuitive for cognitive ergonomic specialists. </p>
	  <p class="normal">After testing 24 commercial Web sites for children (<i>Yahooligans!</i>, 
		<i>SesameStreet.com</i> and <i>ABC News for Kids</i>), Nielsen has adapted 
		its guidelines on children&#39;s Web sites (Nielsen Norman Group, 2002). Particularly 
		appealing is the comment that website developers usually have a folkloric 
		notion of how kids behave on the Web (Nielsen, J. 2002). Kids adore interactivity, 
		but they easily get discouraged and quickly move on. The most important 
		result from the Nielsen series of tests is probably the confusion existing 
		between content and promotional banners, ads, etc. Marketers know that. 
		They exploit more and more thematic Web sites tailor-designed to the young 
		consumer (Rioux, 2002). </p>
	  <p class="normal">Ergonomic evaluation targets the goals to emphasize positive 
		elements and detect and explain elements to be corrected or improved in 
		the website (Robert, 2002). Usability testing is then a component of the 
		global process and a very good follow-up of a heuristic evaluation. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Robert (2002) in a study for the Biosphere, a Montreal-based 
		environmental museum, has presented a comparative analysis of criteria 
		as developed by Bastien and Scapin (1993), Ravden and Johnson (1989) and 
		Robert (1990). The latter divides functionality appropriate to the task, 
		distinguishing the interface quality (compatibility, transparency, cohesion, 
		explicit control, rapidity of action and flexibility) from key functionality 
		of the interaction (information return, navigation, help, error management). 
		This intuitive approach is very useful in the evaluation of the interface. 
		However, for educational Web sites, one also has to take account of content 
		comprehension and architecture. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The International Standard ISO 9241-10 has not proven to 
		be sufficient for the scope of the present work. Unfortunately, evaluation 
		systems for museum Web sites are more oriented towards the pragmatic aspects 
		and collection value of the museum, and less towards the use of the virtual 
		museum by a young clientele, even if these systems are prone to allow 
		greater priority to the user. Guidelines developed by experts for educational 
		Web sites (such as Al-Nuaim, 2000) take into account a more conventional 
		notion of &#39;education&#39; and were not found to be adaptable for this study. 
	  </p>
	  <p class="normal">Generally speaking, I was surprised by the quality and variety 
		of visited Web sites. Most were quite well-structured and graphically 
		interesting, if not remarkable. Navigation is usually efficient, although 
		they are often found to lack more than one option (sitemap, search engine, 
		pop-ups for enlarging images, etc. ). </p>
	  <p class="normal">Without any advance warning, many Web sites only performed 
		when using Internet Explorer (IE) or Netscape Communicator. Still, about 
		10% of website visitors use Netscape Communicator (Ville de Montréal, 
		2002). </p>
	  <p class="normal">Among conducting methods for usability tests, few recommendations 
		are oriented towards children. Usability tests for children do resemble 
		adult ones, but some aspects are more specific to them (Bowman, 2002). 
	  </p>
	  <p class="normal">We followed Larkin&#39;s recommendations (2002) concerning testing 
		children. I do emphasize having the cooperation of school, parents and 
		students, and choosing an environment and preparing scenarios adapted 
		to the children. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Druin (1996) reminds us that children are quite honest. 
		They are quick to respond, to show their likes and dislikes. As users, 
		children see things that are not evident to experts and this can provide 
		a better website evaluation (Robert, 2002). </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Results and recommendations</h1>
	  <p class="normal">Among the results from these tests, the most significant 
		elements that were noted was the wide variability and richness of responses 
		and gathered observations. If these results are calibrated with the results 
		of similar studies, this leads us on interesting paths of extrapolation. 
		In their turn, these paths can generate preliminary recommendations which 
		are useful to creators of children&#39;s sites or those who evaluate them. 
		A subsequent study having a larger sampling would permit an even larger 
		range of recommendations. I will also illustrate how some of these recommendations 
		may have practical applications on a site such as the J@ardin des jeunes 
		branchés&#39; and can dramatically improve a website, even if they 
		involve detailed aspects of the interface design. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Downloading</h2>
	  <p class="normal">When arriving at a website, children take a moment to size 
		up the cognitive environment of the graphics and navigation. They seem 
		to enjoy the novelty of every website. If the website is in the continuity 
		of an alternative media, e. g. a TV program or a magazine, they expect 
		graphic continuity. </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Avoid homepages too long to download. There are still young people 
		  out there who use the Internet with a low-speed connection, They will 
		  be more patient if they can have hints about the value of the upcoming 
		  content.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Navigation, links, frames, icons and information 
		retrieval</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Children know how to follow hyperlink, either by icons, 
		menus or text listings, even if it is not underlined, because they validate 
		links with the cursor appearance. In a complex set of frames and text, 
		underlined links are easier to distinguish and follow. Children understand 
		the value of pop-up windows. </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Eliminate any risk of confusion between the internal navigation of 
		  a site or module and the window banner (frame) normally found on institutional 
		  or governmental sites. 
		</li><li>Avoid too many frames which create visual confusion. </li>
		<li>Avoid tables with complex listings and long lists of badly organized 
		  links which are too cognitively &#34;heavy&#34; for the very young 
		  (under ten years old). </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="normal">Metaphoric use of icons is often confused. Children quickly 
		confuse non-link graphics similar to buttons. They also bring back the 
		semantics developed by the site to their own level of reality. It translates 
		into a mix-up of concepts because of the confusion of language. In French, 
		for instance, a ‘ recherche ü icon (search option) is confused 
		for ‘ recherche scolaire ü, which means schoolwork. Children 
		understand the value of standards, but what if there is a mix-up in their 
		own understanding? </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Use conventional standards and wordings and test their use on your 
		  targeted clientele. </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="normal">A surprising result was the preference of the back button 
		in the navigator over the use of the menu when going back to the homepage. 
		This denotes that they have not fully comprehended the navigation system. 
		When section of a museum website is dedicated to a young clientele, children 
		may be quite confused by the environment related to the rest of the website, 
		especially with direct linking to other parts of the website. </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Have the most linear navigation possible (horizontal or vertical). 
		  A second navigation level could be oriented towards older or more experienced 
		  children and regroup all utilitarian buttons (search, map, mail)</li>
		<li>Always warn children about the existence of a link to an outside site, 
		  even more of the external site&#39;s language is different. </li>
		<li>Use a set of arrows at the bottom of the pages which follow one after 
		  the other. An icon to the top of the page is also useful for any page 
		  which is longer than the screen&#39;s page. </li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Cognitive styles</h2>
	  <p class="normal">As expected, both cognitive styles were represented. Badly 
		chosen wording or spelling for some items confused field-independent children 
		even more. For instance, a glossary identified by a question mark leads 
		a child to select this as a search option. When required to search on 
		a website, children mixed up search from the navigator, search on the 
		current page and search engine from the site itself. Satisfying solutions 
		were largely chosen over the real potential of a website. </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Simultaneously develop a search option and a website map (alphabetical 
		  and or organizational) that brings together both cognitive styles described 
		  by the virtual visitors. Make sure these tools are well positioned and 
		  neglect any analogies or metaphors that could be sources of confusion.</li>
		<li>Use to the maximum the potential of hypertext connections to define 
		  certain words or concepts, for example pop-up windows instead of a glossary 
		  icon, which certain young people confuse with site maps or search option. 
		  Be clear about what images could be enlarged. </li>
		<li>Favor the search for individual pages on sites by their addresses 
		  and individual set of metadata in order to use the potential of search 
		  engines.</li>
		<li>Encourage schools to integrate into the curriculum an adaptive and 
		  progressive program of Internet training. Mention to school authorities 
		  the need for a better Internet mental model, a structured vocabulary 
		  and tools of Internet sites as well as navigators. </li>
		<li>Sensitize parents to the moral authority of content (and reflect this 
		  in your chosen links on your website). </li>
		<li>Sensitize parents, youth and educators to the potential of search 
		  tools and index lists of recommended sites and create such lists on 
		  your Web sites. </li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">School project content-enriched website</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Navigational tools disseminated over the screen often lead 
		children to become confused. The most significant cognitive effort is 
		to select the option that would bring results. The magazine approach, 
		visually heavy, where text is prominent and information is spread out 
		on the page may add to the difficulty to rapidly seize up the path to 
		follow. </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Do not have overly long Web pages. </li>
		<li>Distribute the content along with photos and illustrations over several 
		  pages. Favor small photos which have an enlargement option.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Plugins or scripts</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Children understand the need for plugins but are somewhat 
		hesitant to download them if they do not have the adult&#39;s approval. </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Exercise great caution when using plugins or integrating scripts. 
		  Error messages in certain navigators or platforms, non installation 
		  capabilities of the visitor&#39;s system, poor direction when installing 
		  the plugins can be negative elements to an educational use by young 
		  people whose mental model of the Internet is too incomplete or erroneous.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Colors, graphics, fonts</h2>
	  <p class="normal">All children like colorful, playful graphics. Girls demonstrate 
		a preference for funny or lovable characters. Children see the potential 
		of images which can be included in schoolwork. They try to enlarge them, 
		but are lost when the enlarged image substitutes itself over the page, 
		when the only plausible option then is to use the back button. They appreciate 
		good readability, as expected without serif, and show their disapproval 
		of a small font.comic-style fonts are their favorite (as shown by Bernard, 
		2001). </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Having fun: finding games and playing</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Kids love to have fun. As soon as games are advertised, 
		children select this option over the task to be accomplished. They are 
		eager to play, the more interactive the better, but are disappointed if 
		the game does not prove itself as much fun as it should have been, or 
		too young or difficult for their age level. Their approach is intuitive, 
		not wanting to read rules, although girls are more patient than boys (as 
		shown by Nielsen, 2002). Long non-categorized listing of games were not 
		interesting. All of the tested children were not necessarily familiar 
		with Flash. Rules could have been useful if they had been shown during 
		playing, not just before. </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Exploit to the maximum the educational potential of games, especially 
		  if they are interactive, whether for personal or class use. </li>
		<li>List games indicating their interactivity and their levels of difficulty. 
		</li>
		<li>Don&#39;t use games if the information is for students &#34;to read&#34; 
		  and use for school projects. </li>
		<li>Have concise instructions to which one can accede at different levels 
		  or stages of the game. </li>
		<li>Emphasize important information in larger or thicker fonts. </li>
		<li>Affix a pop-up which can optionally stay open. </li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Forms and passwords</h2>
	  <p class="normal">One visited website needed signing-up. It was a challenge 
		by itself! Children were discouraged and wanted to quit, not knowing how 
		greatly effective the website was. Surveys were sometimes misunderstood 
		as signing-up. </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Have an option for accessing a game without having to use a password 
		  for a first visit so that the site&#39;s potential can be better explored.</li>
		<li>If the information is not commercially dependent or private information 
		  sensitive, publish the user&#39;s name and the password as soon as it is 
		  validated. </li>
		<li>Offer the option of receiving the user&#39;s name and password by e-mail, 
		  without any obligation on the youth&#39;s part. Be sure you respect private 
		  information access rules and laws. Make your privacy policy available 
		  at a child&#39;s level of comprehension. </li>
		<li>Arrange it so that any inscription in a window can be validated by 
		  the enter key. </li>
		<li>Do not make a distinction for font caps in the registration window 
		  without advising the user. </li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Asking questions and receiving a response: Customer 
		service - E-mail</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Even if most of the visited Web sites had e-mail addresses 
		and/or forms, few of them had the option to ask questions. Some are specialized 
		in this type of interaction. When finding this option, children commented 
		they would use it or the offered content to previous questions, because 
		they felt it really corresponded to their needs. An informal test conducted 
		by sending an e-mail to the tested Web sites proved itself ineffective: 
		only one responded quickly and in time with the advertised policy (not 
		counting the author&#39;s J@rdin des jeunes branchés ). </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Add on an option for communicating by e-mail, preferably with a form 
		  (ease-of-use on a school or public library computer) for sending questions, 
		  comments, etc. Indicate clearly on the form&#39;s page, the type of question 
		  that will merit a reply and the time lapse one should expect between 
		  the question and the reply. </li>
		<li>List your privacy policy. </li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Sound and music</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Children did not find sound and music necessary in content-enriched 
		Web sites. Their logic is somewhat disconcerting, one girl stating it 
		could be nice to hear an interviewed scientist speaking instead of reading 
		his words. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Animations</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Attractive Flash animation on homepage but not exploited 
		elsewhere is disappointing. Children find animation overstated and not 
		useful when used elsewhere than games. Some Web sites required plugins 
		when requesting their homepage. Animated gifs were liked, in good dosage. 
		Continual flashing disturbed them. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Information quality</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Most of the children were not really interested in the authorship 
		of the content and the website&#39;s developer, even if a good website title 
		was attractive. It only became important when printing the information 
		and/or including it in schoolwork. Logos, flags and institutional names 
		are obliterated from their virtual experience&#39;s memory. If the visit is 
		in the scope of a museum visit, for instance, or if the site seems to 
		offer a rich content that they will eventually use for other purposes, 
		their interest is higher. All of the children were enthusiastic about 
		discovering more about all of the selected Web sites, even if they were 
		inefficient, leading them to become discouraged if they could not find 
		the information. </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Don&#39;t overdo the presence of logos identifying the sites owners (governments, 
		  institutions, etc. ), particularly those that refer to external sites: 
		  it&#39;s not by overdoing them that a child will remember the content&#39;s 
		  author. These logos seem to become anonymous to young people and, even 
		  more, weigh down the graphic and textual spaces and their memory impact. 
		</li>
		<li>Settle for good and descriptive title pages, including navigational 
		  titles with institutional name on the programming and on ease-of-use 
		  for those who wish refer to sites by bookmarks or by bibliographic data. 
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Publicity</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Exposure to publicity varies in its effectiveness. Most 
		tested children ignored it, having been exposed to a greater extent on 
		commercial sites. Many seem to appreciate it and can interpret it as content. 
		Promotional ads integrated in the content and the navigation let them 
		think they have control over it. </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Eliminate ads including any subjective publicity in any children&#39;s 
		  educational sites, even if these sites are private or commercial. Rather, 
		  make the information market accessible by an icon included somewhere 
		  in the navigation (possibly in the &#34;useful&#34; icons) when signing 
		  up, advertising or buying is desirable (subscribing, coming-up activities, 
		  etc. )</li>
		<li>Don&#39;t have pop-ups for publicity which one can&#39;t get rid of or that 
		  keep coming back every time a page is opened. </li>
	  </ul>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Integrated and iterative model for an educational 
		website</h1>
	  <p class="normal">We are tentatively providing an iterative and complementary 
		system model that reveals an integrated methodology of ergonomic processes 
		for the evaluation of educational Web sites. This model also offers an 
		acknowledgement of alternative data gathering methods such as Web statistics 
		or virtual visitors&#39; comments. </p>

	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusion</h1>
	  <p class="normal">This project has permitted us to validate and clear up some 
		ergonomic criteria that are useful to the youth Web. Some of these criteria 
		are important for any type of clientele, but their importance is clarified 
		by usability testing oriented to children. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The recommendations arising from this study open the door 
		to a non-uniform design of youth Web sites, because their clientele seem 
		to appreciate such factors as novelty and creation even in a purely educational 
		context. They target the integration of tools which are pertinent to the 
		full exploitation of content (site map, search option, glossary, menus, 
		etc. ) as well as the orientation of interfaces of which certain elements 
		could exceed the ergonomic framework and greatly hinder the efficiency 
		of an educational use. Government, media, and museums, outside of the 
		educational and conventional milieu could develop an expertise in rendering 
		their information more accessible to young people who are actively seeking 
		it through online activities and content offered through an effective 
		interface. </p>
