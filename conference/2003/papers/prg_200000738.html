	  <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
	  <p class="AbstractText">This paper began as an attempt to clarify and classify 
		the development of Web3D environments from 1995 to the present. In that 
		process, important facts came to light. A large proportion of these sites 
		were virtual galleries and museums. Second, these same environments covered 
		a wide array of architectural interpretations and represented some of 
		the most cutting-edge work in the medium. It became clear that there is 
		a relationship between galleries and virtual environments. At a fundamental 
		level, both are information spaces. A primary difference is that the Web3D 
		environments are bound to the computer and currently limited by mouse 
		and screen. Factoring this in, we merge the GUI and the Gallery to create 
		a native foundation for the development of virtual space. This paper discusses 
		the relationship of GUI and gallery, and the impact of mouse and screen, 
		and then showcases the exploration of several on-line virtual museums 
		and galleries.</p>

	  <h1 class="SubHeader">A. Foundation</h1>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Introduction</h2>
	  <p class="normal"><span>The digital landscape is littered with failed virtual 
		environments. Questions of their native design remain unresolved. Examining 
		an architectural genre, one similar in functionality to virtual space, 
		would lay the foundation for a deeper understanding of the nature of medium. 
		The question then is &#34;What type of physical space best represents the 
		native form and function found in virtual environments?&#34; In terms of flexibility 
		of design and overall function, one choice clearly stands out — the 
		modern museum. Unlike other spaces like restaurants, bathrooms or garages, 
		the purpose of a museum is not a physical one. It is an educational, often 
		experiential, even spiritual one. With a degree of spatial freedom found 
		nowhere else, museums structure space and house the widest possible array 
		of objects and information.<br/>
		<br/>
		It is this array of objects, and the ability to access them, that brings 
		us to a second similar design genre —that of the graphical user interface 
		(GUI). GUIs are typically two-dimensional in nature and are usually designed 
		to suit the affordances of mouse and screen. Moving the GUI into three 
		dimensions and making it immersive is the functional imperative of virtual 
		environments. Here again the construct of the museum emerges. A comment 
		by William Rubin, former Director of MOMA, sets the stage: &#34;Museums 
		are essentially compromises ... Their weakness is that they are necessarily 
		homogenized - emptied of all connotations other than art, and that 
		is an artificial situation.&#34; To the author, this implies the same processes 
		and the same &#34;necessities&#34; that drive interface design. The 
		museum is the original virtual interface. The outcome of these statements 
		is the belief that the future of virtual design is a merger of GUI and 
		gallery.</span></p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Historical Structures and Philosophic Overview</h2>
	  <p class="normal"><span>This function of displaying objects and information 
		is the key connection in the historical development and definition of 
		the museum. From the early groupings of precious objects in ancient tombs, 
		temples and churches (Schatzkammen) and the collections of art that hung 
		in the galleries of English country homes and French Castles, to the Italian 
		studiolo, the German Wunderkammer and Kunstkammer, there is an order purposely 
		imposed on the objects and space. It is a space designed to support information, 
		in access and understanding. </span></p>
	  <p class="normal">In the abstract, a virtual environment can be interpreted 
		as a pure information space. Within it, the functional imperatives of 
		the GUI merge with the appearance of physical space. Like a GUI, information 
		is divided, categorized, placed within a narrative framework, and then 
		presented to the user. The user is then given paths to follow to access 
		the information. This mirrors real world galleries. Space itself facilitates 
		the access of art. At their best, museums and galleries are flexible spaces 
		that uplift, amuse, educate, classify and present information with a degree 
		of spatial freedom found in no other structures. In this sense, the purpose 
		of the gallery is the same as the GUI. For the designer, art = information 
		in its widest array of configurations.</p>
	  <p class="normal">This is somewhat different from the earlier connection made 
		between virtual environments and museums. &#34;Museums are ideal candidates 
		for hybrid cyberspaces&#34; (1990 Kellogg, Carroll, Richards), and their proposed 
		&#34;Natural History Cyberspace Museum&#34; is a fully immersive installation 
		complete with goggles and gloves. Through it, visitors can pretend to 
		be dinosaurs such an Archaeopteryx. While this application of virtual 
		space is clearly valuable and could be very useful to educate the public, 
		it does little to express the affordances of virtual space. Rather than 
		apply virtual space to the museum, we apply the museum to virtual space. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Secondly, and perhaps controversially, we equate Web3D environments with 
		virtual environments. We do this not as Ken Hillis does in &#34;<i>Digital 
		Sensations</i>&#34;, completely removing technology on philosophical grounds. 
		Instead, we see the future as undefined. Therefore, the legacy of currently 
		widely available technologies is liable to hold a greater sway over this 
		future than imaginary plot-devices such as the holodeck. Within current 
		Web-based environments in mind, we accept the limitations of mouse and 
		screen. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Interpretations</h2>
	  <p class="normal" style="margin-left:0in">A diverse series of interpretations 
		of 3D space have been produced. Most attempt to copy real world spaces 
		exactly. In them, we see faux track lighting, cushioned benches and display 
		cases. Real approaches often go back in time, like the &#34;<i>Natural History 
		Cyberspace Museum</i>.&#34; Opposing them are those whose work represents 
		a rebellion against the limitations of real world architecture. The &#34;<i>Virtual 
		Guggenheim</i>&#34; by Asymtote is such a space. The structure was envisioned 
		to morph between three different forms, while all the while rooms flow 
		like blood vessels through it. Still others, like the early works of Stan 
		George and Daniel Wise, resemble abstract data spaces envisioned by sci-fi 
		authors. Often visually stunning, none of these approaches has yielded 
		the results predicted by their creators. Each suffers from the imposition 
		of philosophies that do not take into account the affordances of this 
		new media. <br/>
		<br/>
		Hillis <span>(1999) </span>points to &#34;t<span>he promise and hype of VR 
		and ITs more generally is part of an ideology of the future, produced 
		in an amnesia and loss of history that forgets the broken promises of 
		past technologies such as the &#39;universal educator&#39; [TV] and &#39;too cheap 
		to meter&#39; [nuclear power]. </span>Whereas Hillis dismisses the virtual 
		entirely, we take a practical approach and look to design in a useful 
		medium, based on facts and not what Hillis deems &#34;<i>wishful thinking.&#34; 
		</i>The goal of this paper is to briefly discuss these failings of virtual 
		space and then provide examples that point toward a native virtual architecture 
		based on the GUI and the gallery.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Impact Of Mouse And Screen</h1>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Examining Failure</h2>
	  <p class="normal">The reasons for failure are diverse. The literal copying 
		of the physical space into virtual space has been less than successful. 
		As we address these failures, we reinforce the previous assertions of 
		gallery and the GUI. We can begin with a common misconception, that <i>virtual 
		reality works just like physical reality</i>. This idea completely fails 
		to account for the hardware through which we interact. Screen-based, mouse-driven, 
		virtual environments (SMVEs) utilize a vastly different interactive methodology. 
		Two issues that quickly become apparent are navigation and interaction. 
	  </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Unseen Feet</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Navigation issues arise on the ends of the spectrum; wayfinding 
		in larger environments and short, goal-oriented, precision movements. 
		To understand precision, one can look to video game design. Games that 
		require precise positioning in their environment use a third-person viewpoint. 
		Less immersive than the first-person viewpoint, the third-person perspective 
		allows a uniquely powerful navigational advantage — you can see your 
		feet. As simple as that sounds, it makes all the difference. Like a cursor 
		in a GUI, feet show the absolute position of the user in the environment. 
	  </p>
	  <p class="normal">More precision issues lie in the standard movements allowed 
		by most Web3d applications: move forward/backward, turn left/right. Compared 
		to the flexibilities of human mobility, the two-button mouse is quite 
		handicapped. The issue is evident when the user zooms in to see a work 
		close-up, and then wants to see another section or detail of that work 
		close-up. The diagram below shows the unwieldy process by which most users 
		try to see the detail. Note Step 03: users need to position themselves 
		in front of the detail without seeing it.</p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><img src="gynup.figure01_nav.jpg" width="400" height="193"/></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption" align="center">Figure 1: S. Guynup. Diagram of Short, 
		Goal-Oriented Movement</p>
	  <p class="normal">Again, video games have addressed this issue by allowing 
		the user to strafe. Strafing is the ability to move perpendicular to your 
		viewpoint. This side-to-side motion is very useful for first-person shooter 
		games where the purpose is to move quickly and kill. Some Web3D technologies 
		allow for sliding, yet even the most experienced users fail to change 
		their navigation preferences for such seemingly short actions. </p>
	  <p class="normal">A last, hidden issue relates to the purpose of the space. 
		The design and action in a game environment are driven actively by the 
		computer and the narrative. In the (usually) more subdued genre of museums, 
		the addition of strafing navigation ability is helpful, yet not as effective. 
		In the museum, Art drives the user&#39;s action. The mindset of users examining 
		art makes them more sensitive to the limitations of the interactivity. 
	  </p>
	  <p class="normal">Wayfinding, the cognitive process of navigating and interpreting 
		the environment, carries a subtle problem. Typically, it takes time to 
		understand the spatial mapping of any environment, real or virtual. We 
		seem to forget how easily we get lost in new surroundings. Factor in the 
		lack of nuanced cues like physical wear, and the problem grows. Wayfinding 
		becomes even harder as designers, free of construction restraints, build 
		large spaces. Free of natural physical laws, they build using their own 
		site-specific logic. (For a secondary reference, look how often we get 
		lost in a two dimensional Web site.) Over time, the user does learn how 
		to interpret the layout of the space. Unfortunately, unlimited time is 
		something we do not have. </p>
	  <p class="SubHeaderSmall">Mouse vs. Body</p>
	  <p class="normal">Interacting with virtual environments carries issues similar 
		to navigation in Web environments. The mouse is not the hand. This sets 
		up the following dynamic; Visually, we cue to items that we interact with 
		in the real world. If the interaction is beyond the scope of the mouse, 
		we can frustrate the user. Typically, the question they ask is &#34;why bother?&#34; 
		Below is a unique example.</p>
	  <p class="normal" style="line-height:150%" align="center"><img src="gynup.figure02_townsquare.jpg" width="400" height="183"/></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 2: Library in &#34;Town Square at Ariadne&#34; - J. Sonstein<br/>
		<a href="http://ariadne.iz.net/~jeffs/" target="_blank">http://ariadne.iz.net/~jeffs/</a></p>
	  <p class="normal">Each book links to a topic in the Yahoo­ database; the computer 
		is a link to a Bosnian info site. Metaphorically, the layering of informational 
		structures (i.e. books and computers) inside a virtual space is thought 
		provoking. In terms of functionality, it is less than optimal. Books and 
		computers were created for use by human hands. The mouse was developed 
		for two-dimensional interfaces. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Leaving the Real</h2>
	  <p class="normal">The reasons for merging GUI and gallery are becoming apparent 
		as mirrored reality approaches falter. As technology advances and allows 
		for more natural manipulation and navigation, we realize that the greatest 
		empowerment may still lie beyond the current notion of reality. Take, 
		for example, the fundamental mechanism of interactive design - the button. 
		Does the button exist in nature? Do birds and bees press buttons? This 
		abstract means of control constructed with finger operation in mind and 
		placed within arm&#39;s reach has become to us second-nature. Recognized by 
		repetitive cause and effect, the button becomes intuitive. Even when the 
		mechanism below the button is beyond the user&#39;s comprehension, such as 
		physics and the codes that make my computer keyboard operate, the action 
		feels natural. As we move toward a native virtual design, vast possibilities 
		emerge, possibilities that stem from a legacy of mouse and screen. The 
		next section moves into abstract territory, presents issues inherent when 
		reality is left behind, and then offers harbingers of future design.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Harbingers of Native Design</h1>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">A Realm of Pure Information</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Authors like William Gibson and architects such as Michael 
		Benedikt left reality behind. Space as interface, as database, a &#34;realm 
		of pure information&#34;, this was the desire of early virtual reality theorists. 
		Abstract visionary environments were designed for the human mind, not 
		the body. Information in graphs and charts surround the user. The philosophic 
		papers of this genre are deeply moving - these environments, these dynamic 
		hyperspaces are beautiful works of art. Yet, overloaded with imagery and 
		force fitted with data, their functionality is forgotten. Despite the 
		ability of three-dimensional space to hold vast amounts of data, it is 
		important to remember that; &#34;Less is more&#34;.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Data representation in three-dimensions is difficult because 
		spatial-visual information generated by the space does not support and 
		often contradicts the data the developer wants represented. Perspective 
		and shading throw a wench into our ability to compare and quantify. Furthermore, 
		the informational narrative created by moving through or rotating the 
		space offers little practical benefit for data that is not inherently 
		spatial or placed with that in mind. To delete the spatial information 
		is to return to two-dimensional space. This then becomes a dilemma of 
		purposes: navigatible space requires visual-spatial information that cues 
		the users, allowing them to move through it, but data representation seeks 
		clarity and comparability. </p>
	  <p class="normal">We can summarize the failings of prior works in two general 
		categories: realistic environments that did not compensate for the affordances 
		of mouse and screen, and data driven environments which could not structure 
		the information to the required level of clarity. The former is a function 
		of technology, the latter of purpose. </p>
	  <p class="normal">To find solutions is a two-fold process. In the next section, 
		<i>Towards a New Interaction and Architecture,</i> we&#39;ll briefly address 
		native navigation and interaction techniques. For the second part, the 
		question of purpose, we move from realistic or data driven ideals and 
		return to William Rubin&#39;s issue — that &#34;museums are ... emptied of 
		all connotations other than art.&#34; We explore connotations and connections 
		in the section entitled <i>Examples of Exploration.</i></p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Towards a New Interaction and Architecture</h1>
	  <p class="normal">To address the root issues of user interactions, we must 
		design objects to be user friendly. Size is often the simplest fix: larger 
		objects are easier to see, easier to click on and proportionately easier 
		to correctly navigate to. Smart objects are possible, and they occupy 
		a range of possibilities. Most Web3D languages allow for &#34;Billboard&#34; objects. 
		These flat panels or even full 3D objects automatically turn to face the 
		viewer. If the panel contains visual or interactive elements, this is 
		an easy way to allow the user to read or touch it head on. Beyond turning 
		on the y-axis, the objects or panels can gently slide into the path of 
		the user. A more aggressive approach is having the interactive object 
		grab the user and position him or her as needed. The effect of this is 
		somewhat jarring to the user and, if used, ought be supported by the narrative 
		of the space (i.e. the designer can provide an alternate reason for moving 
		the user).</p>
	  <p class="normal">A designer can also break from the interior of the space 
		and place information into a heads-up display or even into a side HTML 
		frame. This pop-up can be based on user positioning or be activated by 
		a button on the user&#39;s &#34;dashboard&#34;. While a level of immersiveness is 
		lost, the ease by which the user can interact is greatly enhanced. </p>

	  <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 03: S. Guynup. Surreal Menu </p>
	  <p class="normal">When designers remove items like chairs, tables, lamps from 
		a screen-based, mouse-driven virtual environment (SMVE), a sense of emptiness 
		appears. The effect is emotional as the user has few pre-existing cues 
		to guide the relationship with the space. Real world items also form a 
		basis for comprehending the size and layout of the space. In appropriate 
		amounts, these elements cue the user&#39;s navigational behavior (in larger 
		- or even just realistic amounts they can be cumbersome). To compensate, 
		some virtual architects take a deconstructive approach. They add visual 
		interest and navigational cues by breaking the flat planes of wall and 
		floor. Slight angles and wire frames can reinforce the user&#39;s sense of 
		three-dimensional space. Some authors add background animation to give 
		&#34;life&#34; to a space.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Patrick Keller&#39;s Alternate Fabrique shows the classic architectural 
		interpretation of virtual structures. To generate a sense of space that 
		appears full yet lacks benches and lights of the realistic spaces, Keller 
		breaks and bends his galleries, extends faux structural elements outwards. 
		Lines stretch like taut ropes and help define forms that are weighted 
		yet weightless.</p>

	  </p>
	  <p class="normal">Often, designers use bold colors and oversized visual elements 
		to fully fill their virtual space. This effect, usually fun and visually 
		engaging, plays off the user&#39;s previous knowledge of two-dimensional animated 
		cartoons. There is a second benefit to scaling elements in the environment 
		upwards. Large elements are typically easier to see and interact with. 
		Large elements give the user a larger area for proper positioning and 
		can be a solution to problems of precision navigation</p>

	  <p class="normal">Both of these approaches represent a lateral expansion of 
		reality. To understand this, compare the real world environment of New 
		York City to that of the Arctic tundra. Visually, they are extremely different, 
		yet the same laws of nature and physics apply. Gravity is always active, 
		and the ground is solid. In virtual environments, these rules are flexible; 
		they are at the whim of the world builder. At a deeply fundamental level, 
		there are abstract concepts governing reality that are subject to review. 
		In real environments, objects are persistent and shared. In the virtual, 
		these rules are by default, reversed. Objects are typically unshared and 
		non-persistent. While this is seen as commonplace within a GUI, the long-term 
		impact on the design of virtual space is unknown.</p>
	  <p class="normal">As we exploit the native characteristics of SMVEs, a path 
		becomes clear. We merge the speed and clarity of two-dimensional interfaces 
		with the immersive, experiential aspects of three. In structuring space 
		as subsets of explorable data, we can group and display information in 
		new ways. We can add a level of connection and to some extent the connotations 
		that were previously unreachable. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Examples of Exploration</h2>
	  <p class="normal">The following museum built by Christiano Bianci typifies 
		the subtle border of lateral expression. It has a strong and controlled 
		color scheme and presents its exhibitions within wire frame boxes. At 
		the same time, real world new media trade shows and art exhibits have 
		a very similar sense of place.</p>

	  <p class="MsoNormal">Stairs could have been used to connect the three floors 
		of this virtual gallery, but in these environments, stairs are difficult 
		to use. So instead, we teleport, using what appears to<span class="normal"> 
		</span>be a kiosk (left image). Note that while it resembles a kiosk, 
		it utilizes a GUI menu structure that in fact even says &#34;menu&#34;.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">The Navigatible Database</h2>
	  <p class="normal">This discussion begins, surprisingly enough, with a space 
		that responds to the user&#39;s movement. Although not typically seen as mobile, 
		databases possess a formal order that is navigated and manipulated. We 
		can transcribe the database into a three dimensional form. The example 
		below by Christiano Bianci does just that. As the users move through the 
		space, the data appears to them. The left image is a screen capturel; 
		the right is an illustration of action.</p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><img src="gynup.figure07_database.jpg" width="400" height="145"/></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 7: C. Bianci. A database as gallery structure 
	  </p>
	  <p class="normal">Image this structure within a database table. Related rows 
		and columns slide to present the intersection between the data types. 
		The intersection is given in full detail and the corresponding row and 
		column is given in outline. To navigate this environment, we enter it 
		and we exist at the intersection. As we move, so does the row and column. 
		Data in full is presented around us. The upper right diagram illustrates 
		the layout. Variable B is a timeline; variable A are the members of the 
		band known as the Sex Pistols­. The choice was made because of the diversity 
		and availability of information about the band. Within each database unit, 
		we find text, images, sounds and movies.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Relating space to information can be done on many levels. 
		The gallery on the following page does just that. In the distance, it 
		is an object, a spinnable timeline of the 1950s to the 1970s. The goal 
		was to create a relationship between the distortion of perspective caused 
		by the user&#39;s vantage point and the data. Above, it highlights the differing 
		viewpoints on the 1960s. In concept it is as simple as saying, &#34;In the 
		eyes of 1950s, we see the 1960s as &#39;X&#39; while those looking back from the 
		1970s see the 1960s as &#39;Y&#39;.&#34;</p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><img src="gynup.figure08_timeline.jpg" width="400" height="206"/></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption"><b><i><span>Figure 8: S. Guynup.Ð &#34;Timeline&#34; an immersive 
		pathway </span></i></b></p>
	  <p class="normal">Secondly, the timeline object can become an environment. 
		The user can move into the space and navigate towards the center, the 
		1960s. In doing so, a narrative is produced that colors the user&#39;s opinions 
		of that controversial decade. Depending on which entry point, either from 
		the 1950s or the 1970s, a distinct outlook is formed. In this sense, we 
		mirror the real world: our previous experiences deeply influence our opinion 
		of what follows. Lastly, to the left is a heads-up display (HUD) that 
		tracks the user&#39;s position in the timeline. Visually, the user is able 
		to relate his environmental position to the abstract point in time.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Divisions of Information: Kiosks within a Menu</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Information in a virtual scene can be brought to the user 
		in any quantity desired. This ranges from a single audio file or image 
		to entire worlds that hold a variety of informational objects. In the 
		middle range is an installation, or to use a more functional analogy, 
		a kiosk. A virtual kiosk is a complete unit of information accessible 
		to the larger whole via a menu.</p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><img src="gynup.figure09_kiosk.jpg" width="400" height="148"/></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption" style="margin-left:.5in"><b><i><span>Figure 9: S. Guynup. 
		&#34;Untitled Memories&#34; virtual installation</span></i></b></p>
	  <p class="normal">Clicking on the red buttons in the menu arm gives the user 
		access to the other installations / kiosks. Five separate, yet related 
		informational structures are within easy reach of the virtual visitor. 
		With a single click, users can see the information they came for and decide 
		if they wish to explore it in detail. This could have been created in 
		a single large space holding all five installations. Does the users&#39; travel 
		between installations have value, or is it (in this instance) time consuming 
		and possibly disorientationg? The users may get lost. If they demand quick 
		access, as most do, they will grow frustrated with the one-space design&#39;s 
		inability to meet their needs.<i> </i></p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">And of a New Art</h2>
	  <p class="normal">We have addressed issues of usability and have hopefully 
		provided practical information on the nature of virtual design. Looking 
		forward, we see not only new structures and interfaces, but new art as 
		well: an art that will allow us to explore the relationships between our 
		bodies, minds and world. The variety of works and the galleries that support 
		them is vast. Much has already been done.</p>

	  <p class="normal">The painter Maurice Clifford has translated his abstract 
		art into animated, almost hypnotic flowing sculptures. In John Klima&#39;s 
		Glasbead, art and interface design merge into uncharted territory. Spun 
		by the user, the hammers freely rotate around the center. When a hammer 
		collides with another, a tone is made, and so the physical rhythms of 
		spun hammers create a new musical form.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Earlier we discussed the gallery structure created by Patrick 
		Keller. Conceptually he had designed it to hold virtual works of art. 
		The virtual six artists invited to show in the space were confronted with 
		a unique problem. For artists accustomed to infinite space, the real-world-sized 
		rooms were in effect very small. The smallness of space became the starting 
		point for many of the artists. Taking a cue from the cramped quarters, 
		Andy Best filled his small space with a large fiery animated animal. Steve 
		Guynup added a single button. When pressed, it caused all but the entrance 
		and exit portals to flitter away. With walls removed, the users found 
		themselves in an abstract Chinese garden. In addition, as this was a multi-user 
		space, the users could now interact with others in wholly separate visual 
		environments. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The most ingenious tack was taken by <span>Christiano Bianchi</span>. 
		His work consisted of boxes that float in space at a height that matched 
		users&#39; heads. With collision turned off, the users can actually enter 
		the box. Upon entering a box, users found <span>Christiano</span> had 
		altered their walking speed, making them move more slowly. As the primary 
		tool for judging the size of abstract space is the speed through which 
		one moves, he had in essence created a larger space inside the box. He 
		programmed it so that infinite boxes were placed inside each other and 
		in each, the users moves a little more slowly. Adding letters to the boxes, 
		he entitled the space, &#34;<span>Infinite Babel</span>&#34;</p>

	  <h1 class="SubHeader">A Goal </h1>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Towards a Deeper Understanding</h2>
	  <p class="normal">The goal of the museum is &#34;not to create subject matter 
		mastery, but to accomplish certain appreciative goals¤to awaken interest, 
		to broaden perspectives, to induce deeper understanding, to enrich aesthetic 
		sensitivities, and so forth&#34; (Lee 1968). To do this, we can look beyond 
		the real and the dreamscape to the new. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The gallery below supports two installations. The center 
		holds a sculptured body circled by NATO and Serbian emblems. In the middle 
		of the figure is a map of Kosovo. The interaction is simple. The art attacks 
		the user. NATO and Serbian forces fire lasers and the user can fire back. 
		The only damage they do is to Kosovo. In the upper gallery, images of 
		the destruction are circled around a piece of rotating text that declares 
		<i>&#34;...this is not a game.&#34;</i> As cultures become reared on video games 
		and see war as just another image on TV, it becomes crucial that we use 
		our technology not as trip in time or as an escape from reality. It the 
		end, virtual reality must reinforce the real.</p>

	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Conclusion</h2>
	  <p class="normal">In describing virtual space, we have encouraged a broader 
		perspective in terms of structural design and the end use. As time progresses, 
		virtual spaces on the Web will become more commonplace. To start this 
		process, they must accept the current affordances and limitations of mouse 
		and screen. In creating a new interactive methodology, we also redefine 
		the means by which we can interpret our world and ourselves. Broad new 
		vistas of human experience are not far off, and yet, they are distant 
		enough to be unknown. This paper offers at best only harbingers of that 
		future. All that can be said for certain is that the path to this end 
		lies in the merger of the GUI and the gallery. </p>
