		<p class="Author">Robin Dowden, Walker Art Center, USA</p>
		<p class="URL"><a href="http://mnartists.org/" target="_blank"><i>http://mnartists.org</i></a> 
		  and <a href="http://walkerart.org/" target="_blank"><i>http://walkerart.org 
		  </i></a> </p>
		<p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">mnartists.org is an online resource of and for Minnesota 
		  artists from all disciplines — visual arts, performing arts, media 
		  arts, literary arts, and design and architecture — giving them 
		  a central gathering place on the Web, and ultimately, a community hub. 
		  Developed through a partnership of The McKnight Foundation (<a href="http://www.mcknight.org/" target="_blank">http://www.mcknight.org</a>) 
		  and the Walker Art Center (<a href="http://www.walkerart.org/" target="_blank">http://www.walkerart.org</a>), 
		  over 3,100 artists have registered with mnartists.org since the site 
		  launched in July 2001. In December 2002, mnartists.org launched a new 
		  version of the Web site that provides a range of services, including 
		  expanded news and feature articles, online forums, and streamed broadcasts 
		  of members&#39; work — a Minnesota arts channel — with corresponding 
		  &#34;off-line&#34; events. This paper discusses the development of 
		  mnartists.org in the form of 10 Tips for building online community.</p>
		<p class="keywords"><b>Keywords: </b>online community, collaboration, Walker 
		  Art Center, portal, artists, forums, Minnesota</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Project Overview</h1>
		<p class="normal">There are an estimated 30,000 artists in Minnesota. 
		  How many are making a decent living at it? That&#39;s what The McKnight 
		  Foundation wanted to find out when it conducted a survey of Minnesota 
		  artists in 1999. This survey pinpointing artists&#39; struggles to survive 
		  revealed that the myth of the &#34;starving artist&#34; was much more 
		  a reality than a fable. Most artists reported that it was difficult 
		  to make ends meet, and that they needed to supplement their artists&#39; 
		  incomes with additional jobs.</p>
		<p class="normal">So The McKnight Foundation (<a href="http://www.mcknight.org/" target="_blank">http://www.mcknight.org</a>) 
		  and the Walker Art Center (<a href="http://www.walkerart.org/" target="_blank">http://www.walkerart.org</a>) 
		  decided to form a partnership that we hoped would improve the economic 
		  lives of artists in Minnesota by connecting them with arts organizations, 
		  the broader public, and each other.</p>
		<p class="SubHeaderSmall">mnartists.org is the result of that partnership.</p>
		<p class="normal">mnartists.org is an online resource of and for Minnesota 
		  artists from all disciplines — visual arts, performing arts, media 
		  arts, literary arts, and design and architecture — giving them 
		  a central gathering place on the Web, and ultimately, a community hub. 
		  Any artist interested in promoting their creative work to a broader 
		  audience may register to get a free Web page to display images, text, 
		  sound, and/or video clips of their creative work and to provide information 
		  about themselves and their art. </p>
		<p class="normal">Phase 1 of mnartists.org was launched July 2001. The 
		  primary objectives of the first phase were to create database-driven 
		  access to information about artists working or living in Minnesota and 
		  to build project awareness with key audiences (artists, art professionals/organizations, 
		  and art enthusiasts). </p>
		<p class="normal">Phase 2, which began in March 2002, is continuing our 
		  efforts to build a comprehensive database of Minnesota artists and aims 
		  to make significant steps toward building a community infrastructure 
		  and program that goes beyond the directory. To achieve these goals, 
		  mnartists.org is providing a range of services including access to member-made 
		  collections and tours, expanded news and feature articles, online forums, 
		  and streamed broadcasts of members&#39; work — a Minnesota arts channel 
		  — with corresponding &#34;off-line&#34; events.</p>
		<p class="normal">mnartists.org represents a unique partnership between 
		  a preeminent arts foundation and a multidisciplinary contemporary art 
		  center who are combining their resources to provide an extraordinary 
		  new vehicle to support Minnesota artists by making their work accessible 
		  to anyone via the Internet. </p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">10 Tips for Building Online Communities</h1>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Tip 1: develop a grass roots approach</h2>
		<p class="normal">mnartists.org is the result of The McKnight Foundation&#39;s 
		  desire to fundamentally change the economic status of artists and the 
		  Walker Art Center&#39;s mission to support local artists. The project&#39;s 
		  success, measured through usage statistics and feedback, is in no small 
		  part a result of the democratic, self-defining nature of the community. 
		  To date, over 3,100 registered artists have posted 12,000 works of art. 
		  As of December 2002, there had been over 2 million visitors to the site, 
		  spending 29,214 hours viewing 160,534 pages. Comments about the site 
		  have been extremely positive and suggest that mnartists.org is indeed 
		  making a difference in artists&#39; lives.</p>

		  <p><span class="BlockQuote">I&#39;ve been exploring the site as I work on

			THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WONDERFUL SERVICE - IT WORKS!!!</span></p>

		</div>
	  </blockquote>
	  <div class="MsoBodyText"> 
		<p class="normal">On December 4, 2002, the <i>St. Paul Pioneer Press</i> 
		  wrote an article about the site and its public launch, proclaiming: 
		  &#34;People today often use the word &#34;community&#34; as a demographic 
		  classification  Artists registered with the mushrooming Web site mnartists.org 
		  have a more literal ideal — they want to connect with each other.&#34;</p>
		<p class="normal">To become a member of mnartists.org, you must live or 
		  work in Minnesota, define yourself as an artist, and have an email address. 
		  The artists and their work are not judged or critiqued by the parent 
		  institutions. From the beginning, the Walker and McKnight Foundation 
		  have embraced the notion that the community belongs to the participants, 
		  and that the participants, not the organizers, will ultimately be responsible 
		  for the project&#39;s success.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Tip 2: hire from within the community</h2>
		<p class="normal">mnartists.org is managed by the Walker Art Center. 
		  The Web site lives in the Walker&#39;s collocation facility and is administered 
		  by the Walker&#39;s Web master. The software was created through contracted 
		  services; the principal developer has been with the project since its 
		  inception. While the project could not have been realized without management 
		  and technologists, the community thrives because of the efforts of mnartists.org&#39;s 
		  &#34;staff.&#34; This staff consists of an editor, Ann Klefstad, 
		  and a community manager, Colin Rusch. Both are practicing artists, living 
		  in Duluth and Minneapolis respectfully. Together, they are the face 
		  and real presence of mnartists.org. </p>
		<p class="normal">Ann Klefstad, mnartists.org&#39;s editor, is responsible 
		  for soliciting news about Minnesota arts from throughout the state, 
		  and defining an editorial vision for the site. With modest stipends 
		  for writers, she publishes weekly feature articles, monthly interviews 
		  and bi-monthly reviews on topics ranging from how geography informs 
		  artistic practices to how art relates to spirituality. Ann is passionate 
		  about creating a larger context for the arts in Minnesota and furthering 
		  the project&#39;s goal to change the economic status of artists by paying, 
		  if only minimally, the writers who contribute articles published on 
		  the site. </p>
		<p class="normal">Colin Rusch, mnartists.org&#39;s community manager, works 
		  face-to-face and online. A dancer by profession, Colin is responsible 
		  for developing relationships with artists and organizations throughout 
		  the state. Part evangelist, part definer of needs and opportunities, 
		  Colin is the project&#39;s most visible face. </p>
		<p><span class="normal">Ann and Colin&#39;s relationship to the community 
		  as practising artists enhances their credibility as spokespersons for 
		  the project. The Walker Art Center and McKnight Foundation maintain 
		  relatively low profiles on the site, reinforcing the premise that the 
		  project is &#34;owned&#34; by the community that it represents</span>.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Tip 2a: don&#39;t be afraid to ask for<span class="SubHeaderSmall"> 
		  </span>help</h2>
		<p class="normal">Running community forums is a multi-person job. The 
		  community manager moderates mnartists.org&#39;s forums with help from a 
		  member of Walker&#39;s education staff (Alicia Patrick). As moderators, 
		  Colin and Alicia read all posts, welcome new visitors, and help nurture 
		  conversations (in the first two months of operation, Colin posted 168 
		  messages on topics ranging from simple greetings to thoughtful posts 
		  on how sanctity fits into American art). Colin is responsible for setting 
		  the tone, organizing discussion threads, defining rules of conduct, 
		  and dealing with aberrant behavior. Unfortunately, Colin&#39;s job is a 
		  part time position, and running the forums is just one of his responsibilities. 
		  Since the forums launched in January 2003, there have been over 800 
		  messages posted in 50 topics. As the community continues to grow, the 
		  plan is to recruit volunteers from among the participants to help as 
		  forum moderators.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Tip 3: maintain the community&#39;s interest</h2>
		<p class="normal">All Web developers know that delivering dynamic, up-to-date 
		  content is key to maintaining visitors&#39; interest. mnartists.org has 
		  taken this concept to a new level by making member-generated content 
		  the most visible element on the site. The home page, discipline &#34;browse 
		  pages&#34;, and each individual artist&#39;s home pages are constantly 
		  changing, reflecting the most recent work uploaded by the membership. 
		  The images appearing on these pages are time dated, revealing exactly 
		  when the content was created. Reinforcing this concept, mnartists.org&#39;s 
		  logo includes a polygon whose points and rotation change daily, reflecting 
		  visitor page views (the rotation) and uploads (distance of a point from 
		  the center) within the five disciplines in which registered artists 
		  are grouped. The strength of this design concept cannot be overemphasized. 
		  The idea of getting your work on the home page motivates artists and 
		  organizations to post new material and provides the general membership 
		  — the art enthusiasts — with a constant source of intrigue. </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Tip 4: throw a party</h2>
		<p class="normal">For the public launch of the new interface, mnartists.org 
		  organized an event that included on and off-line components which provided 
		  an amazing opportunity to recruit new members while simultaneously promoting 
		  the project. Entitled <i>5 Minutes of Fame</i>, the event included 
		  a 28-hour Web cast of over 300 five-minute presentations of artists&#39; 
		  work, ranging from moving image, to audio, slide shows, animations, 
		  and scrolling texts representing artists in every discipline. In conjunction 
		  with the Web cast, the Walker hosted a virtual ribbon-cutting ceremony 
		  and a party with guest artists who presented work across disciplines, 
		  including a reading from a book-in-progress and musical, theatrical, 
		  and new media performances. These live performances were broadcast 
		  on the Internet in the first of Walker&#39;s live-cast events.</p>
		<p class="normal"><i>5 Minutes of Fame</i> was amazingly successful on 
		  a number of levels. Less than one month after launching the new mnartists.org, 
		  170 new artists and organizations had registered, and over 500 new work 
		  records had been created. During the two days of the Web cast and live 
		  party, mnartists.org logged 8,100 user sessions in a 48-hour period 
		  — more visits than the Walker Web site, which receives over 3 million 
		  visits per year, has ever had in such a concentrated period.</p>
		<p class="normal"><span class="BlockQuote">The results prior to the event 
		  were just as impressive. In the four-months leading up to <i>5 Minutes 
		  of Fame</i>, over 700 artists and 2,000+ work records were created. 
		  </span><span class="BlockQuote">During this same period, mnartists.org 
		  also worked directly with nearly 30 different arts organizations and 
		  began to foster relationships with local communities across the state. 
		  As we started a more substantial campaign to recruit arts organizations 
		  and continued to tap into local social networks, this event provided 
		  an opportunity to begin building the trust and working relationships 
		  necessary for developing a far-reaching online community.</span></p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Tip 5: learn from the pros </h2>
		<p class="normal">Although the Walker Art Center has a great deal of experience 
		  working with local, physical communities, prior to implementing mnartists.org&#39;s 
		  forums, our online community efforts had been restricted to listservs 
		  operated for set periods of time in conjunction with exhibitions (<i>Shock 
		  of the View</i>, 1998-1999, and <i>EAT: Entertainment, Art, and Technology</i>, 
		  2000). To test the concept and gain experience running an ongoing community 
		  forum, we approached our neighbors and hosts of one of the Internet&#39;s 
		  most successful online communities, Caf Utne (http://cafe.utne.com). 
		  In April 2002, we contacted Caf Utne to host a Walker forum focusing 
		  on the meanings of names as they related to the work of Alan Berliner, 
		  an artist-in-residence at the Walker. Later that year, we approached 
		  Utne for training and mentoring services (12-15 hours per month for 
		  six months). Using the software that had been selected for the forums, 
		  mnartists.org&#39;s community manager and a member of the Walker&#39;s education 
		  department worked with an Utne conference moderator on a training program 
		  consisting of a series of reading assignments and discussions on the 
		  theory and practice of building and managing online communities. Utne 
		  staff assisted Walker and mnartists.org&#39;s staff in the evaluation of 
		  opening topic ideas, forum architecture, and tips for moderators. Post 
		  launch, the Utne moderator continues to participate in the mnartists.org 
		  forums and provides guidance on a variety of topics.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Tip 6: build the audience before starting the 
		  discussion</h2>
		<p class="normal">mnartists.org has been developed over a two-and-a-half-year 
		  period in two distinct phases. Phase 1 (launched July 2001) produced 
		  a database structure and application that allowed artists to register 
		  and contribute to a directory of Minnesota artists. Phase 2 (launched 
		  December 2002) introduced an entirely new interface with enhanced functionality 
		  (such as support of other media file types, including text, audio and 
		  video), a new membership type and profile for arts organizations, and 
		  the introduction of services that would allow participants to better 
		  interact as a community. Significantly, the forums did not actually 
		  open until a month after phase 2 was publicly launched. This delay 
		  allowed the membership to become acquainted with the new interface and 
		  provided us with the opportunity to send invitations and announcements 
		  — get the buzz started — before opening the forum doors. The results 
		  were impressive. Over 180 messages where created in the first week, 
		  and the conversation was stimulating.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Tip 7: be responsive to community needs and 
		  concerns (aka &#34;Stop the Crop&#34;)</h2>
		<p class="normal">Building a successful community requires listening and 
		  responding to the community&#39;s needs and concerns. Beginning with a 
		  1999 study by The McKnight Foundation, the whole process of developing 
		  mnartists.org has been driven by the desire to be responsive to community 
		  needs. The McKnight&#39;s Cost of Culture study, which polled 405 Minnesota 
		  artists about their economic and creative well being, spurred the Foundation 
		  to look for an opportunity to help individual artists at all career 
		  levels. The Web seemed like the perfect environment. Throughout the 
		  development of mnartists.org, McKnight and Walker have solicited community 
		  opinions and feedback through various methods, including focus groups, 
		  usability studies, member surveys, and most recently, online forums. 
		  The forums have become a natural vehicle for answering questions about 
		  the software and provide an excellent environment for the membership 
		  to discuss some of mnartists.org&#39;s more controversial design decisions 
		  (such as the cropping of images). The conversation among information 
		  architects, designers, and artists on the topic of cropping images is 
		  a great thread where everyone learns something about the other point 
		  of view and which will ultimately result in a better design.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Tip 8: let the community help define the rules</h2>
		<p class="normal">Initially, mnartists.org made the decision not to post 
		  explicit rules of conduct. Then on January 23, we had our first posting 
		  with profanity. The moderator edited the post, and a discussion about 
		  censorship and the community&#39;s general rules of conduct ensued. As 
		  Colin said in the first post on the forum entitled &#34;Profanity or 
		  no in the forums:&#34; </p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">How does profanity fit into our standards of decency 
		  as well as the intention of this project? This issue is not mine to 
		  decide, but I will be the person ultimately responsible for maintaining 
		  those standards. Collectively let&#39;s figure out what those standards 
		  are.</p>
		<p class="normal">The community is still discussing these standards, as 
		  well as Colin&#39;s role as enforcer (some argue that peer pressure is enough 
		  to keep people in line). Outside the forums, we are equally cautious 
		  about intervening (to date, we have been forced to remove only one artist 
		  record that was clearly a hack, and recently sent a note to an organization 
		  that had figured out a system for staying on the home page and was abusing 
		  the feature). Our Terms of Use state that mnartists.org is not responsible 
		  for third party content and reserve mnartists.org&#39;s right to edit or 
		  remove any material from the site at any time. Management&#39;s challenge 
		  is to create a comfortable environment where the community feels empowered 
		  to help define the culture and exchange ideas.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Tip 9: seed discussions outside the forum wa<span class="SubHeaderSmall">l</span>ls</h2>
		<p class="normal">Provide gateways from site content to community forums 
		  to allow participants to encounter discussions without clicking on the 
		  Community link. For example, readers of mnartists.org&#39;s articles will 
		  find a link to the forum topic where stories are discussed. People 
		  who might not otherwise seek out forums may well be interested in more 
		  topically oriented subjects. </p>
		<p class="normal">Beginning February 6, 2003, mnartists.org is hosting 
		  for the Walker Art Center forums that blend the real and virtual worlds. 
		  Related to the Walker&#39;s current exhibition How Latitudes Become Forms: 
		  Art in a Global Age, the discussion in these forums often begins with 
		  a lecture or panel discussion that is Web cast live and then archived 
		  on the exhibition Web site. Event attendees are encouraged to visit 
		  the forums after the lecture to join in a discussion that often includes 
		  guest artists and curators. This pairing of event and discussion spaces 
		  helps drive traffic among the Web sites and expands the mnartists.org 
		  community beyond its immediate walls.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Tip 10: welcome your guests and let them choose 
		  their level of interaction</h2>
		<p class="normal">From sending a welcome message to new registrants to 
		  greeting participants when they first post in the online forums, make 
		  sure that community members feel welcome while being respectful of their 
		  privacy. Registered members of mnartists.org are given options for 
		  how much or little they want to hear from the parent organization and 
		  site visitors. From the parent organization, registrants can choose 
		  whether they want to receive site update information only or more general 
		  email delivered to the list at large. Artists and organizations can 
		  elect whether or not to allow email subscriptions from users, and indicate 
		  whether or not they will permit their work to be sent as an email postcard. 
		  Individual permission fields in the artist&#39;s record allow the artists 
		  to control access to their addresses and contact information. In the 
		  forums, we host an &#34;Introduce Yourself&#34; topic where mnartists.org&#39;s 
		  community manager welcomes newcomers and encourages guests to speak 
		  and have a good time.</p>
		<p class="normal">At mnartists.org, making guests feel welcome includes 
		  helping artists and organizations use the technology. The digital divide 
		  affects not only people&#39;s access to technology, but also their ability 
		  to manipulate it, as well as their strategic application of it. We 
		  have done a lot of work educating individual artists through regional 
		  organizations that provide technical resources (e.g., computer access, 
		  scanners) as well as the work that went into helping artists prepare 
		  their <i>5 Minutes of Fame</i> submissions. Our work with organizations, 
		  while more strategic in nature, is fundamentally about building a level 
		  of comfort and understanding of the possibilities for operating in a 
		  networked community environment.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">mnartists.org&#39;s Future</h1>
		<p class="normal">In December, the Walker submitted a proposal to The 
		  McKnight Foundation for continued funding for mnartists.org through 
		  June 2005. The primary goal of the grant period is to build on the 
		  success of the site to meet its mission as the leading, geographically 
		  based, internationally contextualized Internet service for Minnesota 
		  artists, providing public access to the artists and their work. This 
		  funding will assure the stability necessary for the site to become fully 
		  integrated as a critical resource in the Minnesota arts environment. 
		  It will be used primarily to pay day-to-day staff — the community manager 
		  and editor — as well as modest and ongoing resources for writers, a 
		  help desk, an ambassador program, technical maintenance, and marketing. 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">In this next stage, we have chosen to focus on programmatic 
		  activities, to build up the resources of the site. At some point in 
		  the future, we anticipate that the emphasis will shift more toward the 
		  general public, since their support and interest in artists and arts 
		  organizations is critical. However, for the next 28 months we want 
		  to focus on creating and supporting the conditions for a vibrant community 
		  that is active, largely self-directed, and growing. This is the best 
		  way, now, to attract a general public.</p>
		<p class="normal">Another important goal for the next 28 months is to 
		  determine the best ongoing structure for mnartists.org. We know that 
		  we want it to be increasingly community-driven, but exactly how to implement 
		  this and ensure that the project is sustainable is still to be determined.</p>
