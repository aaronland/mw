	  <p class="AbstractText">Despite recent technical advances in collections access 
		and interpretation, most notably on the World Wide Web, a number of key 
		issues still remain. A sustained consideration, beyond technological innovation, 
		to pragmatic concerns arising from current acquisition and documentation 
		practices and data quality is necessary. Coupled with this, a consolidated 
		response is required to recent post-structuralist, postmodern epistemological, 
		disciplinary and museological debates about knowledge making and meaning 
		construction and how current collections information relates to, and revises 
		these themes. </p>

	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Preface</h1>
	  <p class="normal">Paul Marty (1999) in a recent paper argued that information 
		infrastructures can be viewed as organic, evolving with society or the 
		organization they support, defining it as much as they are defined by 
		it. Transposing this argument more specifically to a collections context, 
		and in the framework of the aforementioned issues, one may ask the following 
		questions. What are the potential futures for the next generation of digital 
		collections? How will documentation systems and practices evolve to meet 
		the needs of contemporary knowledge paradigms and users? In what ways 
		will they transform institutions and the way objects are understood and 
		accessed? </p>
	  <p class="normal">This paper poses some answers to these questions drawing 
		on the results of two research projects. First, a discussion of findings 
		from the <i>Themescaping Virtual Collections</i> project (an Australian 
		Research Council funded project with partners the University of Sydney 
		History Department, the Powerhouse Museum and Vernon Systems Ltd.) elucidates 
		some potential futures for online collections interfaces, navigational, 
		searching, browsing concepts and content while profiling and detailing 
		the requirements of an emerging and diverse community of users. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Second, preliminary results from the <i>Knowledge Objects</i> 
		project (an Australian Research Council funded Sesqui grant with partners 
		the University of Sydney History Department and the Powerhouse Museum) 
		offer a sustained consideration, beyond technological innovation, to pragmatic 
		concerns arising from current acquisition and documentation practices 
		and data quality. But more significantly, the discussion offers fresh 
		insights into ways collections documentation and interpretation can be 
		reconceptualized to form new knowledge models in line with contemporary 
		theoretical, pedagogic and public access concerns. </p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">The benefits of this discussion extend 
		beyond how the substantial resources allocated to tasks such as digitization 
		and technical development may reap maximum returns for museums and users. 
		Rethinking the nature of collections information and public access offers 
		new insights into key areas for change in museum policy, practice, knowledge 
		creation and management. </span></p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
	  <p class="normal">With the challenge of digital technologies (most notably 
		the WWW), new knowledge paradigms and public access concerns, it has become 
		necessary to revise museum collections databases, the current epistemological 
		status of data and established documentation practices. The scale and 
		speed at which many museums are responding to some of these new challenges 
		is remarkable. In institutions traditionally viewed as retrospective, 
		where strict conventions rooted in the empirical tradition govern collections 
		management and documentation, opportunities offered by digital technologies 
		radically reform what has been previously possible in terms of knowledge 
		environments.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Most significantly, over the last decade responses to these 
		challenges have led to considerable technological advances in the field 
		of collections access in the context of the World Wide Web as well as 
		investments by museums and providers in collections automation systems. 
		Here research has focused on the development of sophisticated browsing 
		and searching mechanisms, architecture and descriptive concepts such as 
		metadata for retrieval purposes.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The first generation of online collections is typified by 
		a stories/thematic solution to narrative formation as well as searching 
		interfaces. More recently there is a trend towards tailored but also more 
		adaptive responses to different usage situations as well as rethinking 
		of collections data, and how it can be put to more productive interpretive 
		ends. This offers alternative pathways through collections information 
		while posing greater contextual possibilities around objects through the 
		inclusion of additional multimedia and text based information. Above all, 
		it empowers the user to create pathways through and new organizations 
		of information thereby contributing to the development of the knowledge 
		environment. Examples include the EMP Digital Collections (Experience 
		Music Project, http://www.emplive.com), Hypermuseum (<a href="http://www.hypermuseum.com/" target="_blank">http://www.HyperMuseum.com</a>), 
		and History Wired (Smithsonian National Museum of American History, <a href="http://historywired.si.edu/index.html" target="_blank">http://historywired.si.edu/index.html</a>) 
		(Gillard, 2002).</p>
	  <p class="normal">In spite of these innovative advances, two issues remain. 
		The first, originally raised by Sarasan &amp; Donovan (1998), is whether 
		collections databases and exported data presented in the public realm 
		really fulfill the information and pedagogic needs of an emerging community 
		of online users. The second by Thomas &amp; Mintz (1998;2) concerns the 
		problem of data quality. That is, whether the data stored in these systems, 
		and the way objects are interpreted by museum staff originally for the 
		purposes of documentation and inventory control, really engage the needs 
		of online users.</p>
	  <p class="normal">In this paper I address these enduring dilemmas in two parts 
		drawing on the results of sustained research. The first part critically 
		examines the current and future implications for public access to online 
		collections databases and exported data. Selected findings from the <i>Themescaping 
		Virtual Collections</i> project (an Australian Research Council funded 
		project with partners the University of Sydney History Department, the 
		Powerhouse Museum and Vernon Systems Ltd.) initially address the requirements 
		of an emerging community of users. This entails the profiling of user 
		groups, detailing their motivations and matching these to current and 
		future access, retrieval and content requirements while revealing the 
		diversity and breadth of potential uses for these resources. Complementing 
		this I will also consider future concept and content options drawing on 
		emerging technical developments and the potential applications for new 
		knowledge paradigms in the creation of innovative knowledge environments. 
	  </p>
	  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="normal">The second part utilizes some 
		preliminary research findings from the <i>Knowledge Objects</i> project 
		(an Australian Research Council funded Sesqui grant with partners the 
		University of Sydney History Department and the Powerhouse Museum) to 
		address the important problem of documentation, the very foundations that 
		underpin collections databases and hence public access. Here I take the 
		argument beyond the immediate concerns of Thomas and Mintz (1998), and 
		issues of data conversion and technical capability, to reconceptualize 
		traditional museum models and practices for collections documentation 
		according to current theoretical paradigms and the capabilities digital 
		technologies have to offer. Most significantly, I offer some insights 
		into how this transformative process may occur, the nature and form of 
		new knowledge models, how these relate to user needs outlined in the aforementioned 
		project, and the way they may be applied to collections documentation 
		and information capture. To conclude, I discuss the broader implications 
		for future museum practice. The benefits of this discussion extend beyond 
		how the substantial resources put to tasks such as digitization and technical 
		development may reap maximum returns for museums and users. Rethinking 
		the nature of collections information also provides new insights into 
		key areas for change in museum policy, practice, knowledge creation and 
		management. </span></p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Tangible futures - user profiles, access, retrieval 
		and content requirements </h1>
	  <p class="normal">Now revisiting the first consideration. How might documentation 
		systems and practices evolve to meet the needs of contemporary discourses 
		and users? Here the <i>Themescaping Virtual Collections</i> project offers 
		some insightful suggestions illuminated through a program of sustained 
		research. To this end, research methods included interviews and focus 
		groups with a range of users, Indigenous museum workers and IT specialists 
		in Sydney and New Zealand, as well as the evaluation of existing online 
		collections. Contingent to this was an analysis of the current state of 
		user research, state of the art portals and online databases, search functionality, 
		browsing, searching, narrative and personalization tools, metadata and 
		information architecture.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Our research revealed four broad user groups. These were 
		curators, collection managers, educators and non-specialists. Yet none 
		of these profiles is mutually exclusive. Professional users for example 
		may search or browse collections for free-choice learning. So how do user 
		profiles and motivations match up with available and potential searching, 
		browsing, navigational concepts and content? </p>
	  <p class="normal">With these questions in mind we sought to investigate the 
		motivations and needs of the two main user groups, curators and collection 
		managers. Interestingly, these two groups displayed similar but also differing 
		motivations. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">The curatorial user profile</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Curatorial tasks for example include collections documentation 
		and exhibition development. Therefore, curators&#39; motivation for searching 
		and browsing their own and other online collections is to identify objects 
		by comparison with like examples, develop exhibition concepts and publications, 
		plan visits to other museums, research potential acquisitions and to identify 
		objects for loan. Furthermore, databases and exported data were viewed 
		by many focus group participants as having the potential to enhance their 
		own research capabilities, enabling choices to be made on the system thereby 
		cutting down on the physical handling of collections. Such opportunities 
		were seen as enabling democratized access to collections and efficient 
		ways of answering collection inquiries. The more &#39;enlightened&#39; curators 
		among them were also interested in extending their interpretive functions 
		through online collections by the experimentation in new ways of configuring 
		and extending the value of collections information. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Their primary concerns were improving research capabilities 
		through more intelligent searching and browsing mechanisms, and in devising 
		combinations to mine data, as this profile required quick and reliable 
		access to objects, information and images for collection identification, 
		research and exhibition tasks. To this end, the preferred option for specific 
		searches was keywords with the use of thesauri (by subject, function and 
		classification) with mechanisms that suggest search terms, phonetic spellings 
		and make typological corrections. Complementing this, our research revealed 
		a need for the development of a range of logical search schemas. Suggested 
		options included highly structured searching, intuitive browsing mechanisms 
		and navigational tools such as well-indexed subject searches and personalization/theming 
		search engines connected to a theme generator function like the <i>Hypermuseum 
		</i>model (<a href="http://www.hypermuseum.com/" target="_blank">http://www.HyperMuseum.com</a>) 
		(Stuer, 2001). Furthermore, future possibilities may involve the implementation 
		of personalization mechanisms popular in e-commerce environments such 
		as Amazon. As one focus group participant remarked, </p>
	  <p class="BlockQuote"> &#39;I like the way Amazon.com associates things such as 
		suggested readings based on a similar subject/author and so forthÖif you 
		search for a book that interests you it will find other suggested readingsÖit 
		would be good to have a clear personalization engine working within the 
		collections environment<i>.&#39; <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Cameron &amp; 
		Kenderdine, 2001; 28)</span></i> </p>
	  <p class="normal">More specifically, in a collections context, this personalization 
		concept has the potential to generate relationships between objects/topics 
		while searching.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Other desirable features included advanced searching across 
		databases and the comparison of related search results using the indexing 
		of metadata or an existing metadata index. Mechanisms to elicit responses 
		to search results and collections information from users were also high 
		on the list of priorities. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Preferred browsing options on the other hand were specifically 
		for supporting searching and for answering collection enquiries. Potential 
		future options include question and answer search engines, predetermined 
		thematic tours or collection descriptions showing highlights of the collections, 
		followed up by an advanced search using keywords and a browser to further 
		mine data. Collection statements connected to a hyperbolic tree or site 
		map were also seen as a way of specifying its scope. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Most significantly, providing information in various forms 
		to suit the conceptual maps of a range of users was seen by the curatorial 
		profile as vitally important. These include standard schemas such as timeline/chronologies 
		and information hierarchies by theme and sub-theme, as well as more innovative 
		mindmaps as with the <i>Revealing Things</i> (<a href="http://www.si.edu/revealingthings/" target="_blank">http://www.si.edu/revealingthings/</a>) 
		and <i>EMP Digital Collections</i> models (<a href="http://www.emplive.com/" target="_blank">http://www.emplive.com</a>) (Adolsek 
		2001). Additionally the repackaging of information to suit the specific 
		needs of each broad user group profile defined as educators, curators/researchers 
		and general browsers (similar to the <i>Museum of Rural Life</i> model) 
		(<a href="http://www.ruralhistory.org/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.ruralhistory.org/index.html</a>) 
		allows for the user to chose and tailor their experience.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Enriching collection information using both narrative and 
		object-centered histories, according to our research on the curatorial 
		profile, has the potential to extend and enhance collections information 
		for a range of conceptual needs. Exploiting the associative and hyperlinking 
		abilities of the technology in the creation of object-centered histories 
		allows for the layering and exploration of the multiple meanings and contexts 
		of selected objects. Likewise, this method can present and deconstruct 
		the documentation/interpretation process as a post-structuralist, post-modernist 
		text. Furthermore, it invites the user to explore collections in more 
		depth while allowing self-guided interpretations. </p>
	  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="normal">Suggested content included the 
		juxtaposition of subject, disciplinary/cultural perspectives, contexts, 
		information on the use and manufacture of objects and visualizations showing 
		their creation histories. The use of first person voices and quotes, significance 
		statements, curatorial/expert opinions, artists&#39; comments as well as primary 
		source material with supporting documents, images, audio-visual, sound 
		bytes and bibliographic information were seen as ways to expand out the 
		meanings surrounding objects. Allowing the user to put up their own interpretations 
		of this material, according to our research, also supports a constructivist 
		approach to learning. For others, however, it was read as a threat to 
		curatorial authority. These concerns were expressed by one participant 
		and confirmed by others. That is, </span></p>
	  <p class="BlockQuote">&#39;A curator&#39;s authority is threatened when the user can 
		teach and discover thematic relationships for themselves. There is an 
		issue if audiences are invited to construct something without any professional 
		guidance and especially if it goes out into the public domain so we need 
		to be careful about the information they can pull out i.e. privacy and 
		information on people.&#39; <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor"><i>(Cameron &amp; 
		Kenderdine, 2001; 29)</i></span></p>
	  <p class="normal">Most importantly, exposing the nature of museum significance 
		and disciplinary/museum assessment procedures through links to policies 
		and curatorial essays contributes to an understanding by the user of how 
		meaning and value is formulated within the museum context. </p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">Compelling narrative-centered thematic 
		approaches not only allow a means for highlighting the strengths of the 
		collection but, according to this profile, provide a less resource-intensive 
		form of conceptualization. These in tandem with selected zoomable thumbnail 
		images, 3D objects, object movies and prompts to highlight significant 
		points, offer a greater understanding of an object&#39;s form through multiple 
		views and its function and use through movement and sound. Acknowledging 
		sources and the authority and the subject position of collections statements 
		through authoring were seen as vitally important in contributing to the 
		pedagogic usefulness of information. So too were links to current exhibitions 
		related to search results, and theming mechanisms that trigger options 
		to encourage people to go further with their research or visit the institution</span>.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Registrars/Collection Managers user profile</h2>
	  <p class="normal">By contrast, registrars/collection managers are mainly preoccupied 
		with the tasks of acquisition, inventory control and collections documentation. 
		To this end, this group uses databases and online collections on a daily 
		basis to locate, identify, research and date objects. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Here curators and collections managers can agree on one 
		thing — a need to increase the functionality of searching tools. 
		Options include solutions outlined with the curator&#39;s profile. And for 
		those in art museums additional choices comprise searches by date, collection 
		types, media and artist and an alphabetical search by artist/subject. 
		Given that reliable searching is a key need, devices that enhance this 
		process necessarily require the development of tools that both inform 
		and direct. Here informing the searching process can be achieved through 
		the exposition of the scope and breadth of the collection via collection 
		overviews and site maps, and established practices such as thematic highlights 
		with additional and newer searching and browsing mechanisms. To complement 
		this, solutions to direct searching may include graphical representations 
		of browsing pathways and multiple entries to collections information. 
		Furthermore, the ability to store search results via a notebook was also 
		deemed desirable. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Interestingly, content needs specially relate to improving 
		search functionality and hence identification and documentation tasks. 
		And as such, desired content includes zoomable thumbnail images, links 
		to sources, a glossary function, collection percentage statements, copyright 
		information, statements about the exhibition status of objects and language 
		translation facilities. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Teachers and Museum Educators user profile</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Teachers and museum educators are a potentially significant 
		user group. Yet, despite these latent possibilities, collections resources 
		are under-utilized due to problems with computer access, bandwidth and 
		download time. But most significantly, and in many but not all instances, 
		a lack of enriched data precludes the use of such a resource by the profile. 
		Marketing the availability of online collections to this group is also 
		a key issue. Once many of these constraints are surmounted, online collections 
		have the potential to support lesson preparation, learning and student 
		projects about material culture, and to complement school visits.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Ideally educators favored a range of searching/browsing 
		options from tailored thematic trails and intelligent keyword searches 
		to customizable personalization search engines. Here the structuring and 
		navigation of information using traditional hierarchical metaphors similar 
		to a book paradigm and timelines/chronologies as well as mindmaps for 
		visually connecting objects, ideas, metaphors and related themes were 
		deemed to support a range of learning options. Likewise, graphically driven 
		interfaces to search, browse and contextualize collections, while offering 
		an engaging, interactive experience, serve as a departure from catalogued 
		information. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Offering a range of interpretive opportunities and information 
		organizational concepts for students was, according to educators, vitally 
		important to support project work. That is, object-centered histories 
		with links to sources and bibliographic information as outlined previously, 
		with additional significance hierarchies and narrative-centered themes. 
		Other suggestions included the layering of information by complexity to 
		serve a range of information needs, and the creation of action spaces 
		through quizzes and mechanisms to generate suggested thematic trails.</p>
	  <p class="normal">&#39;The more realistic the better&#39; was the feedback we received 
		from educators. Scaled 3D simulations of objects, utilizing multiple views 
		and object movies where students can manipulate digital objects according 
		to their intended use, have the potential to fulfill learning objectives 
		by allowing students to explore the form, construction, texture and use 
		of objects using various senses. Similarly, 3D environments and browsing 
		tools as seen with games technology, have the potential to act as a conduit 
		in the creation of a cultural ambience around collections and to place 
		objects in spatial relationships while creating a narrative format. A 
		strong pedagogic case was put forward by one participant who stated that 
		&#39;this technique is particularly important for younger children as they 
		need to visually explore the connections between objects, contexts and 
		stories&#39; (Cameron &amp; Kenderdine, 2001;30). </p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Non-specialist user profiles</h3>
	  <p class="normal">Lynn Dierking and John Falk (1998) convincingly argued that 
		online visitors to museum websites follow the psychological and demographic 
		profiles of bricks-and mortar museum visitors. More recently the research 
		of Kravchyna and Hastings (2002) on the informational value of museum 
		websites supports and expands on Dierking and Falk&#39;s contention by suggesting 
		that a large proportion of users access online collections and museum 
		websites pre and post visiting the physical site. Yet, a lot more detailed 
		information is needed about this group particularly in a specialized collections 
		context. Despite this, our investigation supports these findings. That 
		is, potential users of online collections are generally museum visitors. 
		Most importantly however, this profile values free choice learning. Additionally, 
		users would potentially access online collections to explore and discover 
		new things and build on their knowledge base, as a form of entertainment 
		if enriched information was available, and to plan visits to museums. 
		Significantly, the belief in the inherent integrity of information a museum 
		web site has to offer was also a motivating factor in accessing online 
		collections. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Due to the diversity of the profile, a range of experiences 
		from simple searching and browsing tools, and content for the inexperienced, 
		to sophisticated challenging tools for the initiated, delivering complex 
		rich media to support a range of learning and entertaining needs was deemed 
		essential. Here, the delivery of these experiences as well as personalization 
		could potentially be achieved through user/task profiles and the future 
		use of searching agents to define profile, mood and required experience. 
	  </p>
	  <p class="normal">Younger members of the group preferred browsing options 
		above specific searches. More specifically, their interest was in semantic 
		structures of 3D space as an exploratory medium, whereby concepts such 
		as personalization, theme generator tools and spatial associative concepts 
		such as mindmaps with magazine style interfaces, visual prompts and interactivity 
		were preferred methods to explore and convey information. Here, a younger 
		member of the group put forward a persuasive argument for the use of 3D 
		semantic structures as a tool to enhance the interpretive and communication 
		potential of collections where &#39;you see relationships and the way they 
		change and interact using the metaphor of 3D spaceÖonce you use the metaphor 
		of 3D spaces the visualization could be 2D —doesn&#39;t matter you have 
		the semantic there&#39; (Cameron &amp; Kenderdine, 2001; 30). </p>
	  <p class="normal">Surprisingly, this group was less interested in prescribed 
		material, choosing to drive their own pathways through collections and 
		to explore object-centered narratives with rich streaming media, 3D objects 
		and visual environments as both a content and delivery tool. By contrast, 
		older participants preferred traditional exhibition metaphors for structuring 
		information and familiar classifications such as collection overviews 
		with keyword searches, thematic structures, chronologies/timelines, linear 
		browsing pathways and searches under known categories. As one contributor 
		pointed out, &#39;these techniques are so simple they are like eating sponge, 
		but there is nothing wrong with eating sponge&#39; (Themescapes Focus Group, 
		Non-Specialists, 2001; 5).</p>
	  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="normal">We now have some valuable data 
		on the needs and preferences of diverse users and requirements for Indigenous 
		collections. So how can content needs be realized through the acquisition 
		and documentation process for the next generation of digital collections 
		and knowledge environments? What new knowledge models are required, and 
		what are the implications for existing knowledge creation and documentation 
		practices in museums? </span></p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">New Knowledge models — the transformative process 
	  </h1>
	  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="normal">Arguably, the transformation of 
		databases from documentation tools to effective and sustainable &#39;knowledge 
		environments&#39; starts at the documentation level. Collections management 
		databases are the primary means in which museums document and interpret 
		their collections. And more importantly, these tools form the starting 
		point by which museums define and communicate the significance and heritage 
		value of collections (Robinson &amp; Cameron 2003:3). Prominent museological 
		scholar Gaynor Kavangah (1990;10) acknowledges that it is at the individual 
		object records that conventional and totalizing practices take root. Yet 
		despite this, there needs to be a sustained consideration, beyond technological 
		innovation, to pragmatic concerns arising from current acquisition and 
		documentation practices and data quality. Coupled with this, a consolidated 
		response is required to recent postmodern epistemological, disciplinary 
		and museological debates about knowledge making and meaning construction 
		and how current collections information relates to, and revisions these 
		themes. At this juncture, an opportunity exists to embrace the opportunity 
		for change (Robinson &amp; Cameron 2003:3). That is, to reconceptualize 
		new knowledge models and streamline the content of collections management 
		databases in line with contemporary theoretical, pedagogic and public 
		access concerns (Ibid). Drawing on some preliminary observations from 
		the <i>Knowledge Objects</i> project, the following considerations have 
		been enumerated as critical to the transformative process. </span></p>

	  </ul>
	  <p class="SubHeader">Resource issues.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Most significantly, all these considerations also have implications 
		for documentation procedures. That is, the types and ways information 
		is gathered and documented by curators and collection managers. Leading 
		on from this are more practical concerns about how meaning making is created 
		around collections and the resultant implications for staff roles and 
		tasks. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Maximizing existing and enriched data</h2>
	  <p class="normal">At the most basic level, in the creation of new &#39;knowledge 
		environments&#39;, there needs to be a consideration of how information such 
		as fielded data can be structured and coded in new ways. Equally important 
		is the manner in which museums can maximize the use of enriched data through 
		cross-linking and filtering to different collection records. This represents 
		a strategy to improving the interpretive potential of collections. </p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Beyond description</h3>
	  <p class="normal">Recent documentation practices have witnessed a trend away 
		from long descriptions to significance statements. Interestingly, these 
		foreground a shift in documentation from the predominately empiricist 
		tradition based on the physicality of objects. Originally written to justify 
		acquisitions to management, there needs to be a further consideration 
		of how these statements can be written in a compelling way for audiences. 
		Rather, curators need to consider the writing of text in the context of 
		constructivist approaches to learning.</p>
	  <p class="normal">But more importantly how can the information and practical 
		needs of curators, users, and the theoretical imperatives brought about 
		by post-structuralist, postmodern and museological debates be feasibly 
		tethered to documentation practices, and in the creation of new knowledge 
		models and environments? </p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">The impact of post-structuralist and postmodern 
		paradigms</h3>
	  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="normal">First, the impact of post-structuralist 
		and postmodern paradigms in knowledge creation and understanding, as seen 
		through our research and trends in scholarly thinking, fundamentally challenges 
		and undermines traditional concepts about the truth-value of empirically 
		based forms of knowledge. In this discursive context, material collections 
		are no longer given privileged standing. That is, where a definitive meaning 
		of the past is deemed to lie dormant in material objects exposed through 
		empirical forms of observation, description and measurement and where 
		one narrative, an interpretation of an object usurps all others. According 
		to the empiricist tradition, documentation as a process is viewed as the 
		collation of self-evident data rather than a subjective form of interpretation 
		on the part of the curator as might be argued from a post- modernist&#39;s 
		position (Robinson &amp; Cameron 2003:20). Current disciplinary classification, 
		descriptions, anonymous statements of significance and provenance have 
		their genesis in the empiricist tradition. Additionally, in documentation 
		there is an underlying view that object descriptive data, the &#39;cold hard 
		facts&#39; such as measurements and visual form, and meaning created through 
		subsequent interpretive text, are two distinct fields (Robinson &amp; 
		Cameron 2003:23). That is, the former is an objective act, and the latter, 
		subjective in nature. Instead, these practices invite a re-examination 
		and the exposure of the discursive nature of museum objects as &#39;factual&#39; 
		statements about events and people, the nature of descriptive and interpretive 
		data as intrinsically subjective and biased, and the ways they are used 
		to substantiate knowledge about the past in collections documentation. 
		</span></p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Incorporating theoretical principles in practices 
		and procedures</h3>
	  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="normal">So how do we get collections documentation 
		up to speed with current knowledge making? Here museums over recent years 
		have been confronted with a difficult challenge. That is, to provide a 
		conceptual structure and order to disparate collections at a documentation 
		level, to acknowledge and utilize previous investments but to also engage 
		a growing community of users. But more importantly how can postmodern 
		and post-structuralist discursive principles about the role of objects 
		as polysemic, holding plural, cross-disciplinary meanings, alternative 
		and sometimes conflicting, be incorporated into documentation? Also how 
		can the meaning of narratives and classification systems be acknowledged 
		as products of cultural, disciplinary, museum and curatorial opinion? 
		Furthermore, in a postmodern context where disciplinary privilege and 
		hierarchies disappear, how can interpretive authority be shared with users? 
		</span></p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Addressing the concreteness of collections</h3>
	  <p class="normal">The first task is to address issues around the concreteness 
		of objects and their interpretations. Interestingly our research suggests 
		that collections items and information must also be considered as a growing 
		and evolving body of knowledge rather than a definitive or quintessential 
		set of facts. A science and technology curator at the Powerhouse Museum 
		noted this point and stated that &#39;there is the realization that while 
		writing, a curator is creating an ëartifact&#39; of that time, place and social 
		context&#39; (Robinson &amp; Cameron, 2003;26). So here we need to present 
		collections and information as temporarily situated expert opinions through 
		authoring and dating. </p>
	  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="normal">Additionally we also need to instill 
		a reflexive consciousness among curators of the limited legitimacy and 
		lifespan of collections information (Robinson &amp; Cameron, 2003; 23). 
		To this end, collections information needs to be revised from time to 
		time within available resources.</span></p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Exposing interpretive frameworks</h3>
	  <p class="normal">The second task is to expose the epistemological/disciplinary 
		frameworks in which objects are interpreted, to explain the fact that 
		object interpretations change and as such should no longer be presented 
		as definitive accounts carrying the ultimate authority. For example these 
		postmodern principles could be shown through disclaimers, authored text 
		and linked curatorial essays about disciplinary contexts outlining the 
		types of information privileged in each domain and how each contributes 
		to our understanding of collections. Furthermore, exposing the nature 
		of museum significance assessment procedures and links to museum collecting 
		policies foregrounds the institutions&#39; role in meaning making. </p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Promoting plurality of meaning </h3>
	  <p class="normal">Third, museums need to capitalize on a plurality of meaning 
		inherent in collection items, rather than favoring one interpretation. 
		Postmodernist principles suggest that an object&#39;s meaning and classification 
		is not self evident nor singular, but is imposed on an object by a range 
		of influences once inducted into the museum (Robinson &amp; Cameron, 2003;11). 
		So how can these issues be acknowledged and dealt with in documentation? 
		Most basically this involves the rethinking of the relationships and meanings 
		of collections in tandem with an understanding of the limitations of current 
		approaches to knowledge making. The specific conceptual and disciplinary 
		frameworks of art history, social history, science, decorative arts, anthropology 
		and the institutional tradition curators work within, as well as the individual 
		standpoints of museum staff determine the types of questions asked of 
		objects. This then establishes the types of information documented and 
		privileged in significance statements, and the subsequent values and meanings 
		ascribed to individual collection items, thereby narrowing their potential 
		interpretative possibilities. </p>
	  <p class="normal">For example a social historian may focus on the use, context 
		and the personal significance of an object to the owner or user. In contrast, 
		a decorative arts curator may note its form, function and material, how 
		it fits into a chronological stylistic framework, the artist/maker and 
		its history of ownership. A technology curator on the other hand could 
		look at the same object in terms of how it is manufactured, its degree 
		of technological innovation, function and how it works. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Our research also revealed the personal and idiosyncratic 
		predilections, goals and interests an individual curator may consciously 
		and tacitly bring to bear on the analysis and documentation of objects 
		(Robinson &amp; Cameron, 2003;19). That is, the task of object interpretation 
		is a dialogic and organic process where various influences come into play 
		and intermingle (Ibid;19). One participant in the decorative arts focus 
		group discussion at the Powerhouse Museum succinctly espoused the feelings 
		of others by stating that &#39;curators cast interpretations from different 
		backgrounds and some objects have more to offer&#39; (Robinson &amp; Cameron, 
		2003;36).</p>
	  <p class="normal">But although many curators we interviewed were aware of 
		the current discursive contexts of objects, appreciated the merits of 
		other disciplinary interpretative frameworks and experiment with integrating 
		themes in exhibitions, this process has been slow to be applied to documentation. 
		So how do we reconcile these information needs, revise the types of questions 
		asked of collections, contribute to their broader understanding and create 
		a useful resource? This could involve collaborations between departments/curators 
		to discuss potential meanings and the significance of selected objects, 
		and the writing of joint significance statements to expose a range of 
		meanings and opinions across disciplinary areas. In procedural terms this 
		involves pulling frameworks together while expanding the potential meanings 
		of objects. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Our research also raised a very important point about the 
		problem of &#34;conceptual fit&#34; between existing object meanings 
		and classification schemes and highlighted the difficulty of prescribing 
		categories that can be applied universally (Cameron 2000). This was particularly 
		obvious when we investigated issues around access to and the documentation 
		of Maori and Aboriginal collections. That is, museums currently require 
		the user to accept the institutional way of organizing information and 
		the meanings ascribed to objects. </p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Enabling a polysemic and shared authoritative 
		approach</h3>
	  <p class="normal">So how can a polysemic and shared authoritative approach 
		be applied in documentation? Here a new knowledge model invites the opportunity 
		to create categories and associated linkages through documentation that 
		could potentially connect objects with a whole range of cultural, social, 
		historical, technological, artistic and disciplinary contexts. In conceptual 
		terms, this involves the virtual layering of meanings and contexts of 
		objects that can subsequently be configured in different ways in a live 
		environment. Establishing relationships between objects on the basis of 
		extended fields and additional ontologies could form the basis of retrieval 
		methods. However, developing concepts on how this metadata is to be handled 
		and standardized will continue to be an important issue. </p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Extending thesauri, nomenclatures and glossaries</h3>
	  <p class="normal">Fourth, problems of conceptual structure and naming need 
		to be dealt with in documentation. Ensuring greater intellectual access 
		to collections and enriched data means extending existing thesauri, nomenclatures 
		and glossaries. Most basically, this needs to occur during the documentation 
		process in order to create a broader range of search and naming options 
		thus contributing to and expanding interpretive options.</p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Use of non-text based information</h3>
	  <p class="normal">And the fifth task involves addressing the emerging interest 
		in the contextualization of objects and their non-textual representation. 
		There is a trend, demonstrated through the <i>Knowledge Objects</i> project, 
		away from detailed descriptions and primary text based provenanced information 
		in documentation to a greater use of non-text based evidence in supporting 
		multiple interpretive strategies. Here we need to consider how objects 
		can be documented at acquisition, especially those deemed the most significant, 
		in ways that capture a range of information. For example, this could include 
		the digital recording of significance through comments by makers, users 
		and donors and of objects in use. The documentation of the pre-museum 
		context of objects will become increasingly useful. </p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Drawing on the wider information assets to best 
		advantage</h3>
	  <p class="normal">In Donovan&#39;s formative paper (1998) he convincingly argued 
		for the building of knowledge bases drawing together the wider information 
		assets of a museum into a centralized resource. The next task is to consider 
		how existing museum data can be put to more productive ends in the documentation 
		and interpretive process. Research files, documents, recorded interviews, 
		graphics, audio/visuals, publications, interactives, and educational materials 
		are all currently held in separate files and collections. Furthermore, 
		in the future all these components could be indexed, managed and delivered 
		by database tools while contributing to the creation of relational thematic 
		linkages, multimedia presentations and rich research resources. But the 
		challenge of delivering multimedia within the context of constantly evolving 
		digital platforms will continue to have major implications for the ways 
		in which collections information can be preserved, accessed, configured 
		and interpreted into the future. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Additionally, the emergence of more creative content environments, 
		in particular 3D visualizations and multimodal sensory experiences to 
		which this material will contribute, are expected to become cheaper and 
		more persuasive. In a collections context, this could potentially lead 
		to the creation of complex cultural interpretations such as highly detailed 
		and dynamic visualizations and navigation environments that have strong 
		popular appeal. However, as Scali and Tariffi (2001) argued, the rethinking 
		of collection management and multimedia delivery systems to provide effective 
		access to such multimedia content will have major implications on how 
		collections information can be configured and elucidated.</p>
	  <p class="normal">To conclude, a shift from the predominant use of highly 
		prescribed authored information, text based descriptions and significance 
		statements to a greater inclusion of interpretive materials around selected 
		significant objects will involve new curatorial roles. Curators may become 
		more involved in bringing together and linking forms of evidence, for 
		example creating relationships between information and objects similar 
		to an exhibitions paradigm. Likewise, the tasks of collection managers 
		may witness a greater emphasis on creating and linking digital resources. 
		Instead, this will ensure a more open and inclusive approach to the ways 
		these materials can be interpreted, giving greater power to the user to 
		create their own knowledge pathways and to make their own interpretations 
		in a kind of shared authorship. While this will undoubtedly require greater 
		effort and resources in compiling each individual record, it will simultaneously 
		allow a greater depth to knowledge woven around a given object, thereby 
		maximizing its meaning potential (Robinson &amp; Cameron, 2003; 23). One 
		answer to the problem of workload is to institute a program of documentation 
		where deemed significant objects get prior standing. Others however could 
		be recorded according to a more simplistic polysemic template where hyperlinks 
		in documentation are used as the primary tool in the creation of relationships 
		and to link sources. Above all these concerns, moreover, such practices 
		correspond and embrace contemporary theoretical premises, that is, the 
		recognition that objects are legitimately interpretable in a variety of 
		ways (Ibid). This new way of curatorial thinking was aptly expressed by 
		a participant in the science and technology focus group discussion, &#39;As 
		a curator, I would define myself as a &#39;knowledge broker&#39;: we have to be 
		aware of notions of pluralism and acknowledge the lack of singular authority 
		of the museum or curator&#39; (Robinson &amp; Cameron, 2003:26).</p>
	  <p class="normal">So the <i>Themescaping Virtual Collections</i> and the <i>Knowledge 
		Objects</i> projects have revealed some possible directions for the next 
		generation of online collections and documentation. It looks exciting 
		but one of our greatest issues is the tension between the potential richness 
		collections have to offer and the relatively poorly resourced institutions 
		we work within. This issue, first raised at the Digital Libraries Research 
		for Access to Cultural and Scientific Resources meeting in Luxembourg 
		in March 2000 (IST European Commission, 2000) will continue to be the 
		single biggest defining matter in the future development of digital collections 
		and knowledge environments.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Nonetheless, developing knowledge bases and other potential 
		futures such as interoperable libraries of collections (Besser 2002) and 
		collaborative knowledge spaces (Fleishman et al 2002) can be viewed as 
		an incremental process occurring through the establishment of a program 
		of iterative development. Yet convincing management of the educational 
		and marketing value of such initiatives, and to commit substantial resources 
		to relevant projects will be one of our most fundamental strategic issues 
		for the future.</p>
