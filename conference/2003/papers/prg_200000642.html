		<p class="PaperTitle">A cooperative experience: the Boí valley gateway</p>
		<p class="Author">César Carreras, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, 
		  Spain </p>
		<p class="URL"><a href="http://oliba.uoc.es/boi/portal" target="_blank">http://oliba.uoc.es/boi/portal</a></p>
		<p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract </p>
		<p class="AbstractText">The Boi valley gateway is a joint project between 
		  different Museums, institutions and Universities of Catalonia (Spain) 
		  with the aim to create a virtual environment to include all the Cultural 
		  Heritage of this small Pyrenees valley. The gateway is not only a potential 
		  resource for cultural tourism, but also an art and history resource 
		  for secondary schools and universities as well as a mean of communication 
		  for the local community.</p>
		<p class="keywords">Keywords: Gateway, virtual, cultural, heritage, multimedia, 
		  cooperation</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
		<p class="normal">The project of the Boi valley gateway started in 2001, 
		  and at the present the first stage of the project is completely finished. 
		  Perhaps, this is the most challenging project that the group Òliba 
		  has undertaken so far, not only for its dimension related to contents, 
		  theoretical concept and multimedia applications, but also the number 
		  of institutions and individuals coordinated. Since May 2002, a first 
		  version in Catalan and Spanish is accessible through <a href="http://oliba.uoc.es/boi/portal" target="_blank">http://oliba.uoc.es/boi/portal</a>, and 
		  hopefully an English version will be available by summer 2003. </p>
		<p class="normal">One of the most outstanding aspects of this project is, 
		  without doubts, the definition of a model of virtual platform for the 
		  dissemination of cultural and natural heritage from a very small community 
		  in the Pyrenees faraway  from the main technological and economic centers 
		  of the country. Boi is a small valley of hardly 18 Kms long near to 
		  the Arán valley (Lérida, Spain), with less than 600 inhabitants, which 
		  enjoys one of the most exceptional group of Romanesque churches in our 
		  country. That is why it was selected in November 2000 as one of the 
		  UNESCO World Heritage (<a href="http://whc.unesco.org/sites/988.htm" target="_blank">http://whc.unesco.org/sites/988.htm</a>).</p>
		<p class="normal">Furthermore, the project allows us, in a virtual format, 
		  to present objects and structures that nowadays are located in other 
		  Museums and institutions outside the valley (such as National Museum 
		  of Art of Catalonia, Diocesan Museum of Lleida and Diocesan Museum of 
		  Vic). Therefore, the virtual platform is used here to unite again the 
		  Boi valley heritage in a unique place. Besides, the virtual platform 
		  is understood as a meeting point for people interested in Romanesque 
		  art and Medieval history, a mean of communication for the local community 
		  and an educative resource for students of secondary schools and universities, 
		  as well as visitors and tourists (Carreras, 2002). </p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">The gateway project </h1>
		<p class="normal">The project began in spring 2000, when the group Òliba 
		  got in contact with the Boi valley Tourist Board to present together 
		  a proposal for a grant of our autonomous government CIRIT (ACOM-2000) 
		  with the aim to develop research and applications in distant regions 
		  from the research and university centers of the country. One of the 
		  main dangers of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is that 
		  it may unbalance even more differences between territories due to lack 
		  of infrastructures and quality access to networks. Despite that ICT 
		  can break space and time barrier, a more social applications of this 
		  technology are still required to help overcome present inequalities.</p>
		<p class="normal">In these days, Barruera city council, as representative 
		  of the Boi valley, had presented to UNESCO its candidature as World 
		  Heritage, for the artistic value of its Romanesque churches. In October 
		  2000 the project was confirmed thanks to the grant of CIRIT (ACOM-2000-026), 
		  and weeks later, the Boi valley was nominated as World Heritage, so 
		  it was the right to employ the gateway to help a better dissemination, 
		  formation and comprehension of the Natural and Cultural heritage of 
		  the valley. As far as we are aware, there is only a similar initiative 
		  in the Loire valley, <a href="http://www.cdv.berkeley.edu/research/Val_de_Loire" target="_blank">http://www.cdv.berkeley.edu/research/Val_de_Loire</a> 
		  (Ceccarelli, Addison and Strickland, 2001).</p>
		<p class="normal">Which were the initial objectives of the project of creating 
		  a virtual gateway in Internet?</p>
	  </div>
	  <ol>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithnumbers"><span class="normal">The Boi valley, despite 
			of all the heritage treasures, nowadays does not have any Museum or 
			Interpretation center, though in the future will be one at Erill la 
			Vall, that may help the visit to all the people interested in the 
			Historic, Artistic and Natural heritage of the valley. Most emblematic 
			objects are kept in city Museums of Barcelona (MNAC) or other urban 
			centers in Catalonia, so faraway from their historic and architectural 
			original context. Therefore, the creation of a virtual space in which 
			objects and historical facts are put together in their geographical 
			context may help to an educative visit to the Boi valley. </span></div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithnumbers"><span class="normal"> The virtual space looks 
			forward to becoming a meeting point for every kind of people, from 
			specialists in heritage related to Boi valley to tourists who may 
			unknown its treasures. According to users profile and personal interests 
			different itineraries and navigation hierarchies will be created, 
			from a general to a deeper way, one including basic knowledge whereas 
			the other may provide a detailed account.</span></div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithnumbers"><span class="normal"> Natural and artistic 
			heritage treasures may be in danger with mass tourism, therefore the 
			virtual resource wishes to make people aware of the heritage fragility. 
			Visitors themselves should be responsible of a correct treatment of 
			this heritage and help to maintain and preserve it, in other words 
			keep the identity signs of the valley. As the own UNESCO says: &#39;<i>Memory 
			is vital to creativity: that holds true for individuals and for peoples, 
			who find in their heritage -natural and cultural, tangible and intangible-
			 the key to their identity and source of their inspiration</i>&#39;.</span></div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="listwithnumbers"><span class="normal"> People of diverse Catalan 
			institutions interested in the valley heritage have been involved 
			in the creation of this gateway, as well as the local people. Actually, 
			some sections are exclusively managed by people from local institutions 
			(i.e. Tourism Board, Aigüestortes Natural Park, Pont de Suert 
			secondary school). Thereby, they employ information technologies to 
			disseminate their activities and they are main characters of the conservation 
			project.</span></div>
		</li>
		<li><span class="normal"> On the other hand, the space is considered also 
		  an educative resource for primary and secondary scholars as university 
		  undergraduates, who wish to learn more about medieval history and Romanesque 
		  art, Pyrenees ethnography or natural heritage. They can learn in an 
		  interactive way about not only the Boi valley, but also medieval Catalonia 
		  and Middles Ages in Western Europe.</span></li>

	  </div>
	  <div class="Section1">
<p class="normal">The gateway has a unique design, though parts of the contents 
		  are hosted in different servers. Perhaps, this feature is a new experience 
		  of decentralized source of information, managing each institution the 
		  contents closer to it. There is a wide variety of degrees of collaboration 
		  of institutions and enterprises. Some of them administer the contents 
		  of one section, while others provide texts or images from their collections. 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">Physically, the web contents nowadays are hosted in 3 
		  or 4 servers, one administered by Aigüestortes National Park, other 
		  by Pont de Suert secondary school, a third one by the Boi valley Tourism 
		  Board and the last one by group Òliba in UOC. Such flexibility 
		  allows an easy contents update using a series common structures and 
		  templates. There are some sections in the gateway that will remain unchanged 
		  in the future, whereas other will evolve all over the time. </p>
		<p class="normal">Apart from the four institutions which co-manage the project, 
		  now there are other collaborators such as: IEC (Institut d&#39;Estudis Catalans), 
		  Enciclopédia Catalana, Dortoka, MNAC (Museu Nacional d&#39;Art de 
		  Catalunya), Consell Comarcal de l&#39;Alta Ribagorça, ENDESA-FECSA, 
		  Museu Etnològic de Barcelona, Arxiu Mas, Televisióde Catalunya 
		  (TV3) and Generalitat de Catalunya. </p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Gateway structure</h1>
		<p class="normal">Following a general order, the gateway consists of 7 basic 
		  sections:</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Valley History (responsible group Òliba 
		  - UOC)</h2>
		<p class="normal">In order to understand the value of Boi Romanesque&#39;s churches, 
		  one needs to know a bit of the history of the people that built them. 
		  Therefore, an introduction to the XI and XII centuries in the Pyrenees 
		  is required as well as mention to institutions, economy, politics and 
		  the most important families (i.e. lords of Erill). In the whole section, 
		  there is information about other constructions such as castles, or churches 
		  in a very bad state. Since the history of Boi valley can be hardly understood 
		  with independence of the history of Catalonia and the Middle Ages in 
		  Western Europe (i.e. Carlemagne), apart from the local history there 
		  are 2 general named Historical Context and History of Catalonia.</p>
		<p class="normal">Contents of those sections have been carried out by lecturers 
		  and students of our University, with the support of companies and institutions 
		  such as Enciclopédia Catalana, el Museu Nacional d&#39;Art de Catalunya 
		  and Boi valley Tourism Board. A last section is kept for <b>monographic 
		  studies</b>, in which very particular aspects of the local history are 
		  covered (p.e. Roda bishopry, lords of Erill, the legend of Bernat I 
		  or the archaeology of Santa Eulàlia de Erill la vall). These 
		  studies are currently undertaken by students and specialists from the 
		  UOC and IEC (Institut d&#39;Estudis Catalans) and Museu Nacional d&#39;Art de 
		  Catalunya (MNAC).</p>
		<p class="normal">At technical level, this section attempts to take fully 
		  advantage of the hypertext format that allows to relate blocks of information 
		  (Carreras, 2000). In this section a as a whole, there are a myriad of 
		  links related to information nodes of other sections, even transversal 
		  ones. Navigation to know the most representative buildings of the valley 
		  comes from a clickable map with two options: churches also shared by 
		  the section Artistic Heritage, and other by castles. However, navigation 
		  through the most relevant families in the valley comes from a genealogic 
		  tree. </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Artistic Heritage (responsible group Òliba)</h2>
		<p class="normal">This section follows a similar structure to the one created 
		  for Valley history, with a subsection on the Art from the valley, as 
		  well as two other subsections to put it in context: Romanesque Art in 
		  Catalonia and Romanesque Art. Of course, there are some concepts such 
		  as iconography or aesthetics, which require a careful reading of medieval 
		  church writers of that period, and discussions between schools (i.e. 
		  iconoclast revolt); that is why they are commented in detail.</p>
		<p class="normal">Finally, there is also a section of <b>monographic s</b>tudies, 
		  in which some works of art from Boi valley are analyzed thoroughly, 
		  such as frescoes from the churches of Sant Climent or Santa Maria de 
		  Taüll. This is open space for future contributions, whereas the other 
		  three subsections are considered completely finished.</p>
		<p class="normal">At technical level, the whole section is intermingled 
		  the History one in order not to replicate contents and favors the interrelationship 
		  between concepts and information. Besides, there are numerous links 
		  to transversal section of glossary, which includes special artistic 
		  terms related to medieval techniques, and probably unknown by most people.  
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="normal">Connected to this section, a virtual 
		  reconstruction of the church of Sant Climent de Taüll was created (look 
		  at the comment below) that allows a navigation through inside and outside 
		  the building.  One can navigate even through the belfry, which shows 
		  a present panoramic view from the top. A series of hotspots are included 
		  in the virtual reconstruction at architectural elements, objects and 
		  panoramic, from which one can access to definitions or other parts of 
		  the hypertext. </span> </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Natural Heritage (responsible Aigüestortes 
		  National Park)</h2>
		<p class="normal"> This section gives direct access to a website already 
		  created by the Aigüestortes National Park, in which a myriad of possible 
		  excursions around Aigüestortes are explained as well as diverse activities 
		  offered by the Park, including descriptions of wildlife and plants. 
		  The whole administration of this section lies on the Park, so they update 
		  contents from their own server at the Conselleria de Medi Ambient de 
		  la Generalitat.</p>
		<p class="normal">The gateway is, in this case, an interface that make easy 
		  the task of putting together some isolated resources, so moving from 
		  one to the other becomes really simple. Normally, a potential visitor 
		  of the valley apart from enjoying a special natural environment, may 
		  be interested in other documentation for other kinds of activities, 
		  who may carry out while he or she is here. Therefore, the gateway facilitates 
		  this interconnection.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Towns (responsible group Òliba and Tourist 
		  Board)</h2>
		<p class="normal">This section pretends to describe each of the Boi valley 
		  villages, with a basic file including the most outstanding features. 
		  It also shows the demographic evolution of these villages over the centuries 
		  with the last migration movements and internal growth. A last subsection 
		  include a series of videoclips provided by the Catalan TV (TV3) that 
		  show some representative landscapes of the valley, its people and villages.</p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"><img src="carreras_figure2.jpg" width="400" height="255"/></p>
		<p class="MsoCaption">Figure 2. A detail of the section of Ethnologic heritage 
		</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Ethnologic Heritage (responsibility of the 
		  Tourist Board)</h2>
		<p class="normal">Perhaps this is the section that has more potential, but 
		  still now lacks a definitive structure. At the beginning, it was looked 
		  for an anthropologist from another Catalan University who may become 
		  responsible for the section. However, the possible candidates refused 
		  the offer, so we assumed ourselves eventually the first version. Therefore, 
		  the first version of this section is a common work between the Tourist 
		  Board and the group grup Òliba, though the Tourist Board will 
		  be responsible in the future. </p>
		<p class="normal">The aim of this section was to recover memories of feasts, 
		  costums and food of the people of valley, which will be lost in the 
		  future. It was thought that their virtual exhibition in this website 
		  will favor their preservation. The space consists of 4 subsections: 
		  Feasts, Food, Photographic archive and Memories. </p>
		<p class="normal">The subsection Photographic archive pretends to recover 
		  old pictures of the Boi valley from the early XXth century, which are 
		  in particular collections and archives of different parts of the country. 
		  There are very relevant collections such as the one of CEC (Centre Excursionista 
		  de Catalunya - Climbing Catalan club) that show the evolution of the 
		  human landscape and changes produced by the construction of roads. Besides, 
		  the images from the photographic archive of ENHER (Electric company), 
		  before mid 50s, when the company began to build numerous dams in the 
		  Pyrenees, which affected completely the economic life of this region. 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">Another impressive collection is kept in the Museu Etnològic 
		  de Barcelona (Ethnologic Museum of Barcelona), that covers pictures 
		  taken also in the 50s about popular festivals. However, the most outstanding 
		  pictures come from the Mas archive, which is a particular collection 
		  of a professional photographer of the early XXth century. He went to 
		  an expedition to the Pyrenees in the 20s, together with ethnographers 
		  and art historians from the Institut d&#39;Estudis Catalans, who rediscovered 
		  the Romanesque churches and their frescoes that were unknown by most 
		  until then. </p>
		<p class="normal">Finally, the section Memories collects registered audios, 
		  videos or texts with memories of elder people from the valley, who are 
		  willing to explain how was life in the past. Conservation of such memories 
		  is nowadays a priority from the Tourist Board, and the creation of this 
		  gateway will mean a boost for it. </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Tourism (responsibility of the Tourist Board)</h2>
		<p class="normal">A website for tourism in the Boi valley already existed 
		  (<a href="http://www.vallboi.com/" target="_blank">http://www.vallboi.com</a>), which provided basic 
		  information for any visitor coming to the valley. Apart from a small 
		  introduction on the artistic and natural heritage of the valley, most 
		  part of this site caters with accommodation addresses, from hotels to 
		  rural houses or camping, as well as restaurants or other leisure places. 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">The website now is part of the gateway as a whole, in 
		  fact is the section named Tourism. It stills covers a briefing of the 
		  main natural and cultural attractions of the valley, but most of section 
		  is intended to supply any kind of information that a visitor may need.  
		  The Tourist Board manages this section from its own server, whose data 
		  should be updated constantly. Besides, the Tourism sections can be directly 
		  accessed through the old Internet address (<a href="http://www.vallboi.com/" target="_blank">http://www.vallboi.com</a>), with the only difference 
		  that a frame below will permit access to the other sections of the gateway.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Life in the Valley (responsibility of the Secondary 
		  School of Pont de Suert)</h2>
		<p class="normal">One of the initial aims of this gateway was, from the 
		  beginning, a space for exchange of information, in which local use it 
		  as their own mean of communication. For this reason, a special section 
		  was created known as <b>Life in the valley</b>, where one might include 
		  any news and activities of the everyday life in the local community. 
		  Some news may have an intrest for a wide public (i.e. discovery of new 
		  frescoes in Sant Climent, Mushrooms festival), while others should affect 
		  only the local community and relatives who live away in many other places. 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">It was thought that the creation and management of this 
		  space could lie on Pont de Suert secondary school as part of learning 
		  process of students and even teachers. Therefore, it was an highly attractive 
		  way to incorporate new technologies, as well as their labour, economic 
		  and social potentials for youngsters of this region. At the start, a 
		  minimum level of creation and management of web pages was required. 
		  So we, the Department of Humanitites of UOC, are currently preparing 
		  some presencial and distance-learning courses for teachers and students 
		  in the institute. In fact, the courses were due in spring 2002, but 
		  there have been some delays.</p>
		<p class="normal">Afterwards, a series of HTML templates (updated with Dreamweaver 
		  or Front Page) were defined in order to put new contents for the section, 
		  as well as a standard procedure to treat images. Contents may be of 
		  the kind of press news, which can be also include in the section News, 
		  or more elaborated works. Actually, it is pretended that some students 
		  works may become accessible by Internet (i.e. maquis guerrilla in the 
		  valley in the 40s). By these means, it can be fostered the students 
		  creativity and favor their multimedia design.</p>
		<p class="normal">This section, and the project in general, was well received 
		  by all the team of teachers from the secondary school, believing the 
		  positive consequences that it will bring. Besides, the project will 
		  allow teachers and students from these distance Pyrenees valleys to 
		  be in touch with the last developments in multimedia technologies.</p>

		<p class="MsoCaption">Figure 3. A view of a virtual reconstruction of Sant 
		  Climent de Taül</p>
		<p class="normal">Together with those main sections, there are a group of 
		  transversal sections that makes easy the access to very specific information. 
		  Therefore, the gateway contains the following transversal sections:</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmaller">a) WWW on medieval period</h3>
		<p class="normal">For anyone who wishes to know more about Romanesque art 
		  in our country and abroad, here you can access to an English gateway 
		  that contains plentiful resources on the Middle Ages.  </p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmaller">b) Mediateca</h3>
		<p class="normal">Here you got a direct access to all the audio, video and 
		  virtual reality resources of this website. Thereby, it becomes easy 
		  to find the desired resources, chiefly for the multimedia applications 
		  lovers.</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmaller">c) Virtual reality</h3>
		<p class="normal">It was attempted to experiment with Virtual reality (3D 
		  models) and its beauty, in order that the user could interact with a 
		  singular architectural building, in this case a Romanesque church. Normally, 
		  virtual reconstructions reproduce buildings in bad state, that have 
		  disappeared or future projects. However, the present reconstruction 
		  of the church of Sant Climent de Taüll corresponds to a real existing 
		  building, so it gives any room for interpretation or imagination. </p>
		<p class="normal">Reproduction in this case should be as real as possible, 
		  in order that the own inhabitants of the valley could feel that the 
		  VR represented their Romanesque church. Moreover, since it was design 
		  as didactic resource, it allows navigation inside and outside the church, 
		  as well as consulting hotspots with definitions of architectural elements. 
		  The virtual reconstruction consists of three united parts: one extern 
		  view of the church, other inside view with many hotspots, and a third 
		  one of the belfry with a wide panorama. </p>
		<p class="normal">Since it is one of the most outstanding resources in the 
		  Boi valley gateway, there are numerous pages from which it can be accessed 
		  such as News, Mediateca, Tourism, History, and even its own transversal 
		  section.</p>
		<p class="normal">For anybody who has not visited yet this church, the reconstruction 
		  should be attractive enough to encourage people to come. As you may 
		  see, the church was made with a lot of detail thanks to great number 
		  of pictures. Virtual reality was created with Quick Time Virtual Reality 
		  and it is offered in two versions: one to view on-line with less definition 
		  and a second one, to be downloaded in order to navigate locally. Finally, 
		  a third version has been made available in Live Picture.</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmaller">d) Glossary</h3>
		<p class="normal">As many other of our websites, there is a transversal 
		  section for a specialized glossary, which contains specific terms of 
		  history and art that appear in the correspondent sections.</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmaller">e) Map</h3>
		<p class="normal">It is a map to make easier the access to people that wish 
		  to come to the Boi valley.</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmaller">f) News</h3>
		<p class="normal">In the front page of the gateway, a series of 4 or 5 periodic 
		  news on the valley life are placed. Actually, these news are the most 
		  outstanding facts of the local peoples everyday life (i.e. stories, 
		  festivals...)</p>
		<p class="normal">Anyone may guess from the description of the gateway that 
		  the most complex problems faced in this project was to create an easy 
		  and comprehensive navigation. First, it was important that users may 
		  move from one section to the other without getting lost. Such objective 
		  was achieved by creating a complex structure of embedded frames, in 
		  which the frame below allows an access to the main 6 sections from any 
		  page in the gateway. Besides, there is a second frame for moving inside 
		  each main section, a third one for moving inside each section and also 
		  page numbering. In the future, a search engine will be included for 
		  making particular access even easier.</p>
		<p class="normal">Furthermore, it was always the idea of taken advantage 
		  of any resources already existent in Internet created by other institutions 
		  to complement the gateway. One example, is an excellent resource created 
		  by the research group GRIHO from Lleida University (<a href="http://griho.udl.es/" target="_blank">http://griho.udl.es</a>) 
		  of the church of <b>Santa Maria de Lavaix</b>, accessible from our gateway 
		  with the permission of the own researchers. </p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusions</h1>
		<p class="normal">This application of new technologies in the field of Cultural 
		  Heritage has not only an educative and dissemination, but also social 
		  and economic, since it permits the use of technology to balance territories. 
		  It gives a chance to access to particular contents and technologies 
		  to distant places from the main economic and academic axes, so it means 
		  to give new potential to disfavored communities. If new technologies 
		  may improve citizens quality of life, and overcome geographic obstacles 
		  in a territory, this kind of applications will make people aware of 
		  advantages that technology may bring in our lives. </p>
		<p class="normal">As the gateway required collaboration of a myriad of institutions 
		  in relation to contents and their update, a special model of decentralized 
		  and flexible platform was defined, which we called galaxy model. The 
		  model attempts to create a virtual resource or interpretation center, 
		  which does not exist in the real world, and because of economic, political 
		  or social reasons will never have a real replica (Carreras, 2001). </p>
		<p class="normal">At technical level, the gateway provides contents hosted 
		  in diverse servers, and each entity becomes responsible for updating 
		  contents of its server. The model is so flexible that you may have as 
		  many collaborators I different degrees as you wish, there are no limits, 
		  except the ones that come with their coordination. Since there is no 
		  identical real space to the gateway, the virtual resource does not enter 
		  in competition with any cultural facility, and on the contrary, it fosters 
		  the visit to institutions taking part in the objects from their collections. 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">It is still too early to evaluate the Boi valley gateway, 
		  though we are currently following it up. The project is still unfinished, 
		  because an English version is missing and some sections are still undeveloped. 
		  Once the gateway will be on-line in the three languages (Catalan, Spanish 
		  and English), we will evaluate logins to the resource as well as the 
		  comments of visitors through the Tourist Board and the experience for 
		  the local community.  </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="normal">Since there were still many aspects 
		  of the gateway unconcluded, the group Òliba and the Boi valley 
		  Tourist Board presented together another proposal for a grant of our 
		  autonomous government. We have recently received confirmation of new 
		  funding from CIRIT (ACOM-2002-003) for executing the incomplete sections 
		  of the project.</span></p>
