		<h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
		<p class="AbstractText">The Mystic Seaport website has been developed 
		  with an increasingly carefully designed underlying architecture that 
		  ties the website to the museum&#39;s electronic information resources. While 
		  this is common in the presentation of collections materials, the extent 
		  (and success) with which this has been realized in the areas of public 
		  programs, products, education, and membership is not. The integration 
		  of these elements has meant an increasingly sophisticated way of managing 
		  our museum information generally with the web as the occasion for that 
		  management rather than the result. </p>
		<p class="keywords">Keywords: Information architecture, museums, inforamtion 
		  management </p>
		<h3 class="SubHeader">Applied Architecture</h3>
		<p class="normal">While technology brings benefits, it also creates problems. 
		  Those problems may not increase in some geometric proportion to the 
		  complexity of the technology, but it is certainly true that one can 
		  end up in a substantially grander fiasco by choosing bad accounting 
		  software than by choosing nine column instead of eleven column accounting 
		  paper. At Mystic Seaport, we are trying to reduce the effects of those 
		  problems by understanding what our information architecture is and acting 
		  on that understanding. We are using the web to realize that information 
		  architecture because the web offers a set of tools for combining textual, 
		  database, and visual materials with sophisticated presentation capabilities 
		  along with the capacity to import and export content where that is needed. 
		  The remarks that follow are based on some preliminary experiments. 
		  A broad outline will be presented, one simple example that we have been 
		  developing explored, and finally a suggestion of some benefits that 
		  have accrued from this approach will be offered.</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeader">An Overview</h3>
		<p class="normal">In the 1980&#39;s the &#39;watch out&#39; for technology planners 
		  was proprietary systems that bound data and their programs inextricably 
		  like Siamese twins so that when the program died or wanted changing, 
		  the data was apt to die as well or was rescued only with great pain. 
		  In the 1990&#39;s the &#39;watch out&#39; was making sure that the programs implemented 
		  did not end up dictating the structure of your organization or work. 
		  Membership and Development may be closely related in museums and quite 
		  separate from Finance, for example, but is this because most membership 
		  or development software packages commercially available combine those 
		  two functions and most financial software systems don&#39;t include them, 
		  or because that is truly the shape of our work? In the new century, 
		  we are obliged to contend with the missteps of the first twenty years 
		  of computerization in museums, but beyond that, technology planning 
		  involves understanding our information architecture, our audiences, 
		  and our business. At Mystic Seaport, we have developed a relatively 
		  simple model for our information, and we have used the web as an occasion 
		  for testing and enhancing it. When we reach the next decade of this 
		  century, we are sure to discover that we did not avoid all of the technological 
		  potholes that we&#39;ll encounter. Future technologies will have to contend 
		  with our missteps. But, understanding our architecture helps us to 
		  choose wisely, and may help smooth the transition into changing technologies 
		  by preserving our data in ways that support our ongoing work.</p>
		<p class="normal">Our approach has been quite simply to borrow from the 
		  many years of studying, storing, recalling, and utilizing collections 
		  information in museums. While the process of understanding and re-thinking 
		  museum collections information that has unfolded over the last twenty 
		  years has been far from linear or even intentional, museums have benefited 
		  from being able to grow their ideas in step with changing technology. 
		  The simple field-tag and data technologies of the 1960&#39;s and 1970&#39;s 
		  were rethought first as simple grids and then relational models as database 
		  tools evolved in the 1980&#39;s and early 1990&#39;s, and those ideas have matured 
		  with object models and the kinds of faceted views that tools like XML 
		  bring to the mix along with the notions of digesting complex structures 
		  into a few core fields that give access to deeper information. Museums 
		  are often criticized for their apparent lack of standards, but that 
		  very lack has enabled them to bring openness to the technologies that 
		  have emerged for managing information. That museums have been thinking 
		  and re-thinking their data over the last twenty years means that they 
		  have developed a reasonably sound set of tested skills in thinking about 
		  information.</p>
		<p class="normal">What museums have learned is that fairly simple relational 
		  models can describe complex concepts, and that in spite of the possibility 
		  of extraordinary complexity for any of the entities within those models, 
		  a simple set of shared elements can be defined. Beyond that, museums 
		  are comfortable—whether they really know it or not—with information 
		  models like object-oriented data structures or with the kinds of partial 
		  views that tools like XML and SGML can provide. A catalogue record—even a very rich one—cannot, indeed need not or even should not, 
		  do more than act as a gesture towards a real object whether it is a 
		  painting or a molding plane or a bird skin. One can quibble with the 
		  details, wisdom, some of the paths, and some of the outcomes of this 
		  mode of thought, but the fact remains that this is something we in museums 
		  have learned to do. This is not a small accomplishment or a simple 
		  habit of mind to develop. Of course, information scientists and technology 
		  designers knew all of this more thoroughly and more theoretically long 
		  before it filtered down to museums, but for casual travelers along the 
		  information highway, museums have done well.</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeader">The Basic Elements</h3>
		<p class="normal">Building on our understandings of collections information, 
		  then, one can suggest that <i>all</i> of the information that museums 
		  manage can be characterized in a fairly small set of elements that have 
		  relatively simple sets of core characteristics, even though any of these 
		  elements may point out to things that are much more complicated than 
		  we care to describe but from which we can extract enough of a view to 
		  be useful.</p>
		<p class="normal">At Mystic Seaport we have identified seven such basic 
		  elements about which the museum has information:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">Collections</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">Programs</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">Calendar</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">Publications</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">Products</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">People</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">Resources</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p class="normal">Each of these has a few basic characteristics: Calendar 
		  information has date, time, and duration; People have names and personal 
		  information; Products have identifying features, costs, and data about 
		  availability. None of these is truly very simple: Publications take 
		  all forms from books to exhibit labels to interpreter&#39;s handbooks to 
		  mission statements to websites; Programs might include formal lectures, 
		  on-site demonstrations, special exhibits, focused classes, or ongoing 
		  activities like volunteer opportunities. We know lots about the complexity 
		  of Collections: objects, manuscripts, books, films, photos, audio recordings, 
		  &#39;educational&#39; collections, reproductions, etc., etc. We also know that 
		  there are all kinds of proprietary, formal, informal, accidental, electronic, 
		  manual, open, closed, and tight-lipped systems that truly lie back behind 
		  each of these seven basic building blocks, but we&#39;ve learned that doesn&#39;t 
		  matter. Museums know the trick of working with the tips of icebergs.</p>
		<p class="normal">One could get elaborate with this approach—more basic 
		  elements, more characteristics—but the end result is not so much to 
		  <i>manage</i> these kinds of data (though that does end up happening 
		  to a degree) but rather to <i>use</i> them. The important thing about 
		  identifying the basic building blocks is being able to combine them 
		  into basic functions. For instance, the Programs combined with the 
		  Calendar becomes the course offerings for any period of time. That 
		  combined with the People element is what is needed to register people 
		  for the courses (and, of course, Resources gets input when they register). 
		  Similarly, the conjunction of the People element with the Products element 
		  (again with the ultimate involvement of Resources) characterizes any 
		  sale transaction. </p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">An Example: Products</h3>
		<p class="normal">One of Mystic Seaport&#39;s businesses is selling things. 
		  Some aspects of this are relatively clear: we have a museum store. 
		  Some are not: we provide research services for a fee and we license 
		  the use of our collections. Some, like memberships, don&#39;t depend on 
		  any &#39;inventory&#39; per se. Others, such as donated boats for sale, are 
		  inventoried, but not in the same sense as the t-shirts in the museum 
		  store. The sale of copies of ship&#39;s plans for boat builders or of photo 
		  reproductions of turn of the last century passenger ships for those 
		  whose genealogical research leads them to those vessels are businesses 
		  on demand. The sale of special member&#39;s hats to members involves screening 
		  the purchasers as well as maintaining an inventory that may have a long 
		  life. The products that we offer are varied.</p>
		<p class="normal">We do have some systems in place for managing the sales 
		  of products: for most of the things sold through the museum store, 
		  there is a commercial software package that maintains all kinds of cost, 
		  inventory, supplier, date received, wholesale shipping, tax, location, 
		  descriptions, manufacturer&#39;s identifiers, inventory numbers, sku&#39;s, 
		  ISBN numbers, and on and on. In its way, it is as complex and as functional 
		  as our collections management system. For other product sales, our 
		  systems are less formal. The collections management system has a module 
		  for tracking rights and reproduction information. The membership program 
		  has the capability of managing a few products for sale to members apart 
		  from the memberships themselves. And, there are some home-grown databases 
		  for storing information about which ship&#39;s plans are available for sale 
		  and which photographs might be reproduced. But, there is not a universal 
		  system that manages products, and we know enough about systems and software 
		  and the effect that those have on our work that even if we could squeeze 
		  everything into our store system (and we probably could), that would 
		  not be desirable. Just because it is our biggest, most expensive system 
		  does not mean it is the best for all products, and just because we might 
		  be able to force integration of all of our parts does not mean that 
		  would be prudent. </p>
		<p class="normal">Instead, using the web as our perspective—a view of 
		  the whole organization and its functions rather than the departmentalized 
		  view imposed in part by our business software, our practices, and the 
		  nature of our products—we looked for commonalities among our products. 
		  They share a few:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">There is always some tangible &#39;thing&#39;—even if 
			it is a research document—that can be identified.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">Those things can be given prices—whether absolute 
			or relative to some amount—pounds, hours, use.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">The availability of those things can be quantified.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">Someone in the museum either has the things or has 
			the means to produce those things.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">There are ways to convey those things (and identifiable 
			costs relating to that conveyance).</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p class="normal">Starting with these simple elements, we began to construct 
		  a product database that had the following:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">Basic descriptive elements for products: name, text 
			or caption, image, and the identifying number used by the one who 
			managed that product within the museum (for things in the museum store, 
			their SKU; for memberships, the code stored in the membership database).</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">Some information about cost—the price, the units 
			that were priced (for example, by the piece, by the pound, or by the 
			hour), whether and when taxes were applicable, the extent to which 
			categories of people (members, for example) got discounts.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">Some information about quantity available.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">Information about what system, department, or individual 
			can supply the product along with information about the timing for 
			fulfillment (custom photos may take a week to produce; t-shirts can 
			be shipped the next day)</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">Information about shipping and its costs</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class="Section1">Some basic administrative details—each record 
			in the Products database gets a unique identifier separate from whatever 
			identifier is used by the person or department who manages that product, 
			each record has a date first entered and a last update date, each 
			record is keyed to a product class that we&#39;ve devised (this helps 
			to build hierarchies of products for presentation purposes), and the 
			like.</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class="Section1"> 
		<p class="normal">Along with this database, we&#39;ve developed programs that 
		  either extract from our product managing systems information or provide 
		  product managers with ways to represent their materials. Some of these 
		  extractions occur regularly Òthe museum store inventory (roughly 30,000 
		  items) is polled every night to update quantities available and price 
		  as well as additions and subtractions. The list of available ship&#39;s 
		  plans does not change more often than quarterly. The membership categories 
		  available as products change less frequently than that. We are still 
		  at the beginning of this process, but by adding product lines and capabilities 
		  slowly, we&#39;ve been able to keep our product database simple. The goal, 
		  after all, is to create something that can intersect <i>all</i> of the 
		  products that we offer and to get the same set of basic data about them 
		  so that we can <i>use</i> that information. It is not to either reproduce 
		  the management systems that any products may originate from or to create 
		  a management system where none exists.</p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"> <img src="blackaby-products.jpg" width="396" height="293"/></p>
		<p class="MsoCaption">The logic of the Products database is to simply 
		  intersect with all of the native sources for product information. Very 
		  little of the native information is required to create this central 
		  element.</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Some Benefits</h3>
		<p class="normal">The most obvious benefit of having a single product 
		  database drawn from our existing systems is that we only have to build 
		  one tool to create a transaction. From the point of view of maintenance, 
		  this alone is a tremendous benefit. But, more interestingly, perhaps, 
		  is the fact that this model does not depend on any particular software 
		  solution or set of procedures or even data structures (though having 
		  everything in a common database language helps ease the extraction routines). 
		  If the store, for instance, changes to a new software solution, the 
		  only change needed in the museum&#39;s information systems as a whole will 
		  be a new extraction routine to populate the Products database. Because 
		  the structure of that Products database is basic and simple, creating 
		  a new set of crosswalks should be straight forward. If the membership 
		  department decides that it wants to let the store sell its merchandise 
		  or the sailing programs add a line of sailing accessories for sale accommodating 
		  that in the Products database is simple.</p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"><img src="blackaby-transactions.jpg" width="395" height="292"/></p>
		<p class="MsoCaption">Transactions are created between the building blocks—Products, People, and Resources in the instance of a sale—not between 
		  any of the underlying native data sources.]</p>
		<p class="normal"> </p>
		<p class="normal">Using the databases singly to store information harvested 
		  from our production systems is hardly the goal of this approach to information, 
		  though. The important benefit of this approach is the ability to create 
		  transactions between the databases. Instead of having multiple product 
		  management systems and multiple people management systems or solutions, 
		  creating a single way to realize a transaction between an individual 
		  in the People database (wherever their information might have been extracted 
		  from) and an item in the Products database (whichever part of the museum 
		  that product emanated from) is a tremendous savings in time and simplification 
		  of process. We have only begun to develop these transactional capabilities, 
		  but they are fairly easy to realize on the web, and their power quickly 
		  becomes apparent.</p>
		<p class="normal">There are many wrinkles in this structure that need 
		  consideration. Some of the information that populates these seven building 
		  blocks exists in database applications already, and it can be rationalized 
		  and harvested easily. Some of it, though, is not and has never been 
		  organized. The whole mass of interpretive content, occasional publications, 
		  educator&#39;s guides, books, journals, articles by staff members, and other 
		  documentary content that together forms the building block Publications 
		  does not have easy structures that one can key off of. Some areas of 
		  the museum have underdeveloped or disorganized information management 
		  tools—the calendar was one such area in our museum—and the core 
		  building block may serve as the structure for the whole and the primary 
		  point of data entry. Finally, some of the building blocks themselves 
		  end up being collectors of information that needs to be re-distributed 
		  out to our various software solutions. The People database is a case 
		  in point here. When someone buys a product from the museum, the system 
		  checks to see if they are already in the People database. If they are, 
		  the transaction proceeds. If they are not, their name is added to the 
		  People database before proceeding. Once it is there, depending on the 
		  transaction, it may be that the membership program, the aspect of the 
		  store system that tracks shipping, or the educational program the person 
		  has signed up for will want to have their personal data stored in its 
		  own format. Nearly all of these challenges turn out to be things that 
		  strengthen our own ability to manage our information.</p>
		<p class="normal">Mystic Seaport is still in the initial stages of realizing 
		  this data architecture, but the results realized to date in the areas 
		  of managing all of the museum&#39;s information in an efficient manner have 
		  been very successful. Indeed, the biggest challenges that we have faced 
		  in moving to this perspective have had to do with our own ability to 
		  understand the tremendous positive implications for our work rather 
		  than anything technical. From the technical perspective, most of what 
		  we are undertaking is quite mundane. The web has served as a very friendly 
		  development platform both from the point of view of creating and using 
		  the tools that we need to work with the seven building blocks and from 
		  the point of view of being a neutral place outside any particular software 
		  application, departmental sway, or the usual vertical structures that 
		  characterize museum organization.</p>
