	  <span class="PaperTitle">Addressing Multiple Audiences with Multiple Interfaces 
	  to The AMICO Library™</span> 
	  <p class="Author">S. Sayre, and K. Wetterlund, The Art Museum Image Consortium, 
		USA </p>
	  <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract </p>
	  <p class="AbstractText">The Art Museum Image Consortium &#34;AMICO&#34; 
		(<a href="http://www.amico.org/" target="_blank">www.amico.org</a>) is 
		a group of over three-dozen Member Museums, which have committed to digitize 
		their collections and contribute them to an integrated library on an on-going 
		basis. The AMICO Library™ has been available to educational institutions-- 
		including colleges and universities, elementary and secondary schools, 
		public libraries and museums-- for almost five years and grows significantly 
		each year. The 2003 edition of The AMICO Library™ will contain over 
		120,000 works of art. After three years of distribution through a single 
		source (RLG, Inc.), AMICO began contracting with other Distributors, each 
		specializing in a different audience, to reach and meet the diverse needs 
		of multiple user communities. Today, each of these six Distributors delivers 
		The AMICO Library™ through their own unique interfaces, often along 
		with other digital resources. This range of Distributors now allows subscribing 
		institutions to choose among the different services and interfaces that 
		are compatible with their institutional requirements and best meet the 
		needs of their end users.</p>
	  <p class="AbstractText">The variety of Distributors of The AMICO Library™ 
		also allows AMICO Member Museums to access and view their digital documentation 
		through a variety of tools and interfaces developed outside of their own 
		direct influence or control. Each Distributor and interface has a significant 
		effect on how the work is used, explored and perceived. This paper explores 
		the multiple interface approach to distributing content as well as the 
		differences in features and functions of multiple distributors. Issues 
		addressed include audience specific functionality, inter-application consistency 
		and the need for additional research.</p>

	  <h1 class="SubHeader"><br/>
		Introduction</h1>
	  <p class="normal">Cultural heritage resources such as museum collections 
		serve a number of educational functions for a wide range of diverse audiences. 
		Museums have historically addressed the needs of these varied audiences 
		through the development of discrete print and/or electronic products, 
		educational programs designed to serve a particular audience and purpose, 
		and reflecting only part of the data known to the institution. The emergence 
		of data driven, online cultural resources now offers museums the opportunity 
		to develop new models to disseminate a unified, continuously augmented 
		resource through a number of different interfaces designed to provide 
		views and tools suited to a range of audiences. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The Art Museum Image Consortium (AMICO) is a non-profit 
		corporation formed by North American art museums in 1997 to provide educational 
		access to and delivery of cultural heritage information by creating, maintaining 
		and licensing a collective digital library of images and documentation 
		of works in their collections. The 39 current Member Museums annually 
		contribute digital images, text, multimedia and related metadata to one 
		centralized library. All contributions are governed by the AMICO Data 
		Specifications and descriptive standards based on the <em>Categories for 
		Descriptions of Works of Art</em> (ed., Baca and Harpring, 2000). Member 
		contributions are collected, validated, and enhanced through indexing 
		by AMICO staff before the resulting Library is released to AMICO Distributors 
		and through them, to the end users.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Beyond the technical aspects of building the digital library, 
		one of AMICO&#39;s primary functions is facilitating, maintaining and enforcing 
		the licensing of the intellectual property of The AMICO Library™ 
		(Bearman &amp; Trant 1997). AMICO licenses the contributed assets from 
		each Member Museum and in turn licenses The AMICO Library™ to each 
		of the Distributors. Separate, standardized license agreements are also 
		contracted between AMICO and each subscriber to The AMICO Library™. 
		These subscriber licenses specify the terms of The AMICO Library&#39;s™ 
		use according to the agreements AMICO has with its Member Museums. The 
		protection provided by these licenses and the controlled distribution 
		of The AMICO Library™ has allowed AMICO to negotiate blanket rights 
		agreements for works of artists under copyright and managed by the Artist 
		Right Society &#34;ARS&#34; and the Visual Arts Galleries Association &#34;VAGA.&#34; 
		These agreements in turn allow AMICO subscribers access to digital images 
		of works of art that are not typically available to the public.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader"><br/>
		The AMICO Library™</h1>
	  <p class="normal">The AMICO Library™ currently consists of museum created 
		digital documentation of over 100,000 works of art from around the world. 
		Works range from prehistoric to contemporary times, and cover the complete 
		range of expressive forms. Cultures and time periods represented range 
		from contemporary art, Native American, and Inuit art to ancient Greek, 
		Roman, and Egyptian works, as well as Japanese and Chinese works.</p>
	  <p>The types of works in The AMICO Library™ include:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>over 13,000 paintings</li>
		<li>over 5,900 sculptures</li>
		<li>over 13,700 drawings and watercolors</li>
		<li>over 23,800 prints</li>
		<li>over 29,000 photographs</li>
		<li>over 1,800 textiles</li>
		<li>over 1,600 costumes and jewelry</li>
		<li>over 9,800 works of decorative art</li>
		<li>over 1,200 books and manuscripts<br/>
		  <br/>
		  A complete breakdown of the current library can be found at (<a href="http://www.amico.org/AMICOlibrary/contents.html" target="_blank">http://www.amico.org/AMICOlibrary/contents.html</a>).</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="normal">Digital documentation for each represented work varies 
		based on the type of object, existing documentation and what each Member 
		Museum has selected to contribute. AMICO&#39;s Data Specification requires 
		that all contributed works contain at least one representative image and 
		a set of 30 core fields of basic information including object title, measurements, 
		materials and techniques, creator culture/nationality, creation date, 
		owner name, accession number, and owner credit line. Other core fields 
		include metadata such as Library contribution date to assist in maintaining 
		The AMICO Library™ over time. Most records contain an extended set 
		of information above and beyond the core fields including text descriptions, 
		provenance, exhibition history, and subject classifications. Additional 
		rich media includes streaming audio and video files, links to related 
		web content and multiple views. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The AMICO Library™ grows in size, depth and scope 
		annually. Contributing Member Museums actively update and expand existing 
		records as well as contribute additional records. AMICO Members understand 
		that subscribers need access to the most extensive documentation possible, 
		and work to meet those needs on an ongoing basis. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader"><br/>
		AMICO&#39;s Audiences</h1>
	  <p class="normal">AMICO&#39;s mission is to enable the educational use of museum 
		multimedia. This mission is centered on the effective delivery of The 
		AMICO Library™ to four communities of subscribers: universities, 
		K-12 (elementary and secondary) schools, public libraries and museums. 
		AMICO currently serves over 3.5 million of these users worldwide. Each 
		of these subscribers has selected to work with one or more of AMICO&#39;s 
		five Distributors. This overview will be limited to the university and 
		K-12 school audiences, since they are the primary focus of AMICO and its 
		Distributors.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">University Subscribers </h2>
	  <p class="normal">Universities currently make up the majority of AMICO subscribers 
		with over 250 subscribing institutions. Worldwide AMICO currently has 
		subscribers in Australia, Canada, China, Israel, Lebanon, the Netherlands, 
		the United Kingdom and the United States. These subscribing universities 
		serve about 2 million students.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">K-12 Subscribers</h2>
	  <p class="normal">K-12 schools have been publicly invited to subscribe to 
		the AMIO Library since the fall of 2002. Since then, AMICO has acquired 
		over seventy K-12 subscribers in North America. These subscribing schools 
		currently serve almost 30,000 students annually. A number of the K-12 
		subscribers participate in AMICO through their membership in one or more 
		consortia, such as New York&#39;s NyLink. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader"><br/>
		AMICO Distributors</h1>
	  <p class="normal">Early in AMICO&#39;s formation it was determined that it was 
		not effective for the organization to directly distribute The AMICO Library™ 
		to end users, considering the infrastructure and staffing required to 
		support such an effort. As a result, a Model Distribution Agreement was 
		developed as a strategy for establishing formal working agreements with 
		experienced distributors of digital resources to deliver The AMICO Library™ 
		to subscribers (Bearman, Trant, 2002). This model gave AMICO the unique 
		advantage of greatly reducing the consortium&#39;s requirement to provide 
		delivery and support. More importantly, this model has allowed The AMICO 
		Library™ to be delivered through a range of Distributors and interfaces, 
		which provides a kind of laboratory for studies of user requirements and 
		the effectiveness of software features.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Today, The AMICO Library™ is delivered worldwide 
		through six major Distributors. Each of the Distributors is unique in 
		its content offerings, interfaces and subscriber base. The following, 
		in alphabetical order, is a summary of the current Distributors</p>

		Distributor Features and Functions</h1>
	  <p class="normal">The AMICO Library™ is identical when received by 
		each Distributor, but because each Distributor of The AMICO Library™ 
		provides its own unique views and tools for working with the contents 
		of The AMICO Library™, it supports different functions and has a 
		different ‘feel&#39;. Each Distributor is required to adhere to minimal 
		display and indexing requirements as specified in the AMICO Distributor 
		Specification. This specification also requires that all Distributors 
		support searches of The AMICO Library™ by any of the following fields 
		and combinations of a minimum of two of them:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li> Creator-Name</li>
		<li> Creator-Nationality/Culture</li>
		<li> Object-Type</li>
		<li> Title</li>
		<li> Creation-Date (CDT) and/or OCS/OCE</li>
		<li> Materials and Techniques</li>
		<li> Owner Name</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="normal">In addition, AMICO requires all Distributors to provide 
		access to a full-screen (1024 x 768) image, and options for accessing, 
		multiple views, associated multimedia, linked structured text files, and 
		audio and motion video files. Beyond these basic requirements, the specific 
		views supported by each Distributor&#39;s interface differ based on Distributor-specific 
		editorial and design decisions. These defined views then dictate the ways 
		in which the underlying data is indexed as well as the scope of the surrounding 
		features and functions. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The features and functions of each distribution of The 
		AMICO Library™ dictates the ways in which subscribers can retrieve 
		and utilize AMICO&#39;s contents. A number of user studies (Stebly 1998, Corbetta-Noyes 
		1998, Gay, Rieger 1999, Sho, Sengupta 2000) examine the features and functions 
		desired by faculty and students when moving from traditional slides to 
		digital media. Sho and Sengupta (2000) define the primary tasks involved 
		in such activities as &#34;search, select, record and use&#34;. While these tasks 
		can be consistently performed in a traditional slide library, the tools 
		available in a digital library environment significantly impact a users 
		ability to perform these tasks. Simple procedures such as &#34;browsing&#34; and 
		&#34;setting images aside&#34; are shown to be common requests (Stebly 1998, Sho, 
		Sengupta 2000) but are not yet standard features and functions offered 
		by every Distributor. Penn State&#39;s forthcoming Visual Image User Study 
		(Pisciotta et al. 2001) promises to be the most comprehensive study to 
		date and may define such standards in the higher education environment.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The following matrix provides a simplified outline of 
		the key features and functions of each Distributor of The AMICO Library™. 
		The information contained within this matrix is not meant to be comprehensive 
		and represents the findings of a first pass inventory by the authors in 
		order to identify similarities and differences between Distributors for 
		further research and to assist in the development of future specifications.</p>

		and Functions</a></p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Definition of Terms</h2>
	  <p>The following defines the way in which the features and functions within 
		the matrix were defined in the inventory.<br/>
		<br/>
		<em><strong>Simple search</strong></em> - a query screen containing one 
		single input box in which users can input a query term or string. Similar 
		to a Google™ search, simple search screens give the impression of 
		querying keywords or all fields, however it is never clear to the user 
		exactly what is being queried and the results are dependent on the indexing 
		strategies of each Distributor. Most Distributor&#39;s advanced searches also 
		provide for some type of simple searching through such functions as search 
		&#34;All,&#34; &#34;Keywords&#34; or &#34;Any Field&#34;.<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong><em>Browse </em></strong>- a top-level screen that facilitates 
		paging through the entire database or according to a field occurrence 
		list such as &#34;Nationality.&#34; All Distributors offer some browsing functionality 
		after performing a query that returns multiple results. Most Distributors 
		also provided browse as a top-level function or finding aid.<br/>
		<br/>
		<em><strong>Thesaurus</strong></em> - a query interface that is built 
		around a thesaurus or lexicon of terms that can be used for term expansion 
		or refinement.<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong><em>Advanced search</em></strong> - a search screen with two or 
		more fields for composing queries and tools that allow for the selection 
		of specific fields or concepts to be queried (i.e. creator/nationality).</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Unlimited Boolean - the ability for the user to perform a complex 
		  Boolean query with an unlimited number of terms within a single field 
		  or multiple fields. Some Distributors provide a limited number of fields 
		  within the advanced search page, but allow for complex Boolean within 
		  them. Others do not permit Boolean operators within the field but provide 
		  interface tools for adding additional query components.</li>
		<li> Keyword - a query option within the advanced search screen that allows 
		  the user to search an index of key terms defined by the Distributor.</li>
		<li> Any field - a query option within the advanced search screen that 
		  similar to a keyword search allows the user to search across a number 
		  of fields simultaneously.</li>
		<li> Authority lists - pull-down menu or pick-list of available controlled 
		  sets of terms for a field (e.g. artist name, creator culture).</li>
		<li>Cat. Fields to query - number of fields that can be selected and directly 
		  queried in an advanced search.</li>
		<li> Cat. Fields displayed - the maximum number of unique fields of data 
		  displayed for one record. The screen on which the maximum number fields 
		  are displayed differ from one Distributor to the next. In some cases 
		  it may be a &#34;full record&#34; view and in others the number of displayed 
		  fields can be controlled globally for all screens. Numbers are approximates 
		  based on items displayed rather than fields in the underlying database. 
		</li>
		<li>Sort results - the ability to select the order in which search results 
		  are displayed (i.e. by relevance, date, etc.)</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p> <strong><em>Graphic tools</em></strong> - interface components that 
		allow for manipulation of an image beyond basic viewing. While all Distributors 
		provide functions for viewing different size images, some provide tools 
		for functions such as zooming and panning.<br/>
		<br/>
		<em><strong>Search history</strong></em> - a dynamically created log of 
		all queries performed within a user session. Distributors offer different 
		advanced functions for combining, saving and re-running past queries.<br/>
		<br/>
		<em><strong>Query links</strong></em> - hyperlinks within search results 
		that perform a query for the linked term when clicked (e.g. clicking Ojibwa 
		in the creator culture field returns all Ojibwa created works).<br/>
		<br/>
		<em><strong>Export text files</strong></em> - functions that allow the 
		user to export records or search returns as formatted text files, HTML, 
		spreadsheets or other text format. While most users can save pages as 
		HTML or text through their browser&#39;s interface, some Distributors have 
		included special tools for performing these functions.<br/>
		<br/>
		<em><strong>Order TIFF files</strong></em> - the ability for end users 
		to order high-resolution TIFF files of images in The AMICO Library™. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<em><strong>Integrated resources</strong></em> - one or more other electronic 
		resources that can be queried simultaneously to The AMICO Library™. 
		Interoperability with these resources can impact the overall available 
		toolset.<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong><em>Personal Grouping</em></strong> - a function allowing users 
		to create and save custom sets of objects and related information. Some 
		Distributors also refer to these functions as notebooks or groups. </p>
	  <ul>
		<li> Local - the ability to store a group on a local drive</li>
		<li> Networked - the ability store a group on the Distributors server 
		  so it can be accessed via any authenticated user.</li>
		<li> Sharable - the ability to &#34;publish&#34; a group so it is accessible and 
		  viewable by other subscribers.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Experience defines functionality </h2>
	  <p class="normal">In some cases the range of other digital resources offered 
		by the Distributors limits the available tools and views. The decision 
		to provide interoperability between distributed resources may constrain 
		options. Past experience in delivering those resources will inform the 
		overall features and functions made available through a Distributor&#39;s 
		interface. This is particularly relevant when it comes to the distribution 
		of digital images and multimedia. Historically, most of the Distributors 
		had focused on the delivery of text-based resources. Because of this, 
		toolsets tend to be more refined to support interoperability between text-based 
		resources than to support advanced functions related to the viewing and 
		manipulation of other forms of rich media. Systems for delivery of digital 
		images are often underdeveloped compared with those for delivering electronic 
		text (Pisciotta et al. 2001). As more and more digital resources begin 
		to incorporate rich media, Distributors will inevitably adjust their interfaces, 
		features and functionality to fully address the potential applications 
		of these new resources.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Degree of Apparent Inter-Application Consistency 
	  </h2>
	  <p class="normal">Features common across most of the Distributors are the 
		concepts of a single field &#34;simple&#34; search and a multiple field or Boolean 
		&#34;advanced&#34; search. Colleen Skidmore and Sandra Dowie, (1999), suggest 
		that simple query tools are best for novice computer users who may be 
		overwhelmed by the complexities and myriad of options available with an 
		advanced search. The University Testbed user survey (Gay &amp; Rieger, 
		1999) found the &#34;simple search&#34; to be considered more useful than the 
		advance search function. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Implementation of these tools and the indexing beneath 
		them varies significantly between Distributors. While most &#34;simple&#34; searches 
		are typically referred to as keyword searches, each Distributor has made 
		independent decisions about which fields are contributing values to the 
		&#34;keyword&#34; or generic string search index. Some Distributors define a simple 
		search as &#34;search all&#34; while others refer to these as &#34;keyword&#34; searches. 
		In both cases, the Distributors have selected and indexed a set of fields 
		to correspond with available data and in the ways in which they believe 
		end users will glean the most benefit. The concept of an &#34;advanced&#34; search 
		also varies significantly between Distributors. One Distributor provides 
		field specific querying for 32 fields of data plus &#34;all&#34; while another&#39;s 
		&#34;Search by Keyword&#34; provides access to five fields (creation date, object 
		type, title, subject, anywhere), two of which (anywhere and subject) are 
		compound fields built by strategically indexing other underlying fields. 
		All of these interfaces have advantages and disadvantages, from being 
		too limited and mysterious to overwhelmingly complex. The availability 
		and resulting functionality of these basic features impacts usability 
		for different audiences and different applications as well as their satisfaction 
		with the number of items their queries return.</p>
	  <p class="normal">In a study of the Museum Educational Site Licensing project 
		(a collaboration of seven collecting institutions and seven universities) 
		defining the terms and conditions for the educational use of digitized 
		museum images and related information that was completed in 1977, Besser 
		(1998) performed five queries against each distribution of the project. 
		He found that these searches returned significantly different results. 
		Figures 15 and 16 illustrate the consistency of results when the same 
		set of queries is performed via the simple and advanced search interfaces 
		of each of the six AMICO Distributors.</p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><a name="fig14"></a><a href="sayre.fig14.html"><img src="sayre.figure14thm.gif" alt="Results of Performing a Simple Search graph link" width="400" height="245" border="1"/></a><br/>
		<a href="sayre.fig14.html" target="_blank">Fig. 14: Results of Performing 
		a Simple Search</a></p>
	  <p class="normal"><em>Each of the terms in Figure 14 was queried using the 
		Distributor&#39;s simple search field. Where a Distributor lacked a simple 
		search field, the search all or keyword function was used in the advanced 
		search (see appendix 1 for details.)</em></p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><a name="fig15"></a><a href="sayre.fig15.html" target="_blank"><img src="sayre.figure15thm.gif" alt="Results of Performing a Advanced Search graph link" width="400" height="242" border="1"/></a><br/>
		<a href="sayre.fig15.html" target="_blank">Fig. 15: Results of Performing 
		a Advanced Search</a></p>
	  <p class="normal"><em>The fields used for each advanced search was dependent 
		upon the types of fields available to query. (See Appendix 1 for details.)</em></p>
	  <p class="normal">As compared with Besser&#39;s findings, there is substantially 
		the same result from each search in each system. Nevertheless, there is 
		some evidence of variation. Neither the statistical significance of this 
		variation nor its correlation with Besser&#39;s findings was assessed for 
		this preliminary examination. And while the many contributory sources 
		for this variation are not the focus of this paper, a number of potential 
		contributing variables can be identified. One of the largest variables 
		was the way in which the authors performed the searches in each of the 
		different distributions (see also Appendix 1). With significant variation 
		in interface, indexing and functional definition between Distributors 
		it is very difficult to perform an apples to apples comparison. Beyond 
		these differences in user strategy there are a number of other more technical 
		variables that are likely to have some impact on these findings. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Variables potentially influencing search returns</p>
	  <ol>
		<li> Collection indexing methodology</li>
		<li> Text stemming capabilities</li>
		<li> Natural language capabilitie</li>
		<li> Number of fields available for query</li>
		<li> Keyword and &#34;All Fields&#34; search capabilities</li>
		<li> Boolean query capabilities</li>
		<li> Search engine capabilities </li>
	  </ol>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">A Need for Additional Research</h1>
	  <p class="normal">There are similarities as well as notable differences 
		between the features and functions available through the Distributors 
		of The AMICO Library™. With AMICO&#39;s focus on a diversity of audiences, 
		K-12 through Higher Education, many questions remain in regards to the 
		alignment between the available features and functions and the needs of 
		the specific audiences. To date, most user research has been conducted 
		in higher education environments that traditionally rely on slide presentations. 
		Very little research has been conducted on the needs of K-12 and public 
		library users. Because of this, it is likely that current Distributor 
		features and functions cater more to the needs of higher education. Even 
		so, all users are still struggling to define their needs while simultaneously 
		defining new applications and rethinking traditional methodologies in 
		the digital environment. Truly innovative uses of digital resources and 
		the definition of related needs will not be possible until users are able 
		to put hard copy metaphors aside. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The amount of experience users have with a resource can 
		affect their ability to identify what they need from the resource. Without 
		fully understanding the potential capabilities of a resource such as AMICO, 
		users can&#39;t always identify which features and functions they desire. 
		In this regard, education and training can serve as another variable that 
		can have a significant positive impact on the perceived utility of a resource. 
		Sayre and Wetterlund (2002) found that once K-12 teachers were shown capabilities 
		of features and functions available in an online catalog of images, they 
		were able to realize the potential of the functions. Prior to exploring 
		these capabilities teachers were unable to describe the types of features 
		and functions they might find useful. This suggests that asking teachers 
		to describe desirable features and functions might be less effective than 
		observing which features and functions are used over time, and to what 
		end. Educators can find it difficult to imagine technological possibilities, 
		but have no trouble imagining creative pedagogical possibilities for existing 
		technology. The impact of these factors should be taken into consideration 
		with all end users in designing future research. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Along with the evolving state of the end users is the 
		continued progress in the cognitive and information sciences in developing 
		more efficient, intelligent solutions for addressing users needs. In order 
		to properly address these types of issues and opportunities, more rigorous 
		formal research is imperative, including task sequence studies and usability 
		analysis for each specified audience.</p>
	  <p class="normal">A rhetorical strategy suggests, on the basis of a rhetorical 
		tree configuration, what shot segmentation and which transition effect 
		should be applied. The strategies employed in the Torre Aquila multimedia 
		guide were elicited by a focus group activity with a documentary director.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusion</h1>
	  <p class="normal">Dissemination of a single digital resource through multiple 
		distributors is one model for addressing the needs of multiple audiences. 
		The Art Museum Image Consortium has found this model to have many advantages, 
		the most significant being exposure to a broader range of users. With 
		a common set of data and multiple Distributors, The AMICO Library™ 
		now offers a unique environment to assess the utility of different features 
		and functions against the requirements of different user communities. 
		The long-term success will be determined by taking full advantage of this 
		virtual laboratory to strengthen the connections between content and its 
		application. In the future, AMICO will continue to partner its Members, 
		Subscribers and Distributors to take advantage of and share this tremendous 
		opportunity to develop a greater understanding of networked delivery of 
		digital cultural heritage information.<br/>
