	  <p class="PaperTitle">What Clicks? An Interim Report on Audience Research</p>
	  <p class="Author">Jim Ockuly, Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Minneapolis, 
		Minnesota, USA.</p>
	  <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
	  <p class="AbstractText">The Minneapolis Institute of Arts is conducting a 
		major research and development project assessing its audiences&#39; awareness, 
		usage, and satisfaction regarding its interactive media/Web resources. 
		The Institute, an encyclopedic art museum, produces and maintains two 
		Web sites (<a href="http://www.artsmia.org/">http://www.artsmia.org</a> and <i><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/">http://www.artsconnected.org</a>, </i>the 
		latter in conjunction with Walker Art Center). It also provides its physical 
		visitors with a host of interactive media programs in the museum itself<i> 
		— </i>from a museum directory to a large number of permanent collection-based 
		programs located throughout the building. The research has been designed 
		to a) measure audience awareness, usage, and satisfaction regarding these 
		resources; b) respond to those findings with improvements; then c) re-measure 
		to gauge the effect of the improvements. A further goal of this project 
		is to share its logic model, methodology, instruments, and findings with 
		the museum community. To date, the benchmarking data has been compiled 
		and analyzed. Production and marketing work are now in progress. This 
		paper is a mid-project report on what we&#39;ve learned so far, and where 
		we&#39;re going. It includes detailed descriptions of the instruments used 
		for data collection (from Usability Lab to Web and in-gallery surveys), 
		presentation of the initial findings, and a discussion of how those findings 
		informed the actions now being taken. <i>What Clicks?</i> is funded by 
		an Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS <i>—</i> <a href="http://www.imls.gov/">http://www.imls.gov</a>) National Leadership Grant.</p>

	  <p class="normal" align="center">Introduction</p>
	  <p class="normal">In 2000, The Minneapolis Institute of Arts (MIA) received 
		a National Leadership Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services 
		(IMLS <i>—</i> <a href="http://www.imls.gov/">http://www.imls.gov</a> 
		). The grant&#39;s purpose was to fund a media and technology-oriented audience 
		research and development project. The project<i> — </i>titled <i>What 
		Clicks? — </i>is now underway. This is an interim report on the project&#39;s 
		progress, findings, and activities to date.</p>

	  <h1 class="SubHeader"><i>What Clicks?</i> Project Profile</h1>
	  <p class="normal">The specific purpose of the <i>What Clicks</i> research 
		and development project is to study audience effectiveness of The Minneapolis 
		Institute of Arts&#39; digital media resources. This includes measurement 
		of audience awareness, use, and satisfaction as it applies to the museum&#39;s 
		Interactive Directory, Interactive Learning Stations, and Web site. Further, 
		the project aims to interpret and react to the initial baseline findings 
		by setting aside significant time to make improvements to the above resources, 
		and then re-measure in an effort to gauge the impact those improvements 
		have made. Ultimately, it is hoped that the <i>What Clicks </i>project 
		will benefit The Minneapolis Institute of Arts and its audience through 
		the identification of audience needs, and in turn benefit other museums 
		and their audiences through the publication of both the project&#39;s process 
		and its findings.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Museum Profile</h1>
	  <p class="normal">Established in 1883 and now considered one of the top 
		ten art museums in the United States, The Minneapolis Institute of Arts 
		has built an encyclopedic collection of approximately 100,000 objects<i> 
		— </i>dating from classical to contemporary times. The Institute 
		offers regular programs that include permanent collection display, special 
		exhibitions, lectures, classes, and tours. It also has a longstanding 
		record of using media and technology to help connect its audiences with 
		art<i> — </i>particularly under current Museum Director Evan Maurer.</p>

	  </tbody></table>
	  <p class="normal">The Minneapolis Institute of Arts employs a staff of seven 
		full-time professionals in its Interactive Media Group<i> — </i>or 
		IMG. The IMG works with other museum staff to design, implement, and support 
		the Institute&#39;s media and technology resources.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Currently, the museum houses an Interactive Directory 
		as an information aid for visitors, and 17 Interactive Learning Stations 
		situated throughout the building. The museum also offers both special 
		exhibition and permanent collection audio tours, as well as an electronic 
		<i>Daily Events </i>screen.</p>
	  <p class="normal">For the off-site audience, the Institute provides two 
		Web sites<i> — </i>the general museum site (<a href="http://www.artsmia.org/">http://www.artsmia.org</a>) 
		and ArtsConnectEd, a resource designed for K-12 teachers and students 
		(<a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/">http://www.artsconnected.org</a>). ArtsConnectEd 
		is a joint project of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts and Walker Art 
		Center (<a href="http://www.walkerart.org/">http://www.walkerart.org</a>). 
	  </p>
	  <p><span class="normal">The museum recorded approximately 500,0</span>00 
		on-site museum visits in fiscal year 2001/2002, while the Institute&#39;s 
		general Web site logged roughly 2.5 million visi<span class="normal">t</span>s, 
		and ArtsConnectEd approximately 500,000. For several years, on-line visitation 
		has grown consistently at a rate of around 50% per year.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Interactive Directory</h2>
	  <p class="normal">The Directory consists of three touch-screens that are 
		used from a standing position or from a wheelchair. It is located in the 
		inner lobby at the museum&#39;s most frequently used entrance. Contents include 
		information about special exhibitions, permanent collection galleries, 
		lectures, films, Family Days, tours, membership, and amenities (restrooms, 
		coat check, cafes, etc.).</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Interactive Learning Stations</h2>
	  <p class="normal">The museum&#39;s 17 Interactive Learning Stations each concentrate 
		on a specific area of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts&#39; permanent collection 
		(e.g. photography, Prairie School architecture, African art, etc.). They 
		provide further content and context for works of art on display. Early 
		thinking was to avoid creating a centralized <i>media ghetto</i>. Most 
		are installed in discrete spaces in or near the galleries whose objects 
		they address. Some are installed in plain view in permanent collection 
		galleries. They range from video &#34;jukeboxes&#34; with a small set of linear 
		segments to highly interactive Web programs with database components.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Web Site</h2>
	  <p class="normal">The Web site acts as both an aid for museum visitation 
		and an on-line art resource. Its major sections are The Collection, Special 
		Exhibitions, Events, Visit, General Info, Education, Interactive Media, 
		Join, Shop, and Electronic Postcards. There are also prominent links on 
		the home page to ArtsConnectEd, press releases, and highlighted exhibitions 
		and events. The site has been noted for its in-depth permanent collection 
		programs (e.g. <i>Modernism</i>, <i>Arts of Asia</i>) and on-line curriculum 
		units (also available through ArtsConnectEd). Awards and high use have 
		testified to the quality of these programs. There is presently no e-commerce 
		or transaction-based activity on the site. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">What Specifically <i>is What Clicks</i> Measuring?</h1>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Awareness <i>—</i>&gt; Use <i>—</i>&gt; 
		Satisfaction</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Audience awareness, use, and satisfaction<i> — </i>with 
		each condition leading to the next<i> — </i>constitute the <i>What 
		Clicks</i> mantra. Because of the breadth of the Institute&#39;s electronic 
		media resources and the impossibility of studying audience relationships 
		within that entire range, there was a desire to limit the scope of the 
		<i>What Clicks</i> project. It was decided that the main focus of <i>What 
		Clicks — </i>in terms of media resources<i> — </i>would be the 
		Interactive Directory, two of the 17 Interactive Learning Stations (<i>Arts 
		of Asia</i> and <i>African Art and Culture</i>), and the museum&#39;s general 
		Web site<i> — artsmia.org</i>. General public awareness of all of 
		these resources was also measured, and basic demographics were captured 
		to see if awareness levels were consistent across groups.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Process Outline</h1>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Baseline Research <i>—</i>&gt; Interpretation/Analysis 
		<i>—</i>&gt; Enrichment/Redesign <i>—</i>&gt; Follow-up Research</h2>
	  <p class="normal">The project process can be reduced to a general arc, starting 
		with baseline audience measurement for benchmarking; then analysis and 
		interpretation of findings; a six-month period of enrichment and redesign; 
		then a second round of audience measurement, performed exactly a year 
		after the baseline measurement and conducted with identical instruments. 
		Interim and summary reporting, both internally (to MIA staff) and to the 
		field, are woven into the process. The project is currently in the enrichment 
		and redesign phase.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Getting Started</h2>
	  <p class="normal">The first step was to form a project team that included 
		the museum&#39;s Assistant Director and members of the Interactive Media Group, 
		the Education Division, the External Affairs Division (which includes 
		Marketing and Communications), and the museum&#39;s Visitor and Member Services 
		department. These people would work directly with the research data and 
		are primary decision-makers in matters regarding the Institute&#39;s media 
		programs.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Logic Model and Evaluation Plan</h2>
	  <p class="normal">To focus the project team&#39;s thinking, a consultant (evaluator 
		Mary Ellen Murphy) was hired to work with the group in developing a project 
		evaluation plan, including a logic model. This also addressed a grant 
		component, since an outcome-based process and final report had been requested 
		by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Before any audience research 
		was done, the project team attempted to envision a process whereby the 
		initial goals of the project might be met (the goals being to increase 
		audience awareness, use, and satisfaction regarding the Institute&#39;s electronic 
		media resources, and to share the process that led to that outcome with 
		peer institutions). The resulting logic model is expressed in a spreadsheet 
		that includes columns headed by these questions: </p>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> What are the desired outcomes?</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal">Who will benefit? </span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> What key activities will bring 
		  about the intended changes? </span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal">What are the inherent values of 
		  the proposed actions?</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> What are the — perhaps hidden 
		  — assumptions about the actions? </span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> What kind of lasting impact is 
		  expected?</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="normal">The project team met several times in this phase, each 
		time getting closer to consensus <i>—</i> an important condition 
		if the project was to get off to a good start. This process revealed the 
		kinds of questions that the team was most interested in answering and 
		eventually informed the survey instruments themselves. </p>
	  <p class="normal">An evaluation plan was developed so there would be a way 
		for the project team to measure success after what was sure to be a long 
		and complex process, and also to provide some early, agreed-upon project 
		structure. The plan matrix included:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <b><i>Outcomes</i></b> (e.g. 
		  increase on-line visitors&#39; awareness of the depth and breadth of artsmia.org)</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <b><i>Indicators</i></b> (e.g. 
		  increased duration of user sessions)</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <b><i>Methods</i></b> (e.g. Web 
		  stats <i>—</i> pre-/post-comparison of user session duration and 
		  server directories visited)</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <b><i>Person(s) Responsible</i></b></span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <b><i>Timeline</i></b>.</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Survey Instruments and Methodology</h2>
	  <p class="normal">With an agreed-upon logic model and evaluation plan in 
		hand, a consulting firm (Cincinnatus, Inc., <a href="http://www.cincinnatus.com/">http://www.cincinnatus.com</a>) 
		was hired to develop the instruments to be used in the audience research 
		and then to carry out the baseline study itself. The project team and 
		consulting firm identified the following research instruments:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal">An <i>Internal Focus Group</i>, 
		  involving staff identification of existing best practices in interactive 
		  media production at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> a <i>Usability Lab Study</i></span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> a <i>Technology Awareness Survey</i> 
		  to be given to people walking into the museum</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> a <i>Directory Survey</i> for 
		  people who had just used the Interactive Directory</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> a <i>Learning Station Survey</i> 
		  for people who have just used one of the two Learning Stations being 
		  studied</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> an <i>Online Web Survey</i> (delivered 
		  via both pop-up and pop-under windows) which would appear on the artsmia.org 
		  Web site for a limited time period.</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="normal">There was also existing data from a previous audience 
		survey that included some questions about media and technology, as well 
		as demographic information for comparison.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Instrument Details</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Each instrument was developed collaboratively among the 
		project team, the research firm, and the IMG. Feeding into this process 
		were the logic model and evaluation plan developed earlier. </p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Internal Focus Group</h3>
	  <p class="normal">The <i>What Clicks </i>project came at a time in the Institute&#39;s 
		development when a great deal of successful work in the realm of interactive 
		media had already taken place over the course of more than a decade. To 
		identify the best practices that had contributed to the museum&#39;s success 
		so far, a roundtable discussion was held. It was facilitated and recorded 
		by members of the Cincinnatus consulting firm, and included several members 
		of the Interactive Media Group and the Chair of The Minneapolis Institute 
		of Arts&#39; Education Division. A transcript of the conversation resulted, 
		as did lists of Best Practices and Goals. This instrument was implemented 
		before any of the others and proved to be a catalyst for thinking about 
		how far the museum had come, and where it was hoping to go next in terms 
		of interactive technology.</p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Usability Lab Study</h3>
	  <p class="normal">The Institute was fortunate to partner with Minneapolis-based 
		Target Corporation in the Usability Lab Study. While the <i>What Clicks</i> 
		project team brought questions, ideas, and desired outcomes to Target, 
		it was Target&#39;s well-developed process, their ability to accommodate a 
		slightly unusual (read non-commercial) client, and their newly reinstalled 
		facilities that made this study work.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Three days of testing were planned, with three subjects 
		(users) per day. (In the end, one subject was unable to attend, so the 
		total was eight.) The users had been screened based on the desire to have 
		a good mix of: people who had personally visited the Institute versus 
		those who had not; museum members versus non-members; people with a high 
		degree of interest in art versus those with moderate interest. Experience 
		with Web design was a quality that ruled potential subjects out. A monetary 
		incentive of $50 was offered to compensate for each user&#39;s time commitment.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Upon testing, each subject was led into the facility and 
		briefly interviewed. Some of the initial screening questions were repeated 
		(Have you been to The Minneapolis Institute of Arts? for example) and, 
		for the first time, users were asked if they&#39;d been to the Institute&#39;s 
		Web site.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Then, sitting at a monitored computer setup with a browser 
		set to an unrelated Web site, each user was asked to find The Minneapolis 
		Institute of Arts&#39; site. Following this step, users were given several 
		scenarios <i>—</i> one at a time <i>—</i> and given several 
		minutes to complete them. The facilitator got them started, then left 
		the room while encouraging them to verbalize their experience and impressions 
		as they went. Audio and video recordings were made as the sessions unfolded. 
		In the control room, members of the project team and other Institute staff 
		observed the tests and recorded their own comments. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The first scenario given the users was simply to browse 
		the site based on their personal interest. The next was to imagine they 
		had visitors coming in a few weeks and wanted to get an idea of what would 
		be going on at the museum at that time. Then, with their visitors&#39; arrival 
		just days away, they were asked to get more logistical information. Sometimes 
		the facilitator would re-enter the room to ask a specific question like, 
		&#34;Would you be able to see [a particular film] as part of your visit?&#34; 
		or &#34;What would you do if your visitors&#39; children were especially energetic?&#34;</p>
	  <p class="normal">Other scenarios were designed to get users to specific 
		parts of the site. In one, users were encouraged to research the work 
		of Frank Lloyd Wright. Ideally, this would get them into the Permanent 
		Collection section as well as to one of the site&#39;s many rich interactive 
		sections <i>—</i> in this case the <i>Unified Vision</i> project 
		(<a href="http://www.artsmia.org/unified-vision">http://www.artsmia.org/unified-vision</a>). 
		Another scenario encouraged users to find and send an E-Postcard.</p>
	  <p class="normal">After each session, the project team would meet in a conference 
		room with Target staff to review the session and make notes about observations. 
		This led to a list of findings, some of which turned up time and again 
		over the 3-day period. This list became an important working document. 
		The IMG is relying heavily on this list during enrichment and redesign.</p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeader">Technology Awareness Survey</h3>
	  <p class="normal">In an effort to measure general awareness of museum technology 
		among museum visitors, 379 visitors aged 15 or older were randomly intercepted 
		on their way into the museum and given an interviewer-administered questionnaire. 
		This took place between the dates of August 2 and August 15, 2002. The 
		questions were designed to get at visitor awareness of various facets 
		of the museum (restaurant, coffee shop, Interactive Directory, etc.), 
		and allow for comparisons between technology-based and non-technology-based 
		amenities. Visitors were also asked when, if ever, they&#39;d visited last, 
		and basic demographic data was also gathered. A small incentive gift was 
		offered (a packet of MIA postcards).</p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Directory Survey</h3>
	  <p class="normal">A total of 128 Interactive Directory users were given 
		a self-administered survey upon being observed using the Directory. This 
		took place between August 16 and 29, 2002. The original sampling plan 
		based on usage history was abandoned because of unexpectedly low traffic 
		during the study period, and, instead, the researchers intercepted everyone 
		who touched the Directory screen. The questions measured awareness (e.g. 
		How did you first become aware of the Interactive Directory?), motivation 
		(e.g. What initially motivated you to use the Directory?), and satisfaction 
		(Users chose from a list ranging from Extremely Satisfied to Not at All 
		Satisfied). Further questions asked specifically what could be done to 
		improve the Directory, and, again, basic demographic information was captured. 
		Packages of MIA postcards were given as an incentive for participation.</p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Learning Stations Survey</h3>
	  <p class="normal">Museum volunteers intercepted 105 users of the two Interactive 
		Learning Stations between August 16 and September 1, 2002. Because two 
		Learning Stations in different parts of the building were being studied, 
		motion detectors and pagers were used to alert the volunteer when a Station 
		was in use. Each Learning Station&#39;s motion detector triggered an auto-dialer 
		which caused the volunteer&#39;s pager to indicate which Station was occupied. 
		The volunteer could then go to the Station in time to intercept the user. 
		Users were given a self-administered questionnaire similar to the one 
		used for the Directory. Again, packages of postcards were offered to survey 
		participants.</p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Online Web Survey</h3>
	  <p class="normal">Between August 28 and September 11, 2002, a pop-up survey 
		appeared as viewers entered the artsmia.org Web site. The pop-up window 
		<i>—</i> designed to graphically complement the site aesthetic<i> 
		— </i>contained text that invited visitors to participate in a survey 
		by providing an email address. Those who complied received an email invitation 
		to complete the on-line survey. It was essential that visitors fill out 
		the survey <i>post</i>-visit. If visitors initially declined, a second 
		window popped <i>under</i> their main browser window, with the idea that 
		visitors would eventually see it upon exiting their browser. The pop-under 
		again invited participation through email, but also offered the option 
		of completing the survey immediately. A chance for a $500 gift certificate 
		to Amazon.com was offered as an incentive. A total of 573 people completed 
		the survey. Considering that there were 35,357 site visits during the 
		survey period, the response rate was 1.62%. The on-line survey was designed 
		to measure awareness, use, and satisfaction regarding the Web site itself, 
		and collected demographic information consistent with the other instruments.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Major Findings</h1>
	  <p>With <i>reams</i> of data from the surveys and countless subjective impressions 
		from the more observation-based instruments, the project team and the 
		members of the Interactive Media Group faced the formidable tasks of interpretation 
		and analysis. A pattern quickly emerged. It was immediately clear that 
		satisfaction was extremely high across the board. Once visitors found 
		their way to the Institute&#39;s electronic resources, they generally reported 
		positive experiences with the Directory, Learning Stations, and Web site. 
		On the other hand, general awareness and, in some cases, usage, scored 
		relatively low. This suggested that the biggest opportunity would be in 
		getting more people to the resources. In brainstorming actions to be pursued 
		in the enrichment phase, emphasis was placed on strategies that might 
		increase awareness and use. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Of course, much light was shed on possible satisfaction 
		enhancements as well <i>—</i> particularly through the in-depth research, 
		as in the usability lab. Some relatively simple methods were also employed 
		subsequently to get at the satisfaction questions (For example, Visitor 
		and Member Services staff and Security personnel confirmed in interviews 
		that museum visitors&#39; top request is for help in locating specific works 
		of art or types of art in the museum. This information supported survey 
		data as well as decisions about improvements for the Interactive Directory.).</p>
	  <p class="normal">It should be noted that curatorial perspective was brought 
		to the project at this point, and that the initial findings were reported 
		to the entire staff. In fact, an internal communications plan was developed 
		to get staff thinking and talking about the project, and to help generate 
		interest in <i>—</i> and support for <i>—</i> eventual changes.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Directory Findings</h2>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Awareness of the Interactive 
		  Directory, when compared with other museum elements, scored relatively 
		  low (35% total aided and unaided awareness compared with 89% for both

		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Most awareness came through direct

		</ul>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Interactive Learning Station Findings</h2>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> Learning Stations scored slightly 
		  higher than the Directory in terms of awareness (43% to 35%)</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal">Most awareness came from direct 
		  observation (75%).</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> 58% of users of one Learning

		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> Half of users say the Stations

		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> When asked how the Learning

		  physical setting.</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal">People tend to feel the Learning 
		  Stations are too isolated. 78% of users would like this kind of resource 
		  &#34;in the galleries close to the art.&#34;</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Web Site Findings</h2>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal">Museum visitors have a higher 
		  awareness of the museum&#39;s Web site (54%) than of its Directory (35%) 
		  or Learning Stations (43%).</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> A higher percentage of museum 
		  members are aware of the Web site (63%) than of non-Members (49%).</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> 1/4 of Web site visitors are 
		  museum members, while 1/3 of museum visitors are members.</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Top motivators for visiting the 
		  Web site in order of popularity were: to find specific information about 
		  the museum, to plan a trip to the museum, to learn about art for personal 
		  enrichment, just browsing, to learn about art for a class assignment, 
		  and to look for employment opportunities.</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Web visitors tend to be younger 
		  than museum visitors and reside further from the museum, and a higher

		<li class="normal"><span class="normal">Repeat visitation to the Web site

		<li class="normal"><span class="normal">80% of Web visitors found what

		<li class="normal"><span class="normal">Top ideas for improvement included 
		  more works of art on the site and more information about works currently 
		  on view in the museum and on the site.</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Usability Lab findings showed 
		  that while users didn&#39;t necessarily expect the depth and breadth of 
		  art information on the site, they were particularly pleased to find 
		  it. General impressions were very positive (look of site, amount of 
		  information). Most said the on-line experience revived their interest 
		  in visiting the museum itself. </span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Usability Lab findings also indicated 
		  some trouble with the relationship between the Visit and General Info 
		  sections, navigation back to the home page, understanding the calendar 
		  function and image zooming controls, and the relationship between the 
		  Collection section, the on-line multimedia programs, and ArtsConnectEd.</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">From Analysis to Action</h1>
	  <p>The next step was to approach the enrichment and redesign phase with 
		four separate but related projects in mind. Three would be based on the 
		medium-specific resources (Interactive Directory, Learning Stations, and 
		Web site) and the fourth would be a general marketing campaign that would 
		raise awareness of all of the above. </p>
	  <p>The project team, having worked through an analysis of the data with 
		input from the IMG, decided to form four working groups <i>—</i> 
		with each group addressing one of the major projects to be completed during 
		enrichment and redesign. Each working group was to be chaired by a member 
		of the project team, and was to include resource members from the IMG, 
		Visitor and Member Services, and The Minneapolis Institute of Arts&#39; External 
		Affairs division (which includes Marketing and Communications). The working 
		groups would meet anywhere from one to three times and report their recommendations 
		back to the project team. </p>
	  <p>This process got underway and led to a clearer picture of what actual 
		action steps were to be taken. In the course of planning these actions, 
		the project team drew up a list of criteria that specific ideas would 
		have to meet.</p>
	  <p>These criteria included:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal">Supported by visitor research</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Doable within <i>What Clicks</i> 
		  enrichment/redesign timeframe (January through July, 2003)</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Doable with <i>What Clicks</i> 
		  budget/MIA staff resources</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal">Supports MIA Strategic Plan</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal">Consistent with Grant/Logic Model</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Benchmarks exist</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal">Minimal long-term cost implications</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Director&#39;s Approval</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>The process yielded a realistic set of proposed actions that were then 
		taken to the Museum Director, who <i>—</i> having been primed with 
		regular project updates <i>—</i> provided a thoughtful and thorough 
		review. Discussions between the Director and the project team took place 
		and, ultimately, the Director&#39;s approval paved the way for enrichment 
		and redesign. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Case by Case: Recommended Actions</h1>
	  <p>As the project is currently in the midst of the enrichment and redesign 
		phase, what follows are general descriptions of the kinds of actions being 
		taken in the four major projects.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Interactive Directory</h2>
	  <p>Key ideas to emerge regarding the Directory include recasting the concept 
		to make it clearer to visitors and to better address their immediate needs: 
		What&#39;s going on right now in the museum? How can I find a specific work 
		of art or type of art? The plan is to redesign the Directory&#39;s interface, 
		contents, and installation in its current location. Next, additional locations 
		will be tested. The Directory <i>—</i> currently a multimedia program 
		not connected to the event database or collections management system, 
		which feed the Web site, will be rewritten as a Web-based program. In 
		response to findings indicating a desire for livelier graphics and images, 
		a video preview of the museum&#39;s galleries and other offerings is under 
		consideration. This preview would most likely be incorporated into the 
		design as an additional <i>—</i> non-interactive <i>—</i> screen. 
		The Directory will also be included in the general marketing campaign 
		as an important component of in-museum technology.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Interactive Learning Stations</h2>
	  <p>With the positive outcome that visitors find the Learning Station contents 
		highly satisfying but have difficulty finding the Learning Stations in 
		the first place, most of the changes will be physical ones. Work is underway 
		to make the stations more visible through consistent signage and more 
		lively attract screens. In some cases, dramatic changes to installations 
		will be made, including the addition of two-sided vitrines in walls that 
		currently hide the Stations. Addressing the desire to better incorporate 
		these resources in the galleries, closer to the art, several instances 
		have been identified where small LCDs can be installed next to objects. 
		These screens will display object-specific video clips. If successful, 
		this idea will open a whole new avenue for in-museum media. Also, the 
		general marketing campaign will attempt to raise visitor awareness of 
		Interactive Learning Stations as effective tools for learning about the 
		collection.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Web Site</h2>
	  <p>Again, with awareness being a key factor, the major effort for the Web 
		site will be to get more people to the site. These include more frequently 
		and prominently featuring the site&#39;s URL in print publications and on 
		<i>take-away</i> items, better using the member&#39;s magazine as a promotional 
		vehicle, creating an on-line version of <i>Recent Acquisitions</i> exhibitions, 
		asking museum staff to incorporate the URL in their email signatures, 
		and purchasing on-line ads. The findings of the usability lab will guide 
		changes to the site&#39;s navigation, structure and contents. Also under consideration 
		is the addition of a new section featuring some of the Institute&#39;s recent 
		acquisitions <i>—</i> a concept that is mirrored with ongoing <i>Recent 
		Acquisitions </i>exhibitions in the museum itself.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Marketing Campaign</h2>
	  <p>As of this writing, a museum technology marketing campaign is being designed 
		to attract more people to the Web site, Learning Stations, and Directories. 
		The campaign will be timed to have had substantial impact by August, &#39;03, 
		when re-measurement is done. A healthy portion of the grant funding has 
		been set aside for this very purpose.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeaderSmall">Questions and Issues</h1>
	  <p>As we&#39;ve worked to get a grasp of the findings, proposed enhancements, 
		and process complexities, several questions have arisen.</p>
	  <ol>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Given that we&#39;ve decided to use 
		  the very same instruments in both the baseline and follow-up research, 
		  how do we measure new ideas that have come out of the process? For example, 
		  the study clearly indicated that users of the Interactive Learning Stations 
		  would like to see pieces of those programs more closely integrated with 
		  the objects in the galleries. This led to the idea of installing LCD 
		  screens near some works of art. What this means is that the environment 
		  itself will be changing in a way that the survey instrument was not 
		  designed to measure. The Learning Station surveys were given to people 
		  who had just finished using one of the two Stations that were part of 
		  the study. How will we measure the impact of the LCDs? There are two 
		  potential solutions. One is to design a mini-study focused specifically 
		  on the LCDs. The other is to see if the Technology Awareness Survey 
		  indicates any increase specifically due to this new technology. It is 
		  likely that both solutions will be pursued. This methodological challenge 
		  also applies to the proposed physical changes to Learning Stations not 
		  initially studied. Of course, we could have decided to be strict with 
		  ourselves and require that each suggested change be measurable with 
		  the existing instruments, but that would have defeated the larger purpose. 
		  </span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> With the Web site constantly 
		  evolving, with changes big and small, how will we remember what state 
		  it was in during the initial survey period? How can we <i>freeze</i> 
		  the site so as to return to it a year later? While it&#39;s next to impossible 
		  to technically save a state of such a dynamic site, we have incorporated 
		  a <i>Web Change Log</i> into our work process. When changes are made, 
		  they are recorded in a spreadsheet, with Nature of Change, Date, and 
		  Reason for Change (Some changes are happening in response to the <i>What 
		  Clicks</i> project, while others are part of the <i>normal </i>process 
		  that would be happening in the absence of <i>What Clicks.</i>). The 
		  <i>Web Change Log</i> will allow at least a crude way to mentally reconstruct 
		  the site as it was when the initial research was conducted.</span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal">Given a record of growth in Web 
		  visitation at the rate of about 50% per year over the last several years, 
		  can we assume that that rate would have continued this year, and that 
		  any increase <i>beyond</i> 50% could be attributed to enrichments coming 
		  out of the <i>What Clicks </i>project? Again, separating <i>natural</i> 
		  growth from that caused by project initiatives will be tricky. Even 
		  without a major research project in the works, the Web site would be 
		  undergoing change. Those changes simply wouldn&#39;t be as driven by audience 
		  data. One thing to watch <i>—</i> to the extent possible <i>—</i> 
		  will be where people are going on the site and where they&#39;re coming 
		  from. Also, any available external benchmarks for Web usage, particularly 
		  for museum sites, will be monitored. </span></li>
		<li class="normal"><span class="normal"> When multiple changes are made 
		  over the course of many months, how will we know specifically which 
		  change caused which result? This is a hazard of almost any research 
		  project. Resources don&#39;t allow for the measurement of each change, yet 
		  it may be possible to find opportunities for measurement as changes 
		  are implemented (e.g. the use of Web stats to show the popularity of 
		  a new section of the site). As much in-process measurement as is possible 
		  will be done during the current phase. </span></li>
	  </ol>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusion</h1>
	  <p>Since this is an interim report, ultimate conclusions are still to come. 
		The proof of the pudding, as they say, is in the eating. While much has 
		been learned, it remains to be seen what impact the current phase of enrichment 
		and redesign will have on audience awareness, use, and satisfaction. The 
		emphasis is now on implementation structure and creative development. 
		Currently, the project team is meeting monthly, the working groups are 
		each keeping regular meeting schedules, the IMG has its own structure 
		of project leadership and coordination, and ongoing museum-wide communication 
		is taking place. </p>
	  <p>We look forward to the follow-up measurement and to sharing the results 
		with our museum colleagues. </p>
