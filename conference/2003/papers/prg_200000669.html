	  <p class="AbstractText"><span>The Herb Lubalin Study Center of Design and 
		Typography at The Cooper Union School of Art periodically offers The Lubalin 
		Curatorial Fellowship to enable recipient to engage in art and design 
		related research and curate a public exhibition based on the research. 
		In 2000, The Center granted the Fellowship for the exhibition &#34;Chinese 
		Graphic Design towards the International Sphere,&#34; which displayed the 
		works of more than 70 prominent Chinese graphic designers and studios 
		from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau. The exhibition ran September 
		4 to December 1, 2001, at The Gallery of Herb Lubalin Study Center, enriching 
		the visual experiences of the American audience and providing students 
		of graphic design with a greater understanding of the historical perspective 
		of design in the Greater China region. After this exhibition closed, The 
		Center began exploring the possible transfer of the exhibition to a virtual 
		presence on the Worldwide Web. Upon receipt of this suggestion from the 
		Center, the exhibition&#39;s curator began analyzing the critical issues involved 
		in &#34;transforming&#34; a physical exhibition into a hyper-reality environment. 
		After considering the various display possibilities available in Web format, 
		the curator decided to adopt a visual based mouse-over technique rather 
		than a data based html coded web page. This paper examines how the curator 
		utilized the Web as a medium to extend the exhibition previously restricted 
		by physical accessibility and time. Comparisons will be made between the 
		original display system design of the exhibition and the final interface 
		and interactive design for the on-line exhibition. </span></p>

	  <h1 class="SubHeader"><span>Introduction</span></h1>
	  <p class="normal">The Lubalin Curatorial Fellowship 2000, offered by The Cooper 
		Union School of Art, was awarded for a proposed research project examining 
		the history of Chinese graphic design. The ensuing research resulted in 
		a public exhibition at The Gallery of Herb Lubalin Study Center of Design 
		and Typography, which held from September 4 to December 1, 2001. This 
		paper reviews how this public exhibition was transformed into an on-line 
		exhibition. The background of this exhibition project is given to enhance 
		the reader&#39;s understanding of the project. The paper continues with an 
		interpretation of the design concept and exhibition contents. It also 
		summarizes the difficulties the curator encountered in transforming the 
		physical exhibition into an on-line format, with the limited resources 
		available. It examines how different Web design techniques can be utilized 
		to construct a virtual exhibition approximating a physical exhibition 
		as closely as possible. The paper&#39;s objective is to document the design 
		processes of both the on-site and on-line exhibition devoted to Chinese 
		graphic design. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader"><span>Background</span></h1>
	  <p class="normal">The Herb Lubalin Study Center of Design and Typography 
		at The Cooper Union School of Art offers The Lubalin Curatorial Fellowship 
		periodically to enable recipients to engage in art and design related 
		research, and later to curate a public exhibition or public performance 
		based on the results of that research or creative exploration. In early 
		2000, The Center released through various media a call for applications 
		to the Fellowship. The Center received a large number of proposals, making 
		competition for the Fellowship keen. Interviews of finalists were conducted 
		in April 2000, and the winner of the Fellowship was announced the following 
		month. The Fellowship was awarded for the proposal entitled &#34;Chinese Graphic 
		Design towards the International Sphere,&#34; an emerging area that is as 
		yet unknown to many American/Western audiences and designers. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The information available to the Western world about modern 
		Chinese graphic design has been limited, and its history and development 
		is likewise little known throughout much of the Greater China region. 
		Unlike the Western world, design in Greater China has a relatively short 
		history, and is not yet recognized as a twentieth-century phenomenon expanding 
		simultaneously with industrial development, commerce, economy, and culture 
		(Wong 2001). All disciplines in design are relatively new, and all the 
		more so throughout Mainland China. Matthew Turner (1995), one of the few 
		Western historians to examine Chinese design, has recovered the early 
		history of Hong Kong industrial design and product manufacturing. Chinese-trained 
		design scholar Shou Zhi Wang (1995) focused his observation on design 
		activity under communism before the start of the Open Door Policy in 1979. 
		Both Turner and Wang first published their work on Chinese design history 
		before the economy of Mainland China took off in the 1990s. Their work 
		demonstrated the common academic practice of separating investigations 
		of Chinese society, addressing Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Taiwan separately, 
		rather than using the relatively new concept of &#34;Greater China.&#34; </p>
	  <p class="normal">The parameters of the Chinese graphic design research 
		as completed for the Fellowship encompassed not only works by designers 
		in the Chinese speaking region, but also included design styles that represent 
		interactions between Western graphic design theory and Chinese cultural 
		symbols, values, and aesthetic directions from the 1960s to 1990s. The 
		expression of this style sometimes occurs as a direct representation of 
		Chinese cultural icons, or alternatively as an abstract ideological or 
		metaphorical interpretation of Chinese cultural values through universal 
		symbols. This visual style provides evidence of the relationship of design 
		and its cultural context, which work together in response to change over 
		time. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The development of the international scene in graphic 
		design first included contributions almost exclusively from the West, 
		mainly the United States and Europe, and then some elements from Japan 
		were introduced in the 1970s (Wong 2001). The full picture of international 
		graphic design up to the present will be enhanced with the addition of 
		contributions from China. At the same time, international elements have 
		gradually been introduced into graphic design in Mainland China, thus 
		creating a two-way exchange of influence. As non-Chinese theories and 
		creative techniques were introduced in the Greater China region, the region 
		was moving onto the international stage and completing a creative logic 
		that incorporated influences of East and West. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Yet, the proposal for the Fellowship suggested strengthening 
		the link between these two spheres by examining and introducing graphic 
		design works from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Mainland China and Macau to the international 
		audience through the exhibition at The Herb Lubalin Study Center of Design 
		Typography at The Cooper Union School of Art. The exhibition aimed to 
		de-mystify the image of Chinese cultures through contemporary graphic 
		design from the Greater China region, using this exhibition as a communicative 
		medium, a product of research and expression of information messages (Kaplan, 
		1995). The exhibit endeavored to increase awareness of Chinese graphic 
		design by bringing it onto an international stage. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader"><span>Research Parameters</span></h1>
	  <p><span>Although Chinese graphic design is of major significance in world 
		graphic design history, it has not yet been systematically examined, in 
		part because of the tendency in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China for practitioners 
		and academicians to more in separate spheres. Whatever the reason, the 
		historical development of modern Chinese graphic design should be considered 
		an integral part of the story of world graphic design history. </span></p>
	  <p><span>The scope of the research focused on commercial graphic design 
		work, including posters, logos, books, editorials, promotional literature, 
		advertisements, and Chinese typography from throughout the Greater China 
		region since the 1970s, with basic visual and narrative establishment 
		of background from earlier decades. To a certain extent, graphic design 
		in Greater China is developing with similar contextual factors as in the 
		Western countries, but still differs in regards to time frame as well 
		as political and cultural influences (Wong 2001).</span></p>
	  <p><span>Among fundamental differences between graphic design in the West 
		and in Greater China, political climate is one of the most critical. During 
		the past decade, with important political solidifications taking place, 
		the various locales within the region have increased cultural and economic 
		exchange to the extent that it no longer makes sense to consider each 
		locale as a separate entity. The research project took the potentially 
		controversial position that Chinese design history should be studied as 
		one unified whole, rather than individual studies of several separate 
		entities. The objective of the research was to unearth &#34;a&#34; history of 
		Chinese graphic design and begin building the foundations of this history 
		from a unified perspective. </span></p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader"><span>Research Methodology and Process</span></h1>
	  <p><span>The research for the exhibition used a historical perspective to 
		trace major developments in the history of Chinese graphic design from 
		the past three decades in Greater China. The research focused specifically 
		on graphic design, examining artistic and commercial visual communication 
		activities. Through conducting interviews, archival research and a longitudinal 
		examination of commercial graphic design works in different locales of 
		the region, it demonstrates the struggle for the expression of Chinese 
		style throughout the years by integrating modern graphic design theories 
		and creative techniques with Chinese cultural heritages. </span></p>
	  <p><span>The first phase involved the identification of creative directions 
		pursued in Chinese graphic design in the past three decades. In this phase, 
		the procedure was divided into four parts according to locale, with the 
		examination carried out in the same way for each. First, design professionals 
		were identified and interviewed about their understanding of graphic design, 
		experience and works. Secondly, representatives of professional design 
		associations were interviewed about their history and activities. Then, 
		design educators and institutes were visited and interviewed about their 
		history, teaching method, and philosophies of design and education. Lastly, 
		secondary research was conducted using publications such as trade journals 
		and design award annuals. </span></p>
	  <p><span>A total of 72 designers were interviewed and included in the exhibition, 
		including 26 from Hong Kong, 14 from Taiwan, 29 from Mainland China, and 
		3 from Macau, with more than 220 pieces of work displayed in the exhibition. 
		After both artifacts and secondary materials the were collected, a triangulate 
		method was conducted to cross-check the accuracy of information obtained. 
		This accuracy check, along with the creation of a database of designers, 
		works, and events, concluded the first phase of the research project. 
		The second phase analyzed the artifacts and materials collected for evidence 
		of historical trends, evidence of influence from one designer or local 
		to another, stylistic developments, and significant themes. Through this 
		analysis, labels and definitions were developed for particular styles 
		and themes of collected design works. </span></p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader"><span>Categorization of the Artifacts</span></h1>
	  <p><span>The contents of the exhibition have been categorized into 11 groups 
		in order to provide a longitudinal examination of collected works from 
		different locales. The collection assembled is a reflection of the diverse 
		culture and facets of modern Chinese life that have influenced the region&#39;s 
		evolving graphic design. </span></p>
	  <p><span>The first group presented the &#34;origins and development before the 
		1970s&#34; of graphic design in the region by displaying artifacts ranging 
		from a communist propaganda poster from the 1960s to commercial works 
		by Henry Steiner in the same period. The second group created a picture 
		of the &#34;Western influences in the Design Education of Hong Kong&#34; in the 
		1970s. The third group demonstrated the emerging &#34;hybridizing West/East 
		Elements in Design in the 1970s and 1980s,&#34; while the fourth was devoted 
		to the developing concept of &#34;national identity&#34; through the title of 
		&#34;remapping the territory in the 1990s.&#34; The fifth group on display collected 
		&#34;cultural and film posters&#34; from the four locales in the region. The sixth 
		group was dedicated exclusively to one of the most internationally known 
		Chinese graphic designers, Kan Tai-keung, whose signature works have appeared 
		in prominent international design magazines. The seventh collection provided 
		a unique space for the &#34;hit hot items&#34; of CD packaging design, graphic 
		design books, and experimental publications. The eighth display consisted 
		of current design activities within the region under the title of  
		&#34;inter-regional thematic poster exhibition since 1995.&#34; The ninth and 
		tenth groups presented samples of &#34;promotional posters&#34; and &#34;experimental 
		posters&#34; respectively. Finally, the last group exhibited samples of poster, 
		designed for China&#39;s bid for the 2008 Beijing Olympics under the title 
		of &#34;future event.&#34; Together, these ten collections devoted to separate 
		eras and themes were united to form a cohesive exhibition.</span></p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader"><span>On-site: The Design of the Exhibition in a Physical 
		Space</span></h1>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Exhibition Environment Study</h1>
	  <p><span>The Herb Lubalin Study Center of Design and Typography at The Cooper 
		Union School of Art is located on the second floor of the Foundation Building. 
		The Center consists of an office, an archive library and exhibition areas 
		for public displays. The archive library also serves as a reading room 
		for The Center&#39;s users. The exhibition area is comprised of two gallery 
		rooms with display showcases in different sizes, and two respective hallways 
		with walls and display showcases. Due to the size limitations of the various 
		showcases, the design of the expedition faced some challenges. The exact 
		measurements of each display unit and wall space in each exhibition section 
		became crucial factors in the selection of exhibits. </span></p>
	  <p><span>Exhibition areas are divided into East Gallery, West Gallery, South 
		Hallway and West Hallway. There is no specific or designated entrance 
		or exit to the exhibition areas. In addition, The Center is adjacent to 
		The Houghton Gallery, the main exhibition gallery of the School of Art 
		at The Cooper Union. With these two physical constraints, the exhibition 
		needed to create a clear flow of direction for its display system, as 
		well as establish an identity distinguishable from the concurrent exhibition 
		being held at The Houghton Gallery. </span></p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Designing Process</h1>
	  <p><span>Since the curator was located in Hong Kong during the yearlong 
		research period to conduct all interviews throughout the Greater China 
		region in person, most communication between the curator and the Center 
		was conducted via email and the exchange of visuals in digital format. 
		To maintain clear and accurate communication throughout the design process 
		of the exhibition, the curator first took study photos of the exhibition 
		environment while physically present at The Center. With ample assistance 
		from The Center&#39;s personnel, including Mr. Philippe Apeloig, the curator 
		of The Center and professor of graphic design, Ms Ann Holcomb, the director 
		of the archive, and her assistant, Ms Alyse Yang, the physical design 
		and execution of the exhibition were carried out smoothly. The Center&#39;s 
		provision of a detailed floor plan of the exhibition environment enabled 
		the curator to compose the layout of the exhibition design visually. Using 
		the exact measurements of each exhibition section and display showcases, 
		the curator produced a design and production visual for The Center staff 
		to refer to.</span></p>
	  <p align="left"><span>First, a design plan with actual exhibits placed in 
		a grid background was produced. </span></p>

	  <p align="left" class="MsoCaption">Figure 1: The Design Plan.</p>
	  <p align="left">The<span> design plan of each exhibition section was first 
		composed using desktop publishing software, then saved in jpeg format 
		for email attachments. Upon receipt of the curator&#39;s email, The Center 
		was able to download the attached visual plan file, and print out a hard 
		copy in color to use as a guideline for the exhibition layout. Secondly, 
		to ensure clear communication, the curator also created a set of photomontages 
		in Adobe Photoshop illustrating the desired finished appearance of the 
		exhibition. </span></p>

	  <p align="left"><span>With both detailed measurement plans and visual references, 
		the exhibition production staff and Center assistants had a clear picture 
		of the desired design of the exhibition. </span></p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Exhibition Design</h1>
	  <p><span>The design issue of the exhibition formed the major concern of 
		the entire project. The curator identified the major design problems of 
		the exhibition to be the different circulation patterns and showcases 
		present within the exhibition environment. The creation of a unique visual 
		identity for the theme of the exhibition, &#34;Chinese graphic design,&#34; was 
		also a challenging task for the curator. Since the exhibition encompasses 
		contemporary Chinese graphic design from different locales throughout 
		Greater China, each locale had its own visual identity within the main 
		framework. The design works from each locale shared both similarities 
		and differences, and the cross-cultural differences were obvious to the 
		curator, a native of Hong Kong. The curator was also concerned with the 
		amount of understanding the largely American audience had about Chinese 
		cultures and their preconceptions of Chinese image and cultural identity. 
		With the goal of the exhibition to introduce contemporary Chinese graphic 
		design to an American audience, the curator decided not to use clich images 
		associated with the American/Western perception of Chinese culture. </span></p>
	  <p><span>The exhibition design adopted a clean visual approach and system 
		by using a color scheme of red, white and black, and free of any traditional 
		Chinese symbol or motif likely to be known to the Western audience. Red 
		was selected for its frequent appearance in Chinese societies in the past 
		and present, and the curator hoped this color would bring just a touch 
		of traditional Chinese design to the modern exhibition. Also, in order 
		to solve a weakness of the physical environment identified by the curator, 
		an 8-inch red stripe was placed approximately 42-inches from the floor 
		throughout the exhibition areas to create a wrap-around effect. This continuous 
		red stripe served to indicate the starting point of the exhibition, beginning 
		at the entrance of The Center area. </span></p>
	  <p><span>The English title of the exhibition (designed by Ms. Mindy Lang, 
		the director of The Center for Design and Typography) appeared on the 
		left-hand side of the entrance area, and the Chinese title (designed by 
		the curator) was located on the right-hand side together with the continuous 
		red-stripe.</span></p>

	  <p align="center"> <span class="MsoCaption">Figure 3: The exhibition location 
		photo #</span></p>
	  <p><span> The red stripe created a continuous look and identity for the 
		exhibition while simultaneously serving as a directional indicator. All 
		exhibits were displayed along the red-stripe, while a guest book for visitors 
		to sign was placed at the end of the exhibition to indicate its end.</span></p>

	  <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 4: The exhibition location photo #2</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Design of the Object Identification System </h1>
	  <p><span>With the limited exhibition space available in The Center, the 
		creation of an object identification system for more than 220 exhibit 
		pieces became another design problem for the curator. As Belcher (1993) 
		declares, &#34;(i)t is frustrating for the visitor if objects are placed on 
		display and are not identified&#34; (p.149). The task was to create an easy 
		object identification system for all exhibits that would work within the 
		limited space available.</span></p>
	  <p><span>In addition, the object labels needed to include basic information 
		about each artifact, such as title of the piece, type of object, creator 
		name, year of creation, locale of origin, and an interpretation of the 
		object (Belcher 1993). Since most of the exhibits were in the Chinese 
		language and the typical visitor would most likely lack the cultural background 
		to understand the context of the design works, the object labels became 
		very important for enabling the visitors understanding of the exhibits. 
		Thus, the creation of labels not only addressed the need for a direct 
		translation of the exhibit but also provided brief contextual information. 
		For example, the object label for a propaganda poster produced in 1960s 
		Mainland China reminds the visitors that English was not included among 
		the six languages the headline was translated into, and that &#34;this omission 
		reflects China&#39;s political stance towards the English speaking world at 
		the time&#34; </span></p>
	  <p align="center"><img src="wong_figure5.jpg" width="400" height="342"/></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 5: Chinese propaganda poster, 1960s</p>
	  <p><span>Throughout the curatorŒs process of writing the object labels, 
		Ms. Ann Holcomb of The Center contributed greatly by offering her points 
		of view as an American audience member. Due to the limited space available 
		in the exhibition areas and the design of the exhibit display system, 
		it was not possible to place each individual object label directly under 
		the corresponding exhibit. In order to save space, the type size of the 
		object label was set in Trebuchet 8.5 point with 1/2-inch margins. The 
		labels were printed on white photo-grade paper using a bubble ink-jet 
		printer and mounted on display board. </span></p>
	  <p><span>The object identification information for each exhibit piece was 
		gathered into groups, and placed in an appropriate position in each section 
		of the exhibit. This system used a one-inch image captured from the exhibit 
		as a visual indication to enable the visitor to identify the object referred 
		to. Object information such as title, type, designer&#39;s name and so forth 
		was placed immediately next to this visual indication.</span></p>

	  <p align="center"> <span class="MsoCaption">Figure 6: Sample of object label</span></p>
	  <p><span>Though more than 220 works were displayed, visitors have no problem 
		identifying objects with the help of this visual referencing system.</span></p>

	  <h1 class="SubHeader"><span>On-line: The Design of the Exhibition in a Hyper-Reality 
		Environment</span></h1>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Goal</h1>
	  <p><span>The exhibition ran from September 4 to December 1, 2001. Although 
		the exhibition was interrupted due to the events of September 11, 2001, 
		it was reopened to the public about a week after the incident. A public 
		lecture by the curator, &#34;The Past and the Future: Politics and History 
		of Graphic Design in China,&#34; also needed to be rescheduled, and was finally 
		presented on October 1, 2001. The Center hosted this public lecture to 
		provide an opportunity for the public to interact with the curator, and 
		gain greater understanding of the background and contents of the exhibition. 
		The lecture was an enjoyable success, with about 100 people in attendance. 
		Unfortunately, the public lecture would be the sole opportunity for face-to-face 
		interaction between the curator and the public. The Center hoped to provide 
		more opportunity to keep communication open, but was unable to do so because 
		of venue, budget and internal constraints.</span></p>
	  <p><span>Because of this limitation, after the exhibition ended The Center 
		expressed interest in continuing this on-site display in virtual space, 
		and the exhibition curator began considering the possible critical issues 
		involved in &#34;transforming&#34; this physical exhibition into a hyper-reality 
		environment. The goal of the on-line version of the exhibition were identical 
		to those of the physical display, and included extending the interaction 
		between the exhibit, the Center and people who were unable to visit the 
		exhibition in person.  Due to this objective, the curator was committed 
		to maintaining the originality and impression of the overall physical 
		exhibition in the on-line version, and to reconstruct as closely as possible 
		the overall visitor experience of the 3-dimensional exhibit. </span></p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Technical Considerations and Constraints</h1>
	  <p><span>Unfortunately, The Center was unable to allocate extra funds for 
		the production of this on-line exhibition. This budget constraint did 
		not allow the curator to employ a technical helper to assist with the 
		computer programming of the web site. With a background in graphic design, 
		the curator voluntarily executed the entire production herself, with assistance 
		from Ms. Ann Holcomb in negotiating with a technical assistant from Web 
		server management at The Cooper Union. Most publications on producing 
		of Web sites that the curator consulted, such as <i>Web Style Guide</i> 
		by Patrick Lynch and Sarah Horton (2001), offered a technical checklist 
		to consult in the beginning of such a project.</span></p>
	  <p><span>However, the curator found it difficult to obtain information regarding 
		what technical functions The CooperŒs web server could support, and there 
		was no indication that it could support database searches, but only basic 
		functions such as email messages from readers. The production of the on-line 
		exhibition was carried out under a number of technical constraints and 
		without the benefit of a long-term Web master. Given these constraints, 
		creating the site using basic production techniques seemed a practical 
		strategy. </span></p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Study of Other On-line Exhibition Sites</h1>
	  <p><span>Considering the constraints encountered in all aspects of production, 
		the curator carefully studied the various display possibilities for on-line 
		exhibition that are available on the Internet. There are numerous on-line 
		exhibition sites out currently on the Worldwide Web. The curator used 
		the <i>Museum of Fine Arts, Boston: Monet in the 20th Century</i> (<a href="http://www.boston.com/mfa/monet/exhibit">http://www.boston.com/mfa/monet/exhibit</a>) 
		as a typical example on how an exhibition may be presented on-line. The 
		exhibits included in this virtual exhibition used a &#34;slide-by-slide&#34; technique, 
		rather than trying to resemble or reconstruct the visitors experience 
		of the original.</span></p>
	  <p align="center"><img src="wong_figure8.jpg" width="400" height="357"/></p>
	  <p align="center"> <span class="MsoCaption">Figure 8: On-line exhibition 
		of Monet in the 20th Century</span></p>
	  <p><span>Some sites surveyed were embedded with a searchable feature, and 
		some of them were database driven. Most of the site designs were unified 
		in look, style, page grid, and overall graphic design standards. </span></p>
	  <p><span>More examples are available in the &#34;Best on-line Exhibition&#34; sites 
		from the finalist list of <i>Museums and the Web 2002</i> and are useful 
		to consider when planning the best design of an on-line exhibition. Some 
		sites provided html and flash versions to accommodate the different preferences 
		of viewers, such as <i>Jacob Lawrence: Over the Line</i> (<a href="http://www.phillipscollection.org/lawrence/">http://www.phillipscollection.org/lawrence</a>). 
		With the increasing use of high-speed Internet connections, animated flash 
		versions of sites are also common. One example is <i>George Washington: 
		A National Treasure</i> (<a href="http://georgewashington.si.edu/">http://georgewashington.si.edu</a>). 
		This Web site has an animated opening page and advanced interactive scripting 
		that allows readers to access information from the next level and beyond 
		the exhibit. </span></p>
	  <p><span>The JavaScript language can also enhance the interactivity of a 
		Web site, as in <i>History Wired: A few of our favorite things</i> (<a href="http://historywired.si.edu/index.htm">http://historywired.si.edu/index.htm</a>l), 
		which created a &#34;wired&#34; effect to echo the concept and theme of this on-line 
		exhibition. <i>The Sport of Life and Death: The Mesomerican Ballgame</i> 
		(<a href="http://www.ballgame.org/">http://www.ballgame.org</a>) Web site 
		provides very interactive educational content and games. Flash-based web 
		sites are more interesting in term of their visual presentation, but users 
		usually have to deal with a slower download time. In addition to these 
		Flash-based sites, there are some sites enabling audio function, such 
		as <i>Treasures From the WorldŒs Great Libraries</i> (<a href="http://www.nla.gov.au/worldtreasures">http://www.nla.gov.au/worldtreasures</a>), 
		and downloadable quick time movies, as in <i>Artists Take on Detroit</i> 
		(<a href="http://www.dia.org/artists">http://www.dia.org/artists</a>). 
		Unfortunately, this kind of technology is not very user-friendly unless 
		the users are accessing the Internet using a high-speed connection, and 
		a suitable movie player plug-in is also required. </span></p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Solution</h1>
	  <p><span>After the preliminary study of on-line exhibitions available from 
		the Internet, the curator considered both the technical constraints and 
		goals of the site design, and decided to adopt a visual-based mouse-over 
		technique rather than a text-based html or a Flash-based site. This technique 
		provided interesting visual effects by inviting the participation of the 
		in discovering the exhibition. The site was mainly created in two Web 
		production applications, Fireworks 4.0 and Dreamweaver 4.0. The page size 
		was set at 600 x 400 pixels, and the basic composition of the site&#39;s graphic 
		design was done in Freehand 9.0. After the drawings were completed, they 
		were transferred into Fireworks4.0 for additional production. </span></p>
	  <p><span>The interface pages were cut into different slides and interactivity 
		was added in Firework 4.0, creating the desired &#34;roll-over&#34; effect. Then, 
		the Fireworks 4.0 file was exported as a Fireworks html file, and reopened 
		in Dreamweaver 4.0 for further manipulation into the final Web site. The 
		sliding and mouse-over techniques chosen enable visual images to be downloaded 
		as small jpeg files and form a 600 x 400 pixel image. By using this method, 
		individual Web pages do not require extra downloading time, as in the 
		Flash-based site. </span></p>
	  <p><span>The goal of the on-line exhibition was to reconstruct a visit experience 
		similar to the 3-dimensional exhibit held at The Cooper Union. The on-line 
		exhibition design followed the design and color scheme of the on-site 
		exhibition by transferring all the exhibits and information into cyberspace. 
		The first page of the virtual site opened with the Chinese and English 
		title on the left hand side, and exhibition information on the right. 
		The reader could click on the word &#34;enter&#34; and access the introduction 
		page of the exhibition exactly as it was once posted physically in The 
		Center. Then, in the third page, a floor plan of The Center provided the 
		introductory navigation system to visitors, and this floor plan also showed 
		the readers how the physical exhibition environment looked. The virtual 
		visitor was allowed to choose any point to enter this on-line exhibition, 
		but they could also follow the suggested sequence as shown in the mouse-over 
		images. Unlike the on-site exhibition, this on-line version was not able 
		and not intended to restrict the navigation patterns of the users. </span></p>
	  <p><span>After entering the main exhibition areas, the Chinese and English 
		title-marks were placed on the left upper corner with the exhibition title 
		in English serving as the signature graphic to indicate the name of the 
		exhibition. Below this block of graphics, additional information showed 
		the location of the exhibition areas. Basic user instructions were added 
		for visitors who are unfamiliar with the mouse-over display techniques 
		used in the site. Interface and graphic navigation links were created 
		as a thumbnail of the display system found in the on-site exhibition design 
		and were placed on the lower part of the page.</span></p>
	  <p><span>To indicate the scale of the exhibits in relation to people, a 
		human figure was placed next to the display set. By moving the mouse over 
		the exhibits on the display units, Internet visitors could experience 
		the exhibition in a way similar to physical attendees by going through 
		each exhibit individually. Unlike the on-site exhibition, users could 
		enjoy the greater freedom and interactivity provided by the Internet. 
		This set of graphic navigation and interactivity links formed the basic 
		site design system. Also, interactive links to other exhibition areas 
		were placed on the left hand side along with consistent and predictable 
		navigation buttons. It created a sense of the site&#39;s organization and 
		made the logic and order of the site clear. </span></p>
	  <p><span>This page layout style covered four exhibition sections in five 
		pages: East Gallery, West Gallery, </span></p>
	  <p><span>South Hallway and West Hallway (Left and Right). The design was 
		a very close approximation of the actual on-site exhibition display organization. 
		The virtually site also included a page giving the names of participating 
		designers, and another of acknowledgements. Finally, the exit page wrapped 
		up the exhibition, addressing the results of this Fellowship project and 
		exhibition and provided email contact information for the visitors. From 
		this page, users could elect to either return to the on-line exhibition 
		site or to the homepage of The Cooper (figure 9: The site design of Chinese 
		graphic design on-line exhibition). Overall, the on-line exhibition achieved 
		the goals set by the curator, although the project sacrificed some potential 
		with no database function available. The on-line exhibition has been available 
		in cyberspace since June 2002, in spite of the technical and budget restraints 
		the project was confronted with. </span></p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusion </h1>
	  <p><span>This paper reviewed the production considerations for an on-line 
		exhibition based on a physical exhibition, &#34;Chinese Graphic Design towards 
		the International Sphere,&#34; held at The Gallery of Herb Lubalin Study Center 
		of The Cooper Union September 4 to December 1, 2001. The research project 
		culminating in the physical and on-line exhibitions was undertaken in 
		fulfillment of The Lubalin Curatorial Fellowship awarded in 2000. Both 
		exhibitions provided valuable examples of graphic design in Greater China 
		to American viewers and a worldwide Internet audience. The exhibition 
		is an example of cross-cultural communication, which introduced designers 
		and designs largely unknown to the Western audience but artistically important 
		to the development of graphic design. The exhibition was also used as 
		a visual reference for students involved in a poster design project, under 
		the direction of Mr. Philippe Apeloig, professor of graphic design at 
		the School of Art, during the exhibition period at The Cooper.</span></p>
	  <p><span>The on-site exhibition created an alternative cultural and learning 
		experience for the American audience, which was continued through the 
		Internet. The design strategy of the on-line exhibition was an attempt 
		to approximate as closely as possible the physical exhibition and so to 
		recreate the on-site experience for a virtual audience. This approach 
		has not often been seen in on-line exhibition Web sites. The mouse-over 
		effect projected images and information to the viewers in an unexpected 
		way, and the Web site projected a unified look and identity as did the 
		original exhibition at The Center. </span></p>
	  <p><span>The goals of on-line exhibition were achieved, as visitors were 
		provided with an educational experience closely approximating that of 
		the on-site event. However, the site was unable to include all the curator 
		s desired features, such as a searchable database function and audio and 
		movie clips, due to budget constraints. It is the curator&#39;s hope that, 
		since the Fellowship project and exhibitions were devoted to Chinese graphic 
		design, a Chinese language version of the entire on-line exhibit may eventually 
		be produced for visitors from the Greater China region. Designers 
		and scholars must continue to carry out the work of increasing the visibility 
		and availability of Chinese graphic design to the world in the future.
