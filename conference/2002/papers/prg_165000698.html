        <p class="PaperTitle">Virtual Pyramids: The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston’s 

          Giza Archives Project</p>

        <p class="Author">Peter Der Manuelian, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, USA</p>

        <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

        <p class="AbstractText"><span class="normal">A grant from the Andrew W. 

          Mellon Foundation is allowing the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, to digitize 

          and integrate all its diverse media archives from forty years of excavations 

          at the famous Pyramids of Giza, Egypt.</span></p>

        <p class="AbstractText"><span class="normal">Keywords: Egypt, Giza, pyramids, 

          mastabas, Egyptology, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</span></p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">What was it like to excavate an ancient temple or 

          burial chamber and watch a brilliantly painted statue of a 5,000-year-old 

          Egyptian official emerge from the sands? Such a dream exists today not 

          only among amateur archaeologists and ancient Egypt fans, but also among 

          scholars. Museum curators, Egyptologists and archaeologists have much 

          to learn from detailed examination of earlier excavations (when they 

          exist), and a common lament is the inaccessibility of those records 

          for research. Archaeological context is critical to proper scholarly 

          inquiry about ancient material culture, but what does the scholar do 

          if the discovery records are locked away in a distant museum archive, 

          unsorted and unusable? (See Figure 1)  </p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">Museums have begun to discover that, with the help 

          of technology, their vast collections, and the intellectual property 

          that accompanies them can reach both the scholar and the interested 

          layman far beyond the doors of the physical museum building itself. 

          While no one is suggesting that the Internet can replace a museum visit 

          for direct interaction with works of art, nevertheless the power of 

          the Web is opening broad new vistas for access to scholarly information. 

          Much of this material can now be presented in ways that were not even 

          imaginable just five years ago. </p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">One such project is now under way in Boston (USA), 

          at the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), where Egyptologists are computerizing 

          the vast excavation archives from forty years of digging at the famous 

          Giza Pyramids. The Pyramids form one part of a vast necropolis, or city 

          of the dead, that housed hundreds of individual tombs of Egypt’s 

          governing classes during the Old Kingdom (Dynasties 4-6, about 2630-2250 

          B.C. See Figure 2). </p>

          1999. Photograph by Brian Snyder. </i></b></p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">In 2000, The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, received 

          a generous grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="../http://www.mellon.org/" target="_blank">www.mellon.org</a></span>) in support 

          of a unique four-year archaeological “Giza Archives Project.” 

          The goal is to provide integrated, on-line access to the archives documenting 

          the Museum’s Giza excavations from 1905 through 1942 and beyond. 

          Excavation diaries, historic glass plate photographic negatives, object 

          register books, published volumes and unpublished manuscripts, maps, 

          plans, and sketches are all being converted (scanned, typed, inventoried 

          and databased) to electronic form to create a reunited archive of Egyptian 

          archaeological information on the pyramids, temples and tombs of Giza. 

          In addition to making this resource available on-line to all, free of 

          charge, this project aims to promote collaborative action among archives, 

          museums, and libraries in the development and delivery of unique online 

          resources. </p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">Between 1905 and 1942, excavations undertaken jointly 

          by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and Harvard University, and directed 

          by George A. Reisner (1867-1942), uncovered one of the richest collections 

          of ancient Egyptian objects in the world (See Figure 3)</p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="center"><img src="manuelian.fig3.jpg" width="400" height="585" alt="Comparison shots"/><br/>

          <b><i>Fig.3: Comparison shots: Above: General view of the cemetery west 

          of the Great Pyramid, looking southeast in 1905/6 (B 7243). Below: the 

          same view on April 4, 1936 (A 7558). Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.</i></b> 

        </p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">After moving to Cairo to participate in an international 

          cataloguing project for the Egyptian Museum, Reisner eventually turned 

          to excavating in his own right. He emphasized field photography as a 

          fundamental element of the documentation process, and developed and 

          maintained numerous expedition record books and numbering systems. Were 

          he alive today, there is no doubt that Reisner would have pioneered 

          the application of relational databases to archaeological research.</p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">The MFA’s archive of Giza reports, photography, 

          diaries, and register books from the Giza excavations is unrivaled for 

          its thoroughness, containing information available nowhere else in the 

          world. The materials increase in value as the ancient monuments they 

          document continue to deteriorate and disappear. Unfortunately, like 

          their ancient counterparts, this irreplaceable archaeological archive 

          is also deteriorating at an alarming rate. The race is on to produce 

          “digital surrogates” while the original documentation still 

          survives intact.</p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">The archives produced during any archaeological excavation 

          naturally dissect the ancient site into a number of discreet components. 

          The primary goal of this project is to reunite these disparate and deteriorating 

          materials, thereby creating a multimedia repository of archaeological 

          data for scholarly research, and effectively reconstructing the ancient 

          environment of the Giza Necropolis. Among the types of documents being 

          “virtually reunited” are</p>

          <span class="small">(<a href="manuelianfig7.html">detailed image</a>)</span></p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">To get down to the individual tomb level, one might 

          include on the Giza Web site a series of aerial overview images of the 

          necropolis. From an overview plan, users might zoom in to an individual 

          cemetery, a single tomb, even an isolated burial shaft by clicking on 

          the appropriate “rollover buttons.” Eventually they could 

          arrive at a screen for the individual monument in question, with options 

          for viewing a host of documents related to that monument, including 

          excavation photos, discovery images of finds, corresponding field diary 

          pages describing the discovery, and even recent, museum quality color 

          studio photography. Thus, hidden behind a user-friendly graphic interface, 

          a number of powerful, inter-related databases should link the disparate 

          types of data described above into a fully searchable and seamless unit, 

          removing the artificial restrictions traditionally imposed by the varied 

          nature of manuscripts, notes, photographs, and physical artifacts. In 

          addition, new technologies will enhance the old ones, with immersive, 

          panorama images (Quicktime Virtual Reality, or QTVR) allowing users 

          on-line to view the interior of a tomb chamber in 360 degrees, or take 

          a virtual walk through the necropolis.</p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">The benefits of the Giza Archives Project to the 

          museum community and international scholarship are threefold in nature.

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">First, it will enhance the study 

          of Egyptian civilization during the Old Kingdom, or Pyramid Age, in 

          a way that is not possible at the site of Giza itself. Some tombs at 

          Giza are now reburied, denuded, or otherwise inaccessible; they are 

          often better preserved in their documented state sixty to ninety years 

          ago in the MFA Expedition archives. <br/>

          <br/>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> 

          <div class="Section1"> Second, online MFA records will allow scholars 

            unprecedented access to our archaeological materials. This includes 

            scholars who are unable to visit the site of Giza, or the portions 

            of the site crucial to their research, as well as those colleagues 

            actually working at the site and needing supplemental documentation 

            no longer accessible or available. <br/>

            <br/>

          </div>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Third, the Giza Archives Project 

          should do far more than just provide access to a body of expedition 

          records and images online. It should be able to answer research questions 

          that today cannot even be posed because of the overwhelming number of 

          archival documents, the impractical search requirements and the limited 

          time and travel constraints under which most scholars work.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <div class="Section1"> 

        <p class="MsoBodyText">The excitement in Boston over this project is growing, 

          as ever more of Reisner’s Giza materials are processed daily. A 

          demonstration Web site with some sample materials is currently available 

          at: <a href="../http://www.mfa.org/" target="_blank">http://www.mfa.org</a>.  

          To follow such an ambitious project to its natural conclusion for a 

          moment, the potential exists for even greater success if one were able 

          to incorporate several other great collections of Giza antiquities. 

          Objects from Giza are in many great museum Egyptian collections. Should 

          all these institutions be able one day to collaborate and add their 

          materials to an international Giza Archives Project, the results could 

          herald a new era of international scholarly cooperation across institutions, 

          languages, borders, and collections. The value of such an integrated, 

          unified Giza archive would then truly be greater than the sum of its 

          parts. </p>
