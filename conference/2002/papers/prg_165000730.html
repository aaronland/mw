      <p class="PaperTitle">Representing Asia: Building a Web Site for the Musée 

        Guimet, Paris</p>

      <p class="Author">Mark Carlson, Musée national des Arts asiatiques–Guimet, 

        Paris, France</p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">On January 15, 2001, the National Museum of Asian 

        Arts–Guimet in Paris reopened after an extensive renovation project. 

        The museum&#39;s first real Web site accompanied this reopening and went on-line, 

        not coincidentally, on the same day. The renovated museum was dramatically 

        different from the one that had closed its doors nearly five years before, 

        and the Web site was designed to be a reflection of the &#34;new&#34; 

        Musée Guimet. </p>

      <p class="AbstractText">This paper will examine the experience of designing 

        and building the Web site, in particular, the cultural and political issues 

        involved in representing a European museum which contains one of the world&#39;s 

        largest collections of Asian art. Designing an appropriate site meant 

        paying attention to design and content issues, and their possible impact 

        on Asian visitors. As the vision and goals of the museum&#39;s director were 

        brought to life, a number of factors played a role, such as the potential

      <h1>History of the Museum</h1>

      <p>At the writing of this paper, no museum Web site is more than a decade 

        old. However, and not always without attendant complexities, Web sites 

        have come to be the principal representatives of institutions that were, 

        in many cases, founded more than a century ago. As the Musée Guimet recently 

        marked its centenary, it seems appropriate here to give a brief history 

        of the Musée Guimet and its founder, in order to place the design of the 

        Web site into historical context.</p>

      <p>Emile Guimet was born in 1836, son of a prominent industrialist from 

        Lyon, and himself a successful manufacturer. When still young, he became 

        passionately interested in the history of religions. He was an avid and 

        frequent traveler.  A trip to Egypt in 1865 drew his attention to the 

        moral message of ancient Egyptian religious practices such as the cult 

        of Isis and Osiris. He then decided to deepen his knowledge of the religions 

        of Asia, and traveled to Japan, China and India in 1867. During this trip, 

        he purchased books, paintings and objects–several hundred pieces 

        in all–which would become the basis for the future Musée Guimet (Jarrige, 

        2000). </p>

      <p>In November of 1889, housed in a newly constructed neo-classical building 

        in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower (built the same year), Guimet&#39;s collections 

        became available to the public. The institution was not meant to be a 

        museum of Asian arts, but a museum of religions, based on Guimet&#39;s original 

        interests. Above all, Guimet wanted the museum to be a &#34;<i>laboratoire 

        d&#39;idées</i>&#34;, with much attention paid to research, scholarship, 

        and publication. This emphasis placed the museum&#39;s library at the symbolic 

        as well as physical center of the building. The collections of objects 

        which Guimet had amassed illustrating the world&#39;s various religions were 

        laid out along iconographic and thematic lines; in addition, a collection 

        of Japanese and Chinese ceramics were presented as examples of craftsmanship 

        and industry. In short, the museum was meant to introduce the West to 

        Asian culture, artisanship, and religious practice. The pedagogic nature 

        of the museum&#39;s exhibitions and the lack of a purely art-historical approach 

        meant that masterpieces were not singled out for appreciation, but blended 

        in with similar objects in a given display (Omoto and Macouin, 1993). 

        A pre-World War I view of the museum&#39;s Egyptian galleries can be seen 

        in Figure 1 . </p>

      <p>Shortly after Guimet&#39;s death in 1918, it was decided to change the orientation 

        of the museum. The previous forty years had seen great progress in the 

        field of Asian art studies, and important French archaeological missions 

        in China and Central Asia in the early part of the century had enriched 

        the museum&#39;s collections considerably. It was at this point that the Musée 

        Guimet changed its orientation, and became a museum dedicated to Asian 

        art. The transformation was aided by additional French missions in Asia, 

        the transfer of Khmer sculptures to the museum after the closing of the 

        nearby Indochinese Museum in the 1930s and, most importantly, the reorganization 

        of the French state museum structure after the war in 1945. The considerable 

        Asian art holdings of the Louvre were transferred to the Guimet, in exchange 

        for its classical and Egyptian collections. As a result of these consolidations 

        and an active acquisitions policy, the Musée Guimet became one of the 

        largest and most comprehensive collections of Asian art in the world, 

        with more than 50,000 pieces from 17 Asian countries from Afghanistan 

        to Korea.</p>

      <h1>Renovations</h1>

      <p>In the decades following the 1920s, and particularly after the war, the 

        museum&#39;s original floor plan underwent a series of modifications that 

        slowly boxed off the museum&#39;s spacious galleries into small and ill-lit 

        rooms. Cheaply-done repairs and renovations left the interiors looking 

        shoddy. Reigning museum design concepts of the 60s and 70s favored very 

        dark rooms in which pieces were lit by spotlights. Finally, the very large 

        holdings of the museum could not be adequately contained in the limited 

        storage reserves, and climate control was almost non-existent. It was 

        clear that a major renovation was required if the museum and its collections 

        were to survive into the 21st century (Eskerdijian, 2001). </p>

      <p>In 1996 when the museum closed, its collections were transferred into 

        offsite storage and the entire interior of the museum was gutted and reconstructed. 

        Two additional levels were dug below ground to house the reserves. The 

        &#34;new&#34; Musée Guimet that opened five years later emphasizes natural 

        light wherever possible, and space. The visitor who slowly ascends the 

        museum&#39;s floors follows a path that geographically extends roughly from 

        west to east, from India and Pakistan to Japan and Korea. Galleries and 

        floors open onto each other so that connections between various civilizations 

        can be seen more readily. Most importantly, the thematic and iconographic 

        displays from the museum&#39;s origins have been supplanted by a spare, uncluttered 

        museology in which the emphasis is on stylistic presentation and historical 

        and geographic continuity. The museum that greets the 21st century is 

        thus considerably different from the one that greeted the 20th century.</p>

      <h2>The Beginnings of the Web Site</h2>

      <p>The museum&#39;s first Web site appeared only in 1997, when the museum had 

        already been closed for more than a year. It consisted of a few pages, 

        mainly intended to inform the visitor about the work in progress and when 

        the museum would reopen. The site remained untouched for more than three 

        years, and then was dismantled. </p>

      <p>When the museum closed for renovations, very few French museums had a 

        Web presence. However, by the time the museum reopened, France had begun 

        to make up for an initially reluctant presence on the Internet, and a 

        comprehensive Web site for the newly refurbished museum was seen as a 

        necessity.</p>

      <h2>The Director&#39;s Vision</h2>

      <p>The initial direction and scope for the project came from the museum&#39;s 

        director, Mr. Jean-François Jarrige. During initial discussions, his vision 

        of the site and what it should accomplish was clear, focused and far-reaching. 

        According to him, the Musée Guimet&#39;s Web site should:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">be a second, virtual Guimet museum 

          in size and scope</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">be instrumental in attracting 

          and securing new audiences for the museum</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">encourage a two-way dialogue between 

          the museum and its public</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">help the museum regain its place 

          at the center of Asian studies in Europe </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> aid the museum in its privileged 

          role as a place of encounter between East and West</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">make the collections of the Guimet 

          available to those visitors who might never come to the museum, particularly 

          those visitors from countries whose works of art are represented in 

          the collections </span></li>

      </ul>

      <p>These criteria, and several others along the same lines, make this a 

        fairly high-level mission statement. Certain issues that are standard 

        fare at other museums, such as building membership or increasing revenues 

        through online sales, did not even make the list. The first point makes 

        it clear that the director wished to build a comprehensive site. Building 

        an audience for the museum was also of crucial importance: the Guimet 

        was, in the years prior to closing, not well-attended, and was very much 

        in the shadow of its bigger sisters, the Louvre, the Musée d&#39;Orsay and 

        the Centre Pompidou. Any remaining loyalties to the museum were further 

        strained by the lengthy renovation period.</p>

      <p>The director&#39;s vision also makes clear the need to take Asian audiences 

        and sensibilities into consideration. He repeatedly stressed the need 

        to have a site that showed virtual visitors from Asia the care the museum 

        took of its collections and the esteem in which the objects were held. 

        This viewpoint does not spring from any sort of need to be perceived as 

        politically correct, but from a deep lifelong interest in and respect 

        for Asian culture and civilization. </p>

      <p>The site, therefore, had to depict the museum accurately, to stimulate 

        attendance by French and European audiences, and to attract the interest 

        and maintain the respect of virtual visitors from Asia and around the 

        world. </p>

      <h1>Exoticism and its Discontents</h1>

      <p>Attracting Asian visitors meant that the design of the site needed to 

        avoid representation of Asian art and culture through a European lens, 

        and be devoid of &#34;exoticism&#34;. France&#39;s presence and activities 

        in China and Southeast Asia over more than three centuries whether cultural, 

        religious or commercial were extremely widespread, important for both 

        sides, and form an significant part of France&#39;s history. Unfortunately, 

        too often this long and rich history is reduced to certain impressions 

        or <i>idées reçues</i>, such as the &#34;exotic East&#34;. The reasons 

        to avoid such an approach are obvious. In those parts of Asia where Franco-Asian 

        exchange was less present or non-existent (e.g. Korea, Pakistan, India, 

        etc.) such an approach would seem puzzling, while in Southeast Asia it 

        would have run the risk of appearing condescending.</p>

      <h1>What Color is Asia?</h1>

      <p>One of the first tasks of the graphic design company retained for the 

        project was to define the graphic charter for the site: colors, typefaces, 

        etc. This immediately produced the first problem: what color is Asia? 

      </p>

      <p>The initial design submitted to the museum was awash in various shades 

        of red as background and highlight colors. It was decided that this was 

        a sinocentric view of Asia most likely a reference to colors used in Chinese 

        architecture: wall color, roof tiles, ornamentation, and so on. It also 

        could be linked to the phenomenon of <i>chinoiserie</i>, the passion for 

        Chinese porcelains, artifacts, furniture, etc., which swept the courts 

        of Europe<i> </i>in the late 17th Century. Whatever its sources, red is 

        not an artistic reference for Asia: apart from red laquerware and <i>thangka 

        </i>paintings, red is not a color much seen in Asian art, and since this 

        is main focus of the site, the color needed to be altered. </p>

      <p>Since the museum makes a great deal of use of natural materials in its 

        displays, especially wood and stone, it was decided to use colors closer 

        to nature: South, Southeast and Eastern Asia contain the widest geographic 

        variations possible, including mountain ranges, jungles, deserts and oceans. 

        By taking this into consideration, the designers finally came up with 

        a much more pleasing and muted palette of greens, blues and grays (see 

        Figure 3 ). </p>

      <h1>Room for Thought</h1>

      <p>It should be pointed out that a large part of the collections of the 

        Musée Guimet consists of pieces—e.g. statues, steles, paintings, 

        etc.—which were/are religious objects, or of objects that had been 

        displayed in a religion setting, such as temples. These pieces were venerated, 

        worshipped, used in ceremonies, and so on. This particularity of the museum&#39;s 

        collections and the respect paid to their display was, of course, taken 

        into consideration in the various incarnations of the museum. Over time, 

        however, maintaining such a space for contemplation became more difficult 

        as the interior spaces of the museum became more and more cramped and 

        closed-off. </p>

      <p>In their plans for the new interior of the museum, the architects Henri 

        and Bruno Gaudin ensured that there was sufficient space for the works 

        on display. The spacious galleries of the museum give the visitor room 

        to contemplate the objects, to concentrate on them and to think. In addition, 

        the arrangement of the various spaces and volumes and the materials used 

        in the displays do not interfere with the collections, nor do they draw 

        attention to themselves.</p>

      <p>It is not possible to reproduce the subtleties and implied meanings of 

        such three-dimensional spaces on a Web page, but the idea that the Web 

        site should be in some way a space for contemplation informed the design 

        process. As a result, pages and templates are not crowded: the palette 

        of colors is attractive but muted. Site navigation headings are placed 

        on the left side of the page in small type. The pages describing the highlights 

        of the collections are fairly unadorned, drawing the user&#39;s attention 

        as much as possible to the image and the text describing it.</p>

      <p>In attempting to create this contemplative aesthetic, the Guimet site 

        follows the lead of other Asian art museum sites. It was interesting to 

        note that this approach is particularly evident in museums in Asia, much 

        more than anywhere else. Examples of institutions employing a relatively 

        spare interface include the Ho-Am Museum in Seoul (<a href="../http://www.hoammuseum.org/">www.hoammuseum.org</a>), 

        the National Museum of Korea (<a href="../http://www.museum.go.kr/">www.museum.go.kr/</a>), 

        the Museum of Oriental Ceramics in Osaka (<a href="../http://www.moco.or.jp/">www.moco.or.jp</a>), 

        and the Kyoto National Museum (<a href="../http://www.kyohaku.go.jp/">www.kyohaku.go.jp</a>). 

      </p>

      <h1>Geography, Politics and the Collections</h1>

      <p>Displaying images from the collections is, obviously, one of the primary 

        goals of many museum Web sites, and this was important for the Musée Guimet 

        as well. The first museum to benefit from the RMN&#39;s Web site project was 

        the Cluny Museum, or as it is now known, the Museum of the Middle Ages. 

        As can be seen in Figure 4 , the Cluny&#39;s collections are grouped by material 

        and theme, and this method of classification was also offered to the Guimet 

        at the beginning of the architecture design process. </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><a name="_Ref1561243"><img src="carlson-fig4.jpg" width="400" height="251"/><br/>

        Figure </a> 4 - Collections entry page, Cluny web site</p>

      <p>Although this approach is a valid one, and is taken at other Asian art 

        Web sites, it was ultimately set aside in favor of a geographical approach 

        to the collections. As shown in Figure 5 , after clicking on the link 

        &#34;The collections&#34;, the visitor is presented with a map of Asia. 

        He or she then clicks on a country or region to view works of art from 

        the chosen area. There were several reasons for this: first, the Guimet&#39;s 

        galleries are arranged geographically, and arranging the site in the same 

        way would offer an accurate reflection of the museum. In addition, having 

        to enter via a map offers subliminal information to the visitor: the size 

        and diversity of the Asian continent, the size of the various countries 

        relative to each other, etc. Finally, and most importantly, it was felt 

        that such an approach individualizes the various Asian countries instead 

        of reducing them to the sum of their artistic achievements, and that this 

        approach would have more appeal to Asian visitors to the site. </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><a name="_Ref1358638"><img src="carlson-fig5.jpg" width="400" height="267"/><br/>

        Figure </a> 5 - Collections entry page, Guimet web site </p>

      <p>This approach was not without problems, however—in particular, the 

        very sensitive problem of Tibet. One of the curatorial departments at 

        the museum is called &#34;Nepal-Tibet&#34;. The same term is used in 

        the galleries themselves. This is a well-known and useful classification 

        in the world of Asian art museums. However, it presents a problem when 

        it is to be used on the Web. Even though the term is strictly an art-historical 

        one, its use invokes this very sensitive political issue. China, as is 

        well known, considers Tibet to be a province of China–Xizang Province–and 

        not an independent country. Using the term &#34;Nepal-Tibet&#34; could 

        quite possibly alienate a portion of those visitors the site is hoping 

        to attract. There is another term which is in use in certain museums, 

        &#34;Art of the Himalayas&#34;, and it was decided that it would be 

        more appropriate to use this alternative term. </p>

      <p>However, this did not entirely solve the problem. Access to the collections, 

        as we have seen, is via an interactive map. As the user moves the cursor 

        over a given country or region, the shape of the region becomes black 

        and its name appears. In the case of Nepal-Tibet, even with the change 

        of designation, the rollover would have–quite literally–highlighted 

        the separateness of the region from China. The decision was finally taken 

        to include the shape of Tibet in the rollovers twice, once in the Nepal-Tibet 

        region and again in the outline of China. The shape of China thus displayed 

        will be familiar to Chinese visitors, and in which no Tibetan border is 

        shown, while the area of Tibet is clearly outlined and delineated in the 

        context of the Art of the Himalayas (see Figure 6 ). </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><a name="_Ref1365179"><br/>

        </a><img src="carlson-fig6.jpg" width="400" height="152"/><a name="_Ref1365179"><br/>

        Figure </a> 6 - The region of Tibet in two separate contexts</p>

      <p>Then there was the matter of the region of the interactive map labeled 

        Central Asia – the part of China known as the Xinjiang-Uygur Autonomous 

        Region, or Chinese Turkestan, and not the collection of countries which 

        is now informally referred to by the same name. The museum&#39;s collections 

        include a number of objects from this part of China- primarily paintings 

        and manuscripts brought back from archaeological missions along the Silk 

        Road, and in particular from the cave complex at Dunhuang. Since the museum 

        has two senior curators for China, one for paintings and manuscripts and 

        one for objects, it was decided to provide a separate rollover for Central 

        Asia in order to reflect these two curatorial appointments. However, just 

        as with Tibet, the region of Central Asia appears twice: separately and 

        within the outline of China. </p>

      <p>Having read this far, the alert visitor will perhaps notice that, no 

        matter where the cursor is placed on the map of China, Taiwan does not 

        become highlighted. The decision to do so was based on the fact that the 

        map represents the museum&#39;s holdings in objects from various countries 

        and regions. Since the museum&#39;s holdings do not include any objects from 

        Taiwan, it was decided not to highlight the island with the rest of China.</p>

      <h1>Asian Art: It&#39;s Not Just China</h1>

      <p>Despite the above discussion, China is not the only country in Asia. 

        The pieces in the Musée Guimet come from a huge, geographically diverse 

        portion of the globe, a region which contains three-fourths of the world&#39;s 

        population. The collections, which in addition span five millenia, reflect 

        this diversity. Nevertheless, it is not uncommon for people to equate 

        Asian art only with China and Japan, and usually with a narrow range of 

        types of pieces. A site which played on this perception would be fine 

        for the visitor who is already passionate about Qing imperial ceramics 

        or lacquered boxes, but not necessarily for someone seeking an entry into 

        the vast world that is Asian art.</p>

      <p>To emphasize the diversity of art from Asia, the site design includes 

        a certain number of visual clues. For example, the backgrounds of each 

        upper level page (e.g. The Collections, What&#39;s Happening, etc.) as well 

        as the home page for each curatorial section contain abstracted images 

        of script in different Asian languages. The language chosen is one from 

        that particular geographic zone. </p>

      <p>In addition, the five principal upper-level pages include small black 

        and white images that appear randomly when the user rolls over the various 

        menu items on that page. These images consist of outlines of Asian art 

        objects and symbols, such as ritual bronzes, hands performing various 

        <i>mudrâ</i> (symbolic gestures), masks, statuary from Southeast Asia, 

        etc. These are intended to stimulate the user&#39;s interest and curiosity 

        by subtly suggesting the many forms which Asian art takes. </p>

      <p>The home page was designed to accomplish the same thing: each time the 

        page is accessed, the central image is one randomly chosen from a series 

        of twenty pictures of objects taken from across the collections. Not only 

        does this give the visitor a sort of &#34;personalized&#34; page each 

        time, but it also gives a broad and multi-faceted glimpse of the museum&#39;s 

        collections.</p>

      <h1>Beyond Design</h1>

      <p>Up to now, we have mainly discussed the design elements of the site. 

        Of course, design does not keep visitors at a site for long; the content 

        is what they come (and stay) for. The content of the Guimet site was designed 

        with a very large audience in mind, and with several questions in mind. 

        Will it make Asian art accessible?  Will it foster learning about Asian 

        art and culture?  Will it be interesting to an international audience? 

      </p>

      <p>Sections that received particular attention in this regard were the collections 

        and the educational sections. Showing the collections is the most significant 

        part of many museum sites; at the Guimet, it was decided to ask the curators 

        to select their favorite pieces from their respective departments. An 

        approximately 300-word text was written to accompany the picture (and 

        static zoom) of each piece, and glossary links were added to selected 

        words in each text. A total of 120 pieces from every part of the museum 

        were thus made available for the opening of the site, and most of the 

        pieces can be found on display in the museum. In the near future, an interactive 

        zoom functionality will be added: users will be able to zoom in on high-resolution 

        images in great detail. </p>

      <p>The educational section was seen as being very important to the site 

        since, as mentioned above, the museum faced the task of winning back its 

        public and creating new audiences as well. School tours and activities 

        are essential in this effort. The site currently offers a list of activities 

        for individuals (workshops, tours, story hours, etc.), as well those for 

        school groups. A page of links allows teachers and students to learn more 

        about selected topics either before or after their visit. A series of 

        in-depth educational dossiers on various aspects of Asian art is in preparation; 

        these will be available for download as PDF files. Finally, a page of 

        games is available for kids; these include &#34;The Emperor&#39;s Story&#34;, 

        a detailed view of a Chinese scroll painting that helps children learn 

        about an interesting period in Chinese history. Over the past year, the 

        educational section has had an avid following among educators in the French 

        school system, to the point that their comments and wish lists are driving, 

        to some extent, the section&#39;s future developments. </p>

      <h1>The Virtual Tour</h1>

      <p>Of special importance to the director was a virtual tour, a way to render 

        both the museum and its collections accessible in a more comprehensive 

        manner. A number of options were discussed, and the solution finally chosen 

        was an application from MGI Software. MGI&#39;s Zoom Image Server allows high-resolution 

        images—whether in the form of panoramas, 2D zooms, or object movies—to 

        be accessed and easily manipulated with very little download time. It 

        was decided to show the museum by means of a series of 360° panoramas, 

        linked together via hotspots. </p>

      <p>A total of eighty panoramas were shot of nearly all the public areas 

        of the museum. They were assembled and linked together by floor. Users 

        may navigate their way through the museum via hotspots in each panorama, 

        or by clicking on an interactive map. In addition—since the panoramas 

        by themselves don&#39;t offer additional information about the objects on 

        display—additional hotspots were added to the tour. These are links 

        to text files that offer brief explanations of roughly 150 objects visible 

        in the panoramas, as well as to nearly 40 sound files, that were taken 

        from the museum&#39;s audioguides. It is the largest panorama virtual tour 

        of any museum in Europe. </p>

      <h1>Translations</h1>

      <p>Since the beginning, the museum&#39;s site was planned to be a multilingual 

        one. It is currently—with several minor exceptions—completely 

        available in both French and English. These two languages were the most 

        obvious language choices for the opening of the site. However, in order 

        to communicate with an Asian audience, the site must be translated into 

        at least one Asian language. After some discussion, Chinese was chosen, 

        and a project to create a Chinese site will begin sometime during 2002. 

        The reasons for choosing Chinese were based on the museum&#39;s extensive 

        Chinese holdings which account for about half of the total objects in 

        the museum. China also contains the largest number of Internet users of 

        any other country in Asia (more than 40 million, including Taiwan). </p>

      <h1>Reactions and the Future</h1>

      <p>After slightly more than a year of being online, the site is slowly becoming 

        known and visited, both in France and abroad. For various technical reasons, 

        precise visitor statistics have up to now been difficult to obtain; however, 

        we do know that the number of unique visitors to the site roughly equals 

        the number of real visitors to the museum: between 5000 and 8000 visitors 

        per week. The site has also proven its ability to retain visitor interest, 

        as a significant percentage of our virtual visitors remain more than twenty 

        minutes, with some staying as long as an hour. </p>

      <p>Since the current statistics package is not able to indicate the countries 

        from which the virtual visitors come, an indication of visitor origin 

        comes from e-mail responses. This is not as reliable a method as one would 

        like, as it is impossible to know whether the respondents represent a 

        true cross-section of the site&#39;s virtual public. However, mail has been 

        received from around the world, including a number of Asian countries, 

        and comments from this part of the world, with very few exceptions, have 

        been overwhelmingly positive. For those correspondents who have had the 

        opportunity to visit the Guimet, many equate the site and the museum, 

        citing similar attention to visitor needs, accessibility and design appeal. 

      </p>

      <p>Future projects include expanding the collections section, increasing 

        the site&#39;s educational and multimedia content, and creating virtual tours 

        of the museum&#39;s temporary exhibitions. Taken together, these developments 

        should constitute another step towards fulfilling the initiative, begun 

        in 1999, of creating a second, virtual Musée Guimet.</p>
