	<meta name="description" content="Information technologies in museums are being touted as the means to create a dynamic interface and intersection between a museum&#39;s resources and student/teacher learning. An emerging concern in educational research is how the introduction of information technologies into museums - digitalized artefacts, web-based resources, online professional development for teachers - has spurred both an influx of undocumented learning with museum collections and a wave of pedagogical activities created in isolation to increase &#39;museum&#39; learning by users. This dual impact of unknown research implications and isolated inquiries that concern the fields of museum studies, educational pedagogy, or information technology design has become a concern for educational researchers. We argue that there has to be greater institutional collaboration and interaction between museum professionals, university researchers, school teachers, students and software designers. This collaboration needs to examine the design, use, and content of web environments as well as the social and educational impacts of information technologies on museum web visitors/users.



Critical curriculum theorists advocate the reduction or elimination of overly-structured and predetermined learning paths in pedagogical models such as textbooks. The &#39;story-board&#39; structure of many museum web sites can create interactions between a visitor and a museum web environment as structured and predetermined as any textbook. This pedagogical model implies that the student or teacher is not being given an active role or enough flexibility in the construction of the exhibit&#39;s meaning from their particular perspective and social situation. In a similar manner, social informatics research examines how people use, adapt or reject information technologies in their specific organisational and cultural situations. Social informatics would recommend the student or teacher-user to not be limited to a rigid design path conceived for the delivery of a number of specific outcomes. Museums need to create environments where the user/visitor/learner feels free and permitted to ask questions that will influence their learning in their own way, to relate their stories and experiences in their own chosen manner, and, to share this knowledge and information with the museum, designers and other users.  The increasing use of information technologies in museums impacts the educational intent of museums. Yet absent is an in-depth understanding of how information technologies interact with specific publics and the ways that museums deliver their educational intent. Despite evidence that social informatics can impact thinking about learning in museums via websites (Anderson, 1999), there is little research about how museums implement and respond to those teachers and students who use the web technologies. Our concerns are with how students and teachers learn by utilizing the digital resources provided by the museum. 



This paper draws on comparisons between three museum websites. We examine how each site seeks to better engage and influence teacher and student learning. Through these comparisons, we will show how museum educators, social informatics researchers, and educators need to move beyond their individual disciplines to collaborate with one another and to better understand how their disciplinary theory and research connects with learning for different public audiences. This paper is both focused on how curriculum and social informatics theory can contribute to museum education in a collaborative and reiterative environment. We seek to introduce and discuss the tensions and difficulties that school-based educators (teachers and faculty) face in understanding museum education and social informatics along with museum professionals. We argue that social informatics is both continuous with a tradition of collaboration and discontinuous in that it responds to a different set of conditions under different modes of learning.

      <p class="PaperTitle">Learning by Design: Teachers / Museums / Technology</p>

      <p class="Author">Lisa Korteweg, University of British Columbia, Canada and 

        Brenda Trofanenko University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">Information technologies in museums are being touted 

        as the means to create a dynamic interface and intersection between a 

        museum’s resources and teacher engagement. An emerging concern in 

        educational research is how the introduction of information technologies 

        into museums – digitalized artifacts, Web-based resources, on-line 

        professional development for teachers – has spurred both an influx 

        of undocumented learning with museum collections and a wave of pedagogical 

        activities created in isolation to increase ‘museum’ learning 

        by users. We argue the need to rethink the relationship of teachers, museums, 

        and museum education, to acknowledge the on-going and significant role 

        museums can hold in teachers’ professional development. The museum&#39;s 

        educational imperative, whether or not aimed specifically at teachers&#39; 

        professional development, continues to advance the museum’s power 

        to educate through its exhibits and programs. A new design of collaboration 

        is necessary for the museum Web site to reach a successful operational 

        status within the teachers&#39; and museum&#39;s expectations. We draw on comparisons 

        between three museum Web sites to examine how each site seeks to better 

        engage and influence teacher learning.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>The crucial link between successful pedagogical purpose and effective 

        technological tool and resource utilization in classrooms is the teachers. 

        Their pivotal role informs the significance of teacher professional development 

        in technology learning, as is well recognized in educational research 

        (Pea, 1998; Cuban, 2001). As museums move into the realm of professional 

        development, primarily through the development and implementation of museum 

        Web sites, the crucial link for these museums is continued Web site use 

        by teachers. It is not surprising that teachers utilize museum Web sites 

        as sites for curriculum development. Yet teachers face various obstacles 

        in integrating technologies into their curriculum (Kravchyna and Hastings, 

        2002). Teachers are often expected to achieve this pedagogical integration 

        in their spare time, at their own expense, and often in isolation, without 

        consistent support or &#39;training&#39; (de Castell, Bryson &amp; Jensen, 2002; 

        Lotherington, Moreby, Granger &amp; Doan, 2001). A frequent result is 

        a fumbled approach positioned as professional development, where teachers 

        are attempting to engage in their own learning and to transfer the technical 

        knowledge and skills into pedagogically valuable classroom experiences. 

        Others refuse to engage in a systemically unstructured, financially unsupported 

        arena of non-existent professional development altogether (de Castell 

        &amp; Bryson, 1998).</p>

      <p>As educators committed to educational theorizing about technology, we 

        recognize the ‘promising’ frustrations and discomfort that technology 

        can usher into education and to educators. The access to and view beyond 

        the classroom world has been narrow, myopic and comfortable in scope and 

        message, limited specifically to classroom textbooks and school library 

        reference books. Available knowledge has grown to incalculable multiple 

        perspectives, sometimes conflicting and critical, delivered through broadband 

        connection to school computers. The educational promise for teachers who 

        wish to utilize museum-based education Web sites, however, has yet to 

        be fulfilled by this merging of school computers and Internet access. 

        Problems persist, not the least of which is the design and support of 

        professional learning for teachers <b>and</b> for all professionals involved 

        in the implementation of technologies in education, including software 

        designers, technical support, and museum educators and curators. </p>

      <p>Technological advances are becoming mainstream in museums – specifically 

        in Web site development and exhibition design. In addition to growing 

        financial commitments to educating the public, museums are making available 

        extraordinary electronic resources for students and teachers. The world 

        presented through digitized museum collections is often richer and more 

        heterogeneous than what has typically been found inside the classroom. 

        Electronic museum resources not only offer digital access to museum collections, 

        but also allow teachers to view artifacts with curatorial interpretations 

        and museum-educator-generated lesson plans. As museums disseminate electronic 

        representations of artifacts into the public realm (including schools), 

        epistemological problems arise for the museum and the teacher. What knowledge 

        about the artifact is transmitted between the museum and the teacher (and, 

        subsequently, the students), and how each recipient will gain that knowledge, 

        challenge the learning intent of the individuals involved. A response 

        by some in the museum community to maintain their educational purpose 

        is to post a cache of lesson plans on the Web site, providing step-by-step 

        guides on how the museum&#39;s expertise can by transmitted or transferred 

        to the student through the teacher&#39;s instruction. </p>

      <p>While the listing of lesson plans in the museum’s education Web 

        pages may be a first step in the promising role museum Web sites occupy, 

        we suggest that it is not enough. It cannot begin to match the promise 

        of digitized artifacts: the promise to increase student (and teacher) 

        curiosity, challenge preconceptions, make connections between unrelated 

        subjects, pursue inquiries, explore complex relationships with diverse 

        communities, and a multitude of other types of intellectual endeavors 

        (see Clifford and Friesen, 2001). We are advocating increased involvement 

        of teachers in the design of museum Web-based learning activities and, 

        similarly, a design of learning for teachers themselves on how the museum 

        may play a role in their curriculum construction and delivery. The museum 

        needs to reconsider how the learning theories inherent in their on-line 

        lesson plans and education Web pages limit the degree to which teachers 

        can effectively play a role in student learning. Such a change in the 

        roles of both the museum and the teacher will require re-designing the 

        existing institutional arrangements between museums and educators. Museum 

        professionals will have to recognize and grapple with the particular pedagogical 

        contexts in which teachers work; and, teachers will need to consider the 

        types of learning possible through the museum&#39;s domain (through representations, 

        pedagogical approaches, access to experts/researchers) that can be now 

        extended beyond the museum&#39;s walls. </p>

      <p>In this paper, we explore how museums are poised to engage in a new design 

        of professional collaboration with teachers directly through electronic 

        means. This is not to suggest that museums will move beyond exhibiting 

        artifacts and artworks. Rather, we consider how artifacts are translated 

        via technology for specific pedagogical purposes, and how the pedagogical 

        intents and benefits that brought teachers initially to museum Web sites 

        need to be explored and further expanded. We frame our examination of 

        two different types of museums – fine arts and science – as 

        a means of acknowledging the various educational approaches museum educators 

        and curators are developing. In the Seattle Art Museum Web site, we examine 

        the Teacher Resource Pages, specifically the teacher units or packages 

        intended to augment the understanding of certain exhibits of now mostly 

        un-digitized items. In the Exploratorium Web site, we focus on the Institute 

        for Inquiry, where we examine how the institution created a sub-institution 

        of academic researchers, museum educators and teacher-educators to engage 

        with the notion of inquiry science; and how its sustained and ongoing 

        association with teachers provides the pedagogical innovations and resources 

        for on-line teachers. Finally, we consider the CyberMuse project at the 

        National Art Gallery of Canada, that combines promising multimedia techniques 

        to communicate curatorial texts associated with eight profiled works of 

        art. </p>

      <p>We frame our critique primarily from an educator’s perspective, 

        in order to understand those instances where museum Web resources could 

        aid in a collaboration between museums and schools generally, and between 

        museum educators and teachers specifically. The idea is to acknowledge 

        those promising Web environments where teachers and museums could develop 

        sustained interaction with each other.</p>

      <h1>Sustained Interactivity: Deriving Benefits for Teachers and Teaching 

      </h1>

      <p>In writing about the benefits for academics of studying teaching, educational 

        theorist Michael Huberman (1999, p. 289) asserts sustained interaction 

        patterns between teachers and academics, two distinct micro (social) worlds, 

        “determine[s] the flow of knowledge.” He offers four premises 

        about the flow of or points of contact in knowledge during educational 

        research, suggesting that the knowledge resulting from the interactions 

        is influenced by how “practitioners” and “researchers” 

        in “research” sites consider their corresponding knowledge and 

        perceptions. Although Huberman speaks specifically about educational research, 

        his framework is applicable to ways teachers can work with curators and 

        museum educators. As such, we have placed Huberman’s framework within 

        the language of teachers, museums, and museum educators. </p>

      <p>The first premise we explore is the way museums handle and characterize 

        ‘the teacher’ in its Web site. This characterization stems from 

        the museum&#39;s pedagogical approach; i.e., how it directs teachers to best 

        utilize its resources. If teachers are considered a dynamic source of 

        knowledge that can contribute to the advancement of an analysis of digitized 

        collections and &#39;users&#39; (and museum education), then the museum will approach 

        the teacher in a different manner. Secondly, how the “micro-worlds” 

        of museum education, on the one hand, and teacher practice in the classroom, 

        on the other hand, interact determines what knowledge flows from the classroom 

        to the museum, and vice versa. Third, the interaction between museums 

        and schools, rather than solely between museum educators and classroom 

        teachers, is crucial in order to understand how the museum as a whole 

        benefits from a focus on education. </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">Sustained interactivity reframes the goal of (museum) 

        research from one of primarily informing the practitioner (teacher-user) 

        to one of jointly constructing knowledge through shared activity.<br/>

        <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Huberman 1999, p.291) </span></p>

      <p>Finally, sustained interactivity between teachers and museum professionals 

        may allow museums to refine, and eventually recast, their conceptual frameworks, 

        methodologies, teaching, and modes of exchange with various audiences 

        through electronic means. </p>

      <p>Huberman’s theory suggests that the interactivity between schools 

        and museums is based on the mutual understanding that each institution 

        and its personnel have pedagogical worth that can contribute to the development 

        of knowledge – knowledge important and valid for both micro worlds. 

        A museum has to demonstrate its pedagogical worth to gain the allegiance 

        of teachers and, consequently, their sustained use of the electronic museum. 

        It has to prove itself effective for augmenting, enhancing or extending 

        teachers’ practices. If not, the Web site remains unused by teachers 

        in the classroom or it becomes a simple add-on in the manner that, perhaps, 

        a museum field trip becomes an add-on experience to a classroom event. 

        We question whether establishing this worth can be accomplished solely 

        with the posting of templated lesson plans or uni-directional learning 

        on museum Web sites. </p>

      <p>We argue for increased interactivity or collaboration between teachers 

        and museums to acknowledge teachers&#39; pedagogical experience and knowledge, 

        and teachers&#39; abilities to utilize Web sites in ways not considered or 

        yet perceived by museums. If teachers are to be included at all in such 

        education, then museums need to account critically for the ways in which 

        they seek to educate. Teachers significantly influence the likelihood 

        of students returning to a museum Web site, both inside and outside of 

        the classroom context. Teachers who reject the traditional lesson plan 

        may be perceived by the museum as resisting the educational innovations 

        currently occurring on museum Web sites. If we consider the teacher as 

        holding great influence over the means and conditions through which students 

        learn within classrooms, then sustained interactivity with teachers will 

        assist the museum in achieving its educational outcomes: increased thoughtful 

        usage by students and educational value for the public. </p>

      <p>Of critical importance here in thinking about the relationship of teachers, 

        museums, and museum educators is realizing the on-going and significant 

        role museums can hold in teachers&#39; professional development. The museum&#39;s 

        educational imperative, whether or not aimed specifically at teachers&#39; 

        professional development, continues to advance the museum’s power 

        to educate through its exhibits and programs. We argue it is in the best 

        interest of teachers, museums, and museum educators to build a closer 

        alliance and a shared agenda of sustained interactivity. Through a new 

        design of collaboration, each micro world works to develop and implement 

        digitized collections and on-line professional development, and extend 

        museum activities, in order that the museum Web site reach a successful 

        operational status within the teachers&#39; and museum&#39;s expectations. </p>

      <p>How, through professional development, teachers and museum professionals 

        come to understand each other’s role in learning is by bringing ideas 

        together to focus on how learning may be enriched through Web sites. To 

        speak of sustained interactivity, as we are using the term here, is to 

        look at how each social world is making sense of the educational mission 

        of the museum through working together and sharing an always tentative 

        theory of learning. As museums are concerned with the educational as well 

        as the economic, we offer the following rationale for a more collective 

        form of education.</p>

      <p>The educational goals and activities that museums present on their Web 

        sites need to be negotiated by the teacher, the museum personnel, and 

        the Web designer. With constant negotiation there is greater involvement, 

        commitment and investment in education in museums, in museums in education, 

        and in the technology necessary to respond to the various social needs 

        of each group. Through a reiterative, collaborative process, teachers 

        may engage in developing and contributing to the museum’s Web site, 

        to hook specific curriculum to the museum resources, and to make operational 

        such resources for specific classroom contexts. In this way, teachers 

        become brokers between the intended student audience and the museum’s 

        educational intent. As teachers are best able to judge how their students 

        are responding to museums&#39; Web activities and technical designs, there 

        is a wealth of data and information that museum professionals may gain 

        from closer interactivity with their teacher-collaborators.</p>

      <p>At a time when museums are experiencing the highest degree of attendance 

        and an increased number of new institutions are opening (Harris, 1999; 

        Pitman, 1999), the economic success of museums is always in flux. We realize 

        that our call for increased collaboration is not without economic impact. 

        To maintain both an institutional sustainability and Web site sustainability 

        will cost money. We are otherwise missing the opportunity to learn about 

        how to advance the educational mission of the museum and make classrooms 

        more vibrant in the community. We suggest a more explicit collaboration 

        in order to ensure the educational role is considered and evaluated in 

        terms of its economic benefits to the museum and teachers. </p>

      <p>To illustrate the interactivity that we advocate, we begin with instances 

        where museum Web sites are attempting to reconsider and re-tool the relationship 

        between the museum and the teacher. In each example, we focus on sites 

        that show promise of greater interactivity with teachers (and students), 

        but with a pedagogical design that still needs to promote “a community 

        of exchange from which each party (museum professional and teacher) could 

        profit in different spheres of activity” (Huberman, p. 299). </p>

      <p><a href="../http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/" target="_blank">http://www.seattleartmuseum.org</a></p>

      <p>Common to museum home pages is a separate education section, to be differentiated 

        from general museum information, exhibition listings, volunteer activities, 

        etc. As with the Seattle Art Museum, the education section is separate, 

        listed under the general “Just for Fun” title (see Figure 1).

      </p>

      <p>Within the Teacher section is an on-line database which provides access 

        to information about teacher programs, school tours, online lesson plans 

        and activities. In the unit <b><i>Teach about Photography</i></b>, a teacher 

        guide is available with lesson plans created to accompany the exhibition 

        <i>An American Century of Photography: From Dry-Plate to Digital: The 

        Hallmark Photographic Collection.</i> The guide is comprehensive and thoughtful, 

        focusing on artistic and subject matter choices made by photographers, 

        providing the history of photography, asking questions and ideas incorporating 

        the Washington State Essential Academic Learning Requirements, and including 

        a glossary of terms. The accompanying pin-hole activity, photographs, 

        and <i>Youth in Focus</i> create a pedagogically useful document for teachers.

      </p>

      <p>Absent from the generous and resourceful site is collaborative dialogue 

        between the museum and educators themselves. The absent exchange denies 

        possible problem-solving over pedagogical issues in the electronic delivery 

        of museum resources. The site presents teachers as designated recipients 

        rather than collaborators in this on-line venture. The electronic medium 

        allows an asynchronous, open exchange of feedback and comments on documents 

        that are intended for use and implementation by teachers. Yet the archived, 

        static nature of the photography unit limits feedback between teachers 

        and the museum concerning the educational successes of a comprehensive 

        unit. </p>

      <p>This Web site is a generous first step by a museum offering to engage 

        with teachers in classroom practice and student activities and learning. 

        Our question of this Web site is not only about museums realizing the 

        success (or not) of their teacher education programs through collaboration 

        and open communication and on-going additions to the unit, but also their 

        placing units on-line that remain separate and distinct from the institutions’ 

        current exhibits.</p>

      <h2>2. The Exploratorium’s Institute for Inquiry </h2>

      <p class="URL"><a href="../http://www.exploratorium/edu/IFI/index.htm" target="_blank">http://www.exploratorium/edu/IFI/index.htm</a></p>

      <p>While housed inside the Exploratorium’s Web site, the Institute 

        for Inquiry remains invisible from the larger museum organization, with 

        the resources and texts separate from the Exploratorium’s digitized 

        exhibits and information resources (see Figure 3). With the current concern 

        within the State Department of Education about mathematics education, 

        the current <i>Mathematica </i>display provides a starting point for investigating 

        not only the history of math (which it does), but also how math can be 

        framed within an inquiry process (which it does not). As a part of Exploratorium’s 

        programs, the Institute for Inquiry is separated from the Teachers Institute. 

        (see Figure 3)</p>

        </a></p>

      <p>As a part of Exploratorium’s <i>Programs, </i>the Institute for 

        Inquiry is separated from the Teachers Institute (see Figure 4). The Institute 

        for Inquiry concerns itself with means and methods for encouraging elementary 

        teachers to attempt ‘inquiry science’ in their classrooms. The 

        Institute pages have photographs of teachers during summer institutes, 

        which seem to be a part of the Teachers Institute, grappling with the 

        challenges and hands-on materials that the Institute facilitators have 

        provided. Absent from the Web pages are references to Exploratorium resources 

        and exhibits by faculty-authors. Although much information is presented 

        about pedagogy vis-à-vis inquiry method, the teacher is situated in a 

        site disconnected from the host museum’s resources. A possible perception 

        gained is that the museum is indirectly associated with some valuable 

        professional development materials.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="kortewegfig4.thumb.jpg" width="400" height="535"/><br/>

      </p>

      <p>Once the teacher has exhausted those pages, there is no connection for 

        further development with the host museum of the Exploratorium. There is 

        no direct lure or enticement to bring the teacher-user back into the Exploratorium 

        pages. This suggests that the professional development is limited to the 

        Institute for Inquiry pages (see Figure 5). </p>

        </a></p>

      <p>The National Gallery Web site offers a virtual space – CyberMuse 

        – that holds the Gallery’s images, information, and ideas about 

        art. This space holds over 5,000 images of works in the Gallery’s 

        collections, with opportunity to provide a closer look at particular artists, 

        artworks, and art styles (see Figure 6).</p>

      </p>

      <p>The general public’s art education is extended by CyberMuse’s 

        Favourites, a showcase featuring a selection of works accompanied by audiofile 

        and videoclips of curatorial interpretation of the works and the artists. 

        While this multimedia presentation is ready for classroom use, a lack 

        of teacher guides or supports subverts pedagogical issues or concerns. 

        The extent of teacher education is limited to education and public programs 

        which provide directions for teachers to attend the physical space of 

        the Gallery (see Figure 7). The curators direct the didactic learning 

        in this site, and although claiming to offer a “complementary experience, 

        a new level of interpretation” with the public, where “dialogue 

        is important,” the educational orientation to teaching is to ignore 

        teacher knowledge. This site teaches art, rather than showing a regard 

        or interest in teaching about art. As such, it has excluded concerns educators 

        may have with the site. </p>

      </p>

      <h2>The Promise and Challenge of Museum Education Web Sites</h2>

      <p>In realizing how museums continue to work the tension of providing quality 

        exhibits as well as fulfilling the larger public educational mission and 

        expectations through Web sites, the examples we provide above initiate 

        discussions about how museums interact with the teaching public. We realize 

        a museum’s educational commitment reflects as well as legitimizes 

        that museum’s collective and individual missions. Yet we also realize 

        that in achieving these missions, a disconnect is occurring between what 

        is offered in the physical spaces of the institution and what is presented 

        on the Web sites to teachers. </p>

      <p>Museums will remain powerful institutions for educating both teachers 

        and students. Each example we have shown illustrates a different interpretation 

        of the relationship between teachers and the museum community. The delivery 

        system constructs teachers as specialized sub-groups that can assist museums 

        in the ways in which Web-based knowledge is presented. Both the museums 

        and the teaching profession need to reconsider their roles in education 

        and draw from the collective ways in which knowledge may be transferred 

        and learning may occur. </p>

      <p>Further work is needed in both the educational and curatorial realms 

        of museum education, broadly speaking. We argue the call for further engagement 

        by teachers in questioning how museums include and exclude their presence 

        on museum Web sites. Having seen the possibilities, we have become more 

        convinced that teachers need to raise some of the unasked questions about 

        what constitutes understanding, about authority of knowledge, and about 

        education. An emerging sensibility among educational theorists who seek 

        to understand museum education would argue the distinctive features of 

        collaboration between teachers and museum professionals. The museum becomes 

        a crucial ground for struggle over educational distinctions. Education, 

        as publicly defined and delineated by museums, is presented as public 

        objects to which all teachers have claim. In fact, a good deal of the 

        museums’ educational credibility rests on clarifying the essence 

        of the relationship with teachers. </p>

      <p>There is nothing simple about the relationship between a museum and its 

        teaching public. Calls from museum professionals and educators have made 

        the relationship complex and contested. What once stood by museum tradition 

        and understanding as an educational institution remains. The conceptualization 

        of education hinges on how museums advance the ideas of education and 

        collaboration during times when the concepts themselves are being questioned 

        by various parties and by changes within the larger social and political 

        arenas.</p>
