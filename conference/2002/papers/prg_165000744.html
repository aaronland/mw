        <p class="AbstractText">The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) Protocol for 

          Metadata Harvesting (PMH) is designed to facilitate discovery of the 

          “hidden web” of scholarly information such as that contained 

          in databases, finding aids, and XML documents.  OAI-PMH supports standardized 

          exchange of metadata describing items in disparate collections such 

          as those held by museums and libraries.  This paper describes recent 

          work done by the University of Illinois Library, recipient of one of 

          seven OAI-related grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.  An overview 

          is given of the process used to export metadata records describing holdings 

          of the Spurlock Museum at the University of Illinois.  These metadata 

          records were initially created to help track artifacts as they were 

          procured, stored, and displayed and now are used also to support end-user 

          searching via the Spurlock Museum Website.  Spurlock metadata records 

          were mapped to Dublin Core (DC) and then harvested into the Illinois 

          project’s metadata repository.  The details of the processes used 

          to transform the Spurlock records into OAI compliant metadata and the 

          lessons learned during this process are illustrative of the work necessary 

          to make museum collections available using OAI-PMH.  Assuming institutions 

          like Spurlock make metadata available, what then can be done with these 

          information resources?  We discuss the OAI-based search and discovery 

          services being developed by the University of Illinois.  Issues such 

          as need for normalization of metadata, importance of presenting search 

          results in context, and difficulties caused by institution-to-institution 

          variations in metadata authoring practices are discussed.  </p>

          collections</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">Although the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) originally 

          focused on the exchange of metadata describing e-prints in the scientific 

          community (Van de Sompel &amp; Lagoze, 2000), the OAI-Protocol for Metadata 

          Harvesting (OAI-PMH) holds much promise for similar exchanges of metadata 

          describing the collections of museums and other cultural heritage institutions 

          (Perkins, 2001).  Materials in these types of collections often are 

          not well indexed (or not indexed at all) by commercial Web search engines.  

          Metadata describing such holdings is hidden in databases, finding aids, 

          and XML documents, or otherwise is not readily available to Web search 

          systems, which typically understand little more than simple HTML.  As 

          a result, these materials remain hard to find and out of reach for many 

          researchers.  With an interest in making these materials more visible 

          to scholars and other researchers, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 

          through an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant, is exploring the feasibility 

          of using OAI-PMH to build services to reveal and make more accessible 

          collections of cultural heritage material.</p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">While a focus of the Illinois research is on building 

          and testing software tools designed to harvest metadata provided by 

          OAI-compliant metadata providers, we also are exploring what can be 

          done with OAI-harvested metadata.  What is the fidelity and usefulness 

          of the indexes and search services that can be built atop a repository 

          of metadata harvested using the OAI-PMH?  The utility of such a metadata 

          repository will depend on many factors, including the development of 

          more uniform metadata authoring practices across various communities 

          of metadata providers.  Metadata is currently used primarily for a variety 

          of local purposes, and the schemas to which collections conform have 

          been adapted and tailored to meet local needs.  Less attention has been 

          paid to using metadata to support universal interoperability.  With 

          the advent of OAI and similar protocols, mapping local schemas to more 

          universally standard schemas for the support of interoperability is 

          gaining ground.</p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">Even assuming broader and more consistent application 

          of metadata schemas designed to support interoperability, there remains 

          considerable work to be done in learning how best to utilize aggregations 

          of metadata describing heterogeneous information resources.  There is 

          a need to normalize metadata so as to enable more consistent retrieval 

          of results from cross-collection searches.  Challenges also exist for 

          presenting search results in ways that provide appropriate contextual 

          information for the records retrieved.  We will discuss more detailed 

          examples of these and other issues throughout the paper.  We will outline 

          our efforts to overcome these issues in building a useful cross-collection 

          repository of cultural heritage materials.  We will also discuss our 

          work in progress, our plans for future development, and our reasons 

          for believing that the OAI protocol has great potential for increasing 

          access to and exposure of hidden resources via the Web.  </p>

        <h1>Illinois Project Harvest Experience To Date</h1>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">As of February, 2002, the Illinois OAI-PMH project 

          has harvested metadata from twenty-five different institutions or consortiums.  

          The resources described range from museum artifacts such as pottery 

          and clothing, to archival manuscript and personal paper collections, 

          to digitized photographs and monographs.  The sets of harvested metadata 

          range in size from the largest at 900,000 records to the smallest at 

          23 records.  Some sites include metadata not relevant to cultural heritage 

          mixed with more appropriate metadata.  Our OAI Harvester software excluded 

          such non-relevant metadata from our indices.  In total, we have inspected 

          over two million individual records, resulting in an index of approximately 

          770,800 records relevant to the subject domain of interest.  The institutions 

          providing metadata are diverse, including academic libraries, museums, 

          historical societies, public libraries, the Library of Congress, and 

          special consortia such as the Colorado Digitization Project and the 

          Alliance and Lincoln Trail Library systems in Illinois.  Eleven contributing 

          institutions are registered OAI metadata providers &lt;<a href="../http://www.openarchives.org/Register/BrowseSites.pl" target="_blank">http://www.openarchives.org/Register/BrowseSites.pl</a> 

          <a name="_Hlt334958"></a> &gt;.  Fourteen institutions have provided the Illinois 

          OAI-PMH project team with snapshots of relevant metadata, in a few cases 

          providing an entire database, which has then been made available from 

          Illinois servers in a manner compliant with OAI-PMH. </p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">While all of the metadata harvested from the registered 

          OAI metadata provider sites was in the required Simple Dublin Core format 

          (DC), metadata from the fourteen unregistered sites were given to the 

          project in a variety of formats.  These included finding aids formatted 

          in encoded archival description (EAD), MARC format metadata describing 

          bibliographic information, and local metadata schemas stored in HTML 

          files, XML files, or proprietary database structures.  We subsequently 

          mapped these records into DC, prior to making them available in accord 

          with the OAI-PMH.</p>

        <h1>Cross-Collection Repository Issues</h1>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">To enhance cross-collection searching, local metadata 

          schemas need to be mapped to standard schemas.  Even with greater adoption 

          of standard metadata schemas like DC, there remain wide variations in 

          the use of authoring conventions and the depth of descriptive information 

          included when creating metadata to describe cultural heritage collections.</p>

        <h2>OAI-PMH Basics</h2>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata 

          Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a new and still evolving protocol designed to 

          allow institutions to share metadata easily.  It is hoped that the standard 

          can help increase the discoverability of resources by scholarly researchers.  

          The Protocol underwent one minor revision during its first full year 

          of experimental implementation.  Version 2.0 is scheduled for release 

          in May 2002.  The fundamental pieces of the protocol are its adherence 

          to well-formed XML, its use of the HTTP standards for data transmission, 

          and its requirement that metadata records shared via the OAI-PMH be 

          made available in the DC metadata schema (optionally records may be 

          made available in additional metadata schemas as well) (Lagoze and Van 

          de Sompel, 2001).</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">One of the common challenges in setting up an OAI-PMH 

          metadata provider service is ensuring that the metadata to be exported 

          is mapped properly into DC.  There are fifteen DC elements (version 

          1.1): Title, Creator, Subject, Description, Publisher, Contributor, 

          Date, Type, Format, Identifier, Source, Language, Relation, Coverage, 

          and Rights.  Definitions and recommended usage of these elements can 

          be found at the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Website &lt;<a href="../http://www.dublincore.org/" target="_blank"></a><a href="../http://www.dublincore.org/" target="_blank">http://www.dublincore.org</a>&gt;.  

          Any or all of these elements may be used, and all are repeatable.  Because 

          much of the existing metadata about museum and special collections was 

          developed with limited resources, using local schemas and with local 

          needs in mind, the process of mapping to DC can be time and resource 

          consuming and potentially frustrating.  There is, however, a growing 

          community of DC users and freely available tools to assist with this 

          process.<i></i></p>

        <h2>Metadata Authoring Practices</h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">Harvesting done so far shows that metadata authoring 

          practices differ both in the selection of DC elements used and the depth 

          of information provided even within specific communities.  As previously 

          noted, DC elements are both optional and repeatable.  These allow a 

          significant degree of variation in the interpretation of which elements 

          to use and how to use them when metadata are created in DC and when  

          mapped to DC.  We examined records from the Library of Congress American 

          Memory Project, the American Museum of Natural History, the CIMI Demonstration 

          Repository, and the Spurlock Museum to compare the use of DC elements 

          (See Table 1).  Within each set of sample records, we calculated the 

          percent of records that contain each of the DC elements and the average 

          number of times an element is used in records that contain it.  The 

          usage variations are due in part to the intrinsic differences in the 

          collections described by the metadata.  However, some variations are 

          clearly due to different decisions made by each institution when determining 

          how to map their metadata into DC.  These variations pose a challenge 

          when attempting to build cross-collection search services and determining 

          what depth of detail should be shown in record display.  The variations 

          can also influence how a search engine’s ranking algorithm orders 

          the result set. </p>

        <h2><span>Spurlock Museum Metadata Mapping</span></h2>

        <p><span class="MsoBodyText"> Museums began to use personal computers 

          for tracking information about their collections using a variety of 

          proprietary databases. The use of proprietary software not specifically 

          designed with the museum community in mind can lead to inconsistencies 

          in the way collections are catalogued and tracked. The descriptive elements 

          within a locally created metadata format and the degree of completeness 

          when classifying and cataloging the items can vary widely from one organization 

          to another. This may have the effect of diluting the potential for discoverability 

          as searching aggregated repositories requires some degree of predictable 

          structure and normalization of metadata terms or concepts. At the same 

          time, one should not overlook the value of descriptive, locally created 

          metadata applied to artifacts by professionals familiar with the collection 

          and the museum. This is particularly valuable for collections used primarily 

          by a local community of users. At the University of Illinois Spurlock 

          Museum, FileMakerPro software is used to track the procurement, storage, 

          stage of processing, and display of artifacts. It is also used to maintain 

          descriptive information about the materials. The FileMakerPro database 

          interacts with a Web server to provide public access to a portion of 

          the collection &lt;<a href="../http://www.spurlock.uiuc.edu/" target="_blank">http://www.spurlock.uiuc.edu/</a>&gt;. 

          This database provides direct online access to 45,000 of over 210,000 

          records describing cultural heritage and natural science artifacts. 

          The Illinois OAI-PMH team was provided with metadata for all 210,000 

          records.</span></p>

        <p><span class="MsoBodyText"><br/>

          As a first step to making these metadata records available via OAI, 

          Spurlock&#39;s metadata were extracted from the FileMakerPro database using 

          a simple extraction script. It was necessary to map the locally created 

          and customized metadata format to a schema more closely related to DC. 

          To preserve richness of the local metadata schema, the Spurlock metadata 

          had to be mapped first to Qualified Dublin Core (DCQ) and then to simple 

          DC (Dublin Core Qualifiers, 2000).</span><br/>

          more time consuming than the time spent writing the scripts and manipulating

            from the original metadata records that could be considered equivalent 

            to DC Subject.  Colons were used to distinguish each of the three 

            original strings that were concatenated to create the single DC Subject 

            element.  If there were not three values to concatenate, then the 

            DC Subject filed would have two colons next to each other or a lone 

            colon at the beginning or end of the element.</div>

          The Coverage element was qualified by appending Spurlock metadata field

        <h2>Item-Level vs. Collection-Level Metadata</h2>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">One of the more challenging aspects of implementing 

          the OAI protocol is mapping from metadata schemas designed to describe 

          collections of materials (e.g., an EAD Finding Aid record) to the DC 

          metadata schema.  Finding aids may describe as many as several thousand 

          items or folders in an archive while DC has typically been used to describe 

          individual items (e.g., books, photographs, letters, personal journals, 

          audio files).  Each EAD record includes metadata describing the entire 

          collection and a &#34;description of subordinate components&#34; which 

          lists the separate series, sub-series, folders and items found in the 

          collection.  Some EAD files reach hundreds of kilobytes, or even several 

          megabytes, in size.  The challenge is to allow the richness of such 

          a large file to be exposed and made searchable alongside other records 

          that describe a single item or a much smaller collection.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">Another challenge is due to the very flexible nature 

          of the EAD standard designed to encourage participation by a large number 

          of institutions.  It is not surprising that the EAD records analyzed 

          for the Illinois OAI-PMH project reveal many differences in tag structures 

          and encoding patterns between institutions.  Despite these differences, 

          the records seem to have enough consistency to make a general cross 

          mapping between EAD and OAI-DC possible.  Although the EAD Application 

          Guidelines include two recommended mappings to DC, one for the finding 

          aid itself (i.e. the electronic resource) and another for the resources 

          described in the finding aid (i.e. the actual manuscripts or archives), 

          neither mapping will generate records adequate for use in an OAI repository.  

          While researchers are interested in discovering the existence of actual 

          archives or manuscripts, metadata about the finding aid itself is also 

          necessary in order to point effectively to the source records.  For 

          this reason, a flexible approach in mapping an EAD finding aid into 

          an OAI record is needed. </p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">We are currently testing a schema that produces many 

          DC metadata records from a single EAD file.  We first produce a record 

          describing the entire collection of materials in the finding aid.  This 

          top-level record becomes a base record for the finding aid and must 

          be as complete, accurate, and concise as possible.  The base record 

          includes a link to the source EAD file as well as references to related 

          parts of the collection.  These related parts are described in other 

          individual records we produce for each component level found within 

          the EAD file&#39;s description of subordinate components.  Although it is 

          not possible to link these records to each other adequately using simple 

          DC, a sophisticated use of qualified DC fields can produce linked records.  

          We hope this method will provide functional and easily searchable records.</p>

        <h1>Enhancing Discoverability of Resources</h1>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">Metadata authoring practices as discussed above play 

          important roles in determining the value of a cross-collection repository 

          focusing on cultural heritage materials.  Providing context for the 

          metadata, normalization techniques, and developing the search engine 

          and interface also need to be examined and explored for ways to enhance 

          the discoverability of the collected metadata.</p>

        <h2>Providing Context for Content</h2>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">One real concern related to the development of cross-collection 

          repository search tools is the context of the original artifact or digital 

          resource.  The value of information about the materials that may be 

          found in museum collections and archives is often related to the context 

          and the provenance of the object(s).  For example, a photographic slide 

          depicting part of a remaining wall of a basilica dating to the 4<sup>th</sup> 

          Century would have less value if it were viewed out of the context of 

          the architectural structure it represents.  It is not good enough simply 

          to make the slide available for viewing; it needs to be put into a proper 

          context.  Ideally, the holding institution of the artifact or digital 

          resource will determine the appropriate context.  We attempt to maintain 

          context in our cultural heritage repository by providing external links 

          back to the holding institutions.  When our repository encounters URLs 

          embedded within any of the metadata fields, they are mapped to the DC 

          Identifier element.  The links sometimes lead to the holding institution 

          or organization’s Web site, to  the digital display of the resource’s 

          record from the holding institution or organization’s database, 

          or to an actual display of the resource itself.  Given the non-persistent 

          nature of many URLs, it is possible that providing access to them may 

          lead to a large number of dead links over time.  With regularly scheduled 

          re-harvesting of the metadata, changes to the URLs should be reflected 

          in the records and therefore allow us to avoid excessive dead links. 

        </p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">For an example of a repository that has made thoughtful 

          consideration of these efforts, consider the metadata collection contributed 

          to the Illinois OAI-PMH project by TDC, the Teaching with Digital Content 

          project &lt;<a href="../http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/tdc/" target="_blank">http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/tdc/</a>&gt;.  

          This project provides a searchable database of images that can be used 

          by K-12 teachers to develop teaching modules that meet specific curriculum 

          requirements.  Partners providing metadata for the project include museums, 

          the Illinois State Library, the Chicago Public Library and others.  

          All the metadata has been entered into a database in a format that meets 

          the specific needs of the TDC project and does not conform to DC.  However, 

          the display of the records is very clean and consistent and maps well 

          into DC for the purposes of the Illinois OAI-PMH project.  With a link 

          directly to the Teaching with Digital Content resource provided from 

          a URL that has been mapped into the DC Identifier field, the context 

          is easily maintained by providing more background information about 

          the record when the user clicks on this link.</p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">We plan to explore methods for providing context 

          internally within the repository as well, linking back to the owning 

          institutions.  Providing easy access to related records may reveal overlooked 

          information and insights.  The collocation of works by the same author 

          and under the same subject headings is a given in databases using a 

          standardized metadata format and data entry.  In an aggregated database, 

          this collocation task is not trivial, but is potentially even more illuminating.  

          The context could be thought of in different ways, such as:</p>

      </div>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> a specific archaeological dig;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> a specific genre of art or literature (e.g. Art Nouveau).</span></li>

      </ul>

      <div class="Section1"> 

        <h2>Metadata Normalization</h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">In order to provide context internally and to enhance 

          discoverability of metadata records in a cross-collection repository, 

          some normalization of the metadata is desirable.  We believe that normalization 

          can be done on several of the DC elements, including Type, Format, Coverage, 

          and Date.  We hope to provide some degree of normalization on the Subject 

          element but have not yet developed our strategy for this more complex 

          normalization.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">Effective normalization requires us to:</p>

      </div>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Understand how the element was interpreted by metadata providers 

          and which elements in other metadata formats were mapped to the DC element;

        <h2 class="MsoList3"> 1. Extract and analyze the element values (content) 

        </h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">We organized the element values by metadata provider.  

          Each unique value was listed, along with the number of times it appeared 

          within each individual metadata set.  For example, we discovered that 

          only eleven of the twenty-five metadata providers used the Type element 

          and that approximately 1440 different Type values appear in the entire 

          metadata set.  Some providers only use one value, and others use over 

          800. (See Table 3)  The number of values seems to be dependent on whether 

          the institutions are using a specific or general vocabulary.  A large 

          number of records in the CIMI metadata use very specific types such 

          as “Physical Object: TOYS.”</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img src="cole.tab3.jpg" width="400" height="327"/><br/>

          <span class="MsoCaption">Table 3 - Number of Values and Vocabulary Used 

          for Type Element</span></p>

        <h2> 2. Determine how each element is interpreted and what controlled 

          vocabulary, if any, is used.</h2>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">We discovered that metadata providers used elements 

          in a variety of ways.  For example, the DC Date element was used for 

          the date the digital item was created, the date the physical item was 

          created or published, and the date an item was added to a collection.  

          Because OAI-PMH requires use of simple DC, the qualifiers that may have 

          explained these values further were not present.  Similarly the variety 

          and specificity or generality of controlled vocabularies also influenced 

          the next steps in the normalization process.</p>

        <h2> 3. Determine focus and vocabulary for normalization</h2>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">Each DC element was examined to determine our focus 

          for normalization for that particular element.  While the Date element 

          suggests a need to choose between options like ‘date created’ 

          or ‘date contributed’ and the particular format the value 

          is displayed in, the Type element required us to focus on the range 

          and specificity of vocabulary used.  For the Type element we determined 

          resource discovery may be enhanced by adding slightly more general terms 

          into the record alongside the ‘native’ vocabulary (e.g.: ‘physical 

          object’ added to ‘toy’).  Following the guidelines from 

          the DC Type Working Group, we developed our own vocabulary, pulling 

          terms from existing vocabularies where applicable, that provided the 

          level of specificity that would benefit our users the most (Apps, 2001).</p>

        <h2> 4. Normalizing the data</h2>

        <p class="MsoList">Once the vocabulary is developed, the values in the metadata 

          are mapped to the vocabulary terms.  The actual normalization of the 

          data is an automated process.  Following the mapping, values from the 

          vocabulary are added to each record as additional.  After new records 

          are harvested, the system compares the values of specific elements with 

          the mapping already done and adds appropriate terms from our vocabulary 

          where applicable.  If a term that has not already been mapped appears, 

          it is flagged and looked at by human eyes.</p>

        <h2>5. Providing services based on the normalization process</h2>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">The last step is to provide services so that users 

          can take advantage of the normalization process.  The ability to limit 

          searches or sort results by type of resource or to search for specific 

          date ranges or geographic areas is each made possible by the normalization 

          process.</p>

        <h2>End-User Search Interface Design Strategies</h2>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">We began our interface design following guidelines 

          for scenario-based design (Carroll, 2000).  We identified likely users 

          of the system as two distinctly separate groups - scholarly researchers 

          and K-12 teachers and students.  We have prioritized the scholarly researcher 

          as our primary user group for the preliminary interface design phase 

          of the project.  As time allows, we also intend to focus on K-12 teachers 

          and students.  In both cases, the need for a simple design seems important.  

          This is in line with generally accepted “best practices” in 

          interface design and is a logical choice given the potential for complex 

          and/or inconsistent record displays due to the heterogeneity of the 

          materials and institutions represented in the repository.  We identified 

          several types of common tasks our users might want to do with a repository 

          of cultural heritage materials and sketched out scenarios that supported 

          these tasks.  Based on these scenarios and working from the interface 

          built into our search engine (developed by the University of Michigan’s 

          Digital Library Extension Service), we designed the first iteration 

          of the end-user search interface following general usability heuristics 

          as outlined by Nielsen (2000).  Figure 3 shows a simple, preliminary 

          search interface developed as much for diagnostic purposes as for the 

          end-user. </p>

        <h1>Work in Progress / Future Plans</h1>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">As of February 2002, we have begun usability testing.  

          The feedback provided has already highlighted obvious flaws both in 

          the actual interface as well as back-end indexing methods.  We will 

          continue usability testing with new iterations of the interface.  Subjects 

          will include students enrolled at the University of Illinois Graduate 

          School of Library and Information Science.  We will also participate 

          in a survey of potential users to be distributed jointly by University 

          of Illinois and the University of Michigan.  This survey is intended 

          for various scholarly researchers on both campuses and will provide 

          feedback to be used in the future design and enhancement of the system.  

          Current plans for enhancing search functionality include adding options 

          to combine and refine searches and access to stored “expert searches.”  

          These expert searches are intended to provide examples of search strategies 

          used by experts from specific user communities.  We will also include 

          in our development user search features that focus on the K-12 teacher 

          and student user profiles as prioritized by our original scenario-based 

          design decisions.  This user group has particular needs that center 

          on curriculum development and the use of on-line resources for achieving 

          clearly defined, institutionally driven educational outcomes.  Under 

          consideration is an enhancement option that would gather user input 

          in the form of annotations or other types of notes one might be inclined 

          to make about particular sets of retrieved records and add these to 

          the index in a way that provides links and displays relationships between 

          records that are related according to the researchers using the system.</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>

        <p class="MsoBodyText">The Illinois OAI Metadata Harvesting Project represents 

          an attempt to enable the integrated searching of diverse types of cultural 

          heritage information.  In so doing, scholars may discover new links 

          across materials that are physically dispersed and that may potentially 

          address common themes across disciplines that have not been previously 

          formally recognized.  Providing cross-collection repositories that preserve 

          the context of the items represented by disparate metadata and offer 

          easily navigable search interfaces of this metadata requires several 

          essential components: </p>

      </div>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">

          <div class="Section1"> Metadata authoring practices must be compliant 

            with community accepted standard schema(s); </div>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">

          <div class="Section1"> Techniques for displaying item-level vs. collection-level 

            records need to be developed; </div>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Normalization processes should be applied to the metadata prior to 

          indexing; and </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">‘Best practices’ for interface design should be adhered 

          to for end-user search tools.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <div class="Section1"> The value of a usable search system that represents 

        texts, manuscripts, images, digital objects, and artifacts simultaneously 

        is difficult to quantify at this stage of our investigation.  However, 

        we believe that the exploration of techniques for providing simultaneous 

        access to such a range of materials is essential if we are to assist today’s 

        scholars in achieving their full potential as researchers.
