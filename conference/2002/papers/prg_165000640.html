	<meta name="description" content="Along the south side of the Palace of The Governors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, sit Native American artists and craftspeople who sell their handmade goods to tourists and local Santa Feans almost every day of the year, rain or shine. The over 900 vendors represent forty-one tribes, pueblos, chapters and villages in New Mexico, the Navajo Nation, and some parts of Arizona. Each morning the Vendors Committee conducts a lottery to see who will occupy the eighty spaces available under the portal that day.



The Vendors Committee creates and enforces rules for those who sell their work under the portal. The rules emphasize authenticity (a maker&#39;s mark is required on all goods), traditional materials (sterling silver is permitted; silver plate and commercial liquid silver is not), and handmade work made as generations of Indian artisans have made it. Because of space limitations, the distances that many of the vendors must drive to participate in the lottery for a space under the portal, and the vagaries of clientele and weather, the Portal Program has sought alternate venues to sell their goods. 



The Portal Program&#39;s coordinator has raised the vendor&#39;s interest in the Internet as a viable &#39;location&#39; that could expand their market as well as accomplish other significant goals. These goals include education and member training. The vendors want the world to know what defines authentic Indian art. They also want non-Native people to have greater understanding about the diverse cultures and art traditions represented in the Portal Program. Finally, the artist-vendors recognize that they need training in the use of electronic media in order to expand their income potential. It is appropriate, if ironic, that contemporary technology can work so effectively to preserve traditional American art forms and cultures by serving a population that is underserved, rural, and unique.

      <h1>Introduction </h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Along the south side of the Palace of The Governors 

        in Santa Fe sit Native American artists and craftspeople who sell their 

        handmade goods to tourists and local Santa Feans almost every day of the 

        year, rain or shine. The over 1,000 vendors represent forty-one tribes, 

        pueblos, chapters and villages in New Mexico, the Navajo Nation, and some 

        parts of Arizona. Each morning the Vendors Committee conducts a lottery 

        to see who will occupy the eighty or so spaces available under the portal 

        that day.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Vendors Committee also creates and enforces the 

        rules for those who sell their work under the portal. The rules emphasize 

        authenticity (a maker’s mark is required on all goods), traditional 

        materials (sterling silver is permitted; silver plate and commercial liquid 

        silver is not), and handmade work made as generations of Indian artisans 

        have made it. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Portal Program&#39;s coordinator has raised the vendors&#39; 

        interest in the Internet as a viable &#34;location&#34; that could expand 

        their markets as well as accomplish other significant goals. These goals 

        include public information and member training. The vendors want the world 

        to know what defines authentic Indian art. They also want non-Native people 

        to have greater understanding about the diverse cultures and art traditions 

        represented in the Portal Program. Finally, the artist-vendors recognize 

        that they need training in the use of electronic media in order to expand 

        their income potential. It is appropriate, if ironic, that contemporary 

        technology can work so effectively to preserve traditional American art 

        forms and cultures by serving a population that is underserved, rural 

        and unique.</p>

      <h1>History of the Palace of the Governors and Native American Vendors Program</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Native American Vendors Program has been an official 

        educational outreach program of the Palace of the Governors since 1922. 

        The Museum of New Mexico was established by the territorial government 

        of New Mexico in 1909. Originally located in the Palace of the Governors, 

        the Museum has grown to include sister museums in Santa Fe - the Palace 

        of the Governors History Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of 

        International Folk Art, and the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture - as 

        well as five state monuments throughout New Mexico. The museums share 

        centralized support services, including exhibitions, conservation, travelling 

        exhibits and state-wide programs and education. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Palace of the Governors has been a center of activity 

        since its construction as New Mexico’s second capitol in 1610. Said 

        to be the oldest continuously occupied public building in the United States, 

        the Palace has housed such diverse occupants as Spanish governors, a Pueblo 

        Indian community, and the territorial governments of the Mexican and American 

        republics.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">At the time of the Pueblo Revolt in 1680, the Palace 

        of the Governors was abandoned by the Spanish, like the rest of New Mexico, 

        to the indigenous Pueblo Indian people, who held the building for the 

        next thirteen years, converting it into traditional “apartment house” 

        dwellings. When don Diego de Vargas led his Army of Reconquest back to 

        Santa Fe in 1692, he found that the Palace resembled the multi-storied 

        Taos Pueblo.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Since its founding in 1909, the Museum of New Mexico 

        has worked to protect and promote traditional Southwest Native American 

        arts and crafts. Museum policy has traditionally reserved, and, in 1979, 

        won the legal right to reserve, the portal of the Palace of the Governors 

        for the exclusive use of Native Americans to display and sell wares they 

        or members of their households have made. As was mentioned above, the 

        Native American Vendors Program became an official organ of educational 

        outreach for the Museum of New Mexico in 1922.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Vendors, with a few exceptions, are members of New 

        Mexico pueblos or tribes. The exceptions are spouses of New Mexico Native 

        Americans who are enrolled members of Native American groups outside New 

        Mexico and graduates of the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa 

        Fe.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">There are over 1,000 authorized participants in the 

        Native American Vendors Program. All program participants must demonstrate 

        their technical mastery of craft skills as part of the application process. 

        The program is monitored, and work inspected, on a daily basis by a ten-member 

        Committee of vendors elected by their peers at the annual meeting held 

        each April. There is a complex set of rules and regulations governing 

        the conduct of the program and the quality of the items sold under the 

        portal. These rules are continually evolving. New rules, rule changes, 

        revisions and refinements are proposed jointly by vendors and the museum 

        administration and voted on at the annual meeting by program participants. 

        Rule changes are reviewed by the state attorney general&#39;s office and presented 

        to the Museum of New Mexico Board of Regents for final approval. These 

        rules, incidentally, are more stringent than any craft show, consistently 

        enforced, and frequently requested as guidelines by other organizations. 

      </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The portal market has been of real economic benefit 

        to New Mexico Native Americans for generations, providing a reputable 

        and reliable outlet for their arts and crafts. Unlike most pow-wows and 

        arts and crafts shows that sell space to artists, the portal spaces are 

        available free to the vendors 360 days a year. Administrative and maintenance 

        costs are minimal and are paid by the Palace of the Governors. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The question, &#34;What is traditional?,&#34; in 

        reference to Native American pottery, sandpainting, silversmithing, lapidary, 

        and weaving has as many answers as respondents. It is, as J.J. Brody wrote 

        in Indian Painters and White Patrons, &#34;a semantic booby trap.&#34; 

        However, it is indisputable that the majority of vendors live on the reservations 

        and are deeply conservative people with many traditional obligations - 

        both civic and ceremonial - at home; these can be extraordinarily demanding, 

        and frequently unpredictable, in terms of time.  The portal as a workplace 

        provides vendors with the scheduling flexibility to fulfill these obligations 

        without jeopardizing their livelihoods.  </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In addition, the Native American Vendors Program is 

        an ongoing experiment in multicultural cooperation. Members of all nineteen 

        New Mexico pueblos, the Navajo, Jicarilla and Mescalero Apache tribes, 

        and Anglo and Hispanic museum staff work closely together daily. From 

        the pueblos, reservations, villages, towns and cities of New Mexico, they 

        come together to form a tentative and fragile community which endures, 

        despite past enmities and contemporary tensions. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">This program has evolved organically over eight decades. 

        It provides visitors to and residents of New Mexico with the opportunity 

        to meet contemporary Native American craftspeople. It is a rare and authentic 

        venture.</p>

      <h1>Project Background</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">New Mexico is the fifth largest state in the nation, 

        with 121,367 square miles. Most of its approximately 1.5 million residents 

        live in rural, remote parts of the state. This is particularly true of 

        Native Americans living in the state’s nineteen pueblos and three 

        tribal reservations, particularly the Navajo Reservation. Life in the 

        pueblos and on the reservations is economically depressed, a situation 

        that is changing somewhat with the spread of gaming casinos. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">While the Native American Vendors Program provides 

        a viable opportunity for Indian artists to sell their goods, there are 

        a number factors that negatively affect the many of those who are members 

        of the program:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">There are only 80 spaces available 

          to sellers, whereas there are more than 1,000 individuals in the program. 

          Each morning, at 8:00 a.m., the vendors line up for a lottery to see 

          who gets to sell that day. Not surprisingly, in the summer there are 

          many who are unlucky with the draw, some who have come a long way.<i></i></span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="listwithnumbers" align="center"><br/>

        <b><i><img src="traube.fig4.jpg" width="450" height="369" alt="Contemporary photo of the portal, not on Web site"/><br/>

        <span class="MsoCaption">Fig. 4:</span></i></b><span class="MsoCaption"><i> 

        Contemporary photo of the portal, not on Web site</i></span></p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Because of the great distances 

          in New Mexico and the expense of getting to and staying in Santa Fe, 

          those who live in the Santa Fe-Albuquerque area have a great advantage 

          over those who live outside the north central corridor. Thus the program 

          has little effect on the area most desperately in need of economic stimulus, 

          the Navajo Nation.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="listwithnumbers" align="center"><b><i><a name="fig5"></a><a href="traubefig5.html"><img src="traube.fig5thumb.jpg" width="330" height="400" border="0"/></a><br/>

        (<a href="traubefig5.html" class="small">detailed image</a>)</span></b></p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Because the vast majority of 

          sales at the portal are made to tourists, the prices of items for sale 

          must be “impulse-friendly,” not too expensive. This means 

          that less costly and unique items are offered for sale. It also means 

          that jewelry is mostly what is offered for sale at the portal. There 

          are few vendors at the portal who sell paintings, weaving, pottery, 

          beadwork or leatherwork.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <h1>Technology, Economic Development <i>and</i> Cultural Preservation</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In the mid-1990’s, I worked with the Museum of 

        New Mexico to create a Web site (<a href="../http://www.nmculture.org/" target="_blank">http://www.nmculture.org</a>) 

        of public collections held by New Mexico museums, parks and monuments. 

        This was my first opportunity to work with the Palace of the Governors. 

        Subsequently, I did other consulting work with the Palace, each time getting 

        to know staff, and vendors, a little better. About three years ago, I 

        organized a meeting at the Palace of the Governors with members of the 

        museum staff, Vendors Committee and some artists and traders from the 

        Four Corners area. At this meeting we discussed the viability of creating 

        a Web site devoted to the work of the artists in the Native American Vendors 

        Program. Resistance to change outweighed interest in something quite so 

        new.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">At that time, very few if any of the vendors had computers. 

        In less than three years’ time, the picture has changed considerably, 

        with many of the vendors owning computers in their homes. Perhaps not 

        surprisingly, those computers are used mostly by their children and grandchildren; 

        that is, until this project. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">What changed attitudes towards technology in this conservative 

        group of people was a combination of factors. For one, every American 

        is inundated with references to the Web, e-mail and dot coms. However, 

        it was a new program coordinator who caused the ‘tipping point’ 

        in the vendors’ attitudes towards computers and Internet use. The 

        program coordinator, Deborah Davis, who is Arapahoe and Shoshone, employed 

        her technology skills in a seemingly small way that turned out to really 

        help the artists. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Deborah started making business cards for the vendors 

        to include with their jewelry and other objects when they made a sale. 

        On the business cards Deborah put <i>her</i> email address. The day after 

        Christmas, 2000, she came into work and found 80 e-mail inquiries about 

        work by vendors who distributed their business cards to buyers. This single 

        event made us realize that creating a program that utilized technology 

        in the service of economic development <i>and</i> cultural preservation 

        was a heck of a good idea. We saw that the artists could greatly expand 

        their market, that those who lived in the more remote parts of New Mexico 

        could join this initiative, and the public could benefit by purchasing 

        certifiably authentic, traditional works at reasonable prices.  </p>

      <h1>Creating the Web Site</h1>

      <h2>Scope of the Project </h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">New Mexico CultureNet, in partnership with North Central 

        New Mexico Economic Development District and the Museum of New Mexico, 

        is working with Native American artists and craftspeople who are members 

        of the Portal Program at the Palace of The Governors to create a Web site 

        where traditional, handmade, unique jewelry, pottery, bead work, sand 

        paintings, and leatherwork are offered for sale. Also hosted on the Web 

        site (<a href="../http://www.newmexicoindianart.org/" target="_blank">http://www.newmexicoindianart.org</a>) 

        is historical and educational information about the traditions and cultures 

        of the people who make these goods, as well as information about the Portal 

        Program and the Museum of New Mexico. The third aspect of the project 

        involves training the Indian vendors to use computers, make use of the 

        Internet, send and receive e-mail, and maintain the Web site, all of which 

        will contribute to their economic development. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><b>Targeted Audience/Market </b></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The market for the traditional artwork of Southwestern 

        Native American artisans includes a broad spectrum of people. They include 

        serious collectors as well as tourists who have visited Santa Fe, perhaps 

        purchased work from the vendors at the Portal, and wish to purchase additional 

        items. As people all over the world are interested in Native American 

        art, we believe many will be eager to view and purchase artwork online; 

        this is particularly true because the works will be offered by such a 

        reputable source, one that has the imprimatur or both the Portal Program 

        and the Museum of New Mexico. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">This project enjoys a built-in publicity network: the 

        Portal Program exists under the auspices of the state history museum, 

        the Palace of the Governors. The Palace, in turn, is part of the Museum 

        of New Mexico, a four-unit museum system that also consists of a Laboratory 

        of Anthropology, five state monuments, and a gallery in the governor’s 

        office. The Museum system generates a constant flow of press releases, 

        newsletters, and related information in which this project will be featured. 

        In addition, the Portal Project will be publicized to Web search engines 

        and in print ads in publications such as <i>New Mexico Magazine</i> and 

        <i>Native American Arts</i>. </p>

      <h2>How Native American Artists Will Benefit From This Project </h2>

      <p class="listwithnumbers">These are the ways Indian artists participating 

        in this program will benefit from it:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">They will be able to increase 

          their sales by selling from the Web site. Also, participants will have 

          opportunities to sell work that it is not possible to offer at the portal 

          because of size, price or both. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Members who live far from Santa 

          Fe will have the option of selling from a virtual venue, the Web site, 

          that has the same standards and rules of the mother program.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> By educating the public about 

          their art and its authenticity, vendors will be creating a more discriminating 

          audience for their work.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">By participating in training, 

          vendors will realize new capabilities to develop and participate in 

          commerce globally as well as locally. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">This project will contribute to 

          cultural preservation, and maintenance of traditional and authentic 

          ways of making art. </span></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Indicators of Project Success</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">We hope to see the following indicators of project 

        success by the end of Y2002:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Increased interest in and sales 

          of the artworks of vendors in the Portal Program</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Increased public understanding 

          of what is genuine, authentic and traditional Indian art </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Increased knowledge about the 

          unique  Portal Program and the Palace of the Governors </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Increased public knowledge and 

          understanding by the public of Native American cultures</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Increased interest in the Internet 

          and its uses by greater numbers of Native American artists</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">New knowledge and skills in the 

          use of the Internet by vendors in the Portal Program</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Application of new skills by 

          members of the Portal Program to sustaining and nurturing the economic 

          initiative proposed here </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Increased participation by Native 

          Americans in the North Central New Mexico Economic Development District 

          activities.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Lessons Learned, Looking Ahead</h2>

      <h3>Culture Preserved; A Culture Changed</h3>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">This project is changing the culture of the Portal 

        Program. Three years ago, almost none of the vendors had computers in 

        their homes. This project is giving the artists themselves exposure to 

        computer technology and empowering them to make use of it. Significantly, 

        the project will expand the audience for their work. This fact has particular 

        implications for those Indian artists who live outside the Santa Fe/Albuquerque 

        area. </p>

      <h3>This Project As a Model</h3>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"> It is the hope of Portal Program Coordinator Deborah 

        Davis and myself that this project will serve as a model to those pueblos 

        and nations which are not located in North Central New Mexico. For example, 

        we hope to work with the Farmington Museum and the Navajo Nation, both 

        located in northwestern New Mexico, to create a mirror program, a virtual 

        marketplace and information resource.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><b><i>Assessment</i></b><i>: </i>Our original expectations 

        for the project were realistic, with the notable exception of the time 

        frame. We were dealing with a population of more than 1,000 artists, only 

        a small fraction of whom frequently come to the Portal. Therefore, there 

        is no guarantee that the person one sees on a Monday will be there the 

        following Monday or even the next day. Feast days and other culturally 

        important events often sidetrack expectations that we non-Indian people 

        may have. Again, the amount of time (huge) we have put into this project 

        far exceeds the funding we received from the Fund for Folk Culture and 

        the Los Alamos National Laboratory Foundation.</p>

      <h2>Looking Ahead:</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">I am concerned about sustaining the program beyond 

        the funding we have received. It is my opinion that the artists themselves, 

        at least at this point, cannot sustain the project without expert help. 

        And Deborah Davis, while a critically important partner, does not have 

        the time or the technical expertise to do all that needs to be done to 

        ensure the continuance of the Web site and classes. CultureNet is willing 

        to remain involved, but only if we receive fair compensation to do so. 

        Having said this, here is what we hope to accomplish in the next few months:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Late February, 02 - Web site launched 

          and publicized</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">March, 02 -  Site introduced to 

          the artists in the Native American Vendors Program in special ceremonies 

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> April, 02 – December: As 

          the site is publicized, we hope that sales of works will occur regularly 

          and will be an effective stimulant for involvement by heretofore reticent 

          artists.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">May, 02 – December: We will 

          approach the New Mexico pueblos that have casinos and solicit sustaining 

          contributions for this project from them. Their contributions will help 

          defray the costs of Web site maintenance and ongoing computer instruction. 

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> 2003 - With continued support, 

          we will be able to create regional programs throughout New Mexico. We 

          want to do more profiles on Indian artists and include portraits, photographs 

          of them working and oral histories. </span></li>

      </ul>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In early February of this year, the founder of the 

        Institute of American Indian Arts, Lloyd Kiva New, died at the age of 

        85. Those who eulogized him mentioned that he championed contemporary 

        arts that expressed Indian identity, but which employed any style of art. 

        New broke with the notion of encouraging art to be made “the way 

        our grandfathers did it.” This project does precisely that: celebrates 

        and perpetuates traditional crafts and art the way it has been made for 

        generations. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">So, it seems to me that there is room for both contemporary 

        art created from a broad intellectual fine arts tradition, liberated from 

        the constraints of repetition and predictability, and traditional art, 

        which honors one’s heritage, freed of much of the expectations and 

        pressures that come with working as a contemporary artist in a high pressure 

        and ever commercialized art world. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Indian artists at the ‘porch,’ as it 

        is called, are not addicted to the new, novel and ephemeral. They exist 

        in another space and time. Perhaps it is more than ironic—in its 

        own way it is radical - that these deeply conservative people are doing 

        this project with us, knowing that doing so will change the culture of 

        their program and, very likely, their personal lifestyles. </p>
