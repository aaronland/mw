      <p class="PaperTitle">Designing the Accessible Web Museum: If I Can Experience 

        It, Everyone Can Experience It Better</p>

      <p class="Author">Jeffrey J. Moyer, M.R.A, Consultant on Access, USA</p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">Individuals with disabilities face barriers when seeking 

        to interact with virtual  and physical museums.  Solutions to accessibility 

        problems can provide an individualized experience for all visitors.  The 

        application of international standards can provide accessible web museums.  

        Onsite, museum location-specific web portals will make the treasures of 

        museums available to everyone in the manner and with the content they 

        desire. Cutting edge technology will open both aspects of the museum experience 

        to all visitors.</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">Keywords: disability, access, standards, location-based 

        information, solutions</p>

      <h1>Accessible to Whom?</h1>

      <p>There are many compelling reasons to design web museums that are open 

        to and accessible by all cyber visitors.  In addition to opening access 

        to people with a range of abilities and limitations, accessible design 

        also provides websites that are more usable by all, and available through 

        a wider array of technology.  When most designers think about access considerations 

        they try to imagine the needs of what they assume is a very small population 

        that has no real need or desire to seek or use their information.  However, 

        recently released data from the U.S. Census presents a very different 

        picture.  Consider the following.  (Data from the U.S. Census  is  used 

        – not because of a U.S.-centric perspective – but because these 

        current and reliable figures represent an excellent snapshot of the human 

        family in developed countries.)  Of all Americans over 15 years old, 3.7% 

        have difficulty seeing words or letters, 3.8% have difficulty hearing 

        conversation and, we can assume, sound content on websites, 3.2% have 

        difficulty grasping objects, including a computer mouse, 1.7% have learning 

        disabilities, 0.7% have retardation, and 0.9% have Alzheimer&#39;s, senility, 

        or dementia (McNeil, 2001). For each of these subgroups, there are design 

        considerations to remove the barriers to website use that do not detract 

        from the nature, depth, quality, or design interest of accessible web 

        pages.  These percentages are not additive, because   many people with 

        disabilities experience multiple disabilities.  However, almost one in 

        five Americans self report having a significant disability.   </p>

      <h1>Disability Facts and Design Fixes</h1>

      <p>Let&#39;s look briefly at what the facts are about some categories of disability 

        and what museum web designers and administrators can do to create welcoming 

        and usable web museums.  </p>

      <h2>Blindness</h2>

      <p>For those who are functionally blind, we can assume that there will be 

        no screen or mouse access.  Computers, whatever the application or function, 

        are used through speech synthesis or electronic Braille displays.   This 

        presents the need for linear text presentations and specific table clarity 

        when tables are used.  Alt tags can provide text descriptions for all 

        graphic or non-text images.  Further, alt tags and text on links will 

        provide specific information of benefit to those not able to follow visual 

        elements like &#34;Click here.&#34;   Avoid multiple columns when presenting 

        text.  Screen readers may read all text on a line, disregarding columns, 

        which will result in unintelligible verbal garble.  When my now-adult 

        son was learning to read as a child, he did not understand columns and 

        read the following sentence as his eyes jumped the white space between 

        two columns in a children&#39;s encyclopedia, &#34;Dogs are human beings…and 

        the only mammals with wings.&#34;  Articulate row and column for each 

        table cell.  That is, don&#39;t present numbers within table format without 

        writing within the cell its row and column position.  Summarize tables 

        to highlight significant data if specific detail is not needed by the 

        user.  Avoid boxes around text because they can interfere with the understandability 

        of surrounded data.  Imagine hearing &#34;underline,&#34; or &#34;asterisks,&#34; 

        67 times as the speech synthesizer reads what is on the screen.</p>

      <h2>Low Vision</h2>

      <p>The majority of individuals with vision loss have low vision -- defined 

        as loss of visual field, limited acuity, or both.  People with low vision 

        have a wide range of visual abilities and often use computers by reading 

        enlarged or enhanced text.  Access is often gained through variable screen 

        enlargement, a technique that by definition reduces the percentage of 

        the total screen that can be viewed at one time.  Such enlargement also 

        necessitates left-right scrolling.  When laying out pages, present text 

        outside of graphic elements, making text easier to read.  Avoid difficult-to-read 

        fonts.  Avoid moving text and pages that auto-refresh because many users 

        with low vision, and other disabilities, may read more slowly.  Maintain 

        high-low glare contrast – contrast sensitivity is often diminished 

        for people with low vision.   Provide the ability to over-ride style sheets 

        with personal style sheets, thereby allowing low vision users to employ 

        color and contrast selections to assist with maximum individual usability.</p>

      <h2>Color Blindness  </h2>

      <p>Most of us would not think of color blindness as a real problem for web 

        users.  However, that is not necessarily true.  Color blindness ranges 

        from color deficiency to total color loss.  The worst colors for many 

        individuals with damage to color perception are reds, greens, oranges, 

        and yellows.  Color coding and critical highlighting can prove problematic 

        for people with color perception difficulty.  Use additional designation 

        for critical color attributes, i.e. asterisks or grouping.  Use bright, 

        pure colors, rather than muted or darker hues.  Like low vision, provide 

        for user ability to over-ride style sheets with personal style sheets.  

        To analyze your museum site as it might appear without color attributes, 

        try checking your site on a black/white monitor. There is an excellent 

        website that provides a general color-blindness simulator, <a href="../http://www.vischeck.com/" target="_blank">www.vischeck.com</a> 

        .   </p>

      <h2>Deafness and Hearing Impairment</h2>

      <p>Deafness and Hearing Impairment, like all disabilities, presents a full 

        continuum of loss.  Assume that the audible portion of your site will 

        be inaccessible.  Lip reading, a generally ineffectual means of receptive 

        communication under the best of conditions, becomes impossible on computer 

        monitors.   Furthermore, lip reading and sign language use are not universal 

        among people with hearing loss.  Provide synchronized captions and/or 

        transcripts for audio elements of web pages. To understand this concept, 

        consider the model of television captioning.</p>

      <h2>Physical Disability</h2>

      <p> Physical Disability can represent a range of limitation to hand dexterity 

        and control, often interfering with mouse use.    Access to computers 

        for people with severe physical disabilities is gained through keyboard 

        or alternative switching systems that take advantage of whatever volitional 

        control may be available.  These may include; key guards to avoid inadvertent 

        key strokes, head or mouth sticks, puff and sip switches, tongue-operated 

        switches, and eye-gaze systems.  Individuals who have physical limitations 

        often experience fatigue when multiple repetitive key stroke sequences 

        are demanded.  Avoid navigational strategies requiring only mouse use.  

        Provide for means of skipping long link lists to avoid fatigue.  Number 

        links for immediate access and implement access key for selectability.</p>

      <h2>Cognitive Disabilities</h2>

      <p>When we consider cognitive disabilities, we must again think about a 

        continuum of cognitive abilities and limitations that includes memory 

        impairment, retardation, and learning disabilities.  The genius Einstein 

        lived with cognitive disability.  More typical are the millions of individuals 

        with disabilities in this category  who learn, work, and live normal lives.  

        The effect of these disabilities on web access is the inability to orient 

        to and navigate within overly complex and poorly organized sites. Consider 

        the following suggestions.   Develop simple and intuitive interfaces.  

        Clearly and directly word text.  Keep navigational schemes consistent.  

        Use non-decorative representational pictographics. Maintain alt tag text 

        and the ability to freeze animated graphics.  Individuals with reading 

        limitations may use text to speech software. Provide a variety of searching 

        strategies.</p>

      <h2>Seizure Disorder</h2>

      <p>Seizure Disorder is rarely considered when thinking about public places 

        or public websites.  Some seizures may be triggered by flashing light 

        between 2 and 55 Hz. Simply avoid flashing banners or other page elements 

        that attract attention but may trigger seizures.</p>

      <h1>Technical Standards and Resources</h1>

      <p>The source for international standards on accessible web design is <a href="../http://www.w3.org/WAI" target="_blank">www.w3.org/WAI</a>.  

        The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is the international standards 

        consortium.  One of the greatest contributions they have given the web 

        community is the priority levels for their accessibility guidelines.  

        Priority 1 designates essential design elements for access by one or more 

        subgroups of people with disabilities. Priority 2 indicates strongly recommended 

        design elements, and Priority 3 desirable design elements. Further, the 

        WAI provides technical &#34;how to&#34; standards, guidance, and materials 

        for web designers.  </p>

      <p>For those interested in applying the principles of accessible design 

        to their museum websites, there are a plethora of resources that can teach, 

        guide, direct and assess efforts.    </p>

      <h1>The Future</h1>

      <p>Web museums are virtual representations of physical museums in most cases.  

        Occasionally virtual museums reflect no “brick and mortar” place 

        of collection.  In either case, the desirability of making virtual visits 

        possible that are not tied to a desktop computer is obvious.  Further, 

        when the museum on the web reflects a physical museum, being able to access 

        the web while visiting the physical museum opens a never-before tapped 

        potential for content exploration for everyone as well as a means of providing 

        access to data currently unavailable to those unable to see or read labels 

        and signs.  </p>

      <p>The New York Times Circuits Section reported on February 14, 2002, that, 

        according to the Yankee Group, a Boston-based market research firm, only 

        10% of the U.S.&#39;s 130 million cell phone users currently use phones to 

        send and receive data.  The Yankee Group projects that by 2006, fully 

        half of all cell phone customers will use wireless data services.  A new 

        generation of cell phones will be needed and is under rapid development.  

        Future phones must have location functions built in, most of today’s 

        phones do not.  It was also pointed out that in order for users to browse 

        the web with tiny 5 line displays, websites will have to develop scaled-back 

        versions, free of graphics and band-width-hogging material. The prototype 

        design mentioned for this type of access is Amazon.com&#39;s text only service 

        for users with visual disabilities.  The website, <a href="../http://www.amazon.com/access" target="_blank">www.amazon.com/access</a> 

        , is free of graphics, advertisements and pictures.  The Times noted that 

        such design is perfect for cell phone users.  This type of web use will 

        employ Short Messaging Service, or SMS.  SMS will be the next breakthrough 

        service according to Verizon Wireless (Hafner, 2002).  Such portable on-site 

        web museum access then will necessitate attention to the same type of 

        design that today will assist any user using speech for reading.   </p>

      <p>The article further notes that with GPS, location-based services present 

        a nearly infinite range of possible applications.  But GPS does not work 

        indoors.  A U.S. company based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Talking Signs 

        Inc.( <a href="../http://www.talkingsigns.com/" target="_blank">www.talkingsigns.com</a> 

        ), has developed and is installing an access technology that provides 

        directional, way-finding information through infrared transmitters and 

        receivers.  (Note: The author serves as Director of Community Relations 

        for Talking Signs). This innovative access technology also holds the potential 

        for solving the problem of location-based services indoors.   Talking 

        Signs® transmitters incorporate PointLink™ technology - now being 

        installed in all transmitters in the U.S., Japan, and Europe.  This combined 

        system includes directional infrared transmitters that provide human voice 

        way-finding sign messages and simultaneously emit an identification, or 

        domain, code for accessing web pages particular to that location in the 

        built environment.  This will be accomplished when next generation receiving 

        devices -- such as future cellular web phones or PDA&#39;s -- can process 

        the received unique domain code and then communicate with wireless local 

        area network technology or cellular service.  The company is installing 

        the system in numerous public places worldwide including on buses, in 

        transit stations, universities, convention centers, intersections, and 

        a variety of other public venues.  This remote infrared audible signage 

        has been installed in many museums including a pilot demonstration at 

        The Boston Museum of Science and a complete installation at the Cincinnati 

        Children’s Museum.  An extensive installation of 300 Talking Sign® 

        transmitters are incorporated throughout the new The Pequot Museum, outside 

        of Mystic, Connecticut.  While earlier Talking Sign® system installations 

        were for the purpose of directional way-finding alone, all current Talking 

        Sign® transmitters incorporate PointLink™ technology.  Presently 

        the following Japanese museums are equipped with Talking Sign® and PointLink™ 

        transmitters: the Nature Museum, Kanagawa Prefecture; the Nature Museum, 

        Ibaraki Prefecture; the Archaeology Museum, Kani City; the Dejima History 

        Museum, Nagasaki City, and the Exhibition Centro of the Tokyo Gas Company, 

        Ltd.  </p>

      <p>Let’s get back to imagining how web access will be provided using 

        location-based information through PointLink™ technology.  The handheld 

        device is pointed at a PointLink™ transmitter and, by receiving and 

        processing this infrared transmission, communicates the  “domain 

        code” of that particular location to an Internet Service Provider.  

        The web page of the location will then appear on the hand held device 

        where the desired information is presented to be browsed by the user, 

        either through visual or auditory means.  Imagine visitors to your museum 

        being able to review content on site in their native language.  Utilizing 

        the power of the web, the museum visitor also has immediate access to 

        the depth and range of data on the museum website germane to that physical 

        location.  In the U.S., Japan, and Europe, the Talking Signs® system (which 

        contains PointLink™) is spreading rapidly, making it the defacto 

        world standard.  A critical aspect of this means of providing location-based 

        services is that, in addition to providing a portal to the web, the technology 

        is device, system, and protocol independent. </p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p>So as surely as the curb cut has increased freedom of travel and comfort 

        to numerous segments of the population not envisioned by advocates and 

        planners involved in the removal of architectural barriers in the built 

        environment, developing and maintaining accessible web museums and linking 

        this content to location-based access in the built museum will expand 

        and integrate the web museum as never before.  Providing curb cuts ensures 

        physical access.  Designing accessible web sites will ensure universal 

        access.  We are on the cusp of real change.  We have the technology.  

        We have the understanding.  Now all we need is the vision and the will.
