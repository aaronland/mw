      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class="AbstractText">This paper investigates what a “virtual museum”, 

        also known as an on-line and web museum. Virtual museums offer an alternative 

        to visiting physical showrooms with a huge access to works of art, retrospectives 

        on the life of an artist, new acquisitions, current and past exhibitions, 

        quizzes, databases, and so on. As Mokre (1998) and Davallon (1998) stress: 

      </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">“none of the limitations of the physical museum 

        apply to the virtual museum. There are no awkward display spaces, no limitations 

        on the number of objects accessible to the visitor, and indefinite storytelling 

        about those objects from which we can pass on tradition.”</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">On-line exhibitions are thus seen as more suitable 

        for a wider audience. We also like to think that behind the concept of 

        on-line museums there is a process of democratization of the arts, bypassing 

        social status and cultural backgrounds. It provides an opportunity to 

        learn about museums throughout the world, and all free of charge!</p>

      <h1>Premise of the research</h1>

      <p class="normal">We put forward in this paper that visitors become “users,” 

        as they require computer skills, when they personally seek information 

        on the arts through a virtual environment. We question the curators’ 

        ability to quench the visitors’ quest for knowledge within the cultural 

        field. We are nevertheless convinced that the <i>framing of users</i> 

        with key-paths (e.g., hypertext links), captions (e.g., Picture of the 

        Month), pictograms (e.g., icons), and higher-end technologies (e.g., VRML)<b> 

        </b>demonstrates the curators’ attention for mediating concepts, 

        objects, or names of artists considered as salient information, and therefore 

        brings about a particular outlook on masterpieces. Those components raise 

        significant issues<b> </b>for a) the control of and access to information, 

        as well as, b) the dissemination of content.<b> </b>We will examine how 

        web museums can provide “knowledgeable information” for the 

        French population, based on the premise that personalization of content 

        allows for better learning attainments.</p>

      <h2>Selected web museums</h2>

      <p class="normal">The results originate from an exploratory study undertaken 

        for the <i>Direction des musées de France</i> (Vol and Bernier, 1999) 

        on 10 on-line museums (both French and English) drawn from an international 

        overview of 300 sites with various orientations (educational, historical, 

        artistic, etc.) through multiple search engines (e.g., <i>Yahoo</i> and 

        <i>Excite</i>). They were then classified into 5 fields of collection<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> 

        [1] </a>: Archaeology and Antiquity, Ethnology and Civilization, History, 

        Fine Arts, and Heritage. The museum sites chosen are listed below in Table 

        1.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Table 1: Selection of the 10 virtual museums</p>

      <h1>Methodology</h1>

      <p class="normal">Our methodological perspective follows the Hypermedia 

        Design Model (HDM) which includes five basic elements. The <i>content</i> 

        relating to semantic means, the <i>structure</i> carrying the application 

        content, the <i>navigation</i> referring to possible links, the <i>dynamics</i> 

        defining the interactivity, and the <i>presentation </i>describing the 

        layout elements. This model was found to be useful for analyzing virtual 

        museum designs (Garzotto &amp; Discenza, 1999; Paterno &amp; Mancini, 

        1999). All participants were invited to browse the web sites of five museums 

        and tell us on a coding sheet which ones they appreciated best with respect 

        to five features: 1) homepage, 2) ergonomics, 3) computer graphics, 4) 

        content, and 5) technological adds-on.</p>

      <h2>Participants</h2>

      <p class="normal">The research was done in two phases, with a total of 37 

        Parisian users (21 men and 16 women), between the ages of 15 and 68 (average 

        age of 45 years), mainly university graduates, with various levels of 

        familiarity with the Internet (i.e., newbies to daily users). Reynold 

        (1997) reports the average age of virtual visitors is between 40 and 64 

        years. The <i>Seventh GVU Survey</i> (<a href="../http://www.gvu.gatech.edu/user_surveys/survey-1997-10" target="_blank">1998</a>) 

        also unveiled that cultural web sites attract an older crowd than the 

        typical Internet user whom is a male his mid-thirties. Bowen’s analysis 

        (1998) is akin to the previous research as he shows that: “46% of 

        museum virtual visitors are women.” In other words, gender is more 

        balanced than for overall web users.</p>

      <p class="normal">French subjects are particularly relevant for a study 

        of virtual museums because they are newly accustomed to the Internet<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> 

        [2] </a>. We thus made our selection of users according to two characteristics 

        “field of study or profession,” taking for principal variable 

        “strong and little sensitivity to ergonomics.”</p>

      <p class="normal">During the first phase, in April of 1998, we composed 

        a sample of 27 well-schooled assiduous users 14 men and 13 women, in their 

        mid-thirties (between 22 and 52 years old), with a Bac+2 (i.e., sophomores). 

        They were mainly graduate students in the Hypermedia program, especially 

        Master’s in Documentation<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> [3] </a> and DESS Hypermedia candidates<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> [4] </a>, at the <i>Université Paris 8</i>. We also 

        found independent workers with technical training as well as people in 

        the cultural sphere. As for the occupation of virtual visitors, Bowen’s 

        results (1998) show that nearly 40% count for the General Public, Business 

        people (approx. 30%), and Education-related professions (approx. 25%). 

        The second phase took place one weekend in January of 1999 during workshops 

        on the Internet at the<i> Cité des Sciences et de l’Industrie</i> 

        in Paris, and would inform us about novices. Among the 10 more users (7 

        men and 3 women, with an average age of 40 years, which possessed a Bac+4 

        [i.e., Master’s degree], except for 2 high-school students). Almost 

        half of them were first-time surfers<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> [5] </a>.</p>

      <p class="normal">We also investigated their museum practices. That is, 

        regular visitors visit museums twice a month, and are mostly interested 

        in temporary exhibitions<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> [6] </a>, and dislike “blockbusters,” as they 

        are already well acquainted with the permanent ones. Occasional visitors 

        frequent museums every two months, whereas the neophytes of the arts seldom 

        visit them (i.e., every six months). These two types of visitors appreciate 

        blockbusters of national art galleries. It is also an opportunity for 

        them to discover national museums. Regular visitors favor traditional 

        topics, occasional visitors and neophytes of the arts however have a preference 

        for broader topics, like artistic trends. Regardless of their museum practices, 

        all visitors look for well known Art or Civilization museums, and mention 

        that on-line visits are a great opportunity to plan a trip abroad or to 

        get acquainted with regional museums. We also learn that cultural web 

        sites are implicitly linked to leisure.</p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>

      <p class="normal">There are three limitations of this research: 1) the primary 

        motive for browsing on web museums was initiated by our survey. It was 

        noted by Bowen (1998) that their main benefit is to explore a personal 

        interest (up to 70%); 2) the panel was limited to 37 people, considering 

        that the overall number of Net surfers is 375 million users as of May 

        2000 (French users represent only 2,5% of them, <i>eTForecasts, </i>2000),<b> 

        </b>and 3) our sample was exclusively French speaking Parisians, in comparison 

        to Internet users among whom three-quarters have English as their mother 

        tongue. However, Chadwick (1999) mentions in his study of web visitors 

        that: “recruiting of participants via the Internet brings [also] 

        a self-selected population and contributes to a gender gap, as more men 

        than women complete on-line.” Moreover, Bowen’s <i>VLmp</i> 

        findings (1998) show that “88% of virtual visitors live in North 

        America,” this high percentage may be explained by the fact that 

        on-line questionnaires are only available in English.</p>

      <h1>French viewpoints of virtual museums</h1>

      <p class="normal">The prevailing perception of the web museum is one who 

        provides information on Fine Arts museums, and that emphasizes taste for 

        aesthetic experiment. French users indeed look forward to getting content 

        on art collections. Oono’s results (1998) indicate that virtual visitors 

        are mostly interested in art collections and exhibition rooms (52.5%). 

        Users claim on-line exhibitions with many images and little text, although 

        one should not forget that museums are a place of literature to pass on 

        culture through a textual environment, not just by displaying objects, 

        because the image is contingent without words. We also found that culture 

        is intrinsically linked to an iconic language (e.g., mosaics of paintings), 

        in particular art objects which carry a symbolic load for the French. 

        Futers (1997) reported that 85% of web visitors want images of works of 

        art. Users also expect specific information from a virtual museum, such 

        as temporary exhibitions, entrance fees, and upcoming conferences. Reynolds 

        (1997) has stressed that general information counts for 41% of the demands.</p>

      <h2>Homepage</h2>

      <p class="normal">The homepage is the paramount feature that encourages 

        the visitors to plug-in to web museums and entrust themselves to on-line 

        exhibitions. It must be colorful, quickly downloaded, with an optimal 

        view of available components (e.g., navigational paths, captions, technological 

        adds-on), and would therefore enhance interest according to personal queries.<b> 

        </b>Regardless of the museums chosen, a majority of visitors agree that 

        most homepages give a general idea of the topics. Users thus appraise 

        highly the <i>Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York</i> (MET) and the 

        <i>Museum of Natural History of London</i> (MNH) because they aim to reach 

        specific audiences. For instance, For kids: games, guide, hunts at the 

        MNH (See Figure 1), or Explore and Learn of the MET. These museums raised 

        a strong interest as visitors can test their knowledge. </p>

      <h1>Ergonomics</h1>

      <p class="normal">We learn, independently of familiarity with the Internet, 

        that our users are conventional in their ways of surfing on-line museums 

        since they mainly use the hypertext and the table of content. Furthermore, 

        users expect a “virtual cartography of the premises” such as 

        the greeting of the <i>Canadian Museum of Civilization</i>, to easily 

        locate oneself and freely browse in and out of the showrooms. Novices 

        and occasional visitors expect a map as provided in the physical museum 

        with a list of paintings as well as an index of artists.</p>

      <p class="normal">Assiduous surfers seek information in a traditional way, 

        as the privileged paths for browsing on virtual museum is the hypertext 

        (e.g., highlighted word) followed by the table of content. A synopsis 

        is also suggested, as for instance a bookmark that facilitates returns 

        to preceding consultations, or more links towards images, that is, moving 

        through web pages without changing subject. Regular visitors also expect 

        “Pop up Bubbles” to discover works of art available on their 

        personal computers. However, novices favored the table of content, back 

        and forward commands then the hypertext. </p>

      <p class="normal">Most users are displeased with the absence of regular 

        shape of indexes on virtual museums. It is stated as a major inconvenience 

        to become acquainted with the exhibits. Garzotto and Discenza (1999) have 

        indeed noted from an analysis of <i>32 Best of the Web museums</i> that 

        only 9% have a singular shape of browsing. </p>

      <h1>Computer graphics</h1>

      <p class="normal">Users want an iconography that is very intuitive such 

        as the pictograms of <i>Medieval Paintings in the South of France </i>with 

        its vaults and chapels, where the mosaics of images match the information 

        to be obtained<b>. </b>For instance, the “death&#39;s-head” icon 

        convinced an occasional visitor to browse on this section, even though 

        he was more or less interested in the topic of religion.<b> </b>Along 

        the same vein, consultation of on-line exhibitions is closely related 

        to features such as color, text, and images. Vol and Léger (1999) reported 

        that, from both a French and a Canadian’ perception on <i>Christmas 

        Tradition</i>s, images are extremely important, but sound makes the information 

        less grim since it personalizes content; it makes the browsing less unpleasant 

        for occasional visitors. In this respect, users said that the <i>National 

        Art Gallery of Washington</i> and the <i>Museum of Fine Art of Bordeaux</i> 

        have sober homepages. Fortunately, they did not provoke<b> </b>a lack 

        of interest in its content. Nielsen (1996) however pointed out to avoid 

        loud colors for background screen, and emphasize content within a transparent 

        navigational structure (i.e., neutral). </p>

      <p class="normal">Many users claim a graphic processing affixed on paintings, 

        which is called a “lighting effect” which highlights the texture, 

        as provided by the <i>National Art Gallery of Washington</i> (See Figure 

        2).<i> </i>Regular visitors stress that they do not want to stare at microscopic 

        masterpieces on a computer, whereas in reality they lose themselves when 

        looking at them in the showroom. Indeed,<i> </i>the reproduction of works 

        of art on screen is not always of the best quality to convey aesthetic 

        experimentation. </p>

      <h1>Content</h1>

      <p class="normal">Regular visitors best appreciated the Tours of the <i>National 

        Art Gallery of Washington</i> and Les 100 chefs d’oeuvre of the <i>Museum 

        of Fine Arts of Bordeaux</i> (See Figure 3), because their art collections 

        are said to be very exhaustive in terms of number of paintings. These 

        museums are particularly relevant for developing a “visual memory,” 

        especially among neophytes of the arts. </p>

      <p align="center"><b class="MsoCaption"><img src="bernier.fig3.thumb.jpg" width="357" height="400" alt="The National Gallery of Art of Washington ©"/><br/>

      <p class="normal">Regular visitors have the impression that the Internet 

        involves specialized museum vocabulary whereas several occasional visitors 

        find the language too general (e.g., Themes), too narrow for their media 

        consonance (e.g., Education), or too unusual (e.g., Cabinet of Curiosity) 

        for the given information. We learn that users appreciate titles sorted 

        by captions, and whose terms are not hermetic.<i> </i>This criticism is 

        all the more true when curators offer a set of topics that are supposedly 

        known by the general public, but rather answer what the public ought to 

        learn.<i> </i>Regular visitors consequently expect a virtual museum that 

        focuses on “personalized features”, by questioning them either 

        on a technique or on current depiction movements. Their suggestion is 

        to offer a variety of glance proposals like What’s New? Pick of the 

        Month, even statements from contemporary painters rather than getting 

        the traditional perception of curators. </p>

      <p class="normal">The content proposed from the <i>Memorial of Caen</i> 

        on the World Wars is said to be simple and accessible to all audiences 

        (See Figure 4). Therefore, this web site seems to correspond to their 

        expectations, as<b> </b>users are looking for a “museography of viewpoints,” 

        by various social actors (e.g., scientists, children) to instigate the 

        visit, or which express actual positions on artists for national art galleries.</p>

      <p align="center"><b class="MsoCaption"><img src="bernier.fig4.thumb.jpg" width="387" height="400" alt="The Caen Memorial ©"/><br/>

      <p class="normal">Once again, virtual museums are said to exclusively aim 

        at museum professionals, that is, a painting’s presentation for unconditional<b> 

        </b>art lovers, especially the <i>Museum of Fine Arts of Bordeaux</i> 

        and the <i>Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York</i>. This comment is 

        more strongly pronounced for the <i>Jacques-Edouard Léger Art Foundation</i> 

        (See Figure 5) and the <i>Museum of Lausanne Antique</i>, as they did 

        not appeal to users. Both Swiss museum web sites harbor a tedious homepage 

        with drab scripts. On-line museums are more likely to serve the research 

        community with their database<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> [7] </a>. Thus, Siegel and Grigoryeva 

        (1999) underlined that database interfaces are often designed for academicians 

        and museum professionals, by offering content on artists, material, dimension, 

        catalogue number, etc.</p>

      <p align="center"><b><img src="bernier.fig5.thumb.jpg" width="400" height="259" alt="The Jacques-Edouard Berger World Art Foundation ©"/><br/>

        Berger World Art Foundation ©<br/>

        <a href="../http://www.bergerfoundation.ch/" target="_blank">http://www.bergerfoundation.ch</a></span></b></p>

      <p class="normal">As for the volume of information, within ten minutes of 

        surfing on a virtual museum, users get a good idea of the types of information, 

        whereas in terms of content retrieval, our users consulted around three 

        pages per topic on virtual museums. In the same vein, Norbotten (2000) 

        found that less than 50% of web users select one theme or more and look 

        at approximatively three pages per subject, knowing that most topics ranged 

        from two to eight pages.</p>

      <h1>Technological adds-on</h1>

      <p class="normal">Novices and occasional visitors have a preference for 

        specific software applications like a palliative for the visualization 

        of masterpieces (e.g., magnifying glass) as well as audio and video comments 

        about the life of an artist. Numerous occasional visitors criticize the 

        absence of audio and video comments for <i>Medieval Paintings in the South 

        of France</i> as well as the under-utilization of images for the <i>Canadian 

        Museum of Civilization</i> and the <i>Museum of Fine Arts of Bordeaux</i>. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">Assiduous surfers welcome sophisticated software such 

        as VRML and QTVR in order to “feed the collections,” as proposed 

        on some cultural web sites. Virtual Tours of the <i>Musée du Louvre</i> 

        is exemplary in that matter (See Figure 6).<i> </i>Considering the newest 

        developments (e.g., TOURBOT discussed by Barbieri and Paolini, 2001),<i> 

        </i>curators must take advantage of usability of IT by increasing the 

        participation of individuals within an interactive knowledge setting, 

        and consequently provide a contemplation of masterpieces <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

      <p align="center"><b><img src="bernier.fig6.new.jpg" width="446" height="404" alt="The Louvre: Painters of Louis XIV ©"/><br/>

        <a href="../http://www.louvre.fr/louvrea.htm" target="_blank">http://www.louvre.fr/louvrea.htm</a></span></b></p>

      <h1>Sociability</h1>

      <p class="normal">Several assiduous surfers who are regular visitors wish 

        that web museum designers create a “network of knowledge” for 

        informal exchanges, as for example, live discussions on specialized art 

        topics (e.g., IRC, newsgroups) with friends of the museum as well as with 

        foreign visitors that would set a sociability similar to the one found 

        in the physical institution. Other users argue that a greater access of 

        to museum staff through the Internet would augment their desire to learn 

        about the arts, as museum employees are too busy on the physical site. 

        Thus, they request that a virtual museum plays a “pole of reference,” 

        by suggesting links towards other web sites, with frequent updates, as 

        it is the case for the <i>Memorial of Caen</i>. Further analysis can be 

        done in this direction.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p class="normal">We have stressed that, when designing a virtual museum, 

        the know-how of virtual visitors must be carefully looked at, as it appears 

        that it is less the knowledge of the arts which is put into question than 

        the mapping of content on museum web sites.<b> </b></p>

      <p class="normal"><i>Museologically speaking</i>, the virtual museum should 

        fall into the four “learning styles” elaborated by Gunther (1990): 

        1) giving facts and details (e.g., index on artists), 2) supporting pragmatism 

        and skill-oriented exploration (e.g., higher-end technologies), 3) sharing 

        ideas (e.g., newsgroups), and 4) bringing about self-discoveries (e.g., 

        quizzes). Web designers should aim at giving content on the arts in a 

        more “user-friendly way,” that is, through new search associations 

        according to available captions which best correspond to the needs of 

        various audiences (museum professionals, art lovers, first-time visitors, 

        etc.). </p>
