      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">In recent years, the UK&#39;s Victoria and Albert Museum 

        has embarked upon various projects designed to improve access to information

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">To begin with, I have to confess that I was somewhat 

        concerned when I saw the title of this session. &#34;Thinking big&#34; 

        is not something that I would ordinarily admit to. However, I do plan 

        to talk about a range of initiatives undertaken in the Victoria and Albert 

        Museum, most of which are interconnected. Fortuitously, at least one of 

        them even has a Massachusetts connection. Although I work in a museum 

        environment, I should also explain that I am a librarian by background, 

        and the following remarks should be seen in that context. For those who 

        are unfamiliar with the V&amp;A, I should start by giving just a little 

        background about the Museum and its technical infrastructure.</p>

      <h1>Background</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Victoria and Albert Museum is the UK&#39;s national 

        museum of design and the decorative arts. It was established after the 

        Great Exhibition held in London in 1851, and for a time it was known as 

        the South Kensington Museum. The V&amp;A&#39;s ceramics, glass, textiles, 

        dress, silver, ironwork, jewelery, furniture, sculpture, paintings, prints 

        and photographs now span the cultures of Europe, North America, Asia and 

        North Africa, and date from ancient times to the present day. The Museum&#39;s 

        new British Galleries opened in November, 2001, and proved to be extremely 

        popular with visitors and critics alike. The Theatre Museum, in Covent 

        Garden, and the Bethnal Green Museum of Childhood are both branches of 

        the V&amp;A. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The National Art Library is a department of the Museum 

        – or, to be more precise, part of a department, following a recent 

        merger with the Prints, Drawing and Paintings Collection. As a major reference 

        library, its fundamental strengths reflect the interests of the V&amp;A 

        itself. <i>The Universal catalogue of books on art </i>(National Art Library 

        1870) signaled the Victorians&#39; desire to achieve comprehensive coverage 

        of the subject area, but this was never a realistic ambition. Nowadays 

        we seek to create virtual, rather than physical, catalogues of collections. 

        Nevertheless, the Library now holds around a million printed volumes on 

        a wide range of subjects relating to the fine and decorative arts, plus 

        many archives and manuscripts. Among other things, the V&amp;A’s 

        own institutional archives are a rich resource for study of the history 

        and influence of one of the world’s oldest decorative arts museums, 

        and of the broader history of art and design. The bulk of the V&amp;A 

        Archive comprises some 60,000 so-called ‘Registered Files’, 

        many of which record the acquisition, loan and disposal of objects, and 

        the planning of V&amp;A exhibitions, from 1864 to date.</p>

      <h1>Infrastructure</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Museum&#39;s Collections Information System (CIS) is 

        based upon the Musims software supplied by System Simulation Limited. 

        The CIS database now contains some 670,000 inventory records for the vast 

        majority of curatorial objects in the V&amp;A, plus fuller catalogue descriptions 

        for around 45,000 items. System Simulation also provide the software for 

        the Picture Library&#39;s Photo Catalogue, which contains more than 80,000 

        records, including some 50,000 digital images. The Museum maintains an 

        extensive intranet, and uses Oracle database software for various applications. 

        An On-line Museum project was initiated in 2000 with the intention of 

        maximizing the potential of the V&amp;A&#39;s cultural assets in the digital 

        world. The Museum&#39;s Web site (<a href="../http://www.vam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.vam.ac.uk</a>) 

        was subsequently re-launched in late 2001, to coincide with the opening 

        of the British Galleries. Separate pages are also maintained for the Theatre 

        Museum (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="../http://theatremuseum.vam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://theatremuseum.vam.ac.uk</a></span>) 

        and the Museum of Childhood (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="../http://www.museumofchildhood.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.museumofchildhood.org.uk</a></span>). 

        Although the various Web sites provide access to a wide range of images 

        of curatorial objects, the collections database itself is not yet available 

        on-line outside the V&amp;A. In the 1990s, however, the Museum was a partner 

        in the European-funded Electronic Library Image Service for Europe (ELISE) 

        project (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="../http://severn.dmu.ac.uk/elise/" target="_blank">http://severn.dmu.ac.uk/elise/</a></span>), 

        which sought to make a wide range of images from disparate sources available 

        on the Web via a distributed Z39.50 service (Dodds 1999). More recently, 

        some 5,000 records have also been contributed to SCRAN (<a href="../http://www.scran.ac.uk)/" target="_blank">http://www.scran.ac.uk)</a>, 

        the Cultural Resources Access Network. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The National Art Library&#39;s Web site (<a href="../http://www.nal.vam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.nal.vam.ac.uk</a>) 

        is currently maintained on a separate server, with links to other related 

        services such as the on-line catalogue. The NAL&#39;s existing library management 

        software, Dynix, is supplied by epixtech <i>(sic)</i> and is due to be 

        replaced by Horizon software later in 2002. At the beginning of the 1990s, 

        the NAL embarked upon a major project to transfer all its older catalogue 

        records to the Dynix system. With funding of £1 million from the UK&#39;s 

        Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), the work is now due to be completed by the 

        end of 2003. The catalogue is made available on the Web via a range of 

        different interfaces, including a JAVA-based application known as Webpac 

        (<a href="../http://catalogue.nal.vam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://catalogue.nal.vam.ac.uk</a>). 

        Like most North American libraries, the NAL uses the MARC21 standard for 

        cataloguing the books in its collections. Among other things, the Webpac 

        software allows the MARC21 catalogue records to incorporate Web links 

        to other electronic resources, including the much richer Encoded Archival 

        Description (EAD) records for archival material. The Library also maintains 

        a Z39.50 server, allowing users to search the catalogue using third-party 

        products and emerging standards such as Dublin Core. As part of the switch 

        to Horizon, we expect to install epixtech&#39;s i-PAC on-line catalogue software 

        later this year.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">MARC is a well-established standard for recording bibliographic 

        information, but it is rapidly being overtaken by newer methods of encoding 

        and retrieval. The Museum Archives section of the NAL, for example, already 

        uses XML and EAD to describe some of the archival material in its collections. 

        Most of the catalogues (or &#34;finding aids&#34;) for individual archives 

        are relatively small documents feasible to write directly into XML, using 

        the EAD DTD. The records can then be displayed as HTML on the Web. In 

        order to assist resource discovery, the EAD records are also being linked 

        to summary descriptions for each archive group. These &#34;group level 

        descriptions&#34; are held in MARC21 format and can thus be retrieved 

        via the Library’s on-line catalogue. We have created a number of 

        catalogues from scratch, using the authoring software XMetaL, and have 

        also had some existing catalogues keyed and marked-up. These we have converted 

        into navigable but static HTML pages, which, although they lack internal 

        search functionality, are accessed via indexed summary descriptions in 

        MARC in the library&#39;s on-line catalogue.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><a name="fig1"></a><a href="doddsfig1.html"><img src="doddsfig1.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="ncoded Archival Description record for an archive group" border="0"/></a><br/>

        Fig 1: Encoded Archival Description record for an archive group<br/>

        (<a href="doddsfig1.html">detailed image</a>)</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In order to achieve proper search functionality, our 

        catalogues of archival material will ultimately need to be handled by 

        an XML-aware application such as Oracle. One series of records in the 

        V&amp;A Archive, for example, consists of some 50,000 paper correspondence 

        files. The catalogue of this material has been created in a simple Filemaker 

        database, for subsequent transfer to an Oracle/XML/EAD environment. Alongside 

        this database we have also produced an electronic surrogate of a sequence 

        of original abstracts of correspondence, which describe some 300,000 letters 

        received between 1864 and 1914; from these we can not only produce contents 

        lists for the earlier correspondence files, but also to some extent reconstruct 

        parts of the archive which have been lost or destroyed. The surrogate, 

        now held in a simple text format, will also be imported into the Oracle/XML 

        environment, but the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) rather than EAD may 

        well prove to be the appropriate DTD for this data.</p>

      <h1>V&amp;A Publications and Exhibitions</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">As mentioned above, the Library is coming to the end 

        of a project to transfer all its older records to the computer system, 

        with funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Before we received this welcome 

        financial assistance from the HLF, we deliberately prioritized categories 

        of material that were of direct relevance to the Museum itself. Among 

        other things, we wanted to ensure that the V&amp;A&#39;s own historic and 

        contemporary publications were properly recorded and, of course, available 

        to future generations. However, it soon became clear that we also needed 

        to maintain information about any exhibitions or displays that might be 

        associated with them. Like many institutions, the V&amp;A&#39;s records were 

        far from satisfactory at the time, with information recorded in numerous 

        different places, if at all. The aims of the V&amp;A Publications and 

        Exhibitions project, therefore, were to:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Establish a master sequence of publications by, for, or about the 

          Museum and its branches</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Create on-line catalogue records for these publications</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Establish a parallel database of exhibitions and displays organized 

          by, for, or at the Museum</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Produce a printed bibliography and chronology, with appropriate name, 

          title, series and subject indexes</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Enable links to be maintained between the records for the publications 

          and exhibitions</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">However, the boundaries for such an exercise were far 

        from self-evident, and certain categories of material (and indeed events) 

        had to be excluded from the project. For example, many V&amp;A staff had 

        produced books and articles for a wide range of external publishers, without 

        the Museum&#39;s direct involvement. Whilst it would have been useful to include 

        these references in the project, the practical difficulties were ultimately 

        too great to contemplate. In any case, much of the information was accessible 

        via other sources such as the annual research reports published by the 

        V&amp;A. Instead, we decided to concentrate on identifying every title 

        published by, for, or on behalf of the Museum. For the list of exhibitions 

        and displays, we elected to include all events that at been held at the 

        Museum or its outstations, even if the V&amp;A itself was not the prime 

        organizer. Of course, this also meant that we were recording details that 

        were possibly also being recorded elsewhere – but more of this later.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">We systematically examined all the book collections 

        held throughout the Museum’s various sites, checking each title against 

        the growing database of known publications. We also checked numerous records 

        held in the V&amp;A Archives, plus other external sources such as the 

        British Library, the Public Record Office and the OCLC database. As a 

        result of this exercise, a near-comprehensive list of V&amp;A-related 

        publications is now available online.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><a name="fig2"></a><a href="doddsfig2.html"><img src="doddsfig2.jpg" width="400" height="221" border="0" alt="Webpac list of V&amp;A publications"/></a><br/>

        Fig 2: Webpac list of V&amp;A publications<br/>

        (<a href="doddsfig2.html">detailed image</a>)</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In order to arrive at anything like a definitive list 

        of exhibitions and smaller displays, we examined exhibition catalogues, 

        published reports, magazine listings, press releases and numerous documents 

        from the Museum&#39;s archives. The degree of evidence that exists is somewhat 

        variable, with the result that some records are much fuller than others. 

        In order to improve the accuracy of the often sketchy data, a draft list 

        of exhibitions was published on the Library&#39;s Web site, with various indexes. 

        The comments we received as a result helped to ensure that the information 

        was as accurate as we could make it, given the limitations of the records 

        that had survived. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Each exhibition entry includes some or all of the following 

        fields:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Exhibition reference number (e.g. VX.1961.003)</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Date opening / Date closing</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Duration</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Title</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Curator(s)</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Venue(s)</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Sponsor(s)</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Publication reference numbers (e.g. VA.1961.003)</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Notes </span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">As stated above, a prime objective of the project was 

        to create electronic records for the publications and exhibitions, and 

        to allow them to be linked to other related records. With this in mind, 

        each publication was allocated a unique identifier, incorporating the 

        year of publication and a simple running number. In parallel, each exhibition 

        was also assigned a similar identifier, so that the records for the publications 

        could refer to the associated exhibitions and vice versa. </p>

        Fig 3: Filemaker database of V&amp;A exhibitions<br/>

        (<a href="doddsfig3.html">detailed image</a>)</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Once we were confident that we had identified as many 

        publications and exhibitions as we could, the bibliographic data was downloaded 

        from the Library&#39;s computer system to a Word file that formed the basis 

        of the list of publications in the printed volume. The data was then amalgamated 

        with the Filemaker records for the exhibitions. In the end, the printed 

        publication (James, 1998) contained references to some 2,700 publications 

        and 1,500 exhibitions from 1852 to the 1990s. The book contains a number 

        of separate sequences - for monograph publications, periodical publications, 

        related publications, exhibitions and displays - and is arranged chronologically. 

        Extensive cross-references are provided, with name, title, series and 

        subject indexes. It also won a major award - the Library Association&#39;s 

        Besterman medal for an outstanding work of reference published in the 

        UK. </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="dodds.fig4.jpg" width="350" height="513"/><br/>

        Fig 4: The printed bibliography and exhibition chronology</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">At time of writing, the exhibitions database is still 

        held in a simple Filemaker format, and we are considering next steps. 

        We still need to enhance the basic records, and we also need to make fuller 

        exploitation of the possibilities for linking the data to related information. 

        In addition, we intend to migrate the data to a more appropriate longer-term 

        environment. One possibility would be to transfer the data to the Museum&#39;s 

        Collections Information System, which includes some relevant fields for 

        exhibition history, events and so on. Another is to hold the records in 

        the V&amp;A&#39;s fledgling Oracle data warehouse. Of course, the Museum also 

        produces virtual exhibitions nowadays, and there is a growing need to 

        maintain a comprehensive list of virtual and actual exhibitions on the 

        V&amp;A Web site. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">We are aware of a number of external initiatives that 

        might ultimately have some bearing on our future direction. For example, 

        for some time the Research Libraries Group&#39;s Art &amp; Architecture Steering 

        Committee has been considering the viability of establishing a Shared 

        Histories of Exhibitions Database (SHED) project. RLG already hosts a 

        database of records for auction house sale catalogues, known as SCIPIO, 

        and the RLG database also includes many records for exhibition catalogues. 

        Essentially, SHED would be a repository for exhibition-related information, 

        with appropriate links to associated physical and virtual publications. 

        In order to begin to assess the need for such a service, the Art &amp; 

        Architecture Group has started to explore current practices in a range 

        of institutions. A survey carried out in 2001 indicated that a substantial 

        number of museums are indeed maintaining information about their own exhibition 

        histories. As might be expected, respondents indicated that the data is 

        held in a variety of forms, and in varying levels of detail. Of the 33 

        responses felt to be relevant to the survey, 11 (33%) held the information 

        in a database, 6 (18%) in a word processor, and 2 (6%) in a library cataloguing 

        system. As well, 15 organizations (45%) made the information available 

        in-house, whilst 8 (24%) had published their data on the Web. Only 4 (12%) 

        had published on paper. For more information about the status of the proposed 

        project, see the Art &amp; Architecture Group&#39;s Web pages (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="../http://www.rlg.org/aag/" target="_blank">http://www.rlg.org/aag/</a></span>)</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Recent developments with SPECTRUM, the museum data 

        standard, may well be of some relevance too. We understand that a SPECTRUM 

        XML schema is currently being prepared, and this may ultimately prove 

        to be a suitable vehicle for sharing exhibition history data. For more 

        details, see the Web sites for CIMI <span class="MsoHyperlink">(<a href="../http://www.cimi.org/" target="_blank">http://www.cimi.org</a></span>)

      <h1>The Art Referees&#39; Reports</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In addition to documenting the V&amp;A&#39;s publications 

        and exhibitions, we are also attempting to improve access to information 

        about the institution&#39;s earliest acquisitions. In its formative years, 

        the V&amp;A&#39;s collections expanded rapidly as the Museum set out to acquire 

        the best examples of metalwork, furniture, textiles and all other forms 

        of decorative art from all periods. It also acquired fine art - paintings, 

        drawings, prints and sculpture - in order to tell a more complete history 

        of art and design. During the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, 

        the Museum employed a number of eminent scholars, connoisseurs and practitioners 

        to provide advice on potential purchases, and decisions about many of 

        the most significant early acquisitions are recorded in a series of papers 

        known as the Art Referees&#39; Reports, which cover the period from 1863-1886. 

        (Burton 1999). One of the most active collectors was J.C. Robinson, who 

        worked in the Museum from the 1850s to the early 1860s. As well as producing 

        an impressive range of publications, Robinson also traveled extensively, 

        acquiring a remarkable collection of works of art and design for the Museum 

        (Baker &amp; Richardson 1997). As he later recalled, he undertook “successive 

        yearly expeditions, of several months’ duration, in which innumerable 

        art auctions, dealers’ gatherings, old family collections, convents 

        and church treasuries, yielded up an infinity of treasures…” 

        (Robinson, 1897)</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Robinson Reports, plus the rest of the Art Referees&#39; 

        Reports, are held in the National Art Library&#39;s Special Collections. They 

        amount to around 50 boxes of papers in total, and are closely related 

        to complementary material held in the Museum Archive. Although the documents 

        have long been recognized to be of great historical significance for the 

        V&amp;A and for others with an interest in the history of collecting, 

        they had not been microfilmed or digitized. In any case, Robinson&#39;s characteristic 

        Nineteenth-century script was particularly difficult for a non-practised 

        eye to read, and digital images of the originals would have been of limited 

        use in isolation. In addition, hardly any of the information about early 

        acquisitions had been recorded in the Museum&#39;s Collections Information 

        System. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In 1999 an American academic, Professor Lee Fontanella, 

        offered to transcribe the full texts of the manuscripts for the V&amp;A. 

        At the time he may not have appreciated the full extent of the commitment 

        he was making, but we were immensely grateful for the opportunity to tackle 

        a project that might otherwise have languished indefinitely. The transcription 

        required expertise in three or more foreign languages, plus extensive 

        knowledge of art-historical terminology and some familiarity with paleography. 

        If the project were to succeed, it would also require a substantial element 

        of technical support. Fortunately, Professor Fontanella worked at Worcester 

        Polytechnic Institute, Massachusetts, which has an active policy of sending 

        its students out to undertake assignments in the community. Each year, 

        WPI students have the opportunity to create and complete projects through 

        the university&#39;s Global Perspective Program. Accordingly, three students 

        from the Institute undertook a placement in the V&amp;A in Spring 2000, 

        working specifically on the Robinson Reports. They began by investigating 

        the source documents and examining possible methods of capturing the data, 

        then moved on to help to specify the details of the proposed methodology. 

        Rather than create simple word-processed files, we preferred to retain 

        the full context of the original documents, whilst also anticipating retrieval 

        via specific characteristics. The intention was to integrate the data 

        with other related sources, including the NAL&#39;s online catalogue, the 

        Collections Information System, and the Museum&#39;s other archival records. 

      </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The approach we adopted is based upon the eXtensible 

        Markup Language (XML) and the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), which was 

        originally developed for transcribing literary texts. Although there were 

        many literary projects using TEI at the time, there appeared to be very 

        few art-historical projects using a similar approach. It was felt that 

        the use of XML would facilitate the subsequent indexing, formatting and 

        retrieval of the full text of Robinson&#39;s observations. An examination 

        of TEI suggested that it could be used with the addition of just a few 

        additional tags for art-historical or museological concepts. Rather than 

        create these arbitrarily, the requisite tags were taken from the Computer 

        Interchange of Museum Information (CIMI) set. Unlike TEI, the CIMI tags 

        had not been migrated from SGML to XML by the time the project started. 

        For more information about TEI, see the organization’s Web site (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="../http://www.tei-c.org/" target="_blank">http://www.tei-c.org</a></span>).</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Primarily because Professor Fontanella was already 

        familiar with the software, the students developed a WordPerfect 9 system 

        for creating the XML data. In an attempt to speed up the process, a series 

        of document templates were set up for specific types of material, such 

        as letters, lists of objects, minutes of meetings, or printed materials. 

        Names were entered as they appeared in the source documents, with the 

        facility to store a normalized version (i.e. Surname, Forename) to aid 

        subsequent retrieval. The discipline imposed by the TEI approach also 

        provided a ready-made way of recording specific features - different &#34;hands&#34;, 

        questionable readings of the text, commentary by the editor, etc.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Professor Fontanella started to transcribe the texts 

        in Summer 2000. For ease of handling, the first batch of files was then 

        migrated from WordPerfect to a dedicated XML editor, in our case Xmetal. 

        A student volunteer - also American, incidentally - subsequently added 

        additional tags (place-names, dates, V&amp;A inventory numbers, etc) to 

        the data. The following year, three more students from WPI undertook placements 

        at the Museum, developing proposals for making the texts available on-line 

        and integrating them into the Library’s services.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><a name="fig5"></a><a href="doddsfig5.html"><img src="doddsfig5.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="0" alt="Sample XML data for Robinson reports"/></a><br/>

        Fig 5: Sample XML data for Robinson reports <br/>

        (<a href="doddsfig5.html">detailed image</a>)</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">At time of writing, some 300 documents, or around 25% 

        of the total, have been transcribed and fully tagged. We are currently 

        developing XSLT style sheets to display the texts to their best advantage, 

        and considering various ways of providing indexes to the material. Although 

        the bulk of the work to date has been done by volunteers, we are also 

        seeking funding to help support the continuation of the project. In any 

        event, we expect to make the full texts of some or all of the Robinson 

        Reports available on the Web in the coming year or so. </p>

      <h1>Conclusions</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Many museums are no doubt grappling with issues similar 

        to those that the V&amp;A is seeking to address, and some are probably 

        more advanced than others in sorting out the relationships among the different 

        types of information. Although the V&amp;A has certainly made some progress 

        in gathering the necessary data, we are still some way away from packaging 

        it in a totally integrated form. The information about V&amp;A publications, 

        for example, is held in a standard MARC21 format, but this is likely to 

        be superseded by XML or some other generic receptacle for the data. We 

        hope to migrate the database of V&amp;A exhibitions in due course, and 

        expect to be able to make the records available in a recognized XML format. 

        In the case of the Robinson reports, we consciously adopted a somewhat 

        experimental approach, in the hope that the resulting XML data would prove 

        to be of lasting value. Whilst the scholarly transcription has inevitably 

        proved to be somewhat time-consuming and the full benefits have consequently 

        still to be realized, we remain confident that the methodology employed 

        is broadly appropriate to the task. We could perhaps have adopted a more 

        straightforward method of recording the information, but it might have 

        proved to be less useful in the longer term. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Of course, we expect that all the most significant 

        records relating to the V&amp;A&#39;s acquisitions, publications and exhibitions 

        will be stored on-line in future. As the NAL, the V&amp;A, and other libraries, 

        archives and museums accumulate marked-up texts in electronic format, 

        we look forward to being able to search the data in meaningful ways, to 

        share it with other institutions, and to add to it where appropriate.</p>
