      <h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>

      <p>Like lots of web sites, the one at Mystic Seaport has gone through stages 

        – on line brochure, medium for educational outreach, repository for 

        seldom referenced (but no less significant for that) materials, collections 

        access point, newsletter.  And, it has gone through the usual management 

        structures – the enthusiasts in the basement who would attempt to 

        do anything that anyone thought to ask for to the open contribution structure 

        where everyone could put what they wanted on the web.  And, like lots 

        of web sites that are now getting close to being ten years old, Mystic 

        Seaport’s had devolved into a chaos of good intentions, bad ideas 

        well executed, good ideas poorly executed, incomplete thoughts, old material, 

        structures that depended on particular software solutions and sophisticated 

        scripting and macros.  Nothing surprising, but nothing that was going 

        to cure itself either.</p>

      <p>At the millennium, the site had roughly 10,000 files on it – about 

        half of which were images.  The various pages represented the interests 

        of the roughly 100 passionate subgroups within the organization who saw 

        their materials as what should be easiest to find and most interesting 

        to all – the boat builders, the planetarium, the education department, 

        the communications department, the volunteers who put pictures of themselves 

        on the web,  the purpose statement for the museum and the list of trustees, 

        the calendar, links out to donors, funding agencies, other museums, the 

        indexes to journals now out of print, the chantey singers, the store, 

        the restaurant’s catering opportunities, the online catalogue, and 

        on and on.  These were organized loosely around the organization of the 

        museum – collections, education, administration, etc.  The site had 

        become a snake-pit, and following the example of Odysseus with Medusa, 

        it was decided that the way to get rid of it was to hold a mirror up to 

        it so that it could self-destruct.</p>

      <p>That decision was the easy part to contemplate.  The delete button is 

        a powerful tool, and it happened that the museum was in the situation 

        of changing servers and platforms, so there was the possibility of starting 

        with a clean slate.  The hard part was thinking about what to do next.  

        There were some basic requirements.  The site had to:</p>

      <ol start="1" type="1">

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">serve all of the current content 

          providers, but it had to have the means to grow<br/>

          <br/>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">self-maintaining – neither 

          the initial technarchy nor the subsequent anarchy had served<br/>

          <br/>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">interest  those of us who saw 

          it ten times a day as well as the one time visitor<br/>

          <br/>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">provide access to all</span></li>

      </ol>

      <p>We started with a vague idea of where we wanted to go, and we gathered 

        together the skills that we thought we would need – politic coordination, 

        some programming skills, some content skills, and a designer who was willing 

        to participate in the discovery process.  The importance of all four of 

        these elements coupled with a big scoop of imagination and willingness 

        to try things out cannot be underestimated.  Each has contributed to the 

        success of the project.  The steps were to assess and identify, plan and 

        design, establish conventions, realize tentatively, and finally reflect 

        on what happens next.</p>

      <h1>Assess and Identify</h1>

      <p>Initially, we did no more than to inventory our current website, try 

        to do some analysis, talk to staff members and interested parties about 

        what they were happy with, what they wanted more of, what worked, what 

        did not, and to look hard at things that we could do to make the whole 

        website work better.  This was not a terribly formal process, though it 

        involved making massive databases, thinking about links and maintenance 

        of links, finding natural collaborations among parts, and doing what we 

        could to put all of the content users at ease about the process and our 

        willingness to accommodate them.</p>

      <p>We discovered several things:</p>

      <ul type="disc">

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">There was little consistency in 

          the naming, placing, or formatting of digital elements.  Popular images 

          of the museum were stored multiple times in multiple places in multiple 

          resolutions.  Pages that had been maintained by staff members no longer 

          at the museum had often just been “papered over” as one might 

          do with wallpaper in the kitchen.  For the most part, these seemed to 

          disappear, though occasionally links to the old pages would surface.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Everyone’s area of interest 

          was the most important, and the world could be turned in such a way 

          as to realize that interest was probably the center of the universe.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Though we had lots of information 

          about who our audiences were through visitor surveys, marketing studies, 

          long range plans, mission statements, and the other paraphernalia of 

          running a museum, the website was organized not around our visitors 

          or their experience but around our museum’s organization chart.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">No one really had time to devote 

          to the website.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Everyone saw the website as the 

          answer to their prayers.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Everyone who used the website 

          relied heavily on the site search engine because over time, the site 

          became navigable only to those who were familiar with where things had 

          been tucked away.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p>From this experience, our belief in developing a more centrally managed 

        structure using databases, addressing the creative development of content, 

        and thinking about our audiences was supported.  We determined to organize 

        around the needs of our audiences and to simplify.  After all, the visitor 

        coming from Boston with a family would want to know about the Chowderfest 

        and did not probably need to look up anything in the on-line library catalog.  

        The researcher trying to find the history of a vessel in the Connecticut 

        Customs House database was probably not going to need to have easy access 

        to ordering a tote bag on line.  Our hope was that users would be able 

        to figure out who they were (and so navigate the site) much sooner than 

        they would infer our institutional organization and its relationship to 

        our current navigation.</p>

      <h1>Plan and Design</h1>

      <p>The next phase was to plan, but from the outset, we incorporated a designer 

        in our thinking.  This was more expensive than simply calling a designer 

        in at the end to put some decorative trim on our site, more time consuming, 

        and more fraught with peril, but it meant that our whole team moved forward 

        with a single view of where we were trying to get.  (For a brief commentary 

        on web design that was helpful in explaining to those unfamiliar with 

        the process what we wanted to do, go to <a href="../http://www.blackaby.com/web_design/" target="_blank">http://www.blackaby.com/web_design/</a>)</p>

      <p>We roughed out a structure based on who our visitors seemed to be that 

        was drawn from all of the studies, web usage, our own intuition, and consideration 

        of what an electronic visit even meant.   Among our important ideas in 

        this regard was that the physical visitor to a museum moves from visual 

        impressions to people who intervene to help with understanding to underlying 

        data structures (accessed in one way or another by either the visitor 

        or the person they are interacting with) that may be digital.  The virtual 

        visitor starts with the digital content, moves into an array of data, 

        and may venture beyond through people to experience.  This pattern – 

        from experience towards data or data towards experience – is as true 

        of the visitor encountering an object in an exhibit and reading the label 

        created by a curator based on catalogue data as it is of the selection 

        of an item in the museum store and the subsequent transaction with its 

        impact on inventory systems and finance.</p>

      <p>We took the overall structure we’d developed to the staff for their 

        comment and contribution in a series of public meetings.  This led to 

        some preliminary design ideas, and those too were taken to the staff in 

        a series of open meetings.  We did not invite the staff to comment on 

        the particulars of the design (though of course, they did) but rather 

        on whether or not the design fulfilled our basic functions – to let 

        visitors know where they were, who we were, how they would navigate, and 

        to provide interest.  By keeping these conversations open and the focus 

        on the <i>function</i> of the pages, we were able to avoid micromanaging 

        the designer for the most part but could still provide useful design related 

        input.</p>

      <p>Along with a set of design modifications, a rough site outline was put 

        up  internally on the web so that any changes in the overall structure 

        could be commented, so that people could see where their content was going 

        to appear, and so we could think about directions for future growth.  

        After looking a some very beautiful computer generated site plans (see 

        particularly the book by Paul Kahn and Krzysztof Lenk, <i>Mapping Websites. 

        </i>RotoVision, 2001), we settled for the reality of sticking 3x5 cards 

        to the wall to begin laying out the site as it currently existed so that 

        we could shift things around to where they were going to be.</p>

      <h1><b>Establish Conventions</b></h1>

      <p>The site as it existed was a well meaning hodgepodge that had hints of 

        conventions established or ignored, understood and applied, or misunderstood 

        and misapplied, or else not.  Some order was imposed through the use of 

        server generated templates, but file naming conventions, site structure, 

        page structure, the size and form of imagery reflected a broad understanding 

        of the digital world.</p>

      <p>A primary concern was digital imagery.  Internally, we had naming conventions 

        for physical photographs – whether of objects or of events, installations, 

        or documentation of the museum and its people.  Besides that, we have 

        more than a million physical photographic items in the collections which 

        all have their own identification systems normalized through the imposition 

        of catalogue numbers.  For digital materials, however, there was no such 

        consistent practice.  Sometimes a digital surrogate was given an identifier 

        related to its source.  Sometimes it participated in an array of ordered 

        identifiers imposed by media or process (such as the 100 images from a 

        Photo CD or the sequence in which pages of a book were digitized). Sometimes 

        the file names were descriptive and the file structures for the imagery 

        provided some kind of intellectual order (such as a series of newspaper 

        articles scanned and given names for the date and headline and then placed 

        in a file structure that had the names of the newspapers as the folder 

        names with all of those folders arranged in a general folder that identified 

        the subject of the whole array of material).  Sometimes thumbnails had 

        different names.  Sometimes thumbnails went in different directories.  

        And so on.  These were all interesting ideas, but together they were chaotic, 

        frequently repetitive with no easy way to identify repetition, and very 

        difficult to maintain.</p>

      <p>We established the following conventions for managing imagery:</p>

      <ol start="1" type="1">

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">If there was a unique identifier 

          (preferably one that was computer generated and sequential) for an image 

          that could take the form of a simple number, that was to be used as 

          the root of the image name.  Museum objects took this from the computer 

          generated id number (NOT the catalogue number which is neither constant 

          nor simple nor something that lends itself to multiple iterations in 

          the case of an object with many digital views that need to be stored).  

          Library objects took the computer generated “bib number” from 

          their MARC records.  Photographs taken by the staff of the grounds, 

          events, and so on, had the convention of using the year and a sequential 

          number through the year (1956-375 was the 375<sup>th</sup> image taken 

          in 1956).<br/>

          <br/>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">When such a unique identifier 

          could be discovered, then such imagery was to be named with that element 

          as its root with the addition of a letter if that was necessary to assure 

          unique values throughout the museum and any leading 0’s to make 

          names of consistent size.  So, for example, the root image name for 

          all museum objects is the letter m with the id number padded to six 

          places, as in m001234.<br/>

          <br/>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">All of these images were to be 

          stored in a directory array on a server that had as its internal arrangement 

          folders named for the first four characters of the file name.  Thus, 

          the image with the root m001234 would go in the folder names m001 along 

          with ones having roots like m001976 and m001333.<br/>

          <br/>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"> 

          <div align="left"><span class="normal">The highest quality digital surrogate 

            that was stored was named with its root plus a hyphen and the letter 

            q.  A “regular” sized image – one of more or less 600 

            pixels in its largest dimension – was named with the root plus 

            –r.  A “snapshot” – one of more or less 275 pixels 

            in its largest dimension was named root-s.  And, a thumbnail was named 

            root-t.</span></div>

        </li>

      </ol>

      <p>There were variations and complexity to account for multi-page works 

        or multiple views of a single object, but the result has been a system 

        that allows you to infer the path and file name for any standard sized 

        image by knowing no more than the root part.  A library object with the 

        bib number12785 would have as its thumbnail ../L012/L012785-t.jpg,</p>

      <p>For all of those images that could not be handled so neatly, or for those 

        images created casually for the web, the same –q, -r, -s, -t convention 

        obtains to describe size, but the imagery is simply stored (as it usually 

        was before) within the body of the website in directories called images 

        directly below the html pages they refer to.  This imagery is treated 

        entirely as being fugitive.</p>

      <p>More complicated was developing a kind of “grammar” for page 

        designs that was based on looking backwards at the materials that we had 

        up on the web and forwards towards what we imagined the design for run 

        of the mill pages to be.  This grammar established that we had a limited 

        set of building blocks that might be combined to make any of the pages 

        that we might want.  The basic units were a text blob, an image, a caption, 

        and a secondary text blob.  The basic formats were vertical, in which 

        case you could have those four elements (though one did not have to have 

        all of them) arranged in two columns, and horizontal, in which case the 

        four elements could be repeated with variations.  The purpose of developing 

        this grammar was to begin imagining how we might generate the web site 

        from a database if we wanted to.  We would at least have a common way 

        of saying, “No – that page is too complicated for us to bother 

        doing  -- it is not ‘grammatical.’” </p>

      <p>This grammar was developed along with basic grids for page layout that 

        were established by the designer that followed very traditional magazine 

        layout principles.  These allowed a kind of flexibility, but within bounds, 

        and so far our fears about enforcing a kind of uniformity that would make 

        the site dull have not been realized.  As the site grows, the grammar 

        may change a bit, but for the moment, having this structure has meant 

        that development and management during development have been extremely 

        rapid.</p>

      <h1><b>Realize Tentatively</b></h1>

      <p>From the point of getting the functional aspects of the design worked 

        out, the site arrangement worked out from the point of view of file naming 

        and organizing, and the basic grammar of the pages, work has proceeded 

        quickly down an increasingly (and happily) slippery slope.</p>

      <p>We did some valuable usability testing with nothing more complicated 

        than a paper mockup of buttons and Xeroxes of screen shots using some 

        of the museum’s volunteers and a few people off the street.  Our 

        goals in the exercise were simple – did the vocabulary we’d 

        selected express, could they figure out where they were and where they 

        wanted to be, was the technology of menus and rollovers beyond naïve users.  

        We made some slight adjustments as a result of this, but more importantly, 

        could proceed with a higher level of comfort.</p>

      <p>A working mockup of the site was developed for presentation to staff 

        and trustees to get feedback and thoughts.  This started largely as a 

        bare-bones effort with a fair amount of variation within the design parameters, 

        and few of the more complex databases represented in the structure, but 

        those have gradually been added in as we’ve had time to look at the 

        site and fine tune our practices.  Things like consistently skipping a 

        line after subtitles, establishing how back buttons are to work, dealing 

        with secondary windows that need to open have been addressed in this phase.</p>

      <p>The significant result of this aspect of the project, however, has been 

        to really move to the point of thinking about the underlying information 

        structure that maintains the site and the ways that we can take the naming 

        conventions, the grammar, and the structure of the site back to the sources 

        of the information that populates the site.  One challenge that we’ve 

        always faced with the site was that of managing to update it appropriately.  

        The site is too big to be data driven throughout (though there are certainly 

        many portions that are or can be.)  Some information only existed on the 

        website, some information on the website was repurposed from other museum 

        publication formats, some was extracted from other places.  There was 

        little uniformity, and little in the way of policy or consistent practice 

        that assured that content updated in one place would be updated elsewhere.  

        Out of this examination of our content, a preliminary information architecture 

        for the entire museum has been developed.  Of course, at this time, much 

        of it is tentative, but having an understanding of what that architecture 

        might be has been influential in shaping what we perceive to be our future 

        steps with the web site and the museum’s systems as a whole.</p>

      <h1><b>A Basic Architecture</b></h1>

      <p>Simplified greatly, the museum web site can be seen as related to six 

        basic kinds of information – collections, publications, the calendar, 

        products, information about people, and information about our offerings.  

        One might add information about resources to this mix, but the basic six 

        elements seem to serve to describe the site generally.  A museum lecture 

        and online registration form, for instance, is a combination of information 

        having to do with our offerings, information drawn from a calendar, and 

        information collected from the visitor to the site about themselves.  

      </p>

      <p>Realizing these basic building blocks make up the website has meant that 

        we can address the maintenance of the site not from the point of view 

        of simply keeping the website going – an effort that is difficult 

        and one that seems to lead inevitably to the kind of total revision that 

        the website has required every couple years.  If, instead of maintaining 

        the website, efforts are made to maintain the sources of the information 

        that go into the website that are a part of our normal business practices 

        (there does need to be some kind of calendar, there will be descriptions 

        of offerings, customer data has to be gathered somewhere, collections 

        data does exist), then the creation of an ongoing website has more to 

        do with figuring out how to extract data from those basic sources rather 

        than anything else.  Of course, some of these sources are easier to get 

        to than others, some of them already exist, some of them might easily 

        exist or be tweaked slightly, but some don’t exist an perhaps never 

        will.  Given that, the website can be made to be responsive to those aspects 

        of the organization that can be normalized in ways that invite extraction.  

        That at least simplifies the issues of maintenance.</p>

      <h1><b>What Next</b></h1>

      <p>At this writing, the website is about ready to go live for internal review.  

        This means that all of the pages that are to be in it will be there for 

        data owners to check.  It does not mean that all the tools for maintaining, 

        extracting, and so on are in place, and it may mean that more pages than 

        we like are “hand made” rather than being generated from data 

        structures.  But, the fact that we have a basic page grammar defined, 

        that we know where we might be extracting the data for those pages should 

        or could come from, and that we understand the goal is to create an institutional 

        information architecture that can support the web (and other activities, 

        as it turns out) means that we can begin to move towards a responsibly 

        organized site.  We expect to be live to the public within a few weeks, 

        and we feel comfortable knowing that by focusing our energies on the internal 

        information architecture of the museum and the tools necessary for maintaining 

        that we will also be creating the wherewithal for maintaining the website.</p>

      <p>The next phase of the project has more to do with looking out to the 

        museum to think about where we can work more sensibly and effectively 

        with cognizance of our information structure.  The web is the occasion 

        for this effort and perhaps the most obvious beneficiary, but the economies 

        of things as simple as having a standard way of managing digital imagery 

        or having a central calendar or course offering database will have significant 

        impact on all aspects of the museum.</p>
