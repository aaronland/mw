      <p class="PaperTitle">Think Globally, Act Locally: The Role of Real Teachers 

        in Community Science Issues</p>

      <p class="Author">Martin Bazley, Lyndsey Clark, Science Museum, UK, Barbara 

        Bottaro, Karen Elinich, The Franklin Institute Science Museum, USA </p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">Science Museums and Science Centers are increasingly 

        seeking more engaging, active ways of involving their audiences. The two 

        partner institutions in this project are working with teachers to get 

        students actively involved with real-world science and technology as preparation 

        for employment and citizenship, whilst building ongoing relationships 

        between the science museums, teachers and community organizations. Last 

        year, US and UK On-line Museum Educators (OMEs) worked with The Franklin 

        Institute Science Museum, Philadelphia and the Science Museum, London 

        to create &#39;Pieces of Science&#39;, a series of on line learning resources, 

        each inspired by a particular museum object. &#39;Pieces&#39; has been very well 

        received, inspiring the team to consider another ambitious project, aimed 

        at involving students, as well as their teachers. </p>

      <p class="AbstractText">In this second year of collaboration, the focus has 

        shifted to creating community and issues-based science projects designed 

        to engage students and their teachers in community service, issues-based 

        discussion, and interaction with practicing scientists. The legacy of 

        each project will be a Web site providing related classroom resources 

        alongside a record of the activities and a toolkit to support other teachers 

        in developing similar activities. This paper will focus on presenting 

        lessons learned and suggestions for anyone considering similar projects 

        in the near future, including issues such as how to engender constructive 

        on-line interaction, and what works and what does not in on-line collaboration 

        projects.</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">Keywords: Teachers, Collaboration, Community, Science, 

        Issues, Educators.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The On-line Museum Educators (OME) project is a partnership 

        between The Franklin Institute Science Museum, Philadelphia, and the Science 

        Museum, London. The project challenges educators to work with the museums, 

        to learn from each other, and to produce online resources. The selected 

        educators have all demonstrated creative use of the Web in teaching. The 

        project and its participants offer a testbed in which informal science 

        education ideas can be exercised. The project has developed and evolved 

        over the past four years with the focus shifting slightly each year. The 

        continually evolving focus keeps the project fresh and innovative and 

        affords the partner museums the opportunity to test new ideas and continually 

        learn from the educators. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Staff from the two museums are supporting the teachers 

        in the development of activities and models. As the teachers create their 

        educational resources, they document their process so that, by the end, 

        there will be a body of data from which staff can draw conclusions and 

        report findings. Likewise, while the teachers are creating resources, 

        they engage in conversation with their international colleagues, ultimately 

        broadening the scope of their thinking and providing an international 

        context for their educational resource creation. Based on the lessons 

        from last year, this process includes creating thematic groupings deliberately 

        mixing UK and US OMEs, and videoconferencing</p>

      <h2>Current Activity</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">This year, the aim is to capitalize on our international 

        collaboration by looking at global science issues while also highlighting 

        community and personal action. The project is primarily targeted towards 

        engaging older students (High School in the US and Secondary or Post-16 

        in the UK) in science through community service, issues-based discussion, 

        and interaction with practicing scientists. We also want to explore and 

        demonstrate how science centres can use the Web to broker a partnership 

        between schools and their communities to address local science-based issues. 

        Some content ideas, like ecology and water chemistry, lend themselves 

        to a strong community investigation/service focus. Others, like health 

        and genetics, lend themselves to a strong focus on debate and individual 

        decision-making. All address the growing international interest in community 

        service as an educational experience and the role of understanding scientific 

        issues in citizenship.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Although we are focusing on older students, the current 

        project participant group includes five teachers of younger students. 

        The chosen project complements current thinking in both the US and UK 

        of ensuring that school students are exposed to the social, ethical, and 

        moral dimensions of science and technology alongside the theoretical subject 

        matter. Rather than thinking of the OMEs and museum staff as a resource 

        production team and the teachers and students involved in the activities 

        as the end users, we are actively encouraging the OMEs this year to involve 

        their students as much as possible in all aspects of the work. OMEs give 

        museum staff an insight into the classroom that only an actively practicing 

        teacher can. By also involving the students, we can learn more about how 

        these ideas work in practice and be sure that all the work has essentially 

        had some form of formative evaluation by the OMEs’ own students.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">This year, a key idea under investigation is whether 

        or not similar local science investigations can motivate global thought, 

        communication and discussion.</p>

      <h2>Themes</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">We have worked with the OMEs to build three thematic 

        groups: health, energy, and water. Each thematic group is producing a 

        &#34;Community Science Action Guide&#34; - a guide for initiating active 

        science learning around real community issues represents a new contribution 

        to the on-line body of educational content resources. The “Community 

        Science Action Guide” is both an expression of real work and a &#34;toolkit&#34; 

        or &#34;work-pack&#34; to allow others to use or adapt the activities 

        for themselves. It may also prove a source of support and inspiration 

        for other teachers wishing to develop and run similar activities on another 

        topic or theme. There will also be comments on what worked well and what 

        didn’t, based on trialing of some activities and informed feedback 

        on others. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The “Community Science Action Guide” will 

        offer multiple portraits of the role that real teachers can play in community 

        science issues. The OME project participants are becoming role models 

        for other educators. These scenarios will have a lasting value for the 

        on-line educational community, even though the specific activity may have 

        a limited shelf-life. For example, one OME in Florida has challenged her 

        students to organize and implement a detailed water usage analysis in 

        the local hotels. Their community’s economy depends on tourism, and 

        large hotels have a definite impact on the water supply. By learning about 

        the water system, analyzing usage patterns, and making a report to the 

        hotel managers, the students will have embraced standards-based science 

        content in a practical, real-world context. The on-line guide will document 

        their investigation, demonstrating the steps that other educators could 

        follow with their own classes. Their teacher has brokered relationships 

        between them and a powerful community testbed: senior citizens.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="elinich.fig1.jpg" width="316" height="357"/><br/>

        Fig. 1: Young scientists in Ohio are learning about the science of aging</p>

      <h2>Roles of the On-Line Museum Educators</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">There are many measures of success for projects like 

        this. Ideally, the OME and her students will establish long-term involvement 

        with key community science stakeholders. For example, scientists and engineers 

        at the local water processing facility will begin to trust that she is 

        capable and reliable, inviting her to return for future projects with 

        other classes. Since the sixteen participants are conducting sixteen different 

        local science initiatives, we may quite likely observe sixteen different 

        roles. Certainly, we will see sixteen distinct portraits. However, the 

        different roles will most likely be categorical. Indeed, we are already 

        detecting patterns that suggest that the roles the OMEs play as local 

        science advocates are perhaps variations on just three profiles: activists, 

        brokers, and consultants.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In the example above, the OME is playing the role of 

        an activist. She and her students detected a latent issue and, by investigating 

        it, are bringing it to the forefront, calling public attention to it. 

        In the field they ask questions, make observations, and record data. Later, 

        in the classroom, they will compare and aggregate their collective data.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="elinich.fig2.jpg" width="387" height="356"/><br/>

        Fig. 2: The students act as field researchers</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Other OMEs are acting as brokers between their students 

        and local scientists or other interested parties. By “making introductions,” 

        they are brokering new relationships and bridging sub-groups within their 

        community. In this role, they are less narrowly focused on a single issue 

        and are more attentive to the relationships.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">By positioning their students as “local experts” 

        on a topic or issue, some OMEs are actually playing the role of consultants, 

        inviting multiple stakeholders to use the students and their research 

        for the greater good.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">These three profiles are preliminary categories and 

        may need to be refined as the project work progresses. They are based 

        upon early observations of role-playing and may change as the OMEs grow 

        more comfortable with their activity.</p>

      <h2>Preparing the Students</h2>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="elinich.fig3.jpg" width="275" height="294"/><br/>

         Fig. 3: Simulating aging: reading</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Before introducing the young research scientists to 

        the residents of a local senior center, the OME had her students visit 

        various “simulation centers” in the classroom for activities 

        that prepared them to think about the issues of aging. Here, a student 

        attempts to read letters while wearing glasses that have been smeared 

        to simulate a slight blurring of vision.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><br/>

        <img src="elinich.fig4.jpg" width="306" height="297"/><br/>

         Fig. 4: Simulating aging: loss of dexterity</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">At this “simulation center,” the students 

        wear rubber gloves to simulate decreased dexterity. They then attempt 

        to complete ordinary tasks like tying shoelaces.</p>

      <h2>Collaboration Spark</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The desire of The Franklin Institute and the Science 

        Museum, London, to work on this project together and to try to capitalize 

        on our international collaboration rose out of our experience of last 

        year&#39;s OME project &#39;Pieces of Science&#39;. While producing the Pieces Web 

        sites, the OMEs worked on their own individual products and interacted 

        with each other in an organic way, sometimes sharing technical experiences, 

        sometimes content ideas, other times experience of working with particular 

        age groups. We believe that these interactions added both to the experience 

        of the teachers working as OMEs and also to the extremely high standard 

        of the Web resources produced. One of last year&#39;s OMEs wrote in her online 

        journal:</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">I believe that we have produced some meaningful classroom 

        content. However, if we are to be pioneers I don&#39;t think we can ever sit 

        back and be content to stay in the same place. If the project should continue 

        for another year I would like to see us delve more into the concept of 

        collaboration...what worked in the past and what didn&#39;t...and build from 

        our observations.</p>

      <h2>Choosing Themes and Topics</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">As we moved the OME project on, we thought hard about 

        what type of work and science topics could be enriched the most by collaboration 

        between UK and US educators. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The idea and motivation to concentrate on how global 

        science issues can be understood and subsequently tackled in a local community 

        context had already been proposed, and we felt that any resource produced 

        by any individual educator could only be enhanced and enriched by the 

        experience of discussing the production process with others from as diverse 

        a range of local communities as possible. There is already great diversity 

        within both the US and UK groups as both groups are geographically spread 

        throughout their respective countries and in rural as well as urban areas. 

        However, sharing between two countries with completely different education 

        systems and, despite a common language, very different cultures would, 

        we hoped, broaden the minds and challenge the thinking of the educators 

        still further regarding tackling global science issues in their own backyard.</p>

      <h2>Structuring the OMEs</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">To further develop this broadening of thought, we decided 

        to be more formal with the nature of the collaboration between individual 

        OMEs than we were on &#39;Pieces of Science&#39;. We decided that on the Community 

        Science Action Guides, although all OMEs would be working on issues in 

        their own community, they should also be required to work with other OMEs 

        from across their own country and engage in conversation with their international 

        colleagues. To encourage the mixing of UK and US OMEs and to ensure that 

        each theme was considered for a whole range of ages of students, we created 

        thematic groupings directly from the outset. We worked flexibly to ensure 

        that all OMEs were able to choose their preferred topic but that each 

        group had at least one representative from each country and at least one 

        teacher of younger students. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">At this early stage it is not clear to us whether this 

        model will work as well as simply leaving the OMEs to form natural alliances, 

        as in last year&#39;s &#39;Pieces of Science&#39; project. However, just because it 

        is proving more difficult does not necessarily mean it will ultimately 

        prove to be either more or less rewarding. The results and final conclusions 

        can only be drawn after the resources are completed and the museums and 

        OMEs themselves have had time to reflect on the experience. We certainly 

        have evidence that at least one group has had a number of interesting 

        discussions about the differences between the education systems in the 

        US and UK and has debated the best way in which to reach the largest audience 

        with the technology available.</p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The ten US OMEs began the project by meeting at The 

        Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia in August, 2001. The 

        OMEs, Franklin staff and a representative of the Science Museum in London 

        spent a couple of days brainstorming ideas and sharing experiences, while 

        also spending time in the evenings getting to know each other. The weekend 

        mainly provided an opportunity for the group to meet and bond and form 

        working relationships that they could take with them into the online environment, 

        but also allowed us to explore the idea of community science issues and 

        to brainstorm topics as a group. It seemed from that meeting that the 

        resources the educators wanted to produce would fit into three broad thematic 

        groups; energy, water, and health.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Participants expressed opinions that the face-to-face 

        portion of the project was vital.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">The face-to-face meeting in August gave the US participants 

        a chance to come to an agreement on a topic and a plan of action. The 

        UK participants didn&#39;t have the chance to meet or discuss anything with 

        us. For me, having the chance to meet and come to an agreement initially 

        was invaluable. The give and take of brainstorming was best done face 

        to face.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">I think the initial face-to-face is probably crucial 

        to really good collaboration, but if that&#39;s not possible then structured 

        guidelines and lots of up-front structure planning by the institutions.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Due to differences in the school calendars in the UK 

        and US and also uncertainties over the funding of the UK chapter, it was 

        not possible to run the UK weekend at the same time. The UK gathering 

        did not in fact take place until late October: 11 weeks after the US gathering. 

        Although this situation was never deemed ideal, it may well prove to have 

        had more of a detrimental effect on the collaboration than we realized 

        at the time. It is clear from the comments above that the US OMEs placed 

        great store by the working groups they had established over the weekend 

        they spent in Philadelphia. Also, as the US OMEs slightly outnumbered 

        the UK OMEs, we were conscious from this stage that it might prove difficult 

        for the UK OMEs to join the groups that had already been established. 

        During the weekend in Philadelphia, we were in the difficult situation 

        of having to stress to the US OMEs that they should be open to the idea 

        of any number of new UK members joining their group ,and also to the chance 

        that perhaps none of the UK OMEs would join their particular group. This 

        left a great many unanswered questions hanging in the weeks between the 

        US and UK meetings. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">When funding was confirmed and UK teachers returned 

        from their summer break, the six UK OMEs had their gathering at the Science 

        Museum in London. They were given the three broad themes chosen by the 

        US OMEs to brainstorm around and came up with ideas of their own that 

        were distinct from the US ideas but also fitted into the three themes. 

        This resulted in our eventual current situation where we have three groups 

        working on the topics; each with different proportions of UK and 

        US OMEs. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The idea was for the &#39;thematic groups&#39; to communicate 

        online, discussing how they can construct resources that are both individual 

        and yet complementary. Each group has at least one teacher of younger 

        children, and the OMEs were keen that the resources for older students 

        should build upon those produced for younger children. Within each group 

        they wanted to produce individual resources for their own classes, but 

        overall, the aim is for three spiraling sets of resources covering each 

        topic area at beginner, intermediate, and advanced level. An on-line workplace 

        was set up on the Franklin&#39;s server, with links to an e-mail list and 

        pictures of each OME with e-mail address. Each thematic group was also 

        given a page for a group e-mail list for posting any important documents. 

        By spring term, only the water group had taken up the offer of an individual 

        e-mail list. However, there does not seem to be much correlation between 

        whether or not the group used an e-mail list and the feelings of the group 

        members as to how successful the collaboration is proving.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">For example, these three comments are from participants 

        in the Water group who did opt to use a group email list.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">The lack of active participation via e-mail within our 

        group is very frustrating for me. Without better communication I&#39;m afraid 

        that the projects won&#39;t fit together very well.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">Our communication since Philadelphia has been direct 

        and clear. We&#39;ve been communicating by e-mail off list for details and 

        on list for the broader plans. We&#39;ve had trouble with feedback from our 

        UK counterparts. I believe that is from the lack of early communication; 

        i.e. the face-to-face preplanning and ironing out of details.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">I&#39;ve been using this time to gather resources for the 

        project. Neither [another OME] nor I have e-mailed the group much. I feel 

        that at this stage we just need to develop our resources, based on the 

        broader picture of the group project, making sure we are not repeating 

        ourselves. I&#39;ve shared my project outline and read through the outlines 

        that have been posted by the others. I think the main collaboration will 

        come when we start to write the Web pages. For instance, making sure the 

        format is similar/same. I&#39;m getting the feeling that the collaboration 

        side of things is an issue? But, providing the final site can be used 

        in the UK and US, then we have a collaborative project. Though someone 

        will need to sift through the sites and make links from both the US and 

        UK national curriculum standards.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">These next two comments are from participants in the 

        energy and health groups who did not opt to use a group e-mail list.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">To be honest I haven&#39;t made much use of the email forum. 

        I expect that this will come into its own later on as people share ideas 

        while developing their work further.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">During the fall semester, the members of the energy 

        group collaborated a great deal to get a common focus. A general structure 

        was decided for future workflow and I had a good sense of what I was supposed 

        to create for the project. In terms of collaboration via e-mail, it is 

        often difficult to decipher what other group members are intending to 

        do in the future. After all, text-based descriptions of what will be created 

        are often much different than what is actually created as the final product. 

        I hope that as things move forward, our group will be able to upload more 

        graphics, animations and video. Working with the other group members has 

        made the energy topic much more interesting, because we can bounce ideas 

        off each other and talk about what actually works in the classroom.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The diversity of these comments suggests that the adoption 

        of an established e-mail list is not a factor in the degree of communication 

        that is occurring within the groups.</p>

      <h2>The Future</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">We intend to gather the participant groups again this 

        Spring for meetings at The Franklin Institute and the Science Museum, 

        London. We would like to schedule these meetings for the same weekend 

        and make use of videoconferencing to allow the groups to share their thoughts 

        and ideas. We may even be able to schedule videoconference slots for each 

        thematic group. We have only used the medium of videoconferencing between 

        the UK and US twice before;. The first occasion was during &#39;Pieces of 

        Science&#39;, when we allowed the UK and US groups to &#39;meet&#39; by videoconference 

        at their second workshop weekends. The large numbers involved on that 

        occasion meant the experience was little more than a fun experience, but 

        all enjoyed putting names to faces and finally seeing those they had been 

        corresponding with for months. The second time we used videoconferencing 

        was at the start of this year&#39;s project when due to unavoidable circumstances, 

        no member of US staff was able to attend the UK gathering. Instead we 

        had a brief videoconference with the US staff in order to make the concept 

        of US colleagues seem more real and also to allow the US staff to welcome 

        our new OMEs to the project. The UK OMEs certainly appreciated this chance 

        to put faces to names and are keen to make further use of the medium of 

        videoconferencing at our second workshop weekend.</p>

      <h2>Freedom or Structure?</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">From its inception, the OME program has resisted the 

        urge to impose behavioral guidelines, structures and rules. Indeed, the 

        urge has been strong! The participants themselves have sometimes expressed 

        a strong desire to be told exactly how to behave. Over the years, several 

        OMEs have left the program, frustrated by lack of prescriptions for their 

        behavior. However, the OME program is about observing when, where and 

        how communication happens organically. As informal science institutions, 

        we want to learn, by observing the OMEs, how teachers are naturally engaged. 

        The challenge becomes a balance between giving the participants enough 

        structure to be productive while still giving them freedom to be innovative 

        and instructive to our thinking. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Many of this year&#39;s OMEs, especially but not exclusively 

        the new members of the programme, probably feel this year that they are 

        spending more time second-guessing what it is the two institutions want 

        and expect from them. If we were to satisfy their hunger for explicit 

        behavioral expectations, then the programme would become less interesting. 

      </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">There seems to be a deep-seated feeling that the two 

        institutions have very definite ideas of how the OMEs should work and 

        what they should produce, and that we&#39;re just not telling them! In fact, 

        the truth is that we want the OMEs to show us how they prefer to work 

        and what they can produce when given free reign to express their creativity 

        and years of teaching experience.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">If we were interested entirely in the end product and 

        legacy of each year&#39;s OME project, then perhaps it would be incumbent 

        on us to brief the OMEs in such a way as to allow them freedom whilst 

        at the same time specifying closely what we want them to achieve. But 

        the nature of the project is such that we are not solely interested in 

        the end product. Although delivering quality Web resources to our audiences 

        is a consideration, as institutions we are involved in this project to 

        learn from the OMEs. If a particular group does not gel or collaborate 

        &#34;well&#34;, it is not an indication of failure of a particular year&#39;s 

        project. Indeed, just as in science, negative results are just as valid 

        and useful to the learning process as positive ones. </p>
