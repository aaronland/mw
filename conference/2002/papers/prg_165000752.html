Research indicates that active learning modes are most effective (Hein 1998). But at Museums &amp; the Web 2001, IBM researchers presented findings that leisure learners prefer passive entertainment experiences over more demanding interactive experiences (Karat, et al. 2001).

This paper reports on a web site evaluation project that seeks to clarify the different factors involved in successfully engaging leisure learners.



This study focuses on six educational Web activities, all developed by Educational Web Adventures (Eduweb) in collaboration with its clients. They represent a wide range of approaches to structuring Web-based educational activities and cover a broad spectrum of subject content, including art history, American history, and natural science. They include an encyclopedic/reference site, a simulation modeling a process, role-playing games, and creative play activities. All of the sites are aimed at a middle school or above audience.



The study uses quantitative and qualitative data from server log analysis and exit surveys of Web visitors. Duration of visit from the log analysis is a rough measure of holding power. The exit survey solicits quantitative feedback - demographics, personal preferences in Web activities, and evaluation of the Web activity in question - as well as qualitative feedback about the user&#39;s experience. We expect to correlate these responses and user evaluations of each project and draw some tentative conclusions about the appeal and effectiveness of various formats to different audiences for active learning on the Web.

      <p class="PaperTitle">How Do You Like To Learn?<br/>

        Comparing User Preferences and Visit Length of Educational Web Sites</p>

      <p class="Author">David T. Schaller and Steven Allison-Bunnell, Educational 

        Web Adventures, Minda Borun and Margaret B. Chambers, Museum Solutions, 

        USA</p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">Developing effective public education sites for the 

        Web requires an understanding of both learning theory and what appeals 

        to learners. A recent study commissioned by IBM found that Web learners 

        prefer passive entertainment experiences to more demanding interactive 

        experiences (Karat et al, 2001). If people learn best in active modes, 

        but prefer passive Web experiences, how can we develop sound educational 

        activities that attract and appeal to a broad audience?</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">This paper reports results of a study designed to 

        determine people’s preferences for different types of Web-based educational 

        activity. The primary research question was: How do people’s preferences 

        vary among types of Web-based learning activity? We identified six activity 

        types for comparison: Creative Play, Guided Tour, Interactive Reference, 

        Puzzle/Interactive Mystery, Role-playing Story, and Simulation. A team 

        of Web developers who work with museums and other learning sites collaborated 

        with a team of educational researchers who work primarily with museums 

        to conduct a survey of visitors to five different types of educational 

        Web site. Two kinds of data were collected: 1. User exit surveys, eliciting 

        an evaluation of the study site and preferred genre or type of learning 

        activity, and 2. Server statistics indicating the duration of stay.Results 

        indicate that there are clear differences in the type of Web-based learning 

        activity preferred by adults and children. Adults are more likely to select 

        Interactive Reference or Simulation whereas children prefer Creative Play 

        and Role-playing Stories. The adult sites yield more straightforward cognitive 

        information while the sites preferred by children allow more personal 

        choice and interaction. Apparently, adults bring an intrinsic motivation 

        to the learning experience. They know what they want to learn and they 

        want to learn it in the most direct way. Children, on the other hand, 

        need to be motivated. They respond positively to the opportunity for interaction 

        and choice within a goal-based environment that offers them an extrinsic 

        purpose.</p>

      <h1>Applying Learning Theory to Interactive Media</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In the past decade, the Web has grown from a text-only 

        tool of academia to a dazzling universe of ideas, community, commerce, 

        and vanity, with a corresponding increase in its multimedia capabilities. 

        How can the Web best be used for education? Applying learning theory to 

        an immature medium like the Web is challenging, but several basic criteria 

        for learning can safely be applied:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> “Education is not an affair 

          of ‘telling’ and being told, but an active construction process”(Dewey, 

          1923).</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> “Learners do not learn directly 

          from technology [or teachers, or books]; they learn from thinking about 

          what they are doing” (Jonassen, 1999).</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Learners must be motivated, which 

          requires an “emotional connection, challenge, and payoff” 

          (Healy, 1994).</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Somewhat more controversial is a key tenet of constructivism: 

        “A range of results are possible <i>and acceptable</i>” (Hein, 

        1998). This tolerance for divergent outcomes distinguishes constructivism 

        from discovery learning, in which “by engaging learners in activity...they 

        will arrive at the <i>correct conclusions</i>” (Hein, 1998). Constructivism 

        suggests that learning activities should allow multiple outcomes, each 

        of which need only “‘make sense’ within the constructed 

        reality of the learner” (Hein, 1998). (For additional analysis of 

        theories of learning applied to the Web, see Schaller and Allison-Bunnell, 

        2001)</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Beyond pedagogical approach, museums and other organizations 

        devoted to leisure learning must decide on the desired type of educational 

        experience. Gammon (2001) offers a useful typology:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <b>Cognitive:</b> Acquire and 

          assimilate new knowledge into existing schemas, apply existing knowledge, 

          connect concepts, draw analogies.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>Affective: </b>Challenge beliefs 

          and values, appreciate viewpoints in other people, inspire interest, 

          curiosity, awe and wonder, associate curiosity and thinking with enjoyable 

          experiences.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>Social:</b> Develop skills 

          of co-operation and communication.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <b>Developing skills</b> (mental 

          and physical): Prediction, deduction, problem-solving, investigation, 

          observation, measuring, classification, testing theories, making and 

          telling stories, decision-making, manual dexterity, craft skills, etc.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <b>Personal</b>: Increasing self-confidence 

          and self-efficacy; motivating to investigate further.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">With these issues in mind, how has the Web fared? The 

        Web is a form of interactive multimedia, or IMM. Some educational researchers 

        and practitioners praise IMM’s ability to use audio, video, text, 

        and immersive environments to appeal to multiple intelligences (Veenema 

        and Gardner, 1996). Others see in IMM the chance to move beyond passive 

        learning modes and engage students in more active learning experiences 

        (Prensky, 2001; Crawford, 1982; Viadero, 1996; Tipping and Graesser, 1996; 

        Bearman, 1997; Plowman, 1996b).</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">However, actual evaluation of IMM products has shown 

        that logistical problems often get in the way of fully realizing IMM’s 

        potential. Many novice learners have found the navigational choices offered 

        in IMM programs bewildering. In studies of classroom use of IMM, students 

        have needed considerable teacher assistance to make use of the programs. 

        (Veenema and Gardner, 1996; Plowman, 1996b; Bearman, 1997). The problem 

        lies in the very freedom afforded by IMM’s non-linear structure: 

        “Being a user-controlled medium, the learner expects to have control, 

        and yet a learner does not know enough to be given full control” 

        (Laurillard, 1996). Novice learners need more guidance and structure to 

        ensure that they find content that is both engaging and appropriate to 

        their knowledge level.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">While classroom teachers with sufficient time, skill, 

        and motivation can overcome these difficulties and provide the necessary 

        guidance to make use of the experience offered by IMM, this is not an 

        option for Web-based leisure learning experiences. Web sites must attract 

        an audience and create a self-contained experience that is satisfying 

        and hopefully educational. Thus we must account for what people want as 

        well as how they might learn.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">A recent study conducted by IBM suggests that, given 

        a choice, leisure learners seek relief from bewildering interactive software. 

        This formative research revealed that:</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">“most participants did not express interest in 

        Web sites that involved active interaction with the content or other people.” 

        They strongly preferred being “guided through an experience or discovery 

        process” <br/>

        <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Karat et. al, 2001)</span>. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Some participants in the IBM study “viewed the 

        more interactive design concepts and existing Web sites as work, not entertainment” 

        (Karat et. al, 2001). Indeed, the learning modes that IBM researchers 

        offered participants were either quite passive (Guided Tour) or quite 

        active (a searchable database of images and information, a chat room, 

        and an online journal). The latter may engage the devotee or a student 

        doing a research report, but can easily overwhelm those who lack an existing 

        interest in the subject and the intrinsic motivation to explore it.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Based on the results of their study, IBM developed 

        a site featuring on-line tours, hosted by curators and other experts, 

        and delivered via streaming video—essentially a TV-like experience 

        with links to additional information. Summative evaluation of the site 

        found that “users interacted relatively infrequently with the [on-line] 

        tours, and the less they interacted, the more they reported feeling engaged 

        and entertained by the experience” (Karat et. al, 2001). These results 

        are disconcerting in that they contradict accepted learning theories that 

        support the value of active involvement (Dewey, 1916).</p>

      <h1>A Research Study of Web Users Preferences</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">If people learn best in active modes but prefer passive 

        Web experiences, how can we develop sound educational Web activities that 

        attract and appeal to a broad audience? We decided to develop a detailed 

        and focused pilot study of user preferences to shed more light on this 

        complex and important issue. The primary research question was: How do 

        people’s preferences vary among types of Web-based learning activity? 

      </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">We identified six activity types based on our previous 

        Web development experience and a review of the literature (Gogg and Mott, 

        1993; Karat et al, 2001; Plowman, 1996b; Sumption, 2001). The six types, 

        as described in the survey instrument, were:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>Creative Play.</b> Draw a picture, 

          write a story, make a movie, etc. Create something original based on 

          the things you learn along the way.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>Guided Tour.</b> Join an expert 

          to explore a topic that he or she knows and loves. The guide leads you 

          on their path through the topic.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>Interactive Reference. </b>Explore 

          a topic on your own, through informative words and pictures. Choose

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Referring back to Gammon’s typology of learning, 

        Interactive Reference and Guided Tour lend themselves primarily to cognitive 

        learning. Creative Play, Puzzle/Mystery, Role-playing Story, and Simulation 

        support both affective learning and developing skills.  Creative Play 

        will help learners with skills such as storytelling and art making.  Puzzle/Mystery 

        and Simulations with prediction, deduction, and other problem-solving 

        skills. Role-playing Stories can challenge beliefs and values and help 

        learners appreciate other people’s points of view.</p>

      <h1>Methodology </h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In November-December 2001, we conducted a series of 

        pilot studies with visitors to one site in order to test various versions 

        of the exit questionnaire. The challenge was to describe the types of 

        learning activity in such a way that preference for type of learning activity 

        was not confounded by preference for the subject matter of the particular 

        site or its visual appearance. We tried and eliminated screenshots of 

        sample sites, since respondents were found to cue to content and aesthetics 

        more than the general activity type. Long Likert scales (5- and 7- point) 

        seemed to confuse respondents, who often indicated contradictory preferences 

        over a series of questions. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Once we finalized the twelve-question survey, five 

        activity sites previously developed by Educational Web Adventures, alone 

        or in collaboration with its clients, were selected for this initial study 

        to represent five of the six types of Web learning activity. No site exemplifying 

        the Guided Tour was represented in the Eduweb portfolio. However, it remained 

        in the list of types about which visitors were queried. The exit questionnaire 

        (Appendix A) was placed on each of five educational Web sites.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In addition to the exit survey, server statistics were 

        used to determine the duration of stay. Summary, a log analyzer (<a href="../http://www.summary.net/" target="_blank">www.summary.net</a>), 

        generated duration charts that give a clear picture of how long users 

        spend at each site.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">A pop-up window displayed the survey on each activity 

        site; it appeared when visitors came to the initial page, and remained 

        behind the main browser window until the visitor clicked to leave the 

        site. Then the survey returned to the foreground. The surveys were posted 

        on the activity sites for 10-20 days, until 50 responses from each site 

        were collected. Table 1 outlines the sites, types of activity, and sample 

        size.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">A control group consisting of 299 visitors to the Educational 

        Web Adventures Web site filled out the first part of the questionnaire, 

        which dealt with learning in general and did not reference a particular 

        activity. Members of the control group did not engage in any of the Web 

        activities selected for the exit survey. The purpose of the control group 

        was to provide a measure of user preferences independent of a specific 

        learning activity for comparison to questionnaires filled out at the activity 

        sites.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="schaller.table1.jpg" width="440" height="239"/><br/>

        Table 1. Experimental Design</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In the following discussion, Control group results 

        are compared to the Treatment population. The Treatment group consists 

        of visitors to the five different Activity Sites. It is important to note 

        that Treatment and Control are not used in the conventional way. We are 

        not looking for post-treatment learning effects. Rather, we are comparing 

        the preferences of users who have and have not experienced a particular 

        Web activity. The purpose of the comparison is to be certain that observed 

        user preferences are not <i>solely </i>a function of the activity in which 

        they have just engaged.</p>

      <h1>Results</h1>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="schaller.table2.jpg" width="230" height="167"/><br/>

        Table 2. Demographic Characteristics of Treatment/Control</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Activity sites had significantly more children 

        than the Control site (<i>X</i><sup>2</sup> p = .0001). An unexpectedly 

        large number of adult females visited the control site. </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="schaller.table3.jpg" width="441" height="171"/><br/>

        Table 3. Demographic Characteristics of Visitors by Site</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The most important differences (<i>X</i><sup>2</sup> 

        p = &lt;.0001) are the large percent of adult females at both the Control 

        and the Interactive Reference sites and the large percent of children 

        at the Simulation site. Also the number of adult males at the Role-playing 

        site was greater than expected, as was the number of girls at the Puzzle 

        site.</p>

      <p align="center"><br clear="all"/>

        <span class="MsoCaption"><img src="schaller.table4.jpg" width="233" height="197"/><br/>

        Table 4. Favorite Type of Computer Learning Activity</span></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Activity sites differ significantly from the Control 

        site (<i>X</i><sup>2</sup>, p = .03). The respondents from Activity sites 

        chose Creative Play and Interactive Reference more than expected. The 

        Control site chose Puzzle/Mystery and Simulation more than expected. As 

        will be seen below, the differences are probably due to the unexpectedly 

        high percentage of adult females at the Control site and a significantly 

        higher percentage of children at the Activity sites. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">We see immediately that, contrary to the findings of 

        the IBM study, Guided Tour was <i>the least preferred</i> type of Web 

        activity for both the Treatment (Activity) and Control sites. The reasons 

        for the difference between this and the IBM study are due to differences 

        in both sample and methodology. IBM used adult subjects, ages 21-55. The 

        subjects, employees and interns at an IBM research facility, were recruited 

        to evaluate selected Web sites. IBM’s sample sites dealt with the 

        subject of music. In the study described here, children are a significant 

        segment of the population, the user group at each site is voluntary and 

        self-selected, and subject matter varies from site to site.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">With the exception of the low scores for Guided Tour, 

        the other types of learning activity seem to be about equal in user preference 

        at the Control site. However, significant differences emerge when the 

        user group is subdivided by generation and gender.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="schaller.table5.jpg" width="527" height="195"/><br/>

        Table 5. Favorite Learning Activity by Age and Gender: Control Site</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">There are a number of differences between generations 

        (<i>X</i><sup>2</sup> p = .0001). Adults preferred Interactive Reference 

        and Simulation and children preferred Creative Play and Role-playing. 

      </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Gender differences between adults were not significant. 

        However, differences between boys and girls were significant (<i>X</i><sup>2</sup> 

        p = .01). Boys showed a preference for Creative Play whereas girls favored 

        Role-playing Story and Puzzle/Mystery.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="schaller.table6.jpg" width="533" height="201"/><br/>

        Table 6. Favorite Learning Activity by Age and Gender: Activity Sites</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Differences in program type preferences at the Activity 

        sites are similar to those found at the Control site. Again there are 

        significant differences between generations (<i>X</i><sup>2</sup> p = 

        &lt;.0001). As at the Control site, adults prefer Interactive Reference 

        and children prefer Creative Play and Role-playing. At the Activity sites, 

        gender differences were not statistically significant.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="schaller.table7.jpg" width="440" height="211"/><br/>

        Table 7. Favorite Learning Activity by Respondent’s Site</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">There are significant differences in program type preferences 

        among the Activity sites (<i>X</i><sup>2</sup> p = &lt;.0001). As mentioned 

        above, with the exception of a lack of interest in Guided Tour, respondents 

        at the Control site were almost evenly divided in their preference for 

        program type. The Activity site respondents, on the other hand, tended 

        to prefer the type of program they were using. This is notably the case 

        with Creative Play, Interactive Reference and Role-playing Story. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">It is important to remember that the Control site data 

        was collected as a check on the tendency of Activity site users to prefer 

        the type of program they are using. However, the similarity in preferences 

        between Control and Activity sites (when subdivided by generation and 

        gender) suggests that there are patterns in preferences that transcend 

        the particular site.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="schaller.table8.jpg" width="235" height="195"/><br/>

        Table 8. Location of Respondents </p>

        Grandparent’s house (1), No answer (9). Numbers in parentheses () 

        indicate number of responses.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">There were no significant differences between the Activity 

        sites and the Control site in terms of where the respondents were when 

        using the computer. Home and School were the most frequent location for 

        both Activity and Control.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The remainder of the questionnaire dealt with users’ 

        responses to the Web activity in which they had engaged; consequently, 

        these questions were not asked at the Control site. The tables below show 

        results from the five Activity sites.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="schaller.table9.jpg" width="445" height="189"/><br/>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The differences are significant (<i>X</i><sup>2</sup>

      </ul>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Teacher assignments are responsible for a high percentage 

        of Creative Play and Simulation usage (<i>X</i><sup>2</sup> p = &lt; .0001). 

        This corresponds with Table 9 that shows that these activity sites are 

        most often used from school. Personal interest was unexpectedly high for 

        Role-playing and the Interactive Reference site was most often accessed 

        to use in a lesson.<br clear="all"/>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Most people reported that their interest in the subject

        Results were not significantly different from site to site. </p>

        no answer (3).</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">*  Puzzle/Mystery: couldn’t find answer (1), done

      <p class="MsoBodyText">*  Role-playing Story: slow (1), not what I was looking 

        for (1) finishing school work (1).</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">*  Simulation: no answer (6).</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The differences here are significant (<i>X</i><sup>2</sup> 

        p = .007). More respondents than expected left the Simulation site because 

        they were confused. Respondents tended to finish the Role-playing Story 

        more often than expected and respondents left the Interactive Reference 

        site for “other” reasons. The reasons were likely to be that 

        the information sought was found or not found. Actually “found what 

        was wanted” might also be interpreted as “finished”, which 

        if coded that way would increase the percent in Interactive Reference 

        who felt they had “finished it”.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The two sites with the highest percentage of users 

        who “finished” the experience are Creative Play and Role-playing 

        story. These are also the sites that are most preferred by children. Perhaps 

        the goal-based structure with a clear ending is part of the appeal of 

        the two sites.</p>

        Table 14. How does this Activity Compare to Others of Its Type?</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Most people felt that the Activity site was as good 

        or better than other similar sites. There were no significant differences 

        from site to site in users’ comparison of the quality of the site.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Additional data was gathered in the form of server 

        logs, which were analyzed for duration information</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="schaller.table15.jpg" width="453" height="198"/><br/>

        Table 15. Time at Site</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">We made a crude measure of the “Ideal Time” 

        it takes a person to go through the activity by timing an adult clicking 

        on and reading all the available content. We electronically collected 

        actual time spent at the site. The mean is given first for the whole group 

        and then minus the outliers, excluding those who left immediately (presumably 

        because the site did not offer what they were looking for or did not have 

        the required technology) and those who stayed more than an hour (possibly 

        because they left their browser on the site after finishing the activity). 

        <i></i></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">A comparison of mean time to Ideal Time shows that 

        unusually long times were spent at the Role-playing Story and Simulation. 

        However, many children were engaged in the Simulation Activity because 

        their teacher assigned it to them (see Table 11); they were required to 

        complete the Simulation and submit journal entries with their conclusions.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Apart from the Role-playing Story and Simulation, the 

        mean times are very similar, indicating that these activity types have 

        comparable holding power. The duration charts that follow reveal in more 

        detail the differences in holding power of the various activity types.

        Table 16: Duration of Visit<br/>

        (<a href="schallertable1.html">detailed image</a>)</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">At most sites, with the exception of Creative Play 

        and Simulation, a sizeable number of visitors leave within the first seven 

        seconds. The explanation for this finding may lie in the specifics of 

        the individual sites rather than in their Activity type.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Marine Ecosystems Simulation was assigned as schoolwork 

        for three-quarters of the users of the site. The Creative Play activity 

        starts with a series of animations that may hook visitors more effectively 

        than the text introductions to the Interactive Reference and Puzzle/Mystery 

        sites. The Role-playing site begins with a splash/Flash plug-in detection 

        page that turns away a sizeable percentage of visitors apparently due 

        to the wait involved, rather than lack of the Flash plug-in (only 16% 

        of visitors did not have the plug-in).</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The remainder of each chart is more revealing. Interactive 

        Reference shows a bell curve. The other sites have skewed distributions, 

        indicating greater holding power, after the initial drop-off. Most striking 

        is the curve for Role-playing Story. Half of the visitors who got past 

        the splash page (and 25% of all visitors) stayed for at least fifteen 

        minutes, approaching and even surpassing the ideal time (19 minutes) for 

        that site. The curves for Creative Play and Puzzle/Mystery are less dramatic, 

        but suggest a similar pattern.</p>

      <h1>Conclusions</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Comparisons of users’ responses to an exit questionnaire 

        posted on five Web-based learning activity sites and at a control site 

        answer some fundamental questions about users preferences for different 

        types of Web-based learning. An earlier study of this subject conducted 

        by IBM found that adult users prefer Guided Tours or non-interactive Web 

        experiences. In the current study, using self-selected subjects and including 

        a large proportion of children, Guided Tour was the <i>least preferred</i> 

        type of Web activity for both the Treatment (Activity) and Control sites. 

      </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">With the exception of the low scores for Guided Tour, 

        the other types of learning activity seem, at first, to be about equal 

        in user preference at the Control site. However, when the user group is 

        subdivided by generation and gender, significant differences emerge having 

        to do with the user’s age, location and purpose for engaging in the 

        activity.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">There are significant age differences in preferences. 

        At both the Activity and Control sites, adults prefer Interactive Reference 

        while children prefer Creative Play and Role-playing Stories. Adult females 

        are over-represented at the Control site. Judging by the Activity sites, 

        many of these adult females may be teachers who use Web sites for their 

        lessons. The Creative Play and Simulation sites used here are often school 

        activities and are usually assigned to the children by a teacher. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Activity site respondents tended to prefer the type 

        of program they were using. The Control site data was collected to counter 

        this tendency. The similarity in preferences between Control and Activity 

        sites (apart from differences in demographic composition) suggests that 

        the observed preference patterns transcend particular sites.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Most people reported that their interest in the subject 

        matter had stayed the same or increased after the Web-based learning activity. 

        Also, most users felt that the Activity site was as good as or better 

        than other similar sites. This suggests that production values did not 

        heavily influence preference for activity type.</p>

      <h1>Implications of the Web Learning Preference Study</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">There are clear differences in the type of Web-based 

        learning activity that adults prefer in comparison to children. Adults 

        prefer the information-based activities of Interactive Reference and Simulation, 

        whereas children, not surprisingly, are more inclined to prefer the exploratory 

        experiences of Role-playing Story and Creative Play.  The adult sites 

        yield more straight-forward cognitive information while the sites preferred 

        by children have strong affective components and allow more personal choice 

        and interaction, but can lead to “dead ends” or less utilitarian 

        solutions. Apparently, adults bring an intrinsic motivation to the learning 

        experience. They know what they want to learn and they want to learn it 

        in the most direct way. Children, on the other hand, need to be motivated. 

        They respond positively to the opportunity for interaction and choice 

        within a goal-based environment that offers them an extrinsic purpose. 

      </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Goal-based environments are advocated by Roger Shank, 

        director of the Institute for the Learning Sciences at Northwestern University. 

        He describes them as “Goal-Based Scenarios” (GBS)—structured 

        learning programs that can be successful in both physical and virtual 

        environments. The goals in these scenarios are not arbitrary extrinsic 

        motivations, such as a good test score, prize, or reward. Rather, they 

        stem from the activity itself—solve a crime, reach a destination, 

        create an original artwork—which reinforces the cognitive goals of 

        the activity. Thus, GBSs “provide motivation, a sense of accomplishment, 

        a support system, and a focus on skills rather than facts” (Schank, 

        1992). In this way, they meet the basic criteria for learning of Dewey, 

        Jonassen, and Healy cited above. They create an environment for doing 

        and thinking, and provide both a challenge and a payoff. If designed properly, 

        they can also connect with pre-existing knowledge and help forge an emotional 

        connection with the subject matter.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Of the six types of Web-based learning activities explored 

        here, two (Puzzle/Mystery and Role-playing Story) are naturally suited 

        to the GBS approach; they inherently provide a motivation to reach a solution. 

        Creative Play and Simulation, on the other hand, may or may not establish 

        a clear goal. If designed as a GBS, each of these four activity types 

        offers a goal or challenge, a payoff, structure and guidance, and some 

        degree of interactivity. Young or novice learners who are unfamiliar with 

        a particular learning domain need such guidance and structure to attract 

        and hold their attention. It is interesting to note that in the Creative 

        Play, Role-playing Story and Puzzle/Mystery activities, a plurality of 

        users indicated they knew “little” about the subject to begin 

        with (Table 10). </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In contrast, Guided Tour and Interactive Reference 

        are not goal-based scenarios. There is no payoff or achievement for completing 

        the activity; learners must bring their own intrinsic motivation to the 

        task. Users of these Web sites may have more expertise in the subject 

        as well. On the Interactive Reference site, more people than expected 

        indicated they knew “lots” about the subject (Table 10). </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Within the structure and guidance provided by GBSs, 

        young learners prefer some degree of freedom. Creative Play and Role-playing 

        Stories, both preferred by children, offer a series of choices in the 

        path of the activity and some control over the outcome. Puzzle/Mystery, 

        which was less favored, and Guided Tour, the least popular type, offer 

        only one outcome and less opportunity for personal involvement. <i></i></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">This brings us to another important dimension: whether 

        the outcome is determined (created by the site developers) or user-created. 

        Different pedagogies underlie the two types of outcome. Discovery learning 

        lends itself to puzzles and mysteries, with their single correct solution 

        (determined), while constructivism supports user-created outcomes that 

        allow more personal choice and involvement. Most of the activities rely 

        on determined outcomes, but Creative Play, and to a lesser extent Simulation, 

        permit learners to create their own outcomes, be it a picture, a story, 

        or a unique configuration of the variables in the simulation. </p>

      <h1>Putting the Results into Practice</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">First, developers of educational Web activities must 

        decide whether their primary audience is adults or children, since the 

        two groups have different learning preferences. Adults prefer reference 

        sites. Children prefer goal-based scenarios, particularly Creative Play 

        and Role-playing Stories. These activity types offer an appealing middle 

        ground between the highly structured and constrained Guided Tour approach, 

        and the “explore according to your own interests” reference 

        format typical of much interactive multimedia. If a site must appeal to 

        both children and adults, developers should consider a dual approach, 

        combining reference and play (as in Leonardo’s Workshop and Study 

        Art).</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Second, developers must decide on a pedagogical approach. 

        Guided Tour and Interactive Reference sites typically provide a traditional 

        expository/didactic approach to learning. Puzzle/Mystery activities reflect 

        a discovery learning orientation, in which a single correct solution or 

        conclusion is the goal. Creative Play takes a constructivist approach, 

        encouraging open-ended experience. Simulations and Role-playing Stories 

        can take a variety of forms, from discovery to constructivism. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Developers should also consider their audience’s 

        expertise in the subject. Expert learners with existing interest in the 

        domain are more likely to favor interactive reference sites. Novice learners, 

        regardless of age, are more likely to need and prefer a guided experience 

        to introduce them to the subject and motivate them to learn more about 

        it. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The audience’s degree of expertise also affects 

        the learning goals of a Web activity. For novices, affective learning 

        experiences can inspire interest and curiosity in a subject, while skill-building 

        activities help them to develop the ability to pursue further understanding. 

        For experts who already have the knowledge base and skills to tackle the 

        subject, interactive reference sites can provide a satisfying cognitive 

        learning experience. For novices, goal-based scenarios can combine affective 

        and skill building learning experiences with cognitive learning.<i></i></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Of course, just because a Web activity attracts and 

        holds users’ interest doesn’t mean it is achieving its educational 

        goals. Evaluating learning outcomes is no easy task, and a matter for 

        another study. However, a Web activity or any other learning activity 

        must first attract and hold the interest of learners in order to have 

        the opportunity to achieve its learning objectives. </p>
