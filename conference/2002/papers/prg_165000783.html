      <p class="PaperTitle">The Electronic Guidebook: Using Portable Devices and 

        a Wireless Web-based Network to Extend the Museum Experience</p>

      <p class="Author">Robert Semper, Exploratorium, and Mirjana Spasojevic, Hewlett-Packard 

        Labs, USA</p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">Recent advances in wireless network technologies create 

        the potential to significantly enhance the experience of a visit to a 

        museum. On the exhibit floor, visitors carrying wirelessly connected portable 

        devices can be given opportunities for exploration, sharing, explanations, 

        context, background, analytical tools, and suggestions for related experiences. 

        When these devices are part of a Web-based network, they can help extend 

        the museum visit: in advance, through activities that orient visitors; 

        and afterward, through opportunities to reflect and explore related ideas. 

      </p>

      <p class="AbstractText">The Electronic Guidebook project is a study of visitors 

        equipped with such technologies, conducted by the Exploratorium in partnership 

        with researchers at Hewlett-Packard Labs and the Concord Consortium. The 

        project is investigating how a Web-based computing infrastructure can 

        provide museum visitors with an augmented museum experience so that they 

        can better plan their visit, get the most out of it while they are in 

        the museum, and be able to refer back to their visit once they have returned 

        to their home or classroom. The goals are to understand what technological 

        infrastructure supports this extended museum experience, and to obtain 

        preliminary data on how different aspects of the technologies, and the 

        content delivered through them, affects engagement with the exhibits and 

        pre- or post-visit learning activities. </p>

      <p class="AbstractText">Keywords: handheld computers, wireless networks, electronic 

        guides, mobile computing devices</p>

      <h1>Background</h1>

      <p>The project created a test-bed and tested a network using a variety of 

        handheld computers and radio-frequency identification tags to link visitors 

        with exhibit-related content delivered by a Web-based server. Visitors 

        in the study were able to access Web-based content, including text, images, 

        video, and audio, during a visit. In addition, they were able to construct 

        a record of their visit by book-marking exhibit content, creating images, 

        notations, and other artifacts, and to access that record on a personal 

        Web page in the museum or following their visit. </p>

      <h1>Rationale</h1>

      <p>The exhibit environment in museums excels in providing the public with 

        direct experiences with phenomena, ideas, and objects. But while the exhibits 

        provide compelling opportunities to stimulate inquiry and exploration, 

        they are not, by themselves, completely successful in supporting conceptual 

        learning, inquiry-skill-building, analytic experiences, or follow-up activities 

        at home or school. An ideal learning experience with exhibits would include 

        ways of capturing the visiting experience for later reflection, being 

        able to access additional material that provides a context for the exhibit, 

        and extending the interaction with the exhibit beyond simple manipulation. 

        If museums are to fulfill their potential role as multi-dimensional educational 

        institutions, they need additional mediation techniques that support these 

        needs. And these techniques need to augment the simple exhibit experience 

        without destroying the informal ambiance that is the hallmark of museums. 

        In effect, what is needed are tools that can provide the kind of contextual 

        support with exhibits that is offered by the familiar travel guides but 

        defined in a new interactive way. </p>

      <p>Guides are an important part of our travel experience. We use them in 

        advance to plan our trips. They provide us with an historical context 

        for the country or city we are going to see. We take them along to provide 

        quick access to essential information like addresses and transit information. 

        We use them as in-depth guides to tours of historical landmarks. They 

        help us translate words and exchange currency during our visit. We personalize 

        them with notes, hotel brochures and postcards from the places we have 

        stayed. We refer to them after the trip to remind us of our visit, and 

        they form the basis of talking about our trip with our friends. The best 

        guidebooks become dog-eared from use by the end of a trip and become keepsake 

        reference points for whenever we “revisit” the journey. In short, 

        they serve as an ongoing tool for enhancing our direct visit experience 

        with a place and culture. </p>

      <p>Emerging computer and network technologies have the potential to significantly 

        enhance the experience of a visit to a museum, giving visitors the opportunity 

        to transcend the traditional limits of time and physical space as they 

        engage in a museum&#39;s offerings. Electronic guides, enhanced via interactive 

        technology, can not only serve as reference information, but also provide 

        expert guidance, dynamic advice, recommendations for further inquiry, 

        and other learner supports no paper-based travel guide can provide. On 

        the exhibit floor, additional information, guidance, or feedback at the 

        right time can turn a simple interaction with an exhibit into a meaningful 

        learning experience. Inexpensive portable devices can give visitors opportunities 

        for exploration, sharing, explanations, context, background, analytical 

        tools, and suggestions for related experiences. </p>

      <p>The visit can be extended through sustaining learning opportunities: 

        in advance through activities that orient visitors, and afterward through 

        opportunities to continue reflection and explore related ideas. By adding 

        personalized technology to the museum experience in these ways, we can 

        greatly enhance the visit’s educational value.</p>

      <h1>Research Project</h1>

      <p>The Electronic Guidebook project (<a href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/guidebook/" target="_blank">http://www.exploratorium.edu/guidebook/</a>) 

        is a National Science Foundation funded activity designed as a proof of 

        concept research study to explore the potential of portable computing 

        devices and a wireless Web-based network. Headquartered at the Exploratorium 

        (<a href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/" target="_blank">http://www.exploratorium.edu</a>), 

        the project is a partnership of the Exploratorium, Concord Consortium, 

        an educational research and development organization, and HP Labs, the 

        research and development laboratory of Hewlett-Packard Company. The Exploratorium 

        worked with the Concord Consortium to identify the technical issues and 

        potential uses of handheld devices in the museum setting, and the museum 

        formed a partnership with HP Labs to develop and test a Web-based, wireless 

        network deployable in the Exploratorium&#39; physical space. The aim of the 

        project is to investigate how a mobile computing infrastructure can enable 

        museum visitors to create their own “guide” to the Exploratorium, 

        using a personalized, interactive system to better plan their visit, get 

        the most out of it while they are in the museum, and be able to refer 

        back to their visit once they have returned to their home or classroom. 

      </p>

      <p>The Electronic Guidebook project focused on three simultaneous strands 

        of investigation: </p>

      <ol>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">information technology infrastructure 

          (networked components delivering the information); </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> human computer interface issues 

          (form factors, interfaces, and usability issues for various audiences); 

          and </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> content development (design, 

          formatting, and topical content of deliverable information). </span></li>

      </ol>

      <p>The project was designed as a proof of concept study to explore potential 

        avenues for future research and development. It was not envisioned to 

        support the implementation of a fully functional system, but rather to 

        point the way for future developments. A key idea was to create the test-bed 

        within the existing museum context and use off-the-shelf technology to 

        the extent possible so as to be able to explore this technology in a realistic 

        setting. Often technology projects are tested in idealized conditions 

        without the distractions and the messiness that occurs in the real world. 

        Our goal was to study the interaction of all of the elements, technology, 

        functionality and content, within an authentic situation. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"> The project worked with an existing set of museum 

        exhibits that are part of the “Matter World” exhibit area. These 

        exhibits that addressed topics in sound, mechanics and heat are highly 

        interactive, distributed in space, and individual in design. Because these 

        exhibits have been in the museum for many years, there exists a rich set 

        of supplemental materials (text, images, teaching activities, exhibit 

        developer interviews, etc.) already developed. While this material could 

        provide a rich context for the visitor, it is usually not readily accessible 

        because it is scattered in files, offices, and the brains of staff members.</p>

      <h2>The Test-bed</h2>

      <p>Initial developmental studies which tested different devices, networks 

        and servers were pursued in 2000 by Concord Consortium and the Exploratorium. 

        For the testbed we augmented the museum environment with technologies 

        developed by the Cooltown research program at HP Labs (<a href="../http://cooltown.hp.com/" target="_blank">http://cooltown.hp.com</a>) 

        [Kindberg (2001); Kindberg (2000)]. In the Cooltown scenario, all physical 

        entities (people, places and things) have a ‘Web presence’ [Debaty 

        (2000); Kindberg (2002)]. Nomadic users navigate from the physical to 

        the virtual world by picking up links to Web resources using a variety 

        of sensing technologies such as infrared receivers and barcode readers. 

        Those readers are integrated with their handheld device, which is wirelessly 

        networked. Users access electronic services by using handheld devices 

        to pick up URLs from barcodes or infrared ‘beacons’ attached 

        on or near the objects of interest. Those services are provided using 

        wireless Web technology: Web browsers on the handheld devices and Web 

        servers in the environment. The services can be adapted for users based 

        on their context, e.g. their identity, location, device capabilities, 

        personal interests and preferences.</p>

      <p>The Electronic Guidebook project test-bed consists of a wireless handheld 

        carried by the visitor, a “pi station” (point-of-information 

        station) at each exhibit, and a content server connected to the World 

        Wide Web on the Internet and accessible both inside the museum and from 

        home or school. The visitor located in the museum space was identified 

        using the handheld by a short range IR transmission, an RFID sensor (<a href="../http://www.aimglobal.org/techologies/rfid/" target="_blank">http://www.aimglobal.org/techologies/rfid/</a>), 

        or a barcode swipe. Data transmission to the handheld was provided using 

        a radio LAN system in the exhibit space that provided connectivity to 

        a Web server which is connected to the public Internet.</p>

        (<a href="semperfig3.html">detailed image</a>)</p>

      <p>Each pi station is a tall stand with a base that can contain a laptop 

        and a panel at eye level that can contain an IR beacon (<a href="../http://cooltown.hp.com/beacon_full.htm" target="_blank">http://cooltown.hp.com/beacon_full.htm</a>), 

        RFID reader, barcode, and/or camera. At each pi station, the visitor can 

        “sense” the URL of the main page for the corresponding exhibit. 

        The page is then retrieved from the Web server and displayed with a browser 

        on the handheld. The pi-station was designed to help test different interaction 

        modalities and to facilitate working with different exhibits for different 

        tests. In future system design, some of this functionality might be built 

        into the exhibit itself. </p>

      <p>Three types of hand-helds have been used for the studies: HP Jornada 

        690&#39;s and 720’s (a Hand-held PC with a physical keyboard), HP Jornada 

        540&#39;s (a Pocket PC with on-screen keyboard), and Hitachi ePlates (touch-screen 

        tablets). The hand-helds are connected to the network using 802.11b cards 

        which provide wireless connectivity at 11 mbps. A single 802.11b base 

        station is connected to the Exploratorium&#39;s network near the exhibits. 

      </p>

         Fig. 4: Handheld devices L to R HP Jornada 548, HP Jornada 690, Hitachi 

        ePlate)</p>

      <p>The Jornadas have IR communication ports and Esquirt software that allows 

        them to collect URLs from Cooltown IR beacons. When the visitor points 

        the Jornada at an IR beacon, the beacon transmits to the Jornada the URL 

        of the on-line content associated with that beacon. A barcode reader is 

        attached to the Hitachi ePlate. The raw ID provided by the barcode is 

        mapped to a URL, which is then treated like the URL&#39;s provided by beacons.</p>

      <p>Information and contextual material for each exhibit are displayed on 

        the hand-helds using a modified Web browser. When the visitor picks up 

        a beacon or barcode for an exhibit, the main page for that exhibit is 

        automatically displayed. The browser&#39;s user interface has been simplified 

        so that the only browser buttons are forward, back, home, and a bookmark, 

        which we added to allow visitors to record visited pages in their personal 

        scrapbook. </p>

      <h1>Using the System</h1>

      <p>Visitors carry the electronic guidebooks with them as they walk through 

        the museum floor. As they walk up to a particular exhibit, the guidebook 

        provides interaction, information, and ideas about the exhibit. When approaching 

        the Exploratorium&#39;s Echo Tube exhibit, for example, visitors see a small 

        Web page on their handheld guidebook, suggesting ways of interacting with 

        the tube, such as clapping and counting to measure the speed of sound. 

        The guidebook also provides visitors with intriguing questions to consider 

        (such as, &#34;What does a dog bark in the tube sound like?&#34;) and 

        a way for them to enter their own questions and observations (which other 

        visitors can then access). In addition, visitors can learn more about 

        the science of echoes (with deeper explanations than available on the 

        exhibit label), real-world connections (for example, recommended locations 

        in the San Francisco area for hearing echoes), and the history and evolution 

        of the exhibit itself (including stories from the exhibit developers). 

        The system allows visitors to save items of interest to a personalized 

        Web page that they can access after their visit at home or school.</p>

      <p>All exhibits have a main page whose URL is stored in the pi station, 

        as well as 3-4 sub-pages. When the main page gets downloaded by the browser 

        (after picking up a URL through a beacon or a barcode), visitors can click 

        on any part of the image to get to the ``nuggets&#39;&#39; page which provide 

        links to several areas for further exploration of content related to the 

        exhibits.</p>

        (<a href="semperfig5.html">detailed image</a>)</p>

      <p>In addition to the individual exhibit pages, visitors can access the 

        Electronic Guidebook home page. The home page contains a list of exhibits 

        and a map of exhibit locations. It also gives visitors access to a personal 

        scrapbook page on the server where they can record URLs of interesting 

        material which can be reviewed later on the WWW from any browser.</p>

      <h1>Research Studies</h1>

      <p>The research team that is studying the use of the test-bed is made up 

        of museum educators, scientists, educational technology researchers, learning 

        researchers and human-computer interface researchers. The project started 

        with a set of questions that the test-bed was designed to help answer.</p>

      <h2>Technology Development</h2>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> What is the feasibility and effectiveness 

          of various wireless receiving and transmitting solutions for an exhibit 

          space including distributed and/or centralized infrared and radio transceivers?</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">What is the appropriate distributed 

          computing power relationship between the handheld device, the exhibit 

          computer, the transceiver system and the network servers?</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">What is the optimal integration 

          of the dynamic user database in the Web environment?</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> What are the appropriate handheld 

          device data sensors for the museum exhibits and the design issues surrounding 

          the interface between these sensors and the exhibits themselves?</span></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Interface Design</h2>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> What is a feasible system for 

          providing handheld devices to the public? How can we distribute these 

          devices equitably and to a diverse cross-section of our visitors? Will 

          the devices be used by individuals or by multiple visitors in a group? 

          How will security be handled? What are the logistics of carrying them 

          on the exhibit floor?</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">What are the issues surrounding 

          the use of these physical devices during a visit to an exhibit environment? 

          How can we integrate the devices into the complex social activity of 

          a museum visit without fragmenting a group? How can they be comfortably 

          handled during a prolonged visit?</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">What is an appropriate software, 

          hardware and exhibit graphics interface design for the experience at 

          the exhibit, at home before or after a visit and in the Learning Studio 

          as part of the museum visit? What are the important accessibility issues? 

          For example, how many visitors have Web access? For those who do not 

          have Web access at home, in what ways can we provide them with closure 

          to their experience?</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">What are the key hardware and 

          software design issues (screen size, speed of use, amount of material) 

          that form a threshold of feasibility for this idea? What are the specific 

          design elements (text, graphics, etc) which are important for the experience? 

          What are the specific mediation components that this technology can 

          support at exhibits (capturing information, providing context, creating 

          representations, taking data)?</span></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Educational Potential</h2>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> What is the effectiveness of 

          the Electronic GuideBook system for capturing experience, providing 

          context and extended interaction? How can we create resources that stimulate 

          exploration and reflection rather than having the hand-held just seem 

          like an electronic textbook? </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">What kinds of learning can we 

          facilitate: Cognitive? Affective? Attitudinal? Skill-based? What are 

          the key issues that might motivate the use of these devices? How can 

          we create resources that stimulate exploration and reflection?</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> What is the value of the different 

          project components to the overall educational experience (i.e. pre visit, 

          at the exhibit, in the museum’s classroom spaces, in the home after 

          the visit)?</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p>The initial work has been focused on developing the test-bed and initiating 

        the study with a series of research questions. These studies have focused 

        on the following ideas:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">What are the basic affordances? 

          For example, is the device easy to carry? Are screen graphics easy to 

          interpret? Is the wireless connectivity reliable? Is the 1-2 meter range 

          for reading a Cooltown beacon more convenient for users than the 1-10cm 

          range for scanning a barcode?</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">What is the visitors’ attention 

          to artifacts? That is, how much attention do the users pay to each exhibit 

          or piece of on-line content, and what is the quality of this attention? 

          For example, did the users look at a particular page? If so, did they 

          glance at it or read some text on it, for example? Were the users mainly 

          paying attention to the exhibit, paying attention to the content on 

          their handheld device, or fiddling with the device itself (e.g. trying 

          to solve some problem with the interface)? </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">What are the visitors’ paths 

          through physical and virtual space? What is the sequence of points in 

          physical space (exhibits) and virtual space (Web pages) through which 

          the users pass as they visit the museum? Of particular interest are 

          trajectories that correspond to high-level user events such as following 

          a virtual link to get more information on a topic, deciding to walk 

          over to another exhibit, shifting attention back and forth between the 

          physical and virtual at a single exhibit.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p>The next set of studies (currently underway) are designed to help us 

        better understand how different types of content (including different 

        multimedia formats, types of suggested activities, and the ability for 

        visitors to add their own observations and ideas) affect users’ experience 

        at the Exploratorium and in what ways mobile electronic resources support 

        or hinder their experience in the museum context. Also planned are studies 

        of the “out of museum” use of the network to explore its utility 

        before and after a visit. </p>

      <h1>Overview of Studies</h1>

      <p>To date, we have carried out several rounds of informal visitor studies. 

        The goal of these tests was to get a general sense of how visitors reacted 

        to the system and to uncover major issues. The users for these initial 

        tests were 12 local school teachers (9 female, 3 male), 14 other adults 

        (8 male, 6 female), and 8 young people, ages 10-17, (5 male, 2 female). 

        The adults ranged in age from about 25 to about 50. All users were fluent 

        speakers of English with no major physical disabilities.</p>

      <p>The evaluation approach selected for the tests was participant observation 

        with a project member shadowing a visitor or a small group of visitors. 

        Visitors were directed up to the general area of the instrumented exhibits. 

        They interacted with those exhibits and sometimes nearby non-instrumented 

        exhibits. The project members observed the visitors’ actions and 

        reactions, and helped them out when they had major problems. Semi-structured 

        interviews were held afterwards. The tests were done when the museum was 

        open to other visitors.</p>

      <p>For these initial tests, we used HP Jornada 690&#39;s, except for one subject 

        who used an Hitachi ePlate. In-depth content has been developed for six 

        exhibits, including one pair of exhibits that are thematically related 

        to one another. Most of the pages have heavily graphical content, with 

        a few having mixed text/graphics content and parallel audio content. The 

        content is formatted for the Handheld PC display size. A stand was placed 

        next to each exhibit, with a barcode and IR beacon containing the appropriate 

        URL for each exhibit&#39;s content. Content was designed primarily for an 

        adult audience.</p>

      <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>

      <p>The overall reaction from the visitors was positive. They enjoyed reading 

        the on-line content. Some adults felt that the content would not be interesting 

        to children. However, children who used the system did actually spend 

        a fair amount of time reading the on-line content and trying out possibilities 

        suggested by it. Visitors frequently commented that the hand-helds were 

        really fun, novel devices. On the one hand, this helped keep them interested. 

        On the other hand, the “wow” factor of using the device distracted 

        them from paying attention to both the exhibits and the on-line content.</p>

      <p>Above all, visitors liked the idea of being able to bookmark information 

        to look at later. Both teachers and children thought this feature would 

        allow the children to play more during their museum visit, completing 

        related homework assignments after the visit.</p>

      <p>Aside from technical problems discussed below, the main negative comments 

        were that using the hand-held tended to distract people from playing with 

        the exhibits. The issues here are both mechanical and cognitive. Holding 

        the handheld prevents people from freely using their hands to manipulate 

        the exhibits. Moreover, reading the content is itself distracting from 

        interacting with the exhibit.</p>

      <p>Using hand-helds in a museum setting may also disrupt normal social interactions 

        between members of social groups, because each visitor can get lost in 

        the world of the device and pay less attention to the rest of his group. 

        For example, we observed two boys moving around the museum floor together, 

        talking about the exhibits and working things out together. Yet when we 

        gave them each a handheld, one spent more time reading the information 

        on the device while the other was still interested in seeing as much as 

        he could. On some occasions, when they needed two people to make an exhibit 

        work, they had to spend time trying to find each other again. We believe 

        that these issues can be overcome by designing a system to specifically 

        support visitors’ conversation patterns, such as the system tested 

        at an historic house [Aoki (2000); Woodruff (2001)] where the electronic 

        guidebook became a third party in the visitor conversation.</p>

      <h2>Handheld design and features </h2>

      <p>Hand-helds do not routinely come with straps. Carrying cases are only 

        available for certain models. This represented a serious problem in the 

        Exploratorium because visitors must have one or both hands free to operate 

        the exhibits. When early trials made it apparent that a strap was necessary, 

        we had to resort to tying a strap around the Jornada 690&#39;s hinge. However, 

        even with a strap attached to it, a Hitachi ePlate was too heavy to use 

        for a prolonged time during the visit.</p>

      <p>Our original plan involved comparing audio renditions of content to parallel 

        graphic versions, as in a recent handheld project at an historic house 

        (Aoki 2000 and Woodruff 2001) This study found that visitors preferred 

        audio content to visual content, presumably because it left their eyes 

        free to look at the exhibits. However, the Exploratorium is extremely 

        noisy. When the Jornada is held in the hand, sound from its speakers is 

        essentially inaudible. Some visitors were not even aware that any sound 

        was playing. Headphones can be used, but the Jornada 690 happens to lack 

        a headphone jack (a problem fixed in the Jornada 720). Therefore, the 

        visitors had to be prompted, by on-screen graphics, to hold the hand-held 

        up to their ears.</p>

      <p>Robustness issues are a concern for use in an interactive science museum. 

        Robust devices are essential if on-line content is to be seamlessly integrated 

        into everyday activities. The hand-helds struck most visitors as too fragile 

        to withstand being dropped or bumped. Many exhibits at the Exploratorium 

        involve materials like sand and water, which handhelds were not designed 

        to withstand.</p>

      <p>The wireless network performance was adequate for downloading Web pages 

        and short audio files. However, network performance can be disrupted by 

        obstacles such as elevator shafts. It is essential to test network performance 

        in the place where it will be used and to check carefully for possible 

        “holes” where performance is bad. Multiple wireless base-stations 

        may be required in such a case.</p>

      <h2>Picking up Beacons and Barcodes</h2>

      <p>We found that visitors were able to sense beacons or barcodes with the 

        handheld devices with little trouble. Other Cooltown demos have used a 

        beep to indicate successful beacon or barcode pickup. Since this sound 

        cannot be heard in the Exploratorium, visual feedback must be provided 

        instead. </p>

      <p>Likewise, we found that a brief hands-on introduction is required: sending 

        visitors off with only verbal instruction isn&#39;t sufficient. However, all 

        visitors became fluent with the devices quickly. The one person who used 

        a barcode reader behaved similarly to those using beacons. </p>

      <p>The visitors never accidentally picked up an IR beacon for a different 

        exhibit. However, some visitors accidentally picked up an exhibit&#39;s beacon 

        repeatedly, because they happened to hold the Jornada so that its IR port 

        pointed at the beacon while they were browsing the on-line content. We 

        have since added features to the browser to minimize duplicate pickups 

        by ignoring them if they occur very soon after original pickup, and by 

        querying the visitor about whether to redisplay the exhibit top-level 

        page if the delay is longer.</p>

      <h2>Graphical User Interface</h2>

      <p>In these studies, we gave visitors only extremely brief instructions 

        on how to use the browser interface. Visitors familiar with hand-helds 

        and browsers had no trouble using the interface. However, some visitors 

        inexperienced with hand-helds had significant problems successfully selecting 

        objects on the touch screen, e.g. they dragged the stylus along the surface 

        rather than tapping. The visitors also weren&#39;t familiar with standard 

        browser buttons such as “ back”. However, these visitors did 

        use the system successfully after brief hands-on instruction. For the 

        last two trials, we added a practice exhibit to the check-out process 

        to alleviate this problem. </p>

      <h2>Content Design and Navigation</h2>

      <p>Visitors were navigating the content using a stylus and clicking on images 

        or text hyperlinks presented on the Web pages. When the top-level navigation 

        page for an exhibit consisted of one large picture (e.g. Fig. 6), some 

        visitors had trouble figuring out that they could click on part of it 

        or which parts of it were click-able. Some visitors expressed a desire 

        to be able to see how much content there was for each exhibit and which 

        parts of it they had/hadn&#39;t seen so far.</p>

      <p>Many visitors to the Exploratorium seem to migrate from one exhibit to 

        the next interesting-looking one. In such cases, the visitors only need 

        to be able to locate a pi station once they have already approached the 

        chosen exhibit. This is not difficult so long as the pi station has a 

        reasonably distinctive appearance.</p>

      <p>However, other visitors may wish to follow a tour or see a group of thematically 

        related exhibits. Or the on-line content may suggest another exhibit closely 

        related to the one they are at. It is unclear how to best direct visitors 

        from one exhibit to another exhibit. Some of our test visitors had difficulty 

        locating pi stations on the same floor and only a modest distance away, 

        even when marked by bright orange flags. The on-line map wasn&#39;t used much 

        - probably because it was not prominent enough in the on-line interface 

        or was too difficult to relate to the 3D environment.</p>

      <h1>Future Research Plans</h1>

      <p>We plan to continue our research with the test-bed in the future with 

        a specific aim of conducting studies with different audiences (general 

        public, school field trips, Explainers (floor interpretive staff), teachers, 

        members and staff.) An important feature of our next study will be to 

        examine the potential use of the system in before-and-after visit situations. 

        Our aim is to continue to explore issues of using wireless networks and 

        portable computers to expand and extend the museum visit experience. </p>

      <h1> Conclusion</h1>

      <p>An additional part of the Electronic Guidebook project is a conscious 

        effort to stimulate discussions within the museum community and between 

        museums and industry about the potential of using these systems in a museum 

        setting. To initiate these discussions, the Exploratorium sponsored the 

        first Electronic Guidebook Forum in the fall of 2001. This two-day forum 

        brought together 39 researchers and developers from industry, academia, 

        and the museum world for discussion of the latest findings on the application 

        of handheld computers and wireless networks in museum exhibitions. The 

        forum discussions centered on interrelated aspects of electronic guidebook 

        projects in museums and on emerging questions from the field. The format 

        included full group discussion of these topics, as well as discussion 

        in small groups on lessons learned and recommended next steps. The goal 

        of the forum was to identify key issues in the museum field that will 

        inform further work on wireless handheld devices and stimulate research 

        and implementation. An in-depth report on the forum is available at <a href="../http://www.exploratorium.edu/guidebook" target="_blank">http://www.exploratorium.edu/guidebook</a>/.
