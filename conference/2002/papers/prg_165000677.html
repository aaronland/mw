      <p class="AbstractText" align="center"><b>Abstract </b></p>

      <p class="AbstractText"><b><br/>

        </b>The first &#34;W&#34; in the acronym &#34;WWW&#34; as we all know 

        stands for &#34;world.&#34; Most Museum Web sites -- and for that matter 

        most the Web sites in the United States -- offer very little in languages 

        other than English. This is understandable. Our main audience is English 

        speaking. However, there are opportunities, when we seek them, to reach 

        out to audiences in languages other than English.</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">This paper presents one such opportunity. In it, I 

        will discuss how the project came about, why we made a decision to translate 

        parts of the site into two other languages, what it took in terms of technology 

        to successfully display these languages, and the results of our decision. 

      </p>

      <p class="AbstractText">The Web site presented is &#34;Holocaust Era in Croatia: 

        Jasenovac 1941-1945&#34; (<a href="../http://www.ushmm.org/jasenovac" target="_blank">www.ushmm.org/jasenovac</a>). 

        The decision was made to translate this Web site into the Serbian and 

        Croatian languages. The Serbian language uses the Cyrillic alphabet while 

        Croatian uses the Latin alphabet, but with its own diacritics. But our 

        endeavor was even greater than the adding of these two languages for we 

        also made the editorial decision to represent in the English text the 

        foreign diacritics when appropriate, for example, with the word &#34; 

        Ustaša.&#34; This paper will present the point of view that the 

        effort was worthwhile, but that to really be effective a variety of Museum 

        staff -- from fundraising to communications -- must be involved</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">Keywords: Jasenovac, Croatian, Serbian, Foreign Language, 

        Web Site, Non-English speaking</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">After Germany and its Axis allies invaded Yugoslavia 

        in April, 1941, the Nazis permitted the fascist and terrorist Ustaša 

        organization to found the Independent State of Croatia. The Ustaša 

        regime established numerous concentration camps in Croatia between 1941 

        and 1945. The largest was the Jasenovac camp complex. </p>

      <p>The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) endeavored to create 

        a Web site that chronicles crimes committed during the Holocaust era in 

        Croatia, memorializes the victims, and archives artifacts from the Jasenovac 

        Memorial Area Collection. The Memorial section is a moving audio-visual 

        collage of images and oral histories from Jasenovac victims. The Collection 

        section displays never-before-seen artifacts including documents, photographs, 

        maps, film, transcripts, testimony, and personal objects. The History 

        section educates visitors about the origins of the independent state of 

        Croatia, its targeted populations and concentration camps, and the research 

        being done today. </p>

      <p>The site is a triptych that uses three distinct modes of interactivity: 

        the Memorial uses sounds, words and images to create a poetic experience; 

        the Collection provides unmediated access to the archives; and the History 

        section educates visitors about the broader story of the Holocaust in 

        Croatia. These three interactive experiences were designed to reflect 

        the mission of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum: remembrance, 

        education, and conscience. <br clear="all"/>

      </p>

      <p>The site is available in three languages: Serbian (in the Cyrillic alphabet), 

        Croatian (in the Latin alphabet), and English.  It is this characteristic 

        of the Web site that is perhaps its most important as well as its most 

        difficult to achieve. The mission of the USHMM describes an audience that 

        is “national.”  The Web site, however, has consistently attracted 

        an audience of internationals.  Nearly ten percent of the average 300,000 

        visitors the Web site attracts each month come from countries other than 

        the United States.  The ten percent comes mainly from English-speaking 

        audiences as the table shows.</p>

      </p><p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="MsoBodyText">When we were first presented 

        with the idea of creating a Web site to highlight the Jasenovac artifacts, 

        we knew that the international segment of the audience for the Jasenovac 

        Web site was decidedly not English speaking.  That segment of our target 

        audience was later defined as those people currently living in Croatia, 

        Yugoslavia, and the former Yugoslav republics that speak and read the 

        Serbian and Croatian languages.  We felt the best way to reach this new 

        audience was to speak their language.</span></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="MsoBodyText">We had had some experience 

        reaching out to foreign language speakers via the Web with the Holocaust 

        in Greece (<a href="../http://www.ushmm.org/greece">www.ushmm.org/greece</a>) Web site that was 

        created in 1999.  In building that Web site, we also were working with 

        a language that didn’t have a Latin character set.  Our advantage 

        then was this author’s ability to read and write in Greek and his 

        Greek system (Windows 95) on his home computer.  The Greek system made 

        the writing of the HTML and Greek language text easy because Notepad in 

        the Greek system could work in both languages.  Furthermore, it was possible 

        to compose the Greek text in Word, spell check, and then paste it into 

        Notepad where the HTML was created.  Without the Greek version of the 

        Windows 95 operating system this would have been nearly impossible.</span></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In 2001, the USHMM acquired the Windows 2000 operating 

        system.  This system (and the newest Microsoft system, Windows XP) offers 

        many more capabilities for foreign languages.  By adding foreign language 

        keyboards,  typing directly into Notepad (or any part of the system) in 

        the desired foreign language is permitted.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="MsoBodyText">Our process for the Jasenovac 

        site was to have the two language specialists who would write in Croatian 

        and Serbian enter type directly into the HTML code using Notepad.  Later, 

        we would format the text.  Spell checking was done by “hand;”  

        that is, by asking the writers to print out the text and copy edit, as 

        well as sending the text to others who could independently edit the text.  

        </span></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="MsoBodyText">An investment in the Microsoft 

        Proofing Tools program would have made the spell checking easier.  By 

        loading it onto the Windows 2000 system, it works with the Office suite 

        to allow spell checking in various languages.  After the spell checking,  

        the text can be pasted into Notepad.</span></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="MsoBodyText">All that was left now to 

        allow for the display in the chosen language was to include the proper 

        character set in the meta tag for the HTML page.  That code looks like 

        this for Serbian: &lt;META content=&#34;text/html; charset=utf-8&#34; 

        http-equiv=Content-Type&gt;.  The important part of the code is the “charset=utf-8.”  

        That character set definition sends a message to the browser that displays 

        a type face that is able to display the text.  Users without foreign language 

        fonts who choose to attempt to view the foreign language pages are frustrated.

        Hi kids,<br/>

        You&#39;re probably aware of this already, I&#39;m just adding my 2 cents. When 

        I go to the Jasenovac site, and click on the CPNCKN link it gives me ???? 

        where the text should be. See attached.<br/>

        Happy Thanksgiving!<br/>

      <p class="BlockQuote">Thanks for your note. You need to have the proper 

        multilingual type faces to view any foreign language. Unfortunately, the 

        Mac is not very good at other languages. I&#39;m not bothered by this as the 

        Serbian and Croatian sections were meant for those people who speak those 

        languages in their countries and they will not have a problem viewing 

        the site.<br/>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Our success in reaching out to our target populations 

        was only mitigated by some English language speakers not being able to

      <p class="MsoBodyText">This is the first Web site for which we choose to 

        include diacritics.  Our style guide for publications has long included 

        the stipulation that diacritics to properly display accent marks be used 

        in English language texts.  We had always shied away from using them on 

        the Web because browsers could not support them.  Given that 90% of the 

        USHMM Web visitors come to our site using the Internet Explorer browser 

        (5.0 or above), we decided that most visitors to the Web site had the 

        capability to see the foreign language markings.  And we were correct 

        – once we got the code right.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">Hi Julie<br/>

        The diacritic in Stara Gradiska doesn&#39;t seem to be displaying properly 

        in the Stara Gradiska map artifact caption -- it appears as a little square 

        in the Serbian and Croatian versions (History, Section III). It&#39;s fine

      <p class="MsoBodyText">To get all the diacritics to display properly, the 

        developers at Second Story (the company hired to do the Web site production) 

        had to go through all the text and insert the right alphanumeric code 

        for each diacritic.  “Nezavisna Država Hrvatska” became 

        “Nezavisna Dr&amp;#158;ava Hrvatska” in the code.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">A critical component in successfully reaching out

        for a press conference to announce that </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">For the past year, the United States Holocaust Memorial 

        Museum has saved from deterioration, organized and conserved thousands 

        of artifacts, tens of thousands of documents, thousands of photographs, 

        and hours of film footage from one of World War II’s most notorious 

        concentration camp systems, Jasenovac…<span class="MsoHyperlink"> </span>The 

        Museum believes this press conference marks the first time any of these 

        objects have been displayed in the United States, and probably outside 

        the former Yugoslavia…. The Museum has also established a Web site 

        on the Jasenovac camp at <a href="../http://www.ushmm.org/jasenovac/" target="_top">www.ushmm.org/jasenovac.</a> The site will be available beginning 

        November 13 and contains a camp history, photographs and films from the 

        camp, oral histories of camp survivors, images and descriptions of items 

        from the collection, and more.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">As a result of the press conference, the New York 

        Times (<i>New York Times,</i> “Croatia: Nazi-Era Camp Artifacts Returned,” 

        12.06.2001) and the Washington Post both ran substantial articles (<i>The 

        Washington Post,</i> “Pieces of Croatia’s Holocaust Now Online,” 

        11.14.2001).  <i>US News and World Report</i> and BBC radio also covered 

        the story.  This coverage in major news outlets led to many Croatian and 

        Serbian news reports.  </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">A report in Croatian with a link to our site was

        The fact that they quote the USHMM statistics regarding the atrocities 

        in Croatia allows us to believe that we are succeeding with our stated

        This is obviously a chat room visited by extreme nationalists from both

        not to worry about this one much. There is no really discussion about 

        the website. It seems that this group of people has been doing this sort 

        of communication for a long time. It is embarrassing and sort of heartbreaking 

        to see how some Serb and some Croats will never change.</span></p>

      <p><span class="MsoBodyText">In the first five days the Web site was live, 

        there were 1,486 visits from Croatia (over 11,000 total). In previous 

        months, Croatia does not even show up on the Web log report. There were 

        also 77 visits from Yugoslavia, 57 from Bosnia Herzegovina, and 11 from 

        Slovenia.  One week later, the numbers had grown to over 30,000 total

      <p class="MsoBodyText">This Web site cost over $90,000 to produce.  And 

        this does not include the cost of time spent by people outside the USHMM’s 

        Outreach Technology Department.  Over fifteen people worked on the project 

        with five people working on the translations.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">With less than three months to complete the project, 

        five people were absolutely necessary to complete the translations.  The 

        translated parts of the Web site included:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="MsoBodyText">All historical text</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="MsoBodyText">Eight pages from one artifact

        <li class="normal"><span class="MsoBodyText">Eight oral histories (that 

          ultimately resulted in excerpts from four)</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Because of the time constraints we decided not to 

        translate all the text that appeared as art in the Web site.  This was 

        a decision that worried us, but to date, not one person has reported that 

        the site was less accessible because they couldn’t read the art.  

        Had we been able to better plan for the fact that we would not be able 

        to translate the text that appeared as art, we would have tried to use 

        more symbols.  For example, a printer icon rather than the word print 

        would have made sense to all users.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The experience and results of creating the Jasenovac 

        Web site has inspired us to do more.  Currently in progress is a translation 

        of the “cornerstone” of our Web site—the Learning Center—into 

        Spanish.  We are officially considering this a pilot program that we hope 

        will later be funded.  We will translate all the “top level” 

        articles and post them to the Internet while awaiting funding for the 

        200+ articles at other levels of the site.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Increasingly, the USHMM Development Department is 

        telling us that thinking about new audiences may bring new types of donors 

        to the Museum.  We hope this is the case for the Learning Center.  And 

        we hope with additional funding we can truly call our on-line representation 

        of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum an international institution 

        with patrons who speak many languages.</p>
