      <p class="AbstractText">Museums world-wide are deploying both virtual exhibits 

        and multimedia collections for use by researchers, educators and the general 

        public. With today’s technology, users searching for thematic information

      <p class="AbstractText">This paper presents the motivation, goals, and approach 

        taken for a newly started project that aims to develop methods and tools 

        to address these problems by integrating and extending existing methods 

        and tools developed separately for metadata, multimedia, and multi-database 

        management. The primary goal is to develop a system to support dynamic 

        generation of specialized collections as the result of an easy-to-use 

        query language to multiple museum collections, i.e. a system to support 

        exhibits-on-demand.</p>

        metadata, Information retrieval, Query processing</p>

      <h1>1. Museums on the Web - an informal report from the perspective of information 

        retrieval</h1>

      <p>Museums world-wide have been deploying virtual exhibits onto the Web 

        since the mid 1990s. The basic structure used for virtual exhibits is 

        a set of Web pages consisting primarily of text, images, and links from 

        either the text or images to similar pages or image enlargements, respectively. 

        Virtual exhibits are frequently large, often much more than 100 pages. 

        Given that usage studies of virtual exhibits have shown that the average 

        viewer of an in-house PC-exhibit selects less than 20 pages (Yamada, 1995 

        and Shneiderman, 1989), while a study reported by Nordbotten (2000) found 

        that visitors to a Web-based exhibit selected, on average, less than 10 

        pages, most virtual exhibits contain far more information than an individual 

        visitor will select. </p>

      <p>Most virtual exhibits are <i>self-contained</i> in the sense that a viewer 

        can select only the predefined exhibit pages using predefined links. In 

        some exhibits, for example the “Bhutan Exhibit” at <a href="../http://www.bhutan.at/" target="_blank">www.bhutan.at</a>, a keyword search 

        facility has been included to aid the viewer to find specific information 

        within the exhibit. If we assume that the purpose of implementing a virtual 

        exhibit is both to inform and to arouse curiosity about the topic, than 

        the self-contained exhibit may not support the later goal, since there 

        is generally no support for retrieving additional information from outside 

        the exhibit page set.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Many museums, in addition to deploying virtual exhibits, 

        have also made electronic versions of (some of) their collections accessible 

        from their Web site. This makes large quantities of information available 

        to researchers, educators, students, and the general public. However, 

        the electronic collections are not commonly accessible from the virtual 

        exhibits unless the Web site navigation bar contains a link to the collections 

        and is constantly available to the virtual exhibit visitor, as done in 

        the Web site of The State Hermitage Museum at <a href="../http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/index.html</a>. 

      </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">A few examples of electronic museum collections, showing 

        diversity of content themes, include:</p>

      <ul>

          site, “Picture Australia”, at <a href="../http://www.pictureaustralia.org/" target="_blank">http://www.pictureaustralia.org/</a>, 

          contains numerous sets of pictures clustered by theme,</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">TAMH: Tayside A Maritime History, 

          at <a href="../http://www.tamh.org/" target="_blank">http://www.tamh.org/</a>, contains 

          a rich set of documents on trade.</span></li>

          in Washington DC, at <a href="../http://americanart.si.edu/study/" target="_blank">http://americanart.si.edu/study/</a>,

      </ul>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia, 

        gives an extensive presentation of the museum and its collections at <a href="../http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/index.html</a>.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Various search tools have been made available for these 

        collections, including some combination of:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><i>Find object,</i> given the 

          catalogue number.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <i>Select from list(s),</i> of 

          artists, subjects, and/or dates.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> <i>Key word </i>search, for matching 

          viewer specified search terms to terms used in the catalogue title, 

          type, creator, date, and/or description fields. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><i>Find similar to input object,</i> 

          for matching a scanned or drawn image, input from outside of the collection, 

          with collection objects, as used by the State Hermitage Museum Web site.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="BlockQuote">a)<i> View similar </i>search, based on matching catalogue 

        descriptions to those of a previously retrieved object.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">b)<i> Refine</i> search, for modifying a previous search 

        to expand or restrict the result set.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The results from a collection search are frequently 

        listed without an apparent order. At least the viewer is frequently not 

        informed of either the lists’ total length or of the relevance criteria 

        used to order the result set. For example, a search for <i>“Indian 

        Child*”</i> through the search facility of the Smithsonian American 

        Art Museum at <a href="../http://americanart.si.edu/study/" target="_blank">http://americanart.si.edu/study/</a> 

        gave a result set, in which the first 3 items were: </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">If the collection consists of images, the results commonly 

        contain a list of thumbnail images, linked to a larger version of the 

        image, plus an annotation giving the artist/creator, date, title, and 

        perhaps location. If the collection consists of documents, the titles 

        are listed and linked to the full text. Associations/relationships between 

        the objects in the result set are not given, even though it is likely 

        that there is a relationship between objects and documents describing 

        them, particularly if the object has been used in an exhibit.</p>

      <h2>1.1 Information retrieval problems</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The search strategies outlined above have a number 

        of well-known problems based on the nature of communication and the mismatch 

        between the knowledge level and language of the viewer and that of the 

        creator of the collection. Another problem area lies in the (lack of) 

        sophistication of the software search engines. For example: </p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Search by catalogue number assumes 

          that the viewer has access to the catalogue. Given that the information 

          in the electronic DB is frequently a version of the catalogue, there 

          may be little new information to be attained.<br/>

          <br/>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Selection from a list of artists, 

          subjects, and/or dates, assumes that the viewer knows the content and 

          time frame of the collection, something that is an unrealistic assumption 

          for general public viewers, particularly when the selection list consists 

          of the formal taxonomy for the collection.<br/>

          <br/>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Key word search requires a language 

          match between the user/viewer and the collection creator, which is seldom 

          found.<br/>

          <br/>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Matching a scanned or drawn image 

          input object from outside of the collection, with collection objects 

          requires a level of software sophistication that is not generally available 

          today (2002), except in very specific applications, such as fingerprints 

          or retina images.<br/>

          <br/>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Retrieving similar objects, based 

          on matching catalogue descriptions, commonly gives a high number of 

          matched objects unless the extended search is limited to only a few 

          of the catalogue characteristics. This function must be accompanied 

          with a “refine results” function.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">These problems are well documented in the information 

        retrieval literature, as presented by Kowalski &amp; Maybury (2000) and 

        Baeza-Yates &amp; Ribeiro-Neto (1999). There are also strategies for improving 

        information retrieval from document collections that should be adapted 

        to the more complex problem of information retrieval from multimedia museum 

        collections.</p>

      <h2>1.2 Result presentation</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Presentation of the results of an information search 

        as an unordered list only indicates that each retrieved object has some 

        relation to the selection criteria. This can be ok, if the user simply 

        wants a list of all objects in a particular category, for example by a 

        given artist. However, there is more information about the result collection 

        available that could be utilized in presentation of the result set. Simple 

        orderings could be by artist, chronologically by date of the objects, 

        or by subject, style, or material. In addition, combining ordering criteria 

        may give the viewer even more information.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Again, from information retrieval research and practice, 

        the results can be ordered by relevance to the search criteria, assuming 

        that multiple criteria are given and/or there is an importance/relevance 

        distinction between matches in the title, keywords, and description of 

        the objects.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Finally, the observed sites do not provide cross-referencing 

        between collections, for example from an image collection to a document 

        collection or to presentation within a virtual exhibit. Providing these 

        links could significantly increase the information about the objects in 

        the result set.</p>

      <h1>2. Designing virtual exhibits on demand:  applying a database management 

        perspective</h1>

      <p>Museum exhibits, and their virtual counterparts, are crafted ’by 

        hand’ on a case-by-case basis and include only a small portion of 

        the museum’s real and electronic collections. Development of an exhibit 

        takes months and several man-years of effort. The resulting exhibit is 

        static in the sense that users cannot extend or tailor the content for 

        their own special needs; for example, to form a specialized exhibit as 

        an element in an educational context. Supporting user-developed exhibits, 

        or specialized user defined collections, requires user access to the underlying 

        data collections, possibly from multiple museums, as well as tools for 

        search, retrieval, and presentation. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Museums maintain, and have made available on the Internet, 

        an increasingly diverse set of electronic multimedia databases. As high 

        quality recording and scanning equipment becomes affordable, document 

        and image collections are being supplemented with audio, video, film, 

        and 3D collections. Parallel digitalization activities have led to the 

        development of sets of separate but related electronic data collections 

        or databases. Given that museums house overlapping collections, the result 

        is a large set of inter-related, Internet accessible multimedia, multi-database 

        systems.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Two principal problems hinder support for location 

        and access to multiple data sources. </p>

      <ol>

        <li> First, there is a lack of agreement on how semantically consistent 

          metadata for description of museum collections should be created.<br/>

          <br/>

        </li>

        <li> Thereafter, a query language and processing system must be developed 

          to support the formulation of search criteria, search in a multi-database 

          space, and integration and presentation of search results.</li>

      </ol>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Our project aims to develop methods and tools to address 

        these problems by integrating and extending existing methods and tools 

        developed separately for metadata, multimedia, and multi-database management. 

        Our interest lies in developing methods and tools for assisting development 

        of virtual exhibits from a collection of underlying multimedia databases.</p>

      <h2>2.1 A user scenario</h2>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Use the local search systems

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Finally, the user must construct 

          a coherent presentation of the retrieved data and information, perhaps 

          as a new virtual exhibit.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Known problem points in the above scenario:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">There are a number of search engines 

          available, each giving a different set of responses to a query. For 

          example: the above query retrieved 31 sites using “Ask Jeeves” 

          and 101 when using “Google”. There were 6 references in the 

          first 20 that were found (in different locations) in the 2 result sets 

          and no references to museum collections.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Internet search engines use indexes 

          of Web (html) sites but are not capable of searching underlying multimedia 

          databases.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> The user search terms may not 

          match the descriptors – <i>metadata</i> – of relevant sites, 

          and</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">There is little or no standardization 

          of collection descriptions (metadata), leading to </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> The retrieved site lists may 

          contain many irrelevant ‘hits’, i.e. which were clearly not 

          relevant to the intent of the requirement statement.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Site access from the result is 

          an easy but tedious process, giving at best a mixed result consisting

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">There is no uniform retrieval 

          format to structure the collected information.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">There is no tool to aid construction

          exhibit.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The problems can be summarized as a need for methods 

        and tools to aid users in <i>locating, accessing, extracting, and presenting 

        </i>relevant information from multimedia, multi-database systems developed 

        and maintained by autonomous museums.</p>

      <h2>2.2 Current status in multimedia, multi-database management</h2>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">There are a number of theories, methods, tools, and 

        IT systems that can be extended to provide a solution for accessing autonomous 

        multimedia, multi-database systems.</p>

      <h3>Resource Location &amp; Metadata development</h3>

      <p>Location of relevant data and information requires that metadata describing 

        the semantic content of each collection be made available in a <i>standardized 

        </i>format that supports <i>semantic integration</i> [Bearman and Trant 

        1998]. There are numerous metadata standardization activities in process, 

        perhaps best known are the development efforts behind Dublin Core in which 

        there are 13 working groups including one with museum representatives. 

        The Dublin Core effort began from the requirements of the Digital Library 

        community and proposals for extension to other cultural application areas 

        have been made, for example in [Bearman et al, 1999]. Other metadata proposals, 

        developed for museum collection description include CIDOC [Doerr 1998] 

        and the Warwick Framework [Lagoze1996]. Proposals for description of the 

        semantic content of general multimedia can be found in [Lu 1999, Marcus 

        1996, Subrahmanian 1998, and Wu et.al  2000].</p>

      <p>The Dublin Core proposal (1999) consists of 13 basic metadata elements 

        for describing aspects of media objects or resources. Controlled vocabularies 

        are recommended for certain descriptive values; for example, for subject 

        and type. However, it is well known that the use of controlled vocabularies 

        for developing collection metadata/indexes requires trained users since 

        the vocabulary seldom matches that of general public users [Hillman 2001]. 

        This problem is also well known in the information retrieval community 

        where much research has gone into linguistic based methods for selecting 

        descriptive document terms and establishing thesauruses to aid the match 

        between user query terms and the collection index terms [Baeza-Yates 1999, 

        Kowalski 2001]. The problem is also well known in the multi-database research 

        community where a structural analysis of database schemas has been the 

        dominant approach for synonym resolution [Elmagarmid et.al 1999].</p>

      <h3>Data access and retrieval</h3>

      <p>As noted above, Internet search engines retrieve lists of Web site URLs 

        after matching the user key word request with site indexes constructed 

        from the metadata available to the search engine via crawler activity. 

        No actual data is returned to the users who must then continue the search 

        using the URL list and the established links on the referenced Web sites.</p>

      <p>Multimedia database management systems, including document retrieval 

        systems, also use a keyword-based search, but can also return actual resources 

        (multimedia or document objects). These systems can also search for resources 

        <i>similar to</i> a given resource, perhaps from the response to an initial 

        keyword search [Baeza-Yates 1999, Kowalski 2001, Lu 1999, and Wu et.al 

        2000]. The problem with current approaches is that the search engine is 

        specialized to one data type (text, image, video, audio, or spatial), 

        thus requiring multiple queries, one to each data collection. Current 

        Object Relational DB management systems, for example IBM’s DB2, can 

        search for multiple multimedia data types within one database by combining 

        access methods. However, these systems do not address the autonomous multi-database 

        problem.</p>

      <p>Current multi-database systems can search and retrieve data from multiple 

        source databases, but only structured databases managed by relational 

        or object-oriented DB management systems.</p>

      <p>In both the multimedia and multi-database approaches, extensions to SQL3 

        are proposed and used, perhaps with a form interface. The major problem 

        here is also that SQL3 is not a user friendly language as it requires 

        user knowledge of the structure of the underlying database to be searched, 

        an impractical restriction for an environment with a large number of multimedia 

        data collections.</p>

      <h3>Presentation</h3>

      <p>Query results are generally given as a list of titles and/or thumbnail 

        images linked to the objects/resources that are considered relevant to 

        the search query. The list may be ordered by a relevance match between 

        the query terms and the object descriptors. If the result is to be formed 

        as an exhibit, the user must then do so.</p>

      <h2>2.3 A database perspective of exhibit construction</h2>

      <p>Figure 1 shows the main components for a planned ICT (Information and 

        Communication Technology) system for construction of a <i>virtual exhibit 

        </i>from the results of a multi-database query. The lower section of the 

        figure illustrates the multimedia multi-database set, i.e. the environment 

        of interest for retrieving information for an exhibit. Note that the figure 

        shows only the databases for one museum/organization. The databases are 

        assumed to be managed by an object-relational database system (for example 

        Oracle or DB2) containing SQL3 as its access language and search functions 

        for document, image, video, audio, and spatial/3D media objects. A catalog 

        describes the objects in the database set. </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="nordbotten-fig1.gif" width="397" height="238"/><br/>

        Figure 1: Virtual Exhibit system components</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The upper part of Figure 1 shows the main components 

        of a user interface for retrieving information from the database collection 

        and presentation of the results as a virtual exhibit. </p>

      <h3>Resource Location &amp; Metadata development</h3>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The interface is based on a semantic model of the object 

        catalogs so that similar objects can be identified in the separate source 

        databases. The ICT implementation of the model is termed the semantic 

        schema and contains a ‘union’ of the local collection metadata 

        as well as term thesauri for the collections. </p>

      <h3>Data access and retrieval</h3>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The SemQL query language is an extension of SQL3. Based 

        on information from the semantic schema, SemQL is able to construct local 

        queries to those databases that have data relevant to the user query. 

        SemQL also has a user interface that is similar to those used in the advanced 

        search functions of Web search engines with the addition of an interactive 

        dialog system to assist with early refinement of the user query.</p>

      <h3>Presentation</h3>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">A virtual exhibit construction module presents the 

        results of queries to the system. The presentation module can construct 

        a set of Web pages, a topic exhibit, for presentation of the query response. 

        The resulting exhibit can be further modified by refining and resubmitting 

        the SemQL query.</p>

      <h2>2.4 The virtual exhibit project</h2>

      <p>Bergen Museum, in Bergen, Norway, has embarked on a project, described 

        briefly by Ramirez (2001), to establish and publish a number of different 

        multimedia databases implemented by theme and media type. The project 

        has funding from a grant from the Norwegian National Research Foundation 

        (NFR), and the available databases can be found at <a href="../http://museum.uib.no/" target="_blank">http://museum.uib.no</a>. 

        The collection of databases currently includes 3D databases for sculpture 

        and insects, a video database of centipedes, a film database from social 

        anthropology projects, plus various text-document and image databases. 

        At this time, the databases are not inter-connected and are not connected 

        to virtual exhibits. When the first phase of the database set has been 

        implemented, the system is to be integrated with similar systems in other 

        Nordic museums.</p>

      <p>At the Department of Information Science, University of Bergen, we’ve 

        begun a project in cooperation with the Bergen Museum project, described 

        in Nordbotten (2001), to develop tools that can utilize their databases 

        for development of virtual exhibits. The framework for the project is 

        given in Figure 1 above. This project is also supported by NFR and has 

        funding for 6 researchers and graduate students.</p>

      <h3>Project goals</h3>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The primary <i>project goal </i>is to develop methods 

        and tools for creating ’on-demand’ virtual exhibits from multiple 

        multimedia systems, as illustrated in Figure 1 above. The new methods 

        and tools are to be an integration and extension of appropriate methods 

        developed separately for metadata, multimedia, and multi-database management.</p>

      <h3>Sub tasks for construction of a system for virtual exhibits on demand</h3>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The following methods and techniques will be developed 

        in the coming 2 years:</p>

      <ol>

        <li> A semantic model for the metadata required for description of <i>semantic 

          content</i> metadata for museum data collections (databases).<br/>

          <br/>

        </li>

        <li> A method for integrating the metadata model from task1 with the basic 

          metadata model of Dublin Core, thus supporting interoperability with 

          other systems that use DC technology.<br/>

          <br/>

        </li>

        <li> A schema structure for storage of the metadata as required from task 

          1.<br/>

          <br/>

        </li>

        <li> SemQL as an extension of the SQL3 query language and processor to 

          support search by <i>semantic content</i>, as defined in the metadata 

          schema developed in task 3, for electronic museum artifacts stored in 

          multiple databases.<br/>

          <br/>

        </li>

        <li> An exhibit construction module for presentation of query search results.</li>

      </ol>

      <p>Finally, a prototype system will be constructed and tested to demonstrate 

        the feasibility and utility of above techniques in prototype system for 

        an educational application.</p>

      <p>The prototype will consist of 3 basic sub-systems:</p>

      <ol>

        <li> A<i> metadata system </i>tailored to museum collection users. Initially, 

          the “media abstraction approach” proposed by Marcus and Subrahmanian 

          (1996) and later extended by Subrahmanian (1998) will be used to develop 

          a semantic model for the museum collection. This media abstraction approach 

          outlines a structure for capturing the semantic content of multimedia 

          objects. It has not yet been developed into a working prototype, so 

          that our result can be considered method development. Assuming this 

          is successful, the result will be integrated with the semantic content 

          descriptions as specified in the current Dublin Core standard for description 

          of artifacts.<br/>

          <br/>

        </li>

        <li> The <i>semantic query language</i> SemQL, based on SQL3+, will be 

          developed. This language will combine the functionality of multimedia 

          and multi-database access as outlined in Baeza-Yates (1999) and Elmagarmid 

          (1999), respectively. In addition, SemQL, will use the semantic schema 

          structure developed under component 1 above. Currently, there is no 

          known query language that combines multimedia search in multi-database 

          systems.<br/>

          <br/>

        </li>

        <li> A generic <i>exhibit generator</i> will be developed for presentation 

          of SemQL query results. We envision using a book metaphor for concurrent 

          presentation of text and related image with embedded links so that the 

          viewer can zoom from either the text or image presentation resulting 

          in more detailed information presented in both text and image panels.</li>

      </ol>

      <h3>Test and Evaluation</h3>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Three phases of evaluation are planned:</p>

      <ol>

        <li> <i>Prototype testing</i> will be used to demonstrate the feasibility 

          of combining the above elements into a museum resource retrieval system. 

          <br/>

          <br/>

        </li>

        <li> <i>Precision &amp; Recall</i> measures, common in document processing 

          systems (Kowalski 2001), will be used for quality testing of SemQL. 

          The test environment will consist of a carefully constructed set of 

          data collections containing the scanned images and descriptive documents 

          for a set of thematically close types of museum objects.<br/>

          <br/>

        </li>

        <li> <i>Usability testing</i> will be done by eliciting thematic descriptions 

          of presentation exhibits, defined by educators interested in the thematic 

          content of the test databases. These will form the source material for 

          the SemQL query and the presentation model testing.</li>

      </ol>
