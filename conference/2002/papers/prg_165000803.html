The Library provides an unusual environment for the Exhibition Program because it is not a museum and therefore allows a lot of freedom but provides little preexisting structure for exhibitions.  The challenge of displaying and interpreting communications technology provided the Exhibition Program with an opportunity to explore the power of multimedia interactives. These interactives both make use of and demonstrate the power of digital age communications technology by confronting the visitor with various digital media. One of the most powerful advantages of digitization is the ability to combine many different source media, including digital artifacts in their own medium, into a consistent, easily navigable experience.  In The Once and Future Web, eleven touch-screen interactive stations deliver text, images, audio, video, and a searchable glossary, providing user-selected content relevant at that point in the narrative. Visitors can also email a Morse-coded message or a digitally manipulated picture of themselves. People can participate in a virtual conversation with one of the leaders of the Internet community, and see a demonstration of &#39;virtual anatomy&#39;. In addition, visitors can relax in a centrally located Digital Lounge, which provides limited Internet access and displays an Internet art program. The area is made informal with chairs, tables, and topical reading materials.

      <p class="PaperTitle">Exhibiting Communications: Digital Narratives at the 

        National Library of Medicine</p>

      <p class="Author">Elizabeth Mullen, Patricia Tuohy, The National Library of 

        Medicine, USA</p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">In May of 2001, the Exhibition Program at the National 

        Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, opened <i>The Once 

        and Future Web: Worlds Woven by the Telegraph and Internet</i>. The exhibition 

        is presented as two intertwining narratives moving through four themes, 

        one telling stories about the telegraph and the other about the Internet. 

        The exhibition combines elements of history and science museums’ 

        styles of presentation and makes extensive use of interactive technology. 

      </p>

      <p class="AbstractText">For <i>The Once and Future Web</i>, the challenge 

        of displaying and interpreting communications technology provided the 

        Exhibition Program with an opportunity to use multimedia interactives 

        to deliver exhibition content. The exhibition’s interactives both 

        make use of and demonstrate the influence of communications technology 

        by providing visitors with digitized media from many different original 

        sources.  One of the most powerful advantages of digitization is the ability 

        to combine many different source media, including digital artifacts in 

        their own medium, into a consistent, easily navigable experience.  </p>

      <p class="AbstractText">The process of creating these interactives also allows 

        the Exhibition Program to re-purpose the content to further extend the 

        reach of the exhibition message to new audiences.  For this exhibition 

        a set of digital animations were created to explain complex technological 

        concepts. Also, many original interviews with innovators in the field 

        were digitally taped.  Finally, several audio pieces were recorded from 

        historic texts and sheet music.  All these pieces were created with the 

        knowledge that they could be re-purposed and presented in other formats 

        and configurations, including a Web site and a DVD, to provide accompaniments 

        to the exhibition and prolong its life past the physical installation.  

        The re-purposing process is not without its challenges, however; as the 

        number of multimedia materials increases, accessibility and archiving 

        issues become more difficult.  </p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In May of 2001, the Exhibition Program at the National 

        Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health opened <i>The Once 

        and Future Web: Worlds Woven by the Telegraph and Internet</i>.  For this 

        narrative exhibition we gathered artifacts and images from a wide variety 

        of sources to help tell the story of how an earlier generation’s 

        enthusiasm for a new communication technology –the telegraph – 

        holds important lessons for people living and working in the age of the 

        information superhighway. In the exhibition, two intertwining stories 

        form a narrative about the development and effects of the telegraph and 

        the Internet. The narrative compares and contrasts the two historical 

        stories by exploring four themes: developing the technology, social impact 

        of the technology, the cultural impact of the technology, and medical 

        applications. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The National Library of Medicine is a unique environment 

        for exhibitions.  Our institution is the world’s largest medical 

        library.  Its History of Medicine Division, of which the Exhibition Program 

        is a part, contains an exemplary collection of historical, rare, and beautiful 

        medical texts and manuscripts dating from the 11th Century, as well as 

        prints, photographs, drawings, and films.  Many libraries , including 

        the New York Public Library and the Library of Congress, have fairly recently 

        begun to produce large-scale exhibitions as part of their outreach and 

        educational programs.  As each Library begins to produce exhibitions it 

        develops an exhibition style of its own, often drawing heavily from its 

        collections.  </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Exhibition Program at The National Library of Medicine 

        was established in 1996.  Until then the Library had no exhibition philosophy.  

        Art museums produce exhibitions featuring artifact-driven storylines. 

        Science museums and children’s museums usually have numerous interactive 

        components and focus on teaching specific lessons.  History museums generally 

        seek to interpret complex and sometimes controversial narratives.  The 

        Exhibition Program at The National Library of Medicine has created a philosophical 

        approach to exhibitions that combines the features of various typical 

        museum interpretive styles in order to best reach our audience.  Our program 

        produces large-scale, historical, narrative exhibitions featuring social, 

        cultural, and historical topics in science, health and medicine.  These 

        projects are educational, fun, and relevant to the general public.  Each 

        topic is framed in a historical context and examines contemporary issues, 

        and often includes explanations of scientific discoveries and technological 

        innovations.  We primarily focus on communicating a narrative and bringing 

        it to life for our visitors by illustrating it with artifacts, graphics 

        and multimedia, most of them borrowed from other institutions.  With <i>The 

        Once and Future Web</i>, The Exhibition Program has applied this philosophy 

        to the creation of an exhibition that makes extensive use of technology.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The use of technology to transmit information to the 

        public is a topic of great interest to both libraries and museums, and 

        one that the National Library of Medicine feels strongly about.  The Web 

        has become a vital tool for the Library’s communication with the 

        public, by making its collections available for searching, delivering 

        information resources such as MEDLINE<i>plus</i>, a health information 

        resource, and by providing narrative interpretation of segments of its 

        collection.  The History of Medicine Division, for example, has a number 

        of on-line exhibitions and essays built around its numerous manuscript 

        collections.  In <i>The Once and Future Web</i>, The National Library 

        of Medicine combines its longstanding interest in communications technology 

        with its interest in exhibitions as a communications tool.  In the past, 

        each of the Exhibition Program’s projects has had a technology component 

        in a Web presence which lasts well beyond its physical installation and 

        presents the illustrated narrative created for the physical installation.  

        <i>The Once and Future Web </i>goes beyond this and reflects a new dedication 

        of the Library to technology on the exhibition floor.</p>

      <h1>Exhibiting Communications</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">An exhibition about communications technology can provide 

        an easy and perhaps logical step into a technology-driven exhibition.  

        It is also a good opportunity to examine the exhibition itself as a communications 

        medium and specifically to look at how technology is used in communicating 

        a narrative.  Interspersed among artifact cases, <i>The Once and Future 

        Web</i> presents 15 touch-screen interactives, 11 of which are content 

        or narrative oriented.  The narrative oriented interactives are designed 

        to create a distinct visual identity for the telegraph and Internet stories 

        while presenting a clear organizational structure to visitors.  Separate 

        color schemes, fonts and background image motifs are assigned to each 

        of the parallel stories, while categories of information and access points 

        to information, the framework or template, are constant.  This unification 

        of structure, like the overall design of the exhibition, helps to integrate 

        the stories of the two parallel technologies into one coherent narrative.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In <i>The Once and Future Web</i> the interactives 

        allow us to present visitors with a choice of cultural artifacts that 

        can only be experienced through multimedia.  This multimedia content provides 

        a more holistic view of historical periods and supplements the narrative 

        with words, pictures, voices, music, historic videos, animations, and 

        a searchable glossary.  Visitors are able to select and view content to 

        experience a narrative tailored to their interests.  Particularly, interactives 

        supplement the narrative by:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Providing in-depth information 

          on a topic;  for example, biographical material on Samuel F. B. Morse, 

          inventor of the electric telegraph, including dramatic readings from 

          his letters recounting his struggle for government funding, an interactive 

          chronology of his life, and a gallery of his paintings.  A glossary 

          is also available from all stations, providing instant information about 

          people, places, things and ideas relevant to the narrative. <br/>

          <br/>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Displaying multimedia artifacts.  

          Visitors can choose to experience original audiovisual artifacts like 

          radio broadcasts, song recordings, historic newsreels, and clips from 

          movies and documentaries.  They can choose recordings made for the exhibition, 

          including songs about the telegraph performed from historic sheet music, 

          dramatic readings from letters and an autobiography, video interviews 

          and animations.  And they can see contemporary digital art created in 

          the form of movies and graphics designed for distribution by media such 

          as video games and the Web.<br/>

          <br/>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Illustrating complex technical 

          concepts.  A set of 5 high-definition animations was commissioned for 

          the exhibition to facilitate visitors’ understanding of key technological 

          concepts like the Morse telegraph, networking, digitization, encryption 

          and bandwidth.<br/>

          <br/>

          </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Providing and enlivening mainly 

          textual material.  Textual materials contain exciting information for 

          historical and cultural narratives, but it can be difficult to bring 

          these words to life in an exhibition environment.  The interactives 

          contain recordings of dramatic readings from letters and autobiographies 

          so visitors can choose to listen to the author’s own words without 

          being required to read long passages.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p><span class="normal">The exhibition also includes four interactive demonstrations 

        of specific concepts or digital technologies that are more engaging than 

        the narrative interactives.  Visitors can create a Morse-coded message 

        or a digitally manipulated photograph and e-mail it to friends. Using 

        voice recognition software, visitors can participate in a virtual conversation 

        with Donna Cox, an artist and Internet communications expert.  Another 

        interactive allows visitors to manipulate an example of “virtual 

        anatomy.”  While the content-oriented interactives allow visitors 

        to choose from many small pieces of the story to create their own narrative, 

        these more engaging interactives provide visitors an opportunity to participate 

        in the actual subject of the narrative: to actually do what is being described 

        by the content.  Visitors can become users of the technology the narrative 

        describes by, for example, learning about digitization and then taking 

        digital pictures of themselves, manipulating them and sending them to 

        someone by e-mail.  Another interactive allows visitors to interact with 

        a telegraph operator in a virtual telegraph office where they can write 

        messages and hear them in Morse code, and then e-mail those coded messages 

        to receivers who can later decode them by visiting a Web site.  Both the 

        telegraph and the Internet require the interaction of individuals with 

        technology to achieve communication.  In a way, the exhibition interactives 

        do the same, allowing visitors to interact with technology and actively 

        receive the narrative messages being sent.  </span></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Yet displaying and interpreting communications technology 

        is a challenging undertaking because the material that illustrates the 

        stories is ephemeral.  Many of these materials are textual, words on paper, 

        audio or video.  The interactives display digital artifacts in their original 

        medium, such as video game movies and art produced for the Web.  The interactives 

        also present audio or video recordings converted from other media, such 

        as historical newsreels or contemporary interviews.  In <i>The Once and 

        Future Web</i> the interactives show visitors, sometimes overtly, sometimes 

        more subtly, the various aspects of digital media delivery.  In order 

        to incorporate these multimedia artifacts into our interactive templates 

        and to provide a seamless and orderly experience from which visitors can 

        draw, we first had to reformat the original material from a number of 

        different media.  This was a complex task, but for us one of the greatest 

        advantages of digital interactives was the number of different source 

        materials we were able to convert to digital formats and insert into a 

        consistent, coherent, easily navigable template. </p>

      <h1>Challenges for Digital Narratives</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">In order to incorporate the extensive list of audiovisual 

        materials described in the previous section, a good deal of manipulation 

        and reformatting was required.  In his 2001 paper “Re-purposing of 

        Content and Digital Delivery Convergence: Implications for Interface Design” 

        Dr. Milekic of the University of the Arts enumerates the various ways 

        that materials previously available through other media are being increasingly 

        re-purposed for use in digital media.  He defines re-purposing</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">in most general terms…as manipulations of <i>space</i>, 

        <i>time</i>, and <i>meaning</i> within the new medium.  Most often re-purposing 

        involves some kind of <i>compression</i>. </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">He goes on to say that transferring information from 

        one medium to another, such as from film to digital file, is one aspect 

        of re-purposing which he calls inter-medium, while reformatting or modifying 

        a digital file, changing its resolution or compression algorithm, for 

        example, is another aspect which he calls intra-medium re-purposing (Milekic, 

        2001).  It is important when embarking on the creation of exhibition interactives 

        to plan ahead and consider the kind of re-purposing required both for 

        the exhibition floor and for other supplemental projects associated with 

        the exhibition, content such as Web sites, catalogues, DVDs etc.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Extensive re-purposing of multimedia materials can 

        quickly become a complicated and confusing task.  The seemingly inordinate 

        amount of effort required to include multimedia materials can sometimes 

        end up causing a development team to give them false weight in a narrative.  

        However, use of multimedia can be very rewarding in illustrating a narrative.  

        In <i>The Once and Future Web</i> interactives allowed us to provide visitors 

        with a rich array of audiovisual artifacts and information and a more 

        complete picture of the cultures that surrounded the telegraph and Internet 

        as they were invented and developed.  </p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The production process required us to take materials 

        from their original formats such as printed media, photographic film, 

        radio broadcasts, vinyl LPs, audio cassette tapes, VHS tapes, computer 

        hard drives, audio CDs, CD-ROMs and DVDs, BetacamSP tapes and others, 

        and re-purpose them (digitize, compress, and insert them into a program) 

        in order to bring them all together and make them accessible to visitors 

        in a coherent and approachable way.  Creating interactives also require 

        s forethought to prepare the way for the re-purposing of content to extend 

        the reach of the exhibition message.  For example, in this exhibition 

        we commissioned a set of high definition digital animations, presented 

        throughout the exhibition under the heading “Show Me How it Works!” 

        to explain complex technological concepts.  Also, 13 original interviews 

        with innovators such as Vint Cerf and Leonard Kleinrock and scholars of 

        the history of the telegraph such as David Hochfelder and Richard John 

        were digitally recorded to digital videocassettes.  We included only small 

        portions of each of these interviews in the exhibition, but the full-length 

        videos exist and can potentially be presented in another format to another 

        audience and archived as additional resources for scholars.  We hired 

        professional actors to read from historic texts and musicians to perform 

        several songs from historic sheet music and recorded these on digital 

        media.  We created all these pieces with the knowledge that they would 

        be re-purposed and presented in other formats and configurations, including 

        our Web site and a DVD.  Such supplemental projects can provide accompaniments 

        to the exhibition and prolong its life past the physical installation, 

        and also expand on the narrative in ways not addressed by the physical 

        installation.  For example, the Web site for <i>The Once and Future Web</i> 

        not only presents much of the physical exhibition’s content re-purposed 

        for the Web but also provides a “Learning Station” designed 

        to help teachers prepare for visits or teach concepts related to the exhibition’s 

        narrative.  This section provides exhibition content materials in new 

        contexts such as pre-visit activities.  Similar reconfiguration of materials 

        is made relatively uncomplicated once a digital archive of exhibition 

        materials is achieved.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The complexity and multi-stage process of the re-purposing 

        procedures presents a new challenge in the archiving of an exhibition.  

        Archives are maintained as a record of the exhibition and also as a resource 

        for the creation of any supplemental projects associated with the content 

        of an exhibition.  Where once slides and transparencies of each object 

        present in the physical exhibition or of the exhibition itself sufficed 

        to create a record of the exhibition, now the situation becomes much more 

        complex.  Modern printing techniques for catalogues and other printed 

        materials require high resolution digital files of images, new multimedia 

        products such as DVDs can display high resolution media files, and new 

        advances in Web technology allow the incorporation of ever more complex 

        and detailed media than ever before.  All these media have different requirements.  

        Re-purposing often involves several stages such as dubbing, cropping, 

        digitization, compression, encoding and others.  When we consider archiving, 

        questions of how many stages of these processes should be retained and 

        what formats should be made standard become important.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The use of interactives also brings new challenges 

        when incorporating accessibility issues into the development process.  

        <i>The Once and Future Web</i> was developed under the federal government’s 

        ADA regulations, and accessibility requirements were considered in its 

        design.  On the exhibition floor, the interactives were made accessible 

        to visitors using wheelchairs by placing the screens at an appropriate 

        height and leaving space for the chair in front of the screen.  The screens 

        were also mounted on a swivel bracket so they can be tilted to multiple 

        viewing angles.  Touch-screens provide easy and immediate access and eliminated 

        the need for a keyboard, mouse or other controller. All audio and video 

        is closed-captioned or transcribed for people with impaired hearing, and 

        exhibition tours, led by an on-staff educator, are available daily or 

        by appointment, with sign interpretation on request.  Of concern in the 

        design of future exhibitions is a recent government mandate of standards, 

        effective as of June 2001, developed under section 508 of the Rehabilitation 

        Act as amended by Congress in 1998.  It requires that all information 

        technology created for or used by the federal government meet new, very 

        specific accessibility specifications.  </p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">Digital communications technology made it possible 

        to answer many challenges posed by an exhibition about communications 

        technology.  <i>The Once and Future Web</i> allows visitors to navigate 

        and choose from a vast array multimedia artifacts woven into a narrative.  

        Through making selections and interacting with the technology, visitors 

        are in fact participating in the very story being delivered to them.  

        In order to make this selection possible, audio, video and digital materials 

        from many media were re-purposed and integrated into a coherent experience.  

        This re-purposing process also creates opportunities for expanding the 

        uses of the material in other formats, thereby extending the reach of 

        the exhibition beyond its physical installation.  It is not without its 

        challenges, however, as accessibility and archiving issues become more 

        difficult as the complexity of the multimedia materials increases.  Still, 

        the challenge is well worth meeting when the audience, both at the exhibition 

        and in related supplemental projects, can be provided with a holistic 

        representation of the narrative brought to life by artifacts that can 

        only be experienced through multimedia.</p>
