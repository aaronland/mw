      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>What do we really know about museums and the Web? What can we really 

        say, and back up with evidence, about the virtual museum and the virtual 

        visitors? As with any fast-growing field, any time this discussion arises 

        we have endlessly more questions than answers. Our battle is made even 

        more difficult by our goals.  Virtual museums may measure eyeballs and 

        click-through rate, but the mission is not achieved when the visitor buys 

        something.  The virtual museum’s mission is to inform, to enlighten, 

        and perhaps to change lives - and museums have risen to this challenge.  

        During this decade, museums have put enormous amounts of energy, both 

        in hours and dollars, into a virtual presence. In order to continue to 

        push the boundaries of what virtual museum sites can achieve, we need 

        to stand back and review the questions we’ve been asking about virtual 

        museums and the answers we think we have.</p>

      <p>We believe the most important questions about museums and the Web are 

        all about learning.  Do people really learn from virtual museums?  If 

        so, we need to know how, why, in what ways, and a whole host of other 

        questions.  As one of the museum Web team staff members we interviewed 

        said, “Does this really work, or is the medium just wrong for learning?  

        Can this create true engagement?”  (Boyd-Smith, 2002).  Unfortunately, 

        we’re not yet at the time where we can, definitively, as a field, 

        answer those questions in depth.  Yet we are definitely at the place in 

        time where we should be asking them.  But in order to answer the more 

        complex questions, such as whether people really learn from virtual museums, 

        we must first know who and what’s out there.</p>

      <h1>Methods</h1>

      <p>We used three methods to investigate these questions.  We did a literature 

        review, conducted a survey of museum Web sites, and conducted phone interviews 

        with museum staff. </p>

      <h2>Literature Review</h2>

      <p>We conducted a literature review both of the literature within the museum 

        field, and of related fields such as distance education, learning from 

        television and learning in general.  What we found in relation to museum 

        Web sites and their visitors was fairly sparse.  Although the field of 

        distance education is rich in studies, little of it was transferable to 

        museum Web sites.  Most of the research and any assessments of learning 

        were directly dependent on traditional classroom dynamics, such as lectures 

        and testing.  As physical and virtual museums move away from a transmission-absorption 

        model of learning towards a more constructivist model, distance education 

        research is less pertinent to virtual museum assessments.</p>

      <p>Of the studies directly within the field, there were several common problems.  

        Most of the information came directly from Web server log analysis.  The 

        results can vary a fair bit depending on the software package used to 

        perform the analysis.  The server logs are sparse in terms of providing 

        certain useful pieces of information. Analysis packages can tabulate the 

        information stored on a server log and provide visitor information about 

        the host computer, how the visitor was referred to the site, the length 

        of time of the visit, the pathway taken through the site, and more.  But 

        this type of analysis is unable to provide data on visitors’ demographics, 

        social context, motivation, or learning.   One interviewee suggested one 

        of the issues surrounding collecting information from museum Web sites 

        is that some Web sites are unable to use cookies because they are hosted 

        on state/government servers which are prohibited from using cookies to 

        track visitors.  (Boyd-Smith, 2002) </p>

      <p>On-line surveys, although providing information more similar to information 

        that would be collected on a survey at the physical museum, have other 

        risks.  Most of the surveys we reviewed either did not list a response 

        rate, or had a response rate between 4 and 11%. (Chadwick and Boverie 

        1999; Chadwick, Falk and O’Ryan 2000; Semper 2000) This extreme self-selection 

        means that most of the surveys suffered from a lack of reliability and 

        validity.</p>

      <h2>Survey of Museum Web sites  </h2>

      <p>We did a survey of more than 80 museum Web sites, both national and international, 

        in order to determine what visitors had available to them in terms of 

        museum Web sites.   The national museum Web sites were chosen in a semi-random 

        manner, attempting to include diversity both in geography and in the size 

        of the museum.  The mix of different types of museums included was based 

        roughly on the percentage of each type of museum in the United States 

        as reflected by AAM membership (Museums Count, 1994).  The international 

        museums were chosen at random from the Virtual Library Museum Pages list 

        of Important International Museums. This component is biased towards large 

        international museums, but allowed us to survey a geographically diverse 

        set of sites while still within the constraint of sites in the English 

        language.</p>

      <p>On each museum Web site we looked to see if it contained the following 

        components:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Logistical information - information on hours, location, etc.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Information on their collections - descriptions of museum’s collections, 

          examples from the collections</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">An on-line database of the collections/part of the collections - a 

          searchable database of collections/parts of collections</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Information on physical exhibits  </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">On-line exhibits of physical exhibits</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Virtual tours of exhibits/galleries</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">On-line only exhibits - on-line exhibits that were not connected to 

          a physical exhibit</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Education section<u> </u>- information for teachers, parents, children’s 

          activities</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">News/calendar/events</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Information on membership<u> </u>– how to become a member, donate 

          to the museum</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">On-line museum store </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Use of plug-ins to view sections/pages</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p>These components were chosen because they encompass the majority of types 

        of content found in major Web sites such as the Metropolitan Museum in 

        New York. </p>

      <h2>Interviews with Museum Staff</h2>

      <p>We did telephone interviews with several museum staff around the country 

        who play key roles in their institutions’ Web sites.  We asked them 

        questions about their Web sites, what they know about their virtual visitors 

        and the relationship between their virtual and physical sites.  Although 

        most staff did not have direct evidence of site usage, their comments 

        were extremely helpful in putting other areas in context.  </p>

      <h1>Findings</h1>

      <h2>Who do museum Web sites reach? </h2>

      <p>In reviewing the sparse information on museum Web site visitors, we have 

        found some distinct trends.  Several of the earlier studies done (Gradwohl 

        and Feldman, 1998; Chadwick and Boverie, 1999), describe virtual museum 

        visitors that mimic general Internet users.  At that time, in the early 

        days of museum Web sites (1994-1997), the Internet user was generally 

        male, between ages 20-40, of a higher income.  The very earliest studies 

        also point to visitors who had Internet access from research or university 

        sites.</p>

      <p>The population on the Internet in 1994 was very different from the population  

        on the Internet in 2002.  As time has passed, museum Web site visitors 

        have changed along with the evolving Internet population.  </p>

      <h3>Nationality</h3>

      <p>Virtual Museum visitors are still primarily North American, though possibly 

        not for long.  Bowen (1999) shows that 88% of virtual museum visitors 

        are based in North America, although he mentions the study limitation 

        of an English-only questionnaire. There is evidence that this sampling 

        method may account for a large amount of measuring error, because by next 

        year the majority of the general Internet population’s first language 

        will not be English, and by 2007, Chinese will be the most used language 

        on the Internet (E-Spectra 2002).</p>

      <h3>Gender</h3>

      <p>Although some recent studies on virtual museums still show a slight predominance 

        of male visitors (Vergo et al, 2001), other studies show closer to gender 

        equity.  (Semper, 2000)  Still other studies (Chadwick, Falk and O’Ryan, 

        2000) show a higher representation of females (71%).  Visitation to physical 

        museums is not homogenous regardless of type of museum, and there is no 

        reason to expect that virtual museum audience demographics would be independent 

        of subject matter.  Falk and Dierking (1992) state “More males than 

        females tend to visit science museums, more females than males visit art 

        museums.”  At the Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., 60% of 

        the visitors are male (Doering and Bickford, 1994).</p>

      <p>Bowen (1999) proposed that gender equity in museum Web site visitorship 

        would occur more quickly than gender equity on the Internet at large.  

        As we left the 1990s, the number of American women on-line has matched 

        the number of men  (Department of Commerce, 2002). Additionally there 

        is more rapid growth of women as Internet users than men, with the number 

        of teenaged girls growing five times faster than overall Internet growth 

        (Rickert &amp; Sacharow, 2000).   One of the highest growth rates among 

        Internet users in different types of households was for single mothers 

        (29%)  (Cyberatlas, 2002).</p>

      <h3>Age</h3>

      <p>Surveys of virtual museum visitors tentatively suggest that the average 

        visitor is slightly older than the average Internet user.  In a study 

        by Semper (2000), the virtual museum visitors tended to be young adults 

        between the ages of 23 and 49.  This corroborates a study by Chadwick, 

        Falk and O’Ryan (2000), where the average age was 40 years, with 

        a high point of 75 and low end of 12.  A survey of on-line international 

        museums (Bowen, 1999) reported that the average virtual museum visitor 

        was between 40-64 years old.</p>

      <p>General Internet use has increased in every age group since 1997.  Currently 

        Internet use rises as age increases through childhood and the teens, plateauing 

        at high rates of use for people in their prime working years, between 

        26 and 55, and then tends to fall among people at higher ages (Department 

        of Commerce, 2002).  Use of the Internet in older age groups is growing 

        with the rest of the population, and as the baby boomer generation ages, 

        one can expect interest usage among the group over age 55 to increase.</p>

      <p>Age of the average physical museum visitor varies wildly dependent on 

        whether the visit is to  a zoo, art museum, children’s museum or 

        historic site.  The majority of visitors to physical museums are between 

        ages 35 to 50, with visitors over 60 rarely accounting for over 10% of 

        the total visitation.  Adults as a whole make up 30% to 90% of the visitation, 

        dependent on the type of museum (Falk and Dierking, 1992).</p>

      <h3> Income</h3>

      <p>We have found no studies that indicate the income levels of visitors 

        to virtual museums.  However, several assumptions can be made with the 

        information on income that we do have available, although that information 

        is solely from the US.  Income is clearly a predictor of computer use, 

        Internet access, and independently, physical museum visitation.  Notably, 

        Internet use among the lowest income households is undergoing rapid growth. 

        The Department of Commerce study (2002) shows that Internet use in households 

        grossing less than $15,000 increased from 9.2% in October 1997 to 25.0% 

        in September of 2001.  Between December of 1998 and September of 2001, 

        there was 25% growth for Internet use for households under $15,000, as 

        compared to an 11% growth for Internet use during the same period for 

        households over $75,000.  The likelihood that lower income households 

        are new to the Internet has implications for their on-line behavior as 

        well. Lower income visitors not only are generally newer to the Internet, 

        but also spend more time on-line (13 hours per month) and view more content 

        pages than higher income groups (Rickert and Sacharow, 2000). </p>

      <p>While visitation to physical museums varies greatly by location and type 

        of museum, it is still disproportionally an activity for higher income 

        groups. (Doering, 1995)  </p>

      <p class="normal">Visitor surveys consistently suggest that, by and large, 

        museum visitors are of higher than average socioeconomic level. These 

        findings apply equally to visitors of art museums, science museum, arboreta, 

        and zoos; they apply as well cross-culturally, to visitors in the U.S.A, 

        Canada, Sweden and Great Britain <i>(Falk and Dierking, 1992).</i></p>

      <h3>Race/Ethnicity</h3>

      <p>None of the studies we reviewed had any information on race or ethnicity 

        for virtual museum visitors.  As much funding for projects in both the 

        physical and the virtual museum worlds is dependent on increasing the 

        diversity of visitation, this remains a key area for future virtual museum 

        research.</p>

      <p>Race and ethnicity, like income, are strongly correlated with both computer 

        and Internet usage.   (See Table 1).   The Internet is rapidly becoming 

        more diverse: usage growth rates for African Americans and Hispanics has 

        outpaced growth of usage for Whites, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. 

        The growth rates for African Americans and Hispanics have accelerated 

        further within the last 18 months.  Despite this growth, there is still 

        a divide by race of Internet usage.  Internet usage for Asian Americans 

        is nearly double that for Hispanics (Department of Commerce, 2002). </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="haleygoldman.table1.gif" width="373" height="112"/><br/>

        Table 1: Computer Usage and Percentage of Race/Ethnicity<br/>

        (Department of Commerce, 2002)</p>

      <p>There is a constant push within physical museums to further diversify 

        the audience, as it is widely understood that minorities are underrepresented 

        in visitorship (Falk and Dierking, 1992).   The table below (Table 2) 

        compares U.S. census population data by race with Smithsonian visitorship.   

        Using Smithsonian visitation (which here includes the National Zoo) likely 

        overstates what minority visitation might be to the average physical museum, 

        but it still exemplifies minority underrepresentation.   </p>

        (Doering, 1994)</p>

      <h3>Social Group</h3>

      <p>A physical museum is at its foundation a social space, and most museum 

        visitors are part of a social group.  The learning agenda presented in 

        a physical museum has been demonstrated to be more successful when visitors 

        communicate amongst themselves, rather than remaining silent (Falk and 

        Dierking, 1992).  Certainly there are a number of innovative ways that 

        virtual visitors can form social connections, even if they are physically 

        alone when connecting to the site. Such collaborative workspaces like 

        the Virtual Leonardo (Barbieri and Paolini, 2000) may eventually change 

        the dynamic of social interaction at virtual museums.  Virtual field trips 

        have greatly strengthened the amount of interaction for virtual sites.  

        But for the non-school visitor, most virtual museum visits tend to be 

        solitary activities.</p>

      <p>The evidence on the social aspects of the visit is mixed.  In one museum 

        Web site survey, 90% of visitors were alone when visiting virtual museum 

        sites (Vergo et al, 2001).   Even in a study of the highly interactive 

        resources - Cow’s Eye Dissection, Flights of Inspiration and the 

        Science of Cycling, two of which were designed for classroom interaction 

        - 45% of people worked alone and 9% of people with someone else.  (As 

        the authors point out, this is a less than satisfactory answer, as the 

        total should reach 100%) (Semper et al, 2000).   Chadwick and Boverie 

        (1999) found that 21.6% of survey respondents were in a family group and 

        8.6% were in classrooms.  </p>

      <h3>Context</h3>

      <p>The setting and details of the actual visit are important pieces of information 

        in understanding the overall virtual visit. Several virtual visitor studies 

        have suggested that the majority of visitors currently are accessing museum 

        Web sites from their home computers.  This evidence is drawn from the 

        preponderance of America On-line and other personal access providers as 

        the referring sites (Ross, N., Personal correspondence, 2002).</p>

      <p>Forty-four percent of the U.S. population have Internet access from home, 

        and 35% have Internet access at work.  Other places are also used to access 

        the Internet, including (in order of popularity) schools, other people’s 

        houses, libraries, and community centers (Department of Commerce, 2002).</p>

      <p>Preliminary data shows that there is more interaction during the week, 

        when presumably, people have more access to high-speed connections. (Semper 

        et al,  2000) Through Web logs we can often tell the site an on-line visitor 

        was at immediately before entering the virtual museum.  We know, for instance, 

        that 45% of the visitors came to two art museums through search engines. 

        Another 17% came from related sites, whereas 10% came directly from other 

        Web pages (Vergo et al, 2001).   Thes figures are similar to the results 

        from a study of science activities, where 40% were referred to the site 

        from a search engine (Semper 2000).  What this does not tell us, however, 

        is the overall context for the visit, what other sites the visitor was 

        browsing during that same on-line session.</p>

      <h1>What do museum Web sites contain?</h1>

      <p>A survey of museum Web sites was conducted in order to get a feel of 

        what museum Web site visitors are exposed to.  We need to understand that 

        museum Web sites are not a one-purpose medium. Museum Web sites contain 

        diverse types and amounts of content. Knowing what museum Web sites today 

        contain helps us to better understand museum Web site visitors’ choices 

        and what they mean. For example, if museum Web sites only contained contact 

        information, we would know what visitors were getting out of the site. 

        Our results show that most museum Web sites have more choices than that, 

        and therefore museum Web site visitors can obtain a range of information.    

      </p>

        Table 3: Museum Web site Content</p>

      <h3>Logistical information</h3>

      <p>Ninety-six percent (n=79) of the museum sitess we looked at had logistical 

        information on them. One of the museums that did not have logistical information 

        appeared to be an on-line only museum. </p>

      <h3>Collections</h3>

      <p>Sixty-eight percent (n=56) of museums surveyed contained information 

        about their collections. Though a majority of sites have information about 

        their collections, only 21% of the museum Web sites surveyed had an on-line 

        database of at least one or part of their collections (See Table 4).</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="haleygoldman.table4.gif" width="295" height="125"/><br/>

        Table 4:  On-line Database of Collection/<u>s</u></p>

      <h3>Exhibits</h3>

      <p>Ninety-two percent (n=75) of museums surveyed contained information on 

        physical exhibits at their museums. Only about half  43% (n=35) of the 

        sites that had information on physical exhibits at the museum had on-line 

        versions of them at their Web sites. A small portion (12%, n=10) of the 

        museum Web sites had on-line exhibits that were not connected to a physical 

        exhibit in the museum (See Table 5).  Ten percent (n=8) of the museum 

        Web sites had virtual tours of the museum, specific exhibits, or galleries 

        of the museum (see Table 6 below). </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="haleygoldman.table5.gif" width="297" height="125"/><br/>

        Table 6: Virtual Tours of Exhibits/Galleries</p>

      <h3>Education </h3>

      <p>A majority, 60% (n=49) of the museum Web sites surveyed contained education 

        sections which included curriculum for teachers, information for parents 

        and/or on-line activities for children. </p>

      <h3>News/calendar/events</h3>

      <p>Of the museums Web sites surveyed, 66% (n=54) contained information or 

        sections on news of what’s going on in the museum or a calendar of 

        events at the museum.</p>

      <h3>Membership information</h3>

      <p>Forty percent (n=31) of museum Web sites surveyed contained information 

        on how to obtain membership to the museum. </p>

      <h3>On-line museum store </h3>

      <p>Of the museum WWeb sites surveyed, 44% (n=34) had an on-line museum store. 

      </p>

      <h3>Use of plug-ins to view sections/pages</h3>

      <p>Only 20% (n=16) of the museum Web sites surveyed had an obvious use of 

        plug-ins whether it was for the whole site or just one or more components 

        (an on-line exhibit, etc.) This is not surprising since many smaller US 

        museum Web sites were surveyed along with major museums. It is also important 

        to note that is it common for Web designers for public Web sites to try 

        to use a lower number of plug-ins so that the Web site is accessible to 

        visitors with slow computer processors and connections to the Internet. 

      </p>

      <h2>What did visitors do when they reach museum Web sites?</h2>

      <p>Many museum educators and curators in the past despaired at the short 

        duration of the average exhibit visit in physical museums.  In a world 

        that we are constantly informed is speeding up, the average virtual visit 

        is even shorter than the average exhibit visit.  Several studies showed 

        half or more of museum Web site visitors entered the museum Web site somewhere 

        other than the home page (Gradwohl and Feldman,1998; Jensen, 1999) .</p>

      <p>The issue of non-home page entries is one several other museums have 

        reported  (Gradwohl and Feldman, 1998; Chadwick and Boverie, 1999; Sumption, 

        2000), and can sometimes be fixed by site redesign.  In the Sumption study, 

        the top 10 entry pages accounted for only 38% of the user sessions, but 

        site redesign boosted the top ten pages to the starting point of 71% of 

        the sessions. Another study showed that even within a specific exhibit, 

        one-third of the visitors entered somewhere other than the main page.  

        Forty-five percent of visitors accessed just the first two pages.  However, 

        8% stayed over 20 minutes to access 43% of total page views (Kenderdine, 

        2001). </p>

      <p>Starting at the entry point can be significant for site “stickiness”. 

        Those who started from a topic page, rather than a detail page, had significantly 

        longer sessions (Nordbotten, 2000). Those sessions also tended to have 

        a richer amount of content, with entries into several separate topic pages.  

        Yet entry through the home page is no guarantee of a deep, content-rich 

        visit. In one study, only 35% looked at home page and nothing else; in 

        another study, 50% left immediately after viewing the home page (Nordbotten, 

        2000; Jensen, 1999).</p>

      <p><b>What are the visitors interested in</b><b>?</b></p>

      <p>Visitors are strongly interested in logistics.  Studies varied, but reports 

        ranged from 28-32% of virtual visitors reporting that they were in search 

        of museum information, often to plan a trip (Chadwick and Boverie,1999; 

        Nordbotten, 2000).  Vergo (2001) reports the other top 3 reasons virtual 

        visitors came to particular arts sites:  25% were researching information 

        on specific content, 12% were looking for fun-like activities, and 2.4% 

        were looking for shopping.  </p>

      <p>Bowen (1999) reports that in a survey of over 200 international museums 

        ,the most popular content was museum collections.  A museum that has a 

        large number of very specific collections on-line can develop a strong 

        scholarly following.  One Canadian museum had 65% of total page requests 

        for collections materials (Jensen, 1999). More recent data show that collection 

        searches continue to be a fundamental reason for virtual museum visits 

        (Kravchyna and Hastings, 2002).</p>

      <h2>Relationships</h2>

      <p>The relationship between virtual museum sites and physical sites has 

        not been extensively researched. Though many museum Web staff have hypotheses 

        about the relationship between their Web site and their museum, few have 

        tested their hypotheses or had any direct evidence. Through our interviews 

        we attempted to address the relationship and interaction of  a museum’s 

        physical and virtual sites. </p>

      <h3>Is there a relationship between physical and virtual sites? </h3>

      <p>In most cases there is a relationship between physical museums and their 

        Web sites though unfortunately there is not enough evidence to prove it. 

        Informal conversations with museum staff concluded that the majority of 

        museum Web sites started for marketing purposes. It seems that who in 

        the museum is responsible for the museum Web site has an impact on what 

        the focus of the museum Web site contains. </p>

      <h3>Is there interaction between the physical and virtual sites? </h3>

      <p>Both interviews and informal conversations with museum Web site staff 

        show a strong belief that there is interaction between the physical and 

        virtual sites- “cross pollination”. For instance, use of on-line 

        curriculum guides can promote class field trips, and vice versa. Another 

        way that the physical and virtual sites impact each other is that museum 

        Web site visitors go to museum Web sites for logistical information providing 

        information for their trip to the physical museum. </p>

      <p> Museum Website staff that we spoke with felt that the museum Web site 

        boosted attendance for the physical museum, but they had no concrete evidence 

        to prove it. </p>

      <p>Museum staff are looking for methods to increase the interaction between 

        the physical and virtual sites. For instance, one museum hopes to print 

        the Web site address on tickets and to integrate it more fully into its 

        publications for marketing purposes. </p>

      <p>There is also interaction between the physical and virtual sites in terms 

        of exhibits. Many on-line exhibits were created from physical exhibits.  

        From our analysis of museum Web sites, the more sophisticated Web sites 

        extended the story in their on-line exhibits while  basic on-line exhibits 

        tend to outline the blueprints of physical exhibits</p>

      <h2><b>Conclusions and Recommendations</b></h2>

      <p>In order to contemplate the next steps in understanding museum Web sites 

        and learning, we need to address the current status of museum Web sites 

        and their visitors. </p>

      <p> There is a variety of information available on museum Web sites, but 

        on-line visitors essentially use them for logistical information and information 

        on the museum’s collections.  Museum Web site visitors frequently 

        visit in order to plan an upcoming trip to the physical museum.  A challenge 

        for museums is to have these visitors return to the Web site after their 

        visit to the physical museum - to extend their visit virtually.  This 

        juxtaposition points out a need to match goals, actual content and museum 

        Web site visitor needs.</p>

      <p>Museums need to develop new plans and review existing technology plans 

        to determine what they want their Web site visitors to gain from their 

        Web site.  As we move into an era of more experienced Internet users, 

        expectations are higher for what a museum Web site might provide.</p>

      <p>These results help our field to build a foundation to someday answer 

        even more critical questions about museum Web sites and learning.  The 

        next questions in the research will be ones that surround the unique context 

        of virtual museums- from how a visitor&#39;s prior knowledge of the Internet 

        impacts the visit to a museum Web site to how the medium of an electronic 

        visit impacts exhibition design.  This will also help us to begin to figure 

        out how to attack the age-old yet never trivial question about outcomes 

        - what do visitors really learn from a virtual museum?</p>
