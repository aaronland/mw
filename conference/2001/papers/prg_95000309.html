      <p class="PaperTitle">Applying High Technology to a Museum Web Site (The Amber 

        Room Project)</p>

      <p class="Author">Tatyana G. Bogomazova, Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology 

        &amp; Ethnography, Russian Academy of Sciences, Vladimir A. Bronnikov, 

        Ctor_Studio Lanck, Russia</p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">The paper explores issues in applying new technologies 

        to a museum web site through analysis of the visual relationship of museums 

        and their visitors, the levels of perception of visual information relating 

        to cultural heritage, and functional (documentation and diffusion) features. 

        As an example authors describe &#34;The Amber Room on the Web&#34; which 

        provides access for a broad public to information about the process of 

        reconstructing a monument. The project is seen as an integral part of 

        the museum&#39;s digital policy: by serving as an information gateway to tell 

        and illustrate the entire process of reconstruction of the Amber Room, 

        it reveals specific goals of the project, its history and conception, 

        planning and creating the content, web development, technology applications, 

        navigation, usability, design issues and basic evaluation parameters.

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class="normal">Creating a virtual environment through applying high technologies 

        to a museum web siteis a special problem in museum information representation. 

        The strategy of applying flash, panoramic video, 3D graphics and reconstructions, 

        immersive imaging as well as multimedia to a museum web site anticipates 

        solving problems of both technological and visual relationship of a museum 

        and its visitors, and of understanding how visitors use a museum web site. 

        Providing user the experience of the reality-virtuality continuum (P. 

        Milgram, H. Takemura, A. Utsumi, F. Kishino, 1994) is a basic objective 

        of representation of museum information.</p>

      <p class="normal">Our methodology in applying presentation technologies to 

        a museum web site involved two basic tasks:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Defining levels of visitor&#39;s perception of visual 

          information relating to cultural heritage</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Defining functional issues of representing cultural 

          heritage on the net.<span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></li>

      </ul>

      <h1>I. Visual relationship of museums and their visitors </h1>

      <p class="normal">Our first research to understand the visual relationship 

        between the museum and its visitor was carried out in 1997 (&#34;Museum 

        Sociology: Visitor of Peter the <span class="Normal">Great Museum of Anthropology 

        and Ethnography (Kunstkammer) of the Russian Academy of Science (MAE RAS)&#34;. 

        The main conclusions of this work could be summarized as follows: </span></p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> By going through museum halls and hearing a tour, 

          visitors feel that there are hidden, non-obvious, but essential objective 

          laws. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Visitors to Science Museums (unlike Art Museums), 

          are seeking to gain in-depth knowledge about unknown, invisible, and 

          unusual phenomena.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> The main distinction of museum learning is that it 

          provides the opportunity for visitors to request information and to 

          choose the level of its presentation himself -- from highly visually 

          represented - to textual (see levels of perception below). </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Virtual reality techniques in used museums - reconstructions, 

          3D graphics, immersive imaging as well as multimedia - are a highly 

          visual and interactive representation and provide a means to access 

          and comprehend complex cultural data (Juan A., Forte, Maurizio, Sanders, 

          Donald H., 2000). They open up new ways of presenting museum displays 

          in general and objects in particular. Such unknown, invisible, unusual 

          phenomena are most appropriate for visualisation and thus for presenting 

          as real visual experiences.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> In addition to its strong popular appeal, computer 

          reconstructions allow presentation of complex information in a visual 

          way that enables them to be used to test and refine reality or a simulated 

          image or model that has been created to represent reality.</span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">The virtual museum is not a replacement of the 

          real museum -- it is a kind of addition. It allows a visitor understand 

          his impressions and feelings, and construct the main ideas according 

          to their personal level of perception. Also the virtual museum is a 

          way to combine two methods of visiting: individual and collaborative. 

          Each visitor of the museum&#39;s web site can feel himself alone in the 

          museum or interact with the means of community-building thus being an 

          object of a collaborative space.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">Museum webs are learning environments 

        where people of different ages and interests acquire further education. 

        The web resource should provide information and documentation in a way 

        that favors the learning process and, stimulates users&#39; enquiries 

        and practical experiments. New technologies can simulate some learning 

        environments in order to reproduce some interacti</span>ve of &#34;hands-on&#34; 

        exhibitions. Other resources may include auto-evaluation or quizzes for 

        youngsters as a way to learn by playing games.</p>

      <h1>Levels of perception of visual information relating to cultural heritage</h1>

      <p class="normal">Surveys of our visitors allowed us to define 5 simulated 

        levels of perception of visual information each having specific relation 

        of cognitive/visual information perception and corresponding manifestation 

        (V.Uzunova, T. Bogomazova, 1999):</p>

      <h2>1. Perception level &#34;beginner&#34;.</h2>

      <p class="normal">Here it is sufficient to look in order to see. On this level 

        there arises the desire to see something new. Here <i>novelty</i> isvaluable 

        in itself. Interest is attracted by nonessential details. Perception easy 

        slides from one thing to another and from topic to topic. Museum technologies 

        appealing to this level of perception include any kinds of virtual reality 

        facilitating overall observation suchas 3D models, 360-degree panoramas, 

        and VRML simulated environments.</p>

      <h2>2. Perception level &#34;curious&#34;. </h2>

      <p class="normal">Here the purpose of looking is to understand. On this level 

        learners seek to gain new knowledge and have a psychological predisposition 

        to remember, to compare, and to be keen in their intellectual search. Museum technologies appealing to this level of perception include interactive 

        guided 3D models, annotated 360-degree panoramas, VRML simulated environments 

        with feedback.</p>

      <h2>3. Communicative perception level.</h2>

      <p class="normal">Here the algorithm of information perception is to see, 

        to think, to connect, and to associate. <i>Perception, memory, imagination, 

        thinking</i> should be claimed at this level. The latter is the level 

        of<i> setting communication</i>. Color, music, video, text - all these 

        elements of one scenario provide input for aesthetic cognition. Here combinatorial 

        associative principle becomes operative. Associations appear as a result 

        of ability to find out, to discover evidence of similar relationship between 

        human beings. Technologies combining 1. and 2. in different variants are 

        useful here.</p>

      <h2>4. Creative search perception level.</h2>

      <p class="normal">Here the algorithm of information perception is that it 

        is not sufficient to look and think, it is necessary to invent. Here we 

        enable our visitor to discover, i.e. we open for him horizons of undiscovered, 

        unknown knowledge. Here we unwrap the theme of the <i>unique.</i> Museum 

        technologies appropriate to this level of perception may include a combination 

        of Virtual Reality with plain texts, images, audio and video clips navigated 

        according to user&#39;s choice thus being reassembled in the process 

        of knowledge acquisition.</p>

      <h2>5. Perception level &#34;master&#34;.</h2>

      <p class="normal">The algorithm of information perception here is the <i>universal 

        </i>principle of humanitarian knowledge - &#34;a great many of all possible 

        worlds&#34; and &#34;a great many of all logically possible facts and 

        ties of things&#34;, i.e. perception as recognition of the universal. 

        Appropriate technologies permit the opportunity to manipulate fragments 

        of appropriated knowledge and to reconfigure and redesign it to tie into 

        universal cognitive experience.</p>

      <p class="normal">In each case, the main objective is to make high quality 

        text, image and sound accessible on-line for any user, notwithstanding 

        current technological hindrances. Since every user may have diverse interests, 

        the aim is to develop an advanced system that takes into account these 

        individual needs. Likewise a virtual resource can be also a meeting point 

        for all specialists in similar subjects and serve as an entrance to other 

        resources of museum collections.</p>

      <h1>Functional issues</h1>

      <p class="normal">Documentation involves the creation of a complex database 

        (a relational or object-oriented design) to facilitate the access to information 

        of objects in the collection. In many cases this information is prepared 

        for researches and museum staff in their diverse departments (Management, 

        Conservation, Documentation, Administration etc.) and everyone has a different 

        means to access their corresponding data. Documentation includes digitization 

        of collections, whether texts, images (fixed images and video) or sounds. 

        Collection digitization is an important tool for the professionals, so 

        it needs to take into account acquisition policy, collection management, 

        information diffusion, exhibition organisation, cultural policy, visitor 

        management and virtual access to museum rooms <span lang="EN-GB">to overcome any obstacle in accessing collections and documentation 

        due to physical distance or time difference by enabling users to get the 

        information on-line. Documentation enables display since digitised objects 

        can be incorporated to an exhibition as virtual elements. </span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span lang="EN-GB">If documentation is important for bringing 

        information to specialists in some subjects (narrow casting), diffusion 

        of cultural heritage is essential to a wide public (broadcasting). First 

        of all it provides visual ways of dynamically interpreting some data or

        diffusion of works of art, architecture and heritage. Except for some 

        extremely high quality images, they should be easily accessed on-line

        images, however the use of dynamic images and 3-D reconstructions can

      <h1><span lang="EN-GB" class="Normal"></span>II. Case Study: The Amber Room 

        Project on the Web</h1>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p class="normal">The secret of the Amber Room is, without exaggeration, one 

        of the most stirring riddles of the twentieth century, not only in Russia, 

        but all over the world. As with any plot having epic implications, the 

        story of the Amber Room tends to grow on itself, acquiring new details, 

        names, and twists of plot. Its mysterious history induces renewed bursts 

        of interest, which are reflected periodically inheadlines in authoritative 

        journals, books of famous writers and publicists, and documentary films 

        and TV programs. Until recently, the importance of the Amber Room as an 

        artistic monument, and information about its history, and particularly 

        the labor-intensive work of dozens of people in its reconstruction, remained 

        unknown.<br/>

        Prior to the beginning of the project to represent &#34;The Amber Room 

        on the Web,&#34; the researchers of the State Museum Reserve &#34;Tzarskoe 

        Selo&#34; and of the Association &#34;Restorer&#34; carried out laborious 

        research on representative materials relating to its interior. The results 

        of this work have shown that no drawings of the original Amber Room existed 

        -- neither the initial Berlin variation nor the subsequent St.Petersburg 

        and Tzarskoe Selo versions, were documented. The unique interior was represented 

        in only one rather schematically executed water-color of the artist Grekhnev 

        from the collection of the Museum Reserve &#34;Tzarskoe Selo&#34;. Thus 

        the primary sources, both for reconstruction of the Amber Room and for 

        historical documentation of the project, were photos. Any pictures made 

        of the interior have been used as major documentary resources, allowing 

        for reconstruction of its image, containing all details. Eighty-six photos 

        of the Amber Room have been found in the State Hermitage, the State Russian 

        Museum, the Leningrad Branch of the Archaeology Institute of the USSR 

        of the Academy of Sciences, the State Inspection on Protection of Monuments 

        of Leningrad, and other archives in the city. They contained pictures 

        beginning with one published by Theophile Gautier in 1859, and ending 

        with ones taken in 1942-1945 after the stolen amber panels had been installed 

        in the Koenigsburg Order Castle. </p>

      <p class="normal">Careful studies of the photographs have revealed numerous 

        losses and various levels in the amber decor of the interior and required 

        serious research devoted to more than two hundred years of the history 

        of the Amber Room in Russia. Due to many years of research, it became 

        possible to determine the structure of initial decoration of the Berlin 

        study and the origin of the Florentine mosaics built into the interior, 

        as well as the time of later additions of amber decorations to the room. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">Preparation for the project of restoring the Amber Room 

        was carried out under the supervision of the principal architect of the 

        Catherine Palace, the esteemed scholar of culture Alexander Kedrinsky. 

        The design documentation included materials on restoration of all of the 

        art decorations of the room: wooden gilded carving, mirror pilasters, 

        painted plafond, and the inlaid floor. </p>

      <h1>Building Conception</h1>

      <h2>1. Documentation</h2>

      <p class="normal">A starting point for any process of reconstruction of a 

        lost original is the architectural plans, which, in one&#39;s turn, are based 

        on historical materialsÂ . The design documentation for the reconstruction 

        of the Amber Room, developed by group of architects under the supervision 

        of Alexander Kedrinsky, included full-scale drawings of all amber panels 

        and reproduction of details in color. On the basis of the plans, and pre-war 

        photos, the sculptor-modeler makes figured models in plastic and plaster, 

        i.e. moulds all elements decoration in full scale. Color and molded standards 

        are the initial materials, which serve as a basis for the actual process 

        of the reconstruction of amber details, carried out by the restorers. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">By the time the project started we had all illustrative 

        materials digitized. The project was seen as important integral part of 

        the museum&#39;s digital policy, allowing it to fulfill the demand for online 

        access to its information resources from Russia and worldwide audience. 

        It serves an information gateway to tell and illustrate the entire process 

        of reconstruction of the Amber Room from the beginning to the end. </p>

      <p class="normal">Conventional cameras proved to be one of the most indispensable 

        to<span class="Normal">ols, allowing the Tzarskoe Selo Amber Workshop 

        staff photographer to shoot and &#34;process&#34; images on an ongoing 

        basis. These images were digitized, organized and archived on the computer 

        in the form of web gallery As the general outline of the reconstruction 

        process was not designed from the onset to allow documentation of the 

        actual process to be inserted into the program, additional attempts were 

        made to coordinate on-line and on-site documentation. Each time any of 

        the amber panels was changed, detailed visual documentation was generated. 

        Specific goals of this stage of the project were:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> To provide basic didactic and visual information about 

          its structure and collection of amber objects. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> To document and archive the process for later reference 

          and educational applications. </span></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>2. Diffusion</h2>

      <p class="normal">Specific goal<span class="Normal">s of the project were: 

        </span></p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> To represent the Amber Room as a unique monument of 

          art of 18<sup>th</sup> c. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> To provide basic information about its history. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> To provide detailed and updated information about 

          the process of its reconstruction - scientific researches, technologies, 

          and methods and to enhance the visitor&#39;s retention of the knowledge 

          and understanding of the ongoing process. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> To make visitors aware that they are contemporaries

      </ul>

      <h3>Stages of the project</h3>

      <p class="normal">The tight timefra<span class="Normal">me demanded rigorous 

        planning to meet project deadlines. The project is divided into 3 stages: 

        </span></p>

      <ol>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">January 2000 - October 2000 - building the basic concept, 

          structure and content of the web site and placing it on the web (<a href="http://www.tzar.ru/amber" target="new">http://www.tzar.ru/amber</a>) <br/>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> November 2000 - September 2001 - complete redesign 

          of basic web site of the State Museum Reserve &#34;Tzarskoe Selo&#34; 

          (<a href="http://www.tzar.ru/" target="new">http://www.tzar.ru</a>), 

          incorporation of additional visual representation tools on the web site 

          of the Amber Room, the building of community, and the addition of e-commerce 

          options, creating &#34;The Amber Room&#34; CD-ROM. <br/>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">October 2001 - December 2002 - finalizing basic project 

          development, evaluating the project, and planning further steps to ensure 

          thematic continuity to site content. In this paper we analyze some 

          results of first stage of the project implementation. </span></li>

      </ol>

      <h3>Funding of the project</h3>

      <p class="normal">Reconstruction the Amber Room began in 1979, and during 

        that 20 years, the project has been financed by the federal budget with 

        $7,754,000. During this time the team of the Tzarskoje Selo Amber Workshop 

        succeeded in reconstructing 30% of the amber decor, but taking into consideration 

        all the preparatory work done in the past two decades, one may estimate 

        the degree of its completion as 60%. During the period of state financing, 

        the last panel was installed in the Amber Room in 1996. <span lang="RU"></span></p>

      <p class="normal">The financing from the federal budget was unstable, therefore 

        the Direction of the State Museum Reserve &#34;Tzarskoe Selo&#34; decided 

        to look for additional sources of financing. An agreement concerning exclusive 

        sponsorship of the reconstruction of the Amber Room was signed on September 

        6, 1999 by the Ministry for Cultural Affairs of the Russian Federation, 

        the Tzarskoje Selo State Museum , and &#34;Ruhrgas AG&#34;. The grant 

        from &#34;Ruhrgas AG&#34; for completing restoration of the Amber Room 

        amounts to US$3.5 million. <span lang="RU"></span></p>

      <p class="normal">Funding for the project on the web was secured through the 

        State Museum Reserve &#34;Tzarskoe Selo&#34; project funds, and the 

        project was undertaken as public relations action to advocate and publicize 

        these events. </p>

      <h3>Planning and Creating the Content</h3>

      <p class="normal">Soon after the team of the working group was approved, a 

        number of planning meetings were held where the on-site and online aspects 

        of the exhibit were introduced and discussed. Strategies were developed 

        to re-purpose and share information between the Tzarskoe Selo Amber Workshop 

        and Tzarskoe Selo Museum Reserve and apply graphic resources as efficiently 

        as possible. Plans were made to coordinate the work of text writers and 

        designers developing the didactics for the web site. Plans were also set 

        how to put the production contract. This was awarded to CTORSTUDIO. All 

        curatorial and research work was to be done by the museum, all issues 

        concerning web development including strategic web content planning was 

        to be done by the studio and the author of the paper acting on behalf 

        of it. Curators identified details and a timeline for the reconstruction 

        process and key resources related to the history of the Amber Room to 

        ensure consistency in style and form. </p>

      <p class="normal">The Director of the project together with the Advertisement 

        and Information Department of the Museum were responsible for overall 

        control of the project, the choice of technology and installation. The 

        project manager was responsible for the day-to-day operation, system 

        design, and producing and managing the content. </p>

      <p class="normal">Because the online exhibition focused upon an ongoing, developing 

        process, the text and images needed to be designed to interpret the events 

        as efficiently as possible and thus provide appropriate dissemination. 

        Two methodologies were developed to address these needs: </p>

      <p class="normal">curators and conservators identified images and generated 

        text describing the standard steps in restoration and the known history 

        of the work of art itself </p>

      <p class="normal">the Tzarskoe Selo Amber Workshop offered its assistance 

        in visually documenting the process. </p>

      <h1>Web site development</h1>

      <p class="normal">The web site needed to run trouble-free on as many browsers 

        and platforms as possible, so versions suitable both for users with Flash 

        plug-in and not having it were created. Advanced version included the 

        features and plug-in content. The site was designed to work with the major 

        browsers version 4 and above. The web site was compiled from the source 

        databases. </p>

      <p class="normal">The database was used to manage all the data for the system 

        - text, images, and design data. The database and system structure continually 

        developed as the project progressed and particularly as new materials 

        were added. In addition to the object and contextual information, a variety 

        of extra features were added to make the system more entertaining and 

        informative to the userÂ - jigsaw puzzle, search engine, feedback 

        form, and an audio sample on the first page. </p>

      <h2>1. Overall structure of the web site</h2>

      <p class="normal">The structure of the web site is built to ensure its ease 

        of use. Basically it has two-level structure. It is constructed in the 

        way that ensures explaining the research and reconstruction process that 

        resulted in the restoration of this outstanding monument. It contained

        Fig.1. The Visitor Information section of the Web site</p>

      <p class="normal">To simplify and accelerate the process of web site development 

        the CTORSTUDIO&#39;s &#39;WebNavigation&#39; technology was used to provide 

        optimal way of logical and representation structure definition. Separating 

        process of content delivery from logical structure definition and HTML 

        template design and coding it provided a simple way to change some portions 

        of the web site. It was especially important for updating dynamic part 

        of content and images. </p>

      <h2>2. Navigation</h2>

      <p class="normal">Though contextual links and cross-referencing help visitors 

        to navigate, navigation of the project combines two paradigms: linear 

        and nonlinear (M. Douma, 2000). Linear navigation is used only on the 

        3<sup>rd</sup> level; two first levels are subjects of nonlinear navigation. 

        To enhance visitors&#39;Â experience the menu of the web site was made 

        as a dynamic one. The visitor uses a menu as he clicks on the section 

        and underlying sub-sections are displayed using Macromedia Shockwave (or 

        Flash). This enables transparency of navigation. As for image navigation 

        on the pages, it allows the visitor to view many images and magnify them. 

        One of the most dynamic sections is the section of the site is &#34;the 

        work to reconstruct the Amber Room since 1999&#34; page, which provides 

        users with a sort of virtual journal of the ongoing progress of the project. 

        It contains scanned watercolor images of all walls, which could be archived 

        for further documentation of the project. The reconstructed amber panels 

        and Florentine mosaic are filled with color, those being in progress are 

        black-and-white (fig.2). To facilitate the efficient maintenance and expansion 

        with a minimal amount of additional markup a special template was made. 

        These interactive online materials contributed the popularity of the project. 

      </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><a href="bogomazovafig2.html" name="fig2"><img src="bogomazova_Bogomazova_fig2_thumb.jpg" width="259" height="241" border="0" alt="The Eastern wall of the Amber Room with numbers of panels and display of reconstructed fragments."/></a><br/>

        Fig.2. The Eastern wall of the Amber Room with numbers of panels and display 

        of reconstructed fragments.</p>

      <p class="normal">To walk through reconstruction process exploring its key 

        stages and see it directly on the panels being restored a special template 

        for pipeline photo galleries was also made. Its methodology was designed 

        to expand the visitor&#39;s context for the reconstruction by highlighting 

        items such as color and molded standards, technology of working process 

        (four stages), and the methods of processing amber including flat assembling, 

        profile composite carving, figured carving, and internal engraving (intalia). 

        Photo galleries of images can be viewed in sequence, both thumbnails and 

        magnified ones. This creates an effect of a &#39;pipeline&#39; or viewing 

        conveyor, allowing details of each image to be directly compared. When 

        the visitor points their cursor at a region, a floating description is 

        displayed next to the cursor (fig 3.). </p>

      <h3>3. Design issues</h3>

      <p class="normal">Sites that target a multicultural audience and should have 

        an international appeal must meet audience expectation of performance 

        art and be aesthetically appealing, especially if the web site is dedicated 

        to a famous art object. </p>

      <p class="normal">The design of the home page was put out to tender among 

        6 designers, who finally presented 16Â variants of design with 21Â variations. 

        As a result of voting in the museum, a basic variant was selected and 

        then turned into dynamic script for Macromedia flash, representing in 

        a visual form all stages of amber processing during reconstruction. Final 

        image in the script serves as a front pages for users having no appropriate 

        plug-in. (fig.4) </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><a href="bogomazovafig4.html" name="fig4"><img src="bogomazova_Bogomazova_fig4_thumb.jpg" width="251" height="171" border="0" alt="The front page of the Amber Room web site."/></a><br/>

      <h2>4. Jigsaw Puzzle </h2>

      <p class="normal">In the jigsaw puzzle section of the site visitors are invited 

        to engage in simulating of their own reconstruction process, piecing together 

        fragments of the mosaic &#34;Touch and Smell&#34;. A customized template 

        for jigsaw puzzle was developed using Macromedia Flash software. In comparison 

        with the same kind of games, made with Java or JavaScript, it features 

        great presentation capabilities along with the necessary functionality 

        and lightweight end-user backend. </p>

      <p class="normal">In this jigsaw puzzle a mosaic panel is split into 49 pieces, 

        while the real mosaic consists of more than 800 pieces. Pi<span class="Normal">eces 

        can be moved, rotated, if a piece matches its position, it will add on 

        to the puzzle. A &#39;Hint&#39; function allows players to look at the 

        assembled mosaic. The number of times you may use &#39;Hint&#39; is 

        limited to five. &#39;Mix&#39; causes the pieces of the mosaic to be 

        randomly placed ready to put back together. &#39;Assemble&#39; causes 

        the jigsaw puzzle to be assembled automatically. &#39;Help&#39; provides 

        detailed instruction how to play (fig.5) </span></p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> During game the user should acquire the following 

          knowledge and skills: </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> To understand what are distinctive feature of the 

          Florentine mosaic </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> To remember how the mosaic panel &#34;Touch and Smell&#34; 

          looks like </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> To develop spatial thinking </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> To develop attentiveness </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> To get skills in assembling jigsaw puzzles</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="normal">This creative element serves as a power in the visitor remembering 

        and learning through experience. The puzzle should carry out not only 

        entertaining, but also educational functions. Therefore algorithm of action 

        of puzzle is designed by a principle &#34;from simple - to complex&#34;.

      <h2>Specific Technologies</h2>

      <p class="normal">There were 2 main technologies used during this web site 

        creation: </p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> CTORStudio&#39;s WebNavigation </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Macromedia Flash </span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="normal">WebNavigation allows us to simplify and speed up the process 

        of web site creation by providing a rapid way of defining logical and 

        display structure. It allows dynamic definition and redefinition of the 

        logical structure and templates used on a site. By separating the process 

        of the content delivery from the logical structure definition and HTML-templates 

        design and coding, it can provide a simple way to change some portions 

        of the website without additional work. This is especially helpful during 

        the dynamic site updates. </p>

      <p class="normal">WebNavigation used on &#34;The Amber Room&#34; website 

        is upgraded with additional modules that customize the site behavior relying 

        on a user browser capabilities. e.g., if a user doesn&#39;t have a Macromedia 

        Flash plugin 4.0+ installed on his computer, an equivalent version without 

        Flash add-ons will be loaded, with a small lack of presentation but none 

        in functionality (fig.6). </p>

      <p class="normal">The architecture of the WebNavigation is shown in fig.6. 

      </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="bogomazova_Bogomazova_fig6.gif" width="500" height="358" alt="The architecture of the WebNavigation"/><br/>

        Fig. 6 The architecture of the WebNavigation</p>

      <p class="normal">At first, the user generates a request for a specific page. 

        This page does not exist as a static object on a server, so web server 

        forwards the request to the WebNavigation (control flow #1). WebNavigation 

        analyses the forwarded request and chooses a presentation template to 

        be used (control flow #2) and the content to be delivered (control flow 

        #3). The template can contain presentation information, such a design 

        used on a page, and navigation linking information, such as information 

        about where and how the navigation links should be inserted. Content can 

        be handled either as a static data or asÂ dynamic requests from the 

        external data sources, such a database. </p>

      <p class="normal">After these steps, template and content are combined together 

        using special commands, inserted in the template and forwarded to the 

        web server (control flow #4) in case of adding special information, such 

        HTTP headers, or performing additional processing for this page (thus 

        can be applying XSL stylesheet to an XML data, for example). The final 

        generated page with the according HTTP headers and other information is 

        delivered to the user. </p>

      <p class="normal">As it was mentioned above, Macromedia Flash was used to 

        create the &#34;Florence mosaic: Touch and Smell&#34; jigsaw puzzle 

        online game. Also Flash was used by its presentation capabilities to give 

        the end user attractive visual effects. </p>

      <h1>Evaluation</h1>

      <p class="normal">Estimation of the efficiency of the web solution and concept 

        will include: </p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Estimation of total visitation with the help of statistical 

          program allowing to analyze efficiency of usability and uploading functions 

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> The analysis of on-line surveys located on the web 

          site of the Tzarskoe Selo Museum Reserve web site (<a href="http://eng.tzar.ru/guestbook/brief_survey">http://eng.tzar.ru/guestbook/brief_survey</a>). 

          Its Russian version is more</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> complete and is designed as a sociological survey 

          study of on-line visitors capturing information about personal relevance, 

          learning outcomes, credibility, etc. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Estimation of returns to the web site </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> The analysis of the responses and electronic letters.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">A sophisticated evaluation model upon finalizing the 

          project will include a special survey study, where both descriptive 

          and explanatory findings will be noted. </span></li>

      </ul>

      <h1>Conclusions</h1>

      <p class="normal">We have presented the solution that we have provided in 

        web site for the Amber Room web site. The project combines multimedia 

        and cutting edge technology with well-prepared and well-managed content 

        for a global audience, which allows to capture information about ongoing 

        reconstruction process and provide both documentation and interpretation/diffusion 

        features. It deals with cultural and historical implications of current 

        day of the famous monument, enabled through communication between the 

        Museum and its audience. The project which is still in progress, strongly 

        supports museum mission and helps to promote the Tzarskoe Selo Amber Workshop 

        as a center for excellence carrying out restoration and conservation of 

        objects from amber. </p>
