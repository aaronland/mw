      <p class="PaperTitle">Co-operation Metaphors for Virtual Museums</p>

      <p class="PaperTitle"> </p>

      <p class="Author">Thimoty Barbieri, Paolo Paolini, Dept. of Electronics and 

        Computer Science, Politecnico di Milano, Italy</p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">Cooperation Metaphors are sets of rules to support 

        interaction and collaboration between users who want to explore complex 

        content and information together. The rules determine how the collaborative 

        community can be created and managed, how members of the community can 

        operate on their own or can cooperate with other members. Different types 

        of situations, tasks and user roles determine different behaviours and 

        therefore need different metaphors. The paper will present the general 

        issue, describing in general what cooperation metaphors are and how they 

        can be defined. A number of examples, related to typical activities for 

        virtual museums (i.e. museums on the Web) will be used in order to give 

        a practical understanding of what cooperation is, or can be. The paper 

        will also argue that virtual metaphors lack some of the features of real-life 

        cooperation, but, on the other hand, can also offer unexpected, powerful 

        and effective possibilities not available in (traditional) real-life. 

        Finally, the paper will describe how collaborative activities for virtual 

        museums can be implemented using today&#39;s tools and applications for collaboration 

        on the Web; such as Net2gether, Microsoft Research&#39;s Virtual Worlds, and 

        the WebTalk series. </p>

      <h1>Introduction and Motivations </h1>

      <p class="normal">In most cases, users today access the shared space represented 

        by a web site in isolation, with little awareness, or no awareness at 

        all, of what other users are doing &#34;at the same time&#34;. In a truly cooperative 

        environment, by contrast, different users try to accomplish something 

        together, accessing the shared space simultaneously and trying to collaborate 

        to reach their goal. Several different go<span class="Normal">als may 

        be the subject of cooperation: teaching/learning, shopping, design, supervising 

        and monitoring, consulting, etc. Several different behaviours are associated 

        with the notion of cooperation, but we should distinguish between two 

        extremes: </span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">the cooperating users are peers, with similar 

          knowledge and similar powers. </span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">one or more of the users control the situation, 

          with knowledge or powers superior to those of the others, as for example 

          tutors with pupils, shop-clerks and shoppers, tourist guides and tourists, 

          etc.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">One basic observation informing our 

        work is that in the real world most activities are performed, if possible, 

        in cooperation</span>. Cooperating while trying to accomplish something 

        very often appears more interesting, more engaging, more amusing or simply 

        more efficient,</p>

      <p class="normal">This initial observation is coupled with the fact that virtual 

        shared environments have existed for a number of years. Initially they 

        were text-based (IRC-II, MUDs, MOOs), allowing users to exchange typed 

        messages, but they have evolved (Blaxxun Community, Virtual Worlds) introducing 

        3D graphics, audio, and other advanced features. In these &#34;virtual worlds&#34;, 

        as they are usually called, users are represented by virtual objects, 

        called &#34;avatars&#34;; users can &#34;move around&#34;, cooperatively interact with 

        the virtual world and its objects, &#34;talk&#34; each other, etc. </p>

      <p class="normal">These worlds allow a great deal of interaction among users, 

        but they lack some of the features that we feel are crucial for an effective 

        collaborative visit to a Virtual Museum: </p>

      <p class="normal">User interaction seems to be the goal, rather than the means 

        to accomplish something. Users amuse themselves by interacting, but they 

        are not trying to get any specific result out of their experience. Visitors 

        to a Virtual Museum, on the other hand, share the goal of better understanding 

        the content and the background of the museum.</p>

      <p class="normal">The amount of information being exchanged among users, or 

        being made available by the world, is relatively small and loosely organized. 

        Sophisticated museum sites by contrast convey a large body of sometimes 

        very difficult knowledge.</p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">The cooperation is loose, in the sense 

        that users are free to behave as they want, with few constraints or enforced 

        patterns. Our experience, however, shows that cooperation must be organized 

        and follow precise guidelines in order to be effective.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">Based on this we have been working 

        on the following ideas since 1998:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Access to a complex museum Website can be made 

          more interesting, engaging and efficient by allowing a certain degree 

          of cooperation among the users accessing the site at the same time.</span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">The cooperation must follow well organized guidelines, 

          in order to be effective at reaching a specific goal (it could be learning, 

          or shopping, etc.). </span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">A 3D virtual world, with avatars representing 

          users &#34;being there&#34;, can be an interesting space for an efficient and 

          engaging cooperation.</span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">The information directly represented in the 

          cooperation space (the 3D world) can&#39;t reproduce all the information 

          of the Web site - the object of cooperation. Too much information, in 

          fact, will clutter the cooperation space, making it less useful and 

          effective. </span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">The cooperation space must offer enough information 

          to allow the user to locate and find the objects on the Web site; once 

          the parts of interest are located, there must be gateways allowing the 

          user to &#34;pass&#34; to the selected portion of the Web site.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">With the above prerequisites, a development 

        environment, WebTalk-I (WebTalk, Barbieri, 1999) was developed and </span>a 

        few applications were developed. The best known of these applications 

        was developed for the Museum of Science and Technology of Milan. The application, 

        named &#34;Virtual Leonardo&#34; (Paolini, 1999), allowed users to co-operate 

        while accessing a site with a number of pages describing different machines 

        invented (designed but never built) by Leonardo da Vinci. Virtual Leonardo 

        was presented in previous editions of Museums and the Web. </p>

      <p class="normal">Virtual Leonardo allows users to visit the museum together, 

        exchange opinions, and interact with the world and with each other in 

        a number of ways: interactive gateways allow the users to visit the pages 

        of the Website though standard Web technology.</p>

      <p class="normal">Our experience with Virtual Leonardo, reinforced after collecting 

        usage data and impressions from the users (Barbieri 2000), convinced us 

        of the necessity to support the creation of such collaborative environments 

        with a theory of design patterns. These are the subject of this paper.</p>

      <h1>Designing for Collaboration</h1>

      <p class="normal">Within a cooperative environment the goal, for a user, is 

        to accomplish something specific (e.g. to get work done, to learn something, 

        to buy something, etc.) through cooperating with other users. The other 

        users can be at the same level of knowledge and power, or can be more 

        expert and/or have greater control over the application. A number of visitors 

        in a museum, for example, can be at a comparable level, while a museum 

        guide is a user with more expertise and with the power to &#34;take&#34; the group 

        of visitors around.</p>

      <p class="normal">When the users interact with each other, they follow patterns 

        of interaction that we call &#34;cooperation metaphors&#34;. The goal of this 

        section is to analyze the general features that cooperation metaphors 

        must satisfy, in order to be effective, and at the same time engaging 

        and compelling. The discussion that follows is based upon literature and 

        our experience gained with WebTalk-I (Barbieri, 1999) and the deployment 

        of applications.</p>

      <p class="normal">First of all, in a cooperation environment, it is important 

        that all actors share the notion of a common state, bound within time 

        and space. The intensity with which this feeling is conveyed to all users 

        determines the level of awareness (Gutwin, 1997) within the environment. 

        The higher the awareness of the shared state, the better the cooperation 

        between users: thus awareness is the primary effect we must create to 

        allow users to work and discuss together. In a virtual space described 

        in three dimensions, users can experience perceptual stimuli that are 

        more similar to everyday life. By processing and understanding these stimuli, 

        they can interact with the environment and the other actors, increasing 

        their awareness, and creating in turn new stimuli for the others. In a 

        collaborative system, this leads to the phenomenon of <i>prediction</i>; 

        that is, participants can anticipate, within a short time, the actions 

        of the others, because the number of informational details they have regarding 

        the space and time they share with others (in one word, their awareness 

        of the system) can lead them to such conclusions. (In this respect, for 

        example, the &#34;slow motion&#34; of avatars in a 3D space can be more effective 

        than fast motion or jumps, since the other users can better predict where 

        an avatar is going if it is moving around slowly). Other important consequences 

        of awareness are the possibility of learning indirectly from other people&#39;s 

        activity, or of gathering information from the state or behaviour of the 

        artefact in the shared environments, or the possibility of using gesturing 

        or indirect communication forms to support one&#39;s communication (e.g. &#34;Follow 

        me this way&#34;, &#34;Take this..&#34;, etc.) when coordinating multiple 

        actions for which more users are needed.</p>

      <p class="normal">The problem in conveying the correct form of awareness is 

        often application-related, meaning that not all kinds of collaborative 

        information are always needed to perform a task within a determined environment. 

        That is why before deploying a collaborative system it is important to 

        design in advance the means by which information will be presented in 

        three-dimensions (<i>Spatial Patterns</i>), and to determine precisely 

        the rules by which users are able to cooperate with each other, and with 

        the environment, and to enhance their awareness during their activity. 

        We call this set of rules <i>cooperation metaphors</i>.</p>

      <p class="normal">In our vision, a <i>cooperation metaphor</i> (Barbieri, 

        2000) is a set of <i>basic rules</i> that describe the different modalities 

        of interaction between users and between users and their environment. 

        These rules encompass various aspects, such as the way users can gather 

        in groups to talk to each other or navigate virtual space, or how visualization 

        of the state of the artefacts and of the avatars (the <i>figurines</i> 

        which represent the current position of each user in space) is to be performed. 

        By making decisions about all these aspects, it is possible to define 

        a <i>global description </i>(a metaphor) of the possible forms of collaboration 

        of users within a system. In the following section, we present an abridged 

        list of these small rules, which can be freely selected to form any metaphor 

        that is felt suitable to regulate collaboration within a certain application.</p>

      <p class="normal">In addition, the design of the application also calls for 

        deciding which <i>spatial patterns</i> are to be followed. Such decisions 

        include whether the world will be represented in an abstract way or by 

        mimicking reality in a simplified way (Bridges and Charitos, 1997, Benford 

        and Snowdon, Hearst, and Karadi 97). Moreover, we must decide how to represent, 

        in a consistent fashion, important visual elements that aid the navigation 

        in space of the users, such as <i>places </i>(Cerulli, 1999), <i>thresholds</i> 

        between one space and the other, <i>landmarks</i> to assist users in finding 

        their own routes within the space (Charitos and Rutherford, 1997), <i>spatial 

        hyperlinks</i> to jump from one point of the space to another (Campbell, 

        1996, Charitos, 96), and so forth. We will not investigate this complex 

        issue in detail in the present paper.</p>

      <p class="normal">Our (limited) experience in designing cooperative applications 

        has shown that although the basic cooperation metaphors are the same, 

        the way to actually implement them or to assemble them, changes from application 

        to application. The role of the designer of a collaborative environment, 

        therefore, is not solely limited to gathering contents and drawing 3D 

        geometries, but includes conceiving a consistent pattern of cooperation 

        metaphors suitable for the different application situations; the designers, 

        in other words, must describe the rules for the collaboration between 

        users.</p>

      <p class="normal">A generic package for supporting cooperation over the Web, 

        therefore, must not provide a fixed set of cooperation metaphors, but 

        rather must present the designers with a vast range of possibilities that 

        can be selected and tuned to the specific needs of the application. This 

        functionality is lacking in all the Virtual Communities tools available 

        today, and that is why we are designing WebTalk-II, a collaborative environment 

        where powerful cooperation metaphors can be combined and tuned at will.</p>

      <h1>Cooperation Metaphors for Virtual Museums</h1>

      <p class="normal">With some oversimplification, we may state that collaboration 

        can be represented with two visualization paradigms corresponding to 2D 

        and 3D representations. While both representations are in fact two-dimensional, 

        since the visualization field is a &#39;flat&#39; computer screen, the main difference 

        between the two is that the first visualization paradigm causes the users 

        to think in term of flat geometric elements and flat structures (windows, 

        icons in windows, buttons laid in a bidimensional grid...), while the 

        3D paradigm utilizes perspectival projection to convey a sense of spatiality 

        and immersion. Very often this paradigm takes advantage of a subjective 

        view; that is, the users infer position in space by viewing a perspective 

        representation of immediate surroundings, but without the ability to see 

        themselves (exactly as in Real Reality). This is usually the approach 

        taken in gaming and web-oriented virtual reality. In high-end virtual 

        reality systems that make use of complicated devices such as gloves and 

        head-mounted displays, there is an effort to convey much more immersion 

        to the user, by tricking the human eye into seeing depth and space in 

        a synthetic computer generated scene.</p>

      <p class="normal">Most of the collaboration patterns can be implemented in 

        either 2D or 3D. In 3D, however, it is possible to conceive a set of collaborative 

        situations that are impossible to represent in 2D, and which can convey 

        a very heightened mutual awareness. In the following we will list the 

        most important collaborative elements, and we specify how they could be 

        implemented in 2D or 3D. For some of these cooperation patterns, it is 

        possible to describe situations that have no match in reality, but can 

        be effectively used for the purposes of particular applications. We will 

        point out some of these cases.</p>

      <p class="normal">At the end of this survey, we will describe sample scenarios 

        with which these collaborative sets can be composed into collaborative 

        behavioural patterns to support a virtual museum application, by using 

        commercial or research tools available today.</p>

      <h1>Distribution of the Shared State</h1>

      <p class="normal">A shared state is a collection of information about the 

        status <span class="Normal">of each participant in the application. In 

        3D environments, it could be the avatar position and its movement or idle 

        state, or the status of a shared resource, like the writing on a collaborative 

        whiteboard. Each user can participate or be isolated from the shared state 

        (and in this last case, it cannot be part of the collaboration mechanisms). 

        The sharing of the state works on two levels:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Sharing Space: </b>All the modifications 

          in space are shared (movements, changes in the bounding environment)</span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Sharing Time: </b>The unit with which time 

          passes, and current time and speed of the animation, are common between 

          the users.<br/>

          It is possible for users to cooperate in a common environment only if 

          they share the same notion of space and time.</span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Integral Sharing: </b>All users within the 

          system or the application share the same events. All of them thus have 

          the same notion of the environment at a given moment.</span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Group Sharing: </b>The shared state can be 

          partitioned in sub-groups; that is, several parallel different states 

          can exist for the same environment. Each participant can belong only 

          to one of the state partitions at a time.<b></b></span></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Mutual Exclusions</h2>

      <p class="normal">If space and time sharing are not enabled simultaneously, 

        it is not possible to support collaboration. If space and time sharing 

        are enabled, an Integral or Group sharing mode has to be specified. If 

        Integral sharing is used, it is not possible to enable Group sharing and 

        viceversa.</p>

      <h2>Enhancement of these collaborative patterns over reality</h2>

      <p class="normal">The possibility of creating applications in which time is 

        counted differently between users, or in which for a same environment 

        there exist several possible states at the same time, has no counterpart 

        in real reality. The first option can be used to let users experiment 

        with artefacts or situations with different speed and timings. The second 

        option is interesting to create multi-path situations in which different 

        choices give rise to different events. An application could model this 

        line of thinking and supply the users with an original way to experiment 

        with this, using Group Sharing.</p>

      <h1>Grouping Mechanism</h1>

      <p class="normal">Grouping mechanisms refer to rules set to the management 

        of user groups. Groups are a means tocluster users by interest or activity; 

        each group shares particular cooperation elements, and behaves following 

        a common pattern. Each group has to be identified by a unique name, so 

        for example a group created to discuss Modern Painting following a renowned 

        critic may be entitled &#34;ModernArtCritique&#34;, while a group designed 

        for f<span class="Normal">ree browsing around the museum resources can 

        be called &#34;StrollingAroundTheMuseum&#34;. Group management is handled 

        by the following four subcategories.</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Group Creation: rules how groups can be formed 

          within the system</span> 

          <ul>

            <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Dynamic: </b>it is permissible to create 

              a new group, with no restrictions. The user that requests the creation 

              of the new group is called the <i>owner</i> or <i>creator</i> of 

              the group. </span></li>

            <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Fixed: </b>the designer of the collaborative 

              environment prepares in advance different groups with different 

              names (as at pre-arranged thematic conferences, for example). The 

              <i>owner</i> is the designer himself or any user that can be determined 

              by a pre-arranged password (see <i>Leadership Management</i>).</span></li>

          </ul>

        </li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Group Protection: defines how a group can be 

          entered by a user</span> 

          <ul>

            <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Free: </b>any user can join the group 

              at leisure.</span></li>

            <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Password: </b>the user can join only 

              if he knows the related password.</span></li>

            <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Fixed Quota: </b>the user can join only 

              if the current number of users in the group does not exceed the 

              maximum number requested by the designer of the application</span></li>

            <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Banning: </b>it is possible to attach 

              to the group a list of particular users who cannot join the group 

              under any conditions (they are banned).</span></li>

          </ul>

        </li>

      </ul>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal"><b>Kicking: </b>other users are allowed 

        to force a user out of the current group. Usually this operation is tied 

        to some kind of privileged status.</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Group Disbanding: defines a criterion by which 

          a group has to be disbanded.</span> 

          <ul>

            <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Persistent: </b>the group remains active 

              and joinable even if no users are participating to this group.</span></li>

            <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Dynamic: </b>the group and all its rules 

              are destroyed when the last user leaves.</span></li>

            <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Forced: </b>a particular user can force 

              the disbanding of the group, scattering all its current participants. 

              This can happen only if there is the availability of a free group 

              to host all dispersed participants (usually called <i>global</i>).</span></li>

          </ul>

        </li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Leadership Management: in many collaborative 

          situations the users do not cooperate on the same level, but one or 

          more participants may have special abilities (they lead the way, or 

          they show an object, or are the only participants enabled to talk). 

          <i>Leadership</i> models a particular privilege within the collaboration, 

          and the mechanism by which leadership is acquired and passed on has 

          to be specified. </span> 

          <ul>

            <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Forbidden: </b>once leadership is acquired, 

              it cannot be passed on.</span></li>

            <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Password Protected: </b>leadership can 

              be acquired by providing the proper password.</span></li>

            <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Op-Passing: </b>a user who holds leadership 

              can yield it to another user in the group.</span></li>

            <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Inheritance</b>: users with leadership 

              can grant leadership to one or more other users, without yielding 

              their own leadership.</span></li>

            <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Tokenized: </b>leadership is a token 

              that can be acquired by the first user who requests it. There are 

              as many leaders as leadership tokens available. For someone to acquire 

              leadership, a token must be available. Users with leadership can 

              yield leadership, thereby freeing a token.</span></li>

            <li> <span class="Normal"><b>Creation Based: </b>in free group formation 

              mode, leadership is automatically granted to the user who creates 

              a new free group.<b></b></span></li>

          </ul>

        </li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Mutual Exclusions</h2>

      <p class="normal">A group can be either dynamic or fixed. Similarly, it can 

        be either free or password protected, but both types can have a fixed 

        quota, banning and kicking. Only one type of disbanding can be specified. 

        Leadership management can be defined by using more elements at a time; 

        that is, leadership can be Creation Based and Forbidden, or Creation Based 

        and Tokenized. Some of the management elements cannot be used together, 

        e.g. leadership cannot be Tokenized and Inherited.</p>

      <h2>Enhancement of these collaborative patterns over reality</h2>

      <p class="normal">Group collaboration in real reality is usually described 

        by a Creation Based, Forbidden leadership pattern, with a fixed/fixed 

        quota group creation and dynamic disbanding. There is no complex notion 

        of leadership management in real groups. In virtual collaboration, leadership 

        can be spread over the group and be used to control enhanced collaboration 

        facilities. (See for example visualization and view-point shifting capabilities).</p>

      <h1>Information Flow</h1>

      <p class="normal">Information flow rules can be attached to any other cooperation 

        element to specify which are th<span class="Normal">e directions and modalities 

        in which information can be transmitted during collaboration.</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Pull: information transmits from the information 

          provider to the information consumer because the consumer explicitly 

          asks the provider for a piece of information (<i>pulls</i> information 

          from the provider).</span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Push: information transmits from provider to 

          consumer, because the provider explicitly publishes new information 

          for the consumer.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Mutual Exclusions</h2>

      <p class="normal">Push and Pull modalities can be used simultaneously. For 

        example, a textual message or information item can be pulled or pushed, 

        even if usually the message text is pushed to the user when new messages 

        are incoming (as phone calls are pushed to your cell phone). Push and 

        pull are particularly effective in visualization, where it can be decided 

        if one user wants to see from the point of view (through the eyes) of 

        another user, or conversely if one user wants to force other users to 

        see what he sees (pushing his view onto others). Moreover, it could be 

        possible to push one&#39;s position to others, to force other users to determined 

        positions in the virtual space, and so on.</p>

      <h2>Enhancement of these collaborative patterns over reality</h2>

      <p class="normal">Push and pull are in general common modalities for textual 

        and vocal communication, but are uniquely an achievement of virtuality 

        when it comes to visualization and physical position.</p>

      <h1>Visualization</h1>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Personal View: </span><span class="Normal">the 

          kind of visualization each user has of the environment in which he is

      </ul>

      <h2>Mutual Exclusions</h2>

      <p class="normal">Personal views can all be used, or forbidden for particular 

        application-related reasons. However, only one kind of view at a time 

        is possible. Scene views are all mutual exclusive.</p>

      <h2>Enhancement of these collaborative patterns</h2>

      <p class="normal">Visualization elements strongly enhance the daily experience 

        of collaboration in reality. In virtual realities it is possible to see 

        oneself acting, or to incarnate other users by seeing from their eyes. 

        This yields enormous gaming, demonstration and collaboration potential.</p>

      <h1>Movement</h1>

      <p class="normal">Specifies which kind of movements are allowed to users in

      <h2>Enhancement of these collaborative patterns</h2>

      <p class="normal">The usual pattern in reality is normal walking in contiguous 

        ranges of time and space. In virtuality the possibility of hyperjumping, 

        not present in reality, enables a more effective collaboration.</p>

      <h1>Self-Representation</h1>

      <p class="normal">Self representation describes the means by which the particular 

        state of the user can be represented. These elements can be enabled or

        <li> <span class="Normal">Emoticons: </span><span class="Normal"><i>emoticons</i> 

          are short sentences or adjectives, often coupled with symbols, drawings 

          or animations, that represent the emotional state and feelings of the 

          user. They are used to better convey a meaning, and thus enhance cooperation. 

          Example are: *smiles, *shrugs, *whistles, *frowns, *yawns, *blows a 

          kiss, *strikes a pose, etc. etc.</span></li>

          etc. (The ICQ)</span><span class="Normal"></span></li>

      </ul>

      <h1>Text-based Communication</h1>

      <p class="normal">In most virtual environments, the most effective mean of 

        communication is still text based: users type in what they want to say 

        to other users, and read the answers. Some environments also offer vocal 

        communication, and there is a pattern about governing vocal communication 

        that we will not discuss here. Still, it is hard to operate in a 3D synthetic 

        environment and<span class="Normal"> talk. For a number of reasons, typing 

        is still the favored method at the moment.</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Free: everybody can talk to all users in all

        <li> <span class="Normal">Whisper: one user talks directly to another 

          user, without being heard by the rest of the group</span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Private: one user establishes a permanent talking</span>

      <p class="normal">Free mode, Group and Group Restricted are in mutual exclusion. 

        The rest of the elements can be used in combination with these first three.</p>

      <h2>Enhancement of these collaborative patterns</h2>

      <p class="normal">These elements model how talking can happen in real collaboration 

        sessions; however, multiple whisper and group restricted elements may 

        be harder to enforce in reality than they are in virtuality. </p>

      <h1>Using tools and metaphors for creating collaborative museums</h1>

      <p class="normal">We will now present a short survey of some software tools 

        that enable us to create collaborative virtual environments for museums, 

        commenting on how they can be used to enforce collaboration metaphors 

        in the ways we presented them. Some of these are strictly 3D Virtual Environments 

        (Zyda and Singhal 99), which strive to present a perspectival representation 

        of the environment in which all participants are immersed. Others simply 

        provide users with a way to collaborate over the Internet with usual 2D 

        metaphors. Still, they can be usefully employed for museum applications, 

        and they do use some of the cooperation elements we mentioned earlier.</p>

      <h1>WebTalk-I </h1>

      <p class="normal">WebTalk-I (see papers in previous M&amp;W conferences,(Barbieri 

        2000. T. Barbieri 99)) allows you to draw a 3D environment that represents 

        a virtual exhibition, and publish it on the web. Users that connect to 

        the web page are presented with the 3D representation and can navigate 

        in it together with others, seeing the other users and chatting with<span class="Normal"> 

        them.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">There are two co-peration metaphors, 

        fixed and imposed by the framework:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Free Visit to the Museum </span> 

          <ul>

            <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Groups can be created and 

              disbanded dynamically, and they allow free access. It is thus possible 

              for users just to form their own groups, or join any group, and 

              start visiting the museum freely, like in reality. Text communication 

              is grouped, and there is a whisper mechanism. Movement can be by 

              walking, flying, and zone jumping to important spots of the museum. 

              Visualization allowed is Normal.</span></li>

          </ul>

        </li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Guided Tour of the Museum </span> 

          <ul>

            <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Leadership in groups is tokenized, 

              so any participant can acquire it and become a <i>Tour Guide</i>. 

              In this metaphor, other participants can follow the one who acquired 

              leadership, and <i>pull</i> inside their point of view what the 

              guide is looking at (in simple words, seeing from the eyes of the 

              guide), using the External Avatar visualization mode. This enables 

              us to make very interesting virtual guided tours inside the virtual 

              museum.</span></li>

          </ul>

      <h1>WebTalk-II</h1>

      <p class="normal">The goal of the WebTalk-II framework is to provide an environment 

        in which it is possible to design and deploy 3D collaborative environments, 

        acting as a way to improve the access to &#34;traditional&#34; Web sites. There 

        is no assumption or constraint about the technology used to implement 

        the Web sites, nor any implication about the design &#34;philosophy&#34;. It is 

        clear, however, that well structured and well behaving Web sites, like 

        the ones that could be obtained using a proper design methodology (HDM 

        and W2000, Rohel, 1997, Bochicchio and Paolini, 1998, Bochicchio and Paolini, 

        1999, Garzotto, 2001), are targets of specific interest. In addition, 

        there is the further requirement that WebTalk-II must be able to interface 

        to Websites where pages are not statically defined, but dynamically generated 

        (it is in fact much easier to define gateways to a set of statically defined 

        pages, than to a set of pages with number and content dynamically defined), 

        according to user requests. The JWEB (Bochicchio et al 1999) environment 

        is one, of the many available, that does exactly this.</p>

      <p class="normal">Consider, for example, the need to coordinate access to 

        a number of pages, for a museum application. The user accesses an &#34;index 

        page&#34; that allows &#34;navigation&#34; to the item of interest. In a collaborative 

        environment, the equivalent of the index page is a 3D sub-space, where 

        the users move through visualizing &#34;gateways&#34; to the indexed pages. </p>

      <p class="normal">In &#34;Virtual Leonardo&#34; for example, the index is represented 

        by a virtual &#34;cloister&#34;, while each page is represented by a virtual room. 

        Each room, in turn, contains an exhibit that can be browsed in a collaborative 

        fashion with other participants.</p>

      <p class="normal">Unlike WebTalk-I where you can have only free groups and 

        pulled visualization from a privileged group user (to form a &#34;guided 

        tour group&#34; metaphor), WebTalk-II allows you to specify (for any 

        virtual exhibition one may design and implement), any possible combination 

        of the collaboration elements discussed earlier in the paper, choosing 

        the best way for people to work with each other given the particular nature 

        of the exhibition the virtual museum is proposing. In other words, you 

        can conceive any cooperation metaphor you like, assign it a name, and 

        specify its properties by enabling or disabling each of the collaboration 

        elements designed above.</p>

      <h1>Net2Gether</h1>

      <p class="normal">Net2Gether (<a href="http://www.n2g.com/" target="new">http://www.net2gether.com 

        </a>) is an interesting tool for 2D based collaboration over the Web. 

        It provides a chat window under the usual browser window. Chat is organized 

        in groups, and each group has a leader. The leader is able to push the 

        Web page being visited into the browsers of the other participants. It 

        is thus possible to &#39;share&#39; the 2D navigation of the museum Web site. 

        The tool also allows pre-recording of sequences of chat messages and of 

        navigation events within the site, and plays it remotely to the users. 

        In this way it is possible to create various exploration paths within 

        the exhibition proposed in the museum Web site.</p>

      <p class="normal">Since Net2Gether has<span class="Normal"> no notion of what 

        cooperation metaphors are, it is not possible to change the way users 

        collaborate. N2G metaphors are thus fixed. They can be classified as:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Guided Tour </span></li>

        <ul>

          <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Uses Dynamic group creation, 

            with free protection, and the possibility of banning and kicking. 

            Disbanding is dynamic as well. Leadership is creation based, and there 

            is an op-possing mechanism that allows other people to push web contents 

            to the group. It is interesting to note that leadership cannot be 

            inherited, as only one user must be able to push web contents to other 

            users. Movement and Visualization elements are not used, since the 

            environment is 2D. Text based communication is grouped and there are 

            mechanisms for whispering and private communication.</span></li>

        </ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Pre-Recorded Guided Tour </span></li>

      </ul>

      <ul>

        <ul>

          <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> In contrast with the Guided 

            Tour metaphor, this metaphor requires fixed groups, with a fixed number 

            of participants. The group is also persistent. Leadership management 

            is forbidden, since it is the system that does the pushing of the 

            content. Communication can be either Grouped or Group Restricted.</span></li>

        </ul>

      </ul>

      <h1>Microsoft Virtual Worlds</h1>

      <p class="normal">Microsoft Virtual Worlds (Microsoft Virtual Worlds) is an 

        authoring environment for creating 3D Collaborative Virtual Environments 

        (<a href="http://www.vworlds.org/" target="new">http://www.vworlds.org</a>). 

        Even if there is not an explicit way to model general Cooperation Metaphors 

        in the sense we described in this paper, Virtual Worlds provides t<span class="Normal">he 

        designer with a high degree of flexibility, allowing them to define, for 

        each object, sets of attributes and properties describing them. Some of 

        the most common cooperation metaphors in virtual museums deployed with 

        Virtual Worlds might be:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Free Visit </span> 

          <ul>

            <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Virtual Worlds does not directly 

              support the notion of groups, but divides users in <i>rooms</i>, 

              with the idea that only users in the same virtual room can talk 

              to each other, like in any real environment. So even if communications 

              can be considered Group based, the Groups are all predefined and 

              persistent. Movement can be done by free walk, zone jumping and 

              near jumping to another avatar. Visualization is extremely flexible, 

              and can be of Normal, Proximity, External, Bird&#39;s View type, at 

              the designer&#39;s will. It is possible to push and pull visualization 

              to any External Avatar. VW also has a well designed system of <i>Emoticons</i> 

              which allow users to express their feelings by modifying the posture 

              and expressions of their own avatar representation.</span></li>

          </ul>

        </li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Piloted Guided Tour </span> 

          <ul>

            <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Extends the Free Visit metaphor, 

              with the possibility of attaching a camera to a particular automated 

              Avatar which can play the role of a semi-intelligent and automated 

              virtual guide in the museum. The users can pull in the visualization 

              of this particular camera and enjoy the ride.</span></li>

          </ul>

        </li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Treasure Hunt </span> 

          <ul>

            <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Virtual Worlds augments collaboration 

              by using the notion of ownership of objects (abridged from the brief 

              sketch of collaborative elements presented in this paper). It is 

              possible for users to take objects from the worlds, giving rise 

              to the possibility of organizing collaborative games or activities 

              like &#39;<i>treasure hunts&#39;</i>, where the guide invites the participants 

              to look for a particular object in the museum, mixing entertainment 

              with education.</span></li>

      <h1>Conclusions and Future Work</h1>

      <p class="normal">The main point of this paper is that for a large range of 

        applications, cooperation among users while visiting a web site is a very 

        important improvement over current practices. Museum app<span class="Normal">lications 

        belong to this class for a number of reasons:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">They support a (potentially very) large body 

          of knowledge</span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">The users have strong motivations to try to 

          get the most out of their &#34;virtual visit&#34;</span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Exchanging knowledge, comments and ideas with 

          other people is an inherent part of an effective (and amusing) visit 

          to a real museum. Why should it not be the same for virtual museums?</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">We have started analyzing the different 

        components for </span>making cooperation effective, recognizing that different 

        situations require different organizations and different actions for cooperation. 

        We have used the name &#34;cooperation metaphors&#34; to identify different cooperation 

        solutions. Also, we have reviewed a number of tools, from the market or 

        our own, in the light of the needs of implementing sophisticated cooperation 

        metaphors.</p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">In the future we will work in the following 

        directions:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Building new museum (and non-museum) collaborative 

          applications, in order to gain further understanding of the key issues.</span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Conducting theoretical and empirical research 

          about the primitives making up effective cooperation metaphors, trying 

          to obtain a more comprehensive list of elementary possibilities and 

          a more complete set of ways of organizing them.</span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Investigating the correlation between visual 

          representations and cooperation metaphors.</span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Completing the development of WebTalk-II, while, 

          at the same time, keeping a close eye on industrial solutions offered 

          by the market.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">Among other application areas, (virtual) 

        museu</span>ms remain our favorite area of application for these general 

        ideas.</p>
