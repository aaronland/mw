      <p class="PaperTitle"><i>Art Tales:</i><i> </i>A Story of Collaboration and 

        Integration</p>

      <p class="Author">Tom Albertsen, The Community Discovered, and Ponteir Sackrey, 

        National Museum of Wildlife Art, USA</p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">The Community Discovered Project, <u><a href="http://www.communitydisc.wst.esu3.k12.ne.us/" target="new">www.communitydisc.wst.esu3.k12.ne.us</a></u>, 

        in its fifth and final year, links technology and the arts with other 

        subjects to transform the education of K-12 students. Using technology 

        and the Internet, the Project&#39;s focus is to develop curriculum models 

        of engaged student learning. </p>

      <p class="AbstractText">Conducted by Westside Community Schools in Omaha, 

        Nebraska, eight Nebraska school districts and five art museums participate 

        in this curriculum development. Via the Internet, educators both nationally 

        and internationally are able to access these resources and interact with 

        other teachers and students.</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">These resources have included virtual exhibitions 

        with on-line curricula and interpretive materials, e-school sessions, 

        teacher chat rooms, interactive activities using on-line images, a list-serve, 

        and more.</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">Administrators and teachers from participating school 

        districts receive on-going training so that they may best utilize the 

        Project&#39;s resources. Museum partners visit the school districts and 

        are assisted by teachers in developing in-house and on-line curricula 

        that are easily adapted into both the classroom and museum galleries.</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">Museum partners include the Smithsonian American Art 

        Museum in Washington, DC; the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska; the 

        Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery and Sculpture Garden in Lincoln, Nebraska; 

        the Museum of Nebraska Art in Kearney, Nebraska; and the National Museum 

        of Wildlife Art in Jackson Hole, Wyoming; all of whom provide a rich resource 

        for educators to incorporate into their curricula. </p>

      <p class="AbstractText"><b>Key words: </b>Community Discovered, National Museum 

        of Wildlife Art, Fine Art, Omaha Public Schools, Westside Community Education 

        Center, Education, Museum Education, Art Education , Collaborative Learning, 

        Technological Integration, Jackson Hole, Wyoming,Jackson, Wyoming, Tom

      <p class="normal">The Community Discovered is a five-year United States Department 

        of Education Technology Innovation Challenge Grant. Although the grant 

        officially ended September 30, 2000, Community Discovered received permission 

        to use carry-over funds for this, its sixth and final year. </p>

      <p class="normal">The Community Discovered first began as a pilot project 

        called the &#34;Art and Technology Integration Project,&#34; or ATI, which was 

        conducted by the Westside Community Schools and Grand Island Public Schools 

        in Nebraska. The ATI project received a two-year grant from the Excellence 

        in Education Council, which was funded by Nebraska State lottery proceeds. 

        The success of ATI encouraged the participants to expand the project as 

        a Federal Department of Education Technology Innovation Challenge Grant 

        called The Community Discovered.</p>

      <p class="normal">The Community Discovered, or CD, focuses on the development 

        of curriculum models of engaged student learning using technology and 

        the Internet. Since the mission of the Challenge Grants is to use new 

        technology and the information superhighway to improve education, this 

        made CD the ideal candidate for a Technology Innovation Challenge Grant 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">The focus of CD is further expanded through its five main 

        goals. The first goal is to create a national network of educators who 

        will develop and implement appropriate learning strategies integrating 

        technology and the arts with core subject areas such as math, science, 

        reading and social studies. This goal began with the enlistment of committed 

        teachers and administrators in the school districts that participated 

        in CD.</p>

      <p class="normal">Initially, four Nebraska school districts were selected 

        to participate. In addition to Westside Community Schools in Omaha, which 

        is the fiscal and administrative agent for the grant, Grand Island Public 

        Schools, Winnebago Public Schools and Lexington Public Schools were actively 

        involved during the first year. The Omaha Public Schools joined during 

        the second year of the grant. In the third year, Nebraska City Public 

        Schools began participating. The last two school districts to join were 

        Smallfoot Public School and McCartney Public School, both of which are 

        one-room rural schoolhouses.</p>

      <p class="normal">In addition to CD participants, educators across the U.S. 

        also access project resources and receive assistance in using them. CD 

        networks with a large and growing base of individuals through its website 

        and listserv, and participating teachers share their experiences in conferences 

        and conventions. </p>

      <p class="normal">The second goal of CD is to provide students and educators 

        in rural and disadvantaged urban areas with equal access to information 

        and museum resources at the state and national levels. Five art museums 

        are partners with CD. Three are located in Nebraska: The Joslyn Art Museum 

        in Omaha, the Museum of Nebraska Art in Kearney, and the Sheldon Memorial 

        Art Gallery and Sculpture Garden in Lincoln.</p>

      <p class="normal">At the national level, the Smithsonian American Art Museum 

        in Washington D.C. and the National Museum of Wildlife Art in Jackson 

        Hole, Wyoming, provide unique resources not easily accessible to Nebraska 

        students. In addition, the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts, 

        the Getty Education Institute for the Arts, the Omaha Community Playhouse, 

        the Nebraska Arts Council, and Opera Omaha have all assisted with the 

        project.</p>

      <p class="normal">The staff of these art institutions have become valuable 

        members of CD, not only by providing access to and information about their 

        collections and programs<b> </b>through digitizing images and providing 

        hypertext information<b>,</b> but by also being a part of a national network 

        of educators who develop learning strategies for the classroom.</p>

      <p class="normal">The third goal of the project is to enable educators to 

        effectively use appropriate technologies for constructivist teaching and 

        learning across curriculum areas. In a constructivist setting, instruction 

        is student-centered with an emphasis on &#34;big concepts&#34; and hands-on learning. 

        This method allows students to be more actively involved in their own 

        education. Museum personnel, along with local and national experts in 

        technology, art and constructivist theory, all contribute to the development 

        of strategies for use in the classroom. In numerous workshops and professional 

        development sessions, participants can collaborate with their colleagues 

        about using technology to integrate art and constructivist teaching into 

        their curriculum. </p>

      <p class="normal">Opportunities to develop expertise with various software 

        and hardware configurations are an important component of staff development. 

        The exhibition <i>The Great American Pop Art Store: Multiples of the Sixties</i> 

        held at the Joslyn Art Museum provided such an opportunity during an all 

        day teachers&#39; workshop. Teachers used new technologies during hands<b>-</b>on 

        sessions to generate ideas for integrating art and constructivist teaching 

        into the classroom.</p>

      <p class="normal">Participants also attended an intensive summer institute 

        in the arts. Beginning with Prairie Visions, a Regional Institute Grant 

        in Nebraska that is funded by the Getty Grant Program, teachers embarked 

        on an in-depth study of Discipline-Based Art Education practices. Prairie 

        Visions was followed with continued immersion into the arts on location 

        at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Kennedy Center.</p>

      <p class="normal">The fourth goal of CD is to enable educators to implement 

        effective curricula incorporating the arts and technology into core subject 

        areas such as math, science, reading and social studies. Collaboration 

        amongst CD staff and museum partners is again integral in achieving this 

        goal. By maintaining an active Internet listserv where participants exchange 

        ideas and request help, the virtual community, reflected in the project&#39;s 

        name, assists educators in incorporating art and technology into these 

        core subject areas.</p>

      <p class="normal">In one instance, a teacher requested ideas for integrating 

        art into a social studies unit about communities. Museum and CD staff 

        monitoring the listserv responded with ideas and titles of digitized images 

        available for viewing on museum websites. Further, an on-line chat was 

        scheduled between students and museum staff using ACTV&#39;s &#34;eSchool 

        <span>Ã</span> Online.&#34; This Java-based software suite uses ACTV&#39;s 

        HyperTV<span>Ã</span> technology to offer synchronized, real-time delivery 

        of Internet content, chat functionality, and streaming audio and video. 

        Digitized images from the museums were &#34;pushed&#34; over the Web to the students 

        for viewing. The students, in turn, pushed their own images and written 

        projects back to the museum. While these images were moving back and forth, 

        real-time discussions about the artwork took place, allowing for immediate 

        feedback to students.</p>

      <p class="normal">Another &#34;eSchool<span>Ã</span>&#34; event, called &#34;ConferNet 

        99,&#34; was held between several classrooms of students across Nebraska and 

        the Smithsonian American Art Museum in conjunction with their <i>Posters 

        American Style </i>exhibition. This virtual conference became an electronic 

        forum for learners to explore how works of art reflect and celebrate human 

        experience. Students created on-line exhibits of posters<b>, </b>listened 

        to a keynote address with streaming audio, and participated in &#34;Ask a 

        Docent&#34; on-line sessions, among other activities. With &#34;eSchool<span>Ã</span>,&#34; 

        real time interaction between participants is no longer limited by location.</p>

      <p class="normal">Allowing students access to museum collections is an essential 

        part of CD. By digitizing and posting images on their Web sites, museum 

        partners allow students daily access to their collections. </p>

      <p class="normal">Regarding the role of the museum and related logistical 

        issues, the following is a narrative by Ponteir Sackrey, Director of Marketing 

        and Visitor Services and Web Project Manager for the National Museum of 

        Wildlife Art in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. </p>

      <p class="normal">The National Museum of Wildlife Art is a small museum whose 

        collection of fine art focuses on the subject of wildlife. In late 1997, 

        we became the fifth and final museum partner in CD. Until joining the 

        project, the museum had a fledgling Internet presence, hosting only a 

        static page describing our collections and programs. Our museum management 

        recognized that the Internet was key to widening our audience, which is 

        quite limited due to our remote location.</p>

      <p class="normal">Joining CD, therefore, with its vast support system, was 

        critical in developing an Internet presence that was innovative and interactive. 

        Thanks to CD, today the NMWA Web site is both. </p>

      <p class="normal">As you know, in 1997 it was difficult for a non-profit to 

        obtain financial backing for Internet presence, a medium that was largely 

        untested as a tool for museum outreach. If a museum was able to dedicate 

        resources to the Internet, the overall goal was often marketing related. 

        Most sites offered little more than general information, a few images 

        of the collection, a listing of events, a museum shop and an email contact. 

        Interactive programs and on-line curricula that could be of interest and 

        use to educators were seldom offered or even perceived as valuable. </p>

      <p class="normal">So, by joining CD, the NMWA was challenged to offer comprehensive 

        programming that could provide resources for teachers and students. By 

        being the last partner to join the project, the NMWA benefited from lessons 

        learned by other CD museums. Examples of such lessons include avoiding 

        the use of fancy graphics to prevent consequent downloading problems, 

        developing on-line curricula that is user-friendly for teachers, and establishing 

        avenues to maintain effective communication with both the teachers and 

        the project administrators. Another key issue was the development of a 

        search engine with the appropriate parameters to facilitate access to 

        the on-line collection. </p>

      <p class="normal">Other development issues we addressed during the early stages 

        included: What kind of art images are most helpful to teachers of such 

        varied disciplines? What can we offer Spanish-speaking students, a growing 

        population in the Nebraska school system? Do we need to host an actual 

        <i>physical </i>visit from the teachers since none of them have ever visited 

        our museum? What other resources are needed to support the teachers when 

        using our on-line resources? During this process, we found that both CD 

        teachers and project administrators were extremely helpful in providing 

        feedback about our overall site design and its content. </p>

      <p class="normal">Most of our Web site challenges have been logistical. When 

        we joined CD, like most museums, the NMWA did not have a Web &#34;department.&#34; 

        Rather, we formed a Web &#34;team,&#34; led by me, the director of marketing. 

        Also on the team were three members of the education department, another 

        member of the marketing department (who served as Web editor), and a part-time 

        computer consultant in Denver who was responsible for html programming 

        and other such back-end support. </p>

      <p class="normal">Since then our site has grown to such proportions we have 

        added to our team a Web curriculum consultant - who works part-time - 

        our Curator of Art, our in-house MIS technician, and the manager and assistant 

        manager of our museum shop. We have also switched our computer consultant 

        to someone who is a local resident so that he can attend our Web team 

        meetings.</p>

      <p class="normal">Having an expanded Web team allows us to offer additional 

        programs such as: <i>Wildlife in Winter</i>, our latest on-line exhibition, 

        complete with lesson plans; &#34;Curator&#39;s Pick,&#34; a monthly feature which 

        highlights a significant artwork from our collection (this is in addition 

        to our monthly featured images); an expanded on-line museum shop; an interactive 

        kiosk for our museum lobby, whose content mirrors that of our Web site; 

        games, and virtual tours, which will be on-line this summer. </p>

      <p class="normal">Also, this summer we will be hosting a teacher/administrator 

        training at the NMWA during which CD and non-CD educators will be given 

        the necessary tools and resources so that they may adopt the CD methodology 

        into their own school systems and classrooms. There is no question that 

        perpetuating the CD infrastructure is critical to the project&#39;s success. 

        Later, Tom will talk about CD resources now available for interested educators 

        and web developers.</p>

      <p class="normal">Another new program the NMWA is particularly proud of is 

        called &#34;Art Tales,&#34; an interactive story-telling program. &#34;Art Tales&#34; 

        was created by our Web Team and the Internet company, Educational Web 

        Adventures. Through this interactive activity, the participant chooses 

        to be an explorer and pen a journal in Frontier Explorer; or, be a writer 

        and develop a wildlife field guide in Wildlife Field Guide Writer; or, 

        be a curator and organize a museum exhibit in Museum Curator, all using 

        the NMWA on-line artwork.</p>

      <p class="normal">After creating stories, the visitor can send his/her work 

        to the NMWA&#39;s educational staff, which reviews each submission. Each 

        month, several are published on-line for other visitors to enjoy. </p>

      <p class="normal">As an example, let&#39;s take a look at &#34;Frontier Tales,&#34; 

        the most popular of the three choices. Using NMWA artwork to illustrate 

        the tale, one is asked to imagine being a western explorer during the 

        nineteenth-century. Next one is asked to choose a total of eight images 

        that depict the landscape and wildlife typically encountered during this 

        era and in this region. Once these images have been chosen, one is asked 

        to narrate their journey in a journal.</p>

      <p class="normal">One visitor to &#34;Art Tales,&#34; who used this painting by William 

        Jacob Hays to describe a section of the journey taken by Lewis and Clark, 

        states:</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;The weather is mild and sunny as we begin our journey into 

        the great unknown land of the Louisiana Purchase. We follow the Missouri 

        River north from St. Louis. We have seen all sorts of animals on our journey 

        across these great plains of endless grass. The Prairie Dogs have been 

        particularly amusing, scolding us as we pass and disturb their everyday 

        business.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">Another visitor uses this lithograph by John James Audubon 

        depicting a whooping crane to describe a hunting experience:</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#34;We came into some open plains after crossing a difficult 

        mountain range. We spied the most unusual birds, a lot like egrets, but 

        much fuller and more awkward. They seemed very peaceful and hardly were 

        bothered by our hunting party. But their demeanor soon changed when the 

        first round of shots were fired. We were able to bring down five of those 

        big birds and had a tasty treat!&#34;</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#34;Art Tales&#34; was originally intended as an interactive 

        experience for our visitors outside an educational setting. Still, many 

        teachers are using &#34;Art Tales&#34; in their classrooms. </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">A fifth-grade teacher in the Westside Community School 

        district, Jamie Beran, states &#34;We were delighted with &#39;Art Tales&#39;. 

        It proved to be an exciting and motivating tool for helping students learn 

        skills in both reading and writing. &#39;Art Tales&#39; was integrated 

        into a Reading-Writing unit with the big idea of &#39;Adventure.&#39; 

        Because of this theme, we used the &#39;Art Tales&#39; activity <i>Frontier 

        Explorer</i>. While in fourth grade, these students studied Nebraska history 

        and were very familiar with traveling west in the 1800&#39;s. In fifth 

        grade, students are required to understand and apply the reading skill 

        of a sequence of events. Students also must be able to use transitional 

        words and produce writing with multiple paragraphs. &#39;Art Tales&#39; 

        was an excellent tool for learning these skills and then applying them.&#34; </p>

      <p class="normal">Beran adds, &#34;Students were thrilled to write these stories. They loved choosing the artwork and they told me the pictures are what 

        helped them come up with ideas. The fact that the tales were published 

        within days was wonderful.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">In terms of ideas of how we can further develop our web 

        presence and keep it fresh to retain interest, the NMWA has no shortage. 

        However, we have found that it can take more time than anticipated to 

        get seemingly easy problems resolved. The main reason for this is that 

        each member of our Web team has other responsibilities besides the maintaining 

        and developing the Web site. And most issues require the entire team&#39;s 

        input, so getting the necessary feedback can be slow.</p>

      <p class="normal">All of these challenges are common to any institution that 

        is grappling with the Internet. And despite the logistical issues facing 

        the NMWA, we continue to improve our site, albeit slowly, so that it remains 

        a useful and viable tool for CD teachers and other educators. We focus 

        our efforts using this measurement - Will it be useful in education? </p>

      <p class="normal">Maintaining the goal of educational outreach has committed 

        us to a high standard of Web development. Of course, in an effort to fairly 

        represent our world-class collection, we also strive to present graphically 

        pleasing pages that are indexed well. Since we are committed to education, 

        however, we primarily concentrate on content and measure ourselves not 

        by hit statistics, but by user sessions. This standard indicates if students 

        and teachers are actually using the site. Today we are indebted to CD 

        for not only altering the NWMA approach to on-line outreach, but for being 

        a change-agent in the field of education.</p>

      <p class="normal">Now Tom Albertsen will conclude with an overall evaluation 

        of the project. </p>

      <p class="normal">So, here&#39;s the question. Is connecting all these schools 

        and art institutions effective in educating students? That leads us to 

        the fifth and most important goal of CD: To enable students to achieve 

        high academic standards by integrating the arts and technology into core 

        subject areas. Throughout the run of the project, a continual evaluation 

        has been conducted by the University of Nebraska at Omaha. </p>

      <p class="normal">Through observations, surveys, interviews, and evaluations 

        of units developed by teachers, the evidence is overwhelming that CD has 

        achieved its goals. As one example out of many, a fifth grade teacher 

        who integrated art and technology into a reading unit observed a significant 

        increase in the California Test of Basic Skills (CTBS) reading scores 

        from a pretest average of 21.7 to a post-test average of 62.5. This was 

        then compared to a control group (from a similar class that was not involved 

        in CD) that increased to a post-test score of only 43.6.</p>

      <p class="normal">Often CD teachers examine a wide range of student achievement, 

        through structured work in formal graduate study classes. One study completed 

        in 1999 showed that a group of fourth-grade students integrating art within 

        history performed better on general retention and comprehension tasks 

        than a control group. Another study also completed in 1999 demonstrated 

        that a group of eighth grade students participating in a CD project and 

        simultaneously working on a poetry assignment did better than a control 

        group on an analysis of the structure and depth of the poetry.</p>

      <p class="normal">A perspective on the evaluation process comes from Mike 

        Timms, a senior research associate at WestEd (<u><a href="http://www.wested.org/" target="new">www.wested.org</a></u>), 

        a non-profit education research organization based in San Francisco. Mr. 

        Timms has worked with the University of Nebraska at Omaha evaluation team 

        assigned to CD. What follows is <i>A View From the Outside</i>, his contribution 

        to CD&#39;s monograph, which will be available later this summer.</p>

      <p class="normal">Timms states, </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#34;The goals of The Community Discovered were ambitious. 

        Any project that seeks to change the way that teachers organize their 

        classes and interact with their students is bound to prove difficult.&#34;</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#34;So, as an outside evaluator on the evaluation team, 

        I was keen to see what impact the project had made at its conclusion. 

        On a personal level, I believed that the infusion of art and technology 

        into the core curriculum would broaden and enliven each subject in a way 

        that would engage students. I am a proponent of constructivist teaching, 

        but as an evaluator, was careful not to let my personal beliefs cloud 

        the judgments that I needed to make in determining if the project had 

        met its goals.&#34;</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#34;In the first four years of the project, the evaluation 

        activities focused on how the involvement in CD had changed teachers&#39; 

        skills and lesson-planning styles. So, by the final year of the project, 

        it seemed timely to find out exactly how well teachers were able to pull 

        together all the strands of knowledge and skills they had gained. Because 

        the place where it all comes together is in the classroom, I decided that 

        the best way to get an objective view of what was happening was to develop 

        a classroom observation instrument -- a rubric by which to measure 

        the skills promoted by CD.&#34;</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#34;Developing an observation instrument was not as easy 

        as it might seem. Right from the onset of CD, it had been hard to get 

        people to clearly define what teaching might look like once it had successfully 

        incorporated art and technology in a constructivist manner. I spent time 

        reviewing some videotapes of teachers taken earlier on in the project 

        in order to determine how to measure the impact of CD. I found some examples 

        of observational systems from similar projects. Earlier in the project, 

        I had interviewed some teachers identified as ones who exemplified the 

        project&#39;s focus and that gave me a good sense of what to look for. 

        A group of evaluation team members tried out a prototype of the observation 

        sheet on a few teachers and then refined it.&#34;</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#34;For the evaluation, we focused on a sample of nine 

        teachers, each at various stages of involvement in CD. Among the teachers 

        studied, we saw a range of lessons. One mixed grade class was learning 

        medieval history through looking at tapestries on-line. Another high school 

        class was exploring local Native American traditions by studying handmade 

        rugs and quilts and by using the Internet to view the work of Native American 

        artists. In another lesson, students were involved in an on-line conference 

        with docents at the National Museum of Wildlife Art in Jackson Hole, Wyo. 

        Docents asked students about drawings and paintings that they had made 

        of natural scenes they had seen during field visits to Platte River Park. 

        These are all good examples of the infusion of the arts and technology 

        into other subject areas. The positive impact of CD on students is exemplified 

        by one teacher who spoke of the effects on students in a remedial reading 

        class:&#34;</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#39;The kids... were remedial reading kids. ...What 

        I saw with those reading kids was the doors it opened for them and the 

        way it made them feel about themselves. In one unit, they got to learn 

        about William H. Johnson and...be docents at the Joslyn for their classmates. 

        So, they took on leadership roles - they never experienced being leaders 

        in their class before -- and it really made them grow and feel better 

        about themselves. I think also just the different ways kids learn; that 

        some are more tactile, some are more visual...this addresses all those 

        kinds of things.&#39;</p>

      <p class="normal">Timms continues, </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#34;These observations, together with evidence from interviews, 

        indicated that participating teachers had incorporated art, technology 

        and constructivism in their teaching. The observations were deliberately 

        scheduled to occur when the teachers were teaching a unit that had been 

        developed as a result of CD. Nevertheless, teachers were able to achieve 

        moderate to high levels of sophistication using art and constructivism, 

        and - to a lesser degree - technology. The effects of CD were clearly 

        detectable in the teaching of the project participants. Evidence from 

        the interviews showed that CD was working as a community, as it was intended. 

        Teachers used the museums and their resources physically <i>and</i> through 

        the Internet. Comments about the museums were all positive. One teacher 

        said:</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#39;The connections with the museums are huge and 

        so beneficial for kids. It just opens doors for them to see the museum 

        on-line and then go to it afterward.&#39;</p>

      <p class="normal">Continues Timms, </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#34;The way the project coupled intensive summer workshops 

        with continuing support and interaction via listservs led to increased 

        professional growth amongst the participating teachers. It worked particularly 

        well with the integration of art and the use of constructivist teaching 

        methods. There also was a change in the teachers&#39; use of technology 

        in the classroom, but the technology was not as fully integrated into 

        the curriculum as art. This may have to do with the fact that there is 

        a longer history of art integration through the work of the Prairie Visions 

        Institute that provided a model for art integration. Likewise, there is 

        a long history of constructivist teaching methods for the project to draw 

        upon. Models intended to test and measure successful technology integration 

        are not as refined as they are for art and constructivist teaching. However, 

        Technology Challenge Grants like CD have paved the way to developing methods 

        and models for making technological integration easy and, most important, 

        effective for student learning.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">As I noted earlier, Timms&#39; statement, and other contributions 

        to the <i>Community Discovered Monograph,</i> are scheduled for publication 

        by summer&#39;s end. Contact Westside Community Schools in Omaha, Nebraska, 

        for information about obtaining a copy.</p>

      <p class="normal">The five main goals of CD follow the spirit and intent of 

        the Challenge Grant&#39;s mission of being a catalyst for change. By 

        supporting the collaboration of educators and parents, museum partners, 

        community leaders and in the development of effective applications of 

        new learning technologies in communities throughout the country, meaningful 

        educational reform has occurred. </p>

      <p class="normal">Although the grant is nearing its end, CD plans to continue 

        its support of classroom teachers through its Web site and further development 

        of on-line curricula. Also, a staff development model has been compiled 

        -- we have brochures describing the program here today.</p>

      <p class="normal">This model includes three major components: first, a three-day 

        workshop involving the foundations of Disciplined Based Art Education 

        and constructivist theory, Internet resource explorations, peer mentoring, 

        assessment and building rubrics, and creating units; second, providing 

        on-going mentor support using a listserv to promote team-building essential 

        to the process of curriculum development; and lastly, a three-day follow-up 

        workshop to review the concepts of the first workshop, revisit, reflect, 

        and revise the teacher constructed units, and reaffirm the commitment 

        to the workshop goal of empowering teachers to create long-lasting changes 

        in curriculum which will integrate the arts and the tools of technology 

        in a constructivist setting.</p>

      <p class="normal">The information superhighway has created new possibilities 

        for extending the time, place and resources for learning. By nurturing 

        strong partnerships, providing professional development for teachers, 

        and engaging students in activities that foster high academic standards, 

        CD has become a model for art and technology integration on a national 

        level. We are optimistic that our legacy will continue to thrive and grow.</p>
