        Museum</p>

      <p class="Author">Ana Carolina Bertoletti, Museu de Ciências e Tecnologia

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">The SAGRES system is an educational environment built 

        on the Web that facilitates the organization of visits to museums, presenting 

        museum information bases in a way adapted to the user&#39;s characteristics 

        (capacities and preferences). The system determines the group of links 

        appropriate to the user(s) and shows them in a resultant HTML page. In 

        addition, SAGRES enables cooperative learning by supporting interaction 

        among users and also among members of groups of users. </p>

      <p class="AbstractText">Users in SAGRES are aided by personal assistants that 

        are software agents, whose purpose is to monitor the visitors&#39; actions, 

        helping them during the navigation. Considering studies in human-computer 

        interaction (Ball et al, 1997) (Koda, 1996) and aiming to provide a friendlier 

        interface for the SAGRES system, the agents have a graphical representation 

        as animate characters. These characters improvise a group of behaviours 

        similar to human behaviours (happiness, satisfaction and vibration), making 

        the interaction more attractive. </p>

      <p class="AbstractText">In order to evaluate the user&#39;s degree of satisfaction 

        with the agents, we developed a questionnaire and obtained some favorable 

        results. This system is developed in the Museu de Ciências e Tecnologia 

        (MCT) at Pontificia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS), 

        Porto Alegre, Brazil.</p>

      <p class="AbstractText"><b>Keywords: </b>Virtual Museums, Software Agents, 

        Personal Assistant and Evaluation of Systems.</p>

      <h1>1. Introduction</h1>

      <p class="normal">Most virtual museums are sites that offer on-line learning 

        resources, inviting the visitor to investigate and explore. The SAGRES 

        system is a virtual museum that seeks cooperation between museum and schools, 

        in order to create a new educational environment that provides continuous 

        education, allowing access to information of the museum by the community 

        at large. Due to the possibility of using the system as a distance-teaching 

        tool, and to the diversity of the school population to be reached, SAGRES 

        was conceived as a flexible and adaptive system, able to pay attention 

        to the different needs and situations of its various visitors. Because 

        presentation of information on the Web is achieved through hypermedia 

        documents, success of virtual museums can be limited by a lack of initial 

        training and by users getting &#39;lost&#39; during navigation, due 

        to the large number of links available.</p>

      <p class="normal">In order to overcome these limitations, software agents 

        were used to incorporate personal assistance to the SAGRES&#39; users. These 

        kinds of agents have been used for the development of a large number of 

        applications. They can provide assistance to the user during some systems 

        operations and can execute tasks on the user&#39;s behalf (Genesereth and 

        Ketchpel, 1994). As personal assistants they can be responsible for helping 

        in the navigation and operation of the system, overcoming the need for 

        initial training. Besides, software agents are quite useful in analyzing 

        and monitoring the users&#39; actions. Considering this, we believe that agents 

        can help in the system operat<span class="Normal">ion both at operational 

        and interface level.</span></p>

      <p class="Normal">Many systems developed for the Internet have a concern 

        about how to accommodate user needs and preferences and how to provide 

        interfaces that are more comfortable and easy to manage. Some researchers 

        are considering software agents as a good option, because they are adaptable, 

        persistent, semi-autonomous (Maes et all., 1999) and can be represented 

        through animate characters. There are studies that indicate that interaction 

        with computers unavoidably evokes human social answers. People treat computers 

        as humans even if the interface is not explicitly anthropomorphic. In 

        this case, the social metaphor represented through the presence of animate 

        characters (similar to real life people) has reduced anxiety associated 

        with the use of computers.</p>

      <p class="Normal">In order to evaluate the degree of user satisfaction related 

        to the agents, we conducted a study of agent evaluation methods and, based 

        on this research, developed a questionnaire. We applied this questionnaire 

        to partners of the Computer Club in the Museu de Ciências e Tecnologia 

        (MCT) and we obtained some satisfactory results. </p>

      <h1>2. SAGRES -- A Virtual Museum</h1>

      <p class="Normal">The SAGRES system (Bertoletti and Costa, 1999) is a virtual 

        museum that seeks to form a partnership between museums and schools, and 

        to build a new educational environment going beyond such partnership by 

        providing information available in the museum to the whole community, 

        through the Web. The system determines the information appropriate to 

        the visitor(s) and shows it in a resultant HTML page. </p>

      <p class="Normal">The information available in the SAGRES is based on the 

        physical structure of MCT. The subjects for consultation are arranged 

        in the system in agreement with their actual location in the MCT exhibitions 

        area, allowing to the visitor to find the experiments in a real visit. 

      </p>

      <p class="Normal">Through the on-line exhibition visitors access the information 

        of the physical museum. The use of such on-line information can happen 

        in several ways (Lewis, 1997): in a set of activities coordinated by teachers 

        in which students participate; in &#34;halls of activities&#34;, i.e., 

        series of activities with a central theme open to any visitor, and by 

        individuals as a source for individual studies. In addition, SAGRES provides 

        cooperative learning by supporting interaction among visitors and also 

        among members of groups of visitors. </p>

      <p class="Normal">The system supports different groups of users: </p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>A Visitor</b> accomplishes the interaction with 

          the system individually. He is included in the system by a process of 

          self-registering, where he is responsible for defining his profile, 

          informing the system of his characteristics, capacities and preferences, 

          in order to facilitate the construction of his model. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>A Teacher</b> (generally identified as a school 

          teacher whose student groups visit the museum) is responsible for the 

          definition of the profile of the group. By a profile we understand the 

          set of characteristics of the group; that is, the students&#39; backgrounds 

          and preferences, any particular subject being focused in the visit, 

          and the activities. The teacher is also responsible for registering 

          the students, as well as accompanying them and evaluating their performance 

          during the visit, through reports delivered by the system. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>A Student</b> is allowed to interchange ideas with 

          colleagues in his group and to work on the activities and subjects determined 

          by the teacher.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="Normal">One advantage of SAGRES is that it allows visitors to 

        plan their visits to the MCT in advance. Thus, when arriving at the museum, 

        the visitor already knows where to find specific experiments. Later, in 

        their homes, the visitors can get other information related to the experiments 

        visited.</p>

      <p class="Normal">For teachers, SAGRES is a powerful tool to support teaching, 

        because it works as a repository of information from which they can elaborate 

        a library of activities (for example, questionnaires for tests) and share 

        them with other teachers.</p>

      <h1>3. Integrating Personal Assistance in the SAGRES </h1>

      <p class="Normal">Since information is presented on the Web through hypermedia 

        documents, virtual museums are limited by the lack of initial training 

        and by users getting lost during navigation, due to the large number of 

        available links (Yamada et all., 1995). Therefore, software agents were 

        used to incorporate personal assistance in the SAGRES system. As personal 

        assistants they have the responsibility to help the visitors during interaction 

        with the system. These agents are represented trough animated characters. 

        According to Hayes-Roth (1998), the introduction of characters on the 

        Internet introduces the sense that people are interacting with &#34;real characters&#34; 

        in virtual worlds. This sense is intensified because characters simulate 

        verbal and physical behaviours similar to humans, such as happiness, satisfaction 

        and greeting. As people are social beings and interact instinctively with 

        each other, the user&#39;s interaction with the interface becomes friendlier.</p>

      <p class="Normal">To support independence between the agents, SAGRES adopted 

        a three-layer development model (Kirtland, 1999): presentation, business 

        and data. The layers of data and business meet in the server. Data layer 

        stores the SAGRES&#39;s databases and information related to the agents&#39; 

        execution scripts and repertoire of behaviours. The business layer implements 

        the agents&#39; functionalities. The presentation layer is located in the 

        client and contains the SAGRES&#39;s HTML pages and agents&#39; pages. This model is visualized in figure 1.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="bertoletti.fig1.gif" width="515" height="676" alt="Figure 1: Agents and SAGRES System"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 1: Agents and SAGRES System</p>

      <p class="Normal">Figure 1 shows that agents are structured into two main 

        modules: internal representation (presented in the data and business layers) 

        and interface (presented in the presentation layer). The internal representation 

        module is divided into data and control. Data contains information about 

        the agent such as agent identification, current agent state (idle, execution), 

        script (name of the file that contains the execution&#39;s script of 

        the agent), list of neighbours (name of the agents that it will be able 

        to communicate to) and who is communicating (name of the agent that is 

        communicating at the moment). This information is stored in a database. 

        All information in data is updated, according to the process in the control 

        module. The control module contains the personal assistants&#39; functions. 

        Assistants have common knowledge about the world that is implicitly incorporated 

        in the control module. The interface contains graphical representation 

        of the agents that interact with visitors through the execution script 

        incorporated in the HTML pages (Moraes et al., 1999a). An example of this 

        script is illustrated in figure 2.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 2: Example of an execution script</p>

      <p class="Normal">This example shows that agent&#39;s actions are related 

        to behaviours (physical and verbal). Each one of these behaviours has 

        one to five possibilities of execution. In this way, the agents can improvise 

        behaviours and different possibilities to execute the selected behaviour. 

        This characteristic makes agents more flexible, life-like and believable, 

        increasing the users&#39; satisfaction related to the system operation 

        as we can see in section 5.</p>

      <h1>4 Visualizing Personal Assistance in the SAGRES</h1>

      <p class="Normal">In this section we are going to describe the SAGRES system, 

        as it operates with personal assistants, by illustrating an example of 

        the visitor&#39; interaction. Figure 3 shows the main page of the system.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="bertoletti.fig3.gif" width="375" height="281"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 3: Main Page</p>

      <p class="Normal">After choosing the personal assistant option, the visitor 

        provides his name and password (figure 4).</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="bertoletti.fig4.gif" width="375" height="281" alt="Figure 4: Logon Page"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 4: Logon Page</p>

      <p class="Normal">Based on the name and password information the system 

        identifies the user&#39;s kind: visitor, student and/or teacher (figure 5).</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="bertoletti.fig5.gif" width="375" height="281" alt="Figure 5: Kind of User Page"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 5: Kind of User Page</p>

      <p class="Normal">After the user chooses the visitor module, the system 

        loads his visitor&#39;s models (figure 6).</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="bertoletti.fig6.gif" width="375" height="281" alt="Figure 6: Consultation Options Page"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 6: Consultation Options Page</p>

      <p class="Normal">After the user selects a subject, the system builds a 

        presentation page where the user can see the documents about the selected 

        subject and the link for the communication mural and document edition 

        (figure 7).</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="bertoletti.fig7.gif" width="375" height="281" alt="Figure 7: Information Presentation Page"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 7: Information Presentation Page</p>

      <p class="Normal">In some pages there is a button related to the personal 

        assistant, as we can see in figures 6 and 7. This button activates the 

        assistant, so when the user needs help, he only has to click on that button. 

        When the user wants to stop the explanation, he clicks on the button again. 

        The user can activate the assistant when the button is green, and he can 

        stop the assistant when the button is red. The explanation provided is 

        in accordance with the pages&#39; context, assistant actions and behaviours. 

        When the button is not present, the assistant acts autonomously. This 

        means that the assistant observes the user&#39;s actions and motivates 

        and helps the user when necessary.</p>

      <h1>5. Evaluation of Personal Assistance in the SAGRES System</h1>

      <p class="Normal">In order to evaluate the user&#39;s satisfaction with the 

        degree of personal assistance in the SAGRES system, we researched evaluation 

        approaches for intelligent agents. Hayes-Roth and Doyle (1998) point out 

        that works in intelligent agents inherit the evaluation approaches of 

        Artificial Intelligence and other fields of Computer Science such as Human-Computer 

        Interfaces. These approaches define the desirable qualities of systems. 

        However, as personal assistants are intended to be more similar to people, 

        traditional approaches should be adapted or modified. Hayes-Roth and Doyle 

        (1998) present an adaptation of some important approaches for evaluation 

        of animated characters. As personal assistants are represented through 

        animated characters, these approaches can be applied. The approaches are: </p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Reliable becomes variable: to be more human-like and 

          believable the animate characters must display normal variability in 

          their choice and manner of executing behaviours</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Predictable becomes idiosyncratic: animate characters 

          must display roughly predictable patterns of behaviour, punctuated by 

          interesting surprises</span></li>

        <li> <span class="Normal">Correct becomes appropriate: rather than behaving 

          correctly, animate characters must behave appropriately, given the roles, 

          their circumstances and their imperfect human-like natures</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Complete becomes effective: animate characters must 

          function effectively, albeit sometimes incompletely, in the roles they 

          play</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Efficient becomes interesting: animate characters must 

          forego efficiency in their paths to goals in favour of paths that are 

          intrinsically interesting</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Optimal becomes distinctively individual: it is important 

          that animate characters be distinctive individuals whose behaviour surprises, 

          delights or provokes us in ways that are unique</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="Normal">Considering the ideas presented by Hayes-Roth and Doyle 

        (1998), we developed a questionnaire to evaluate characteristics related 

        to the agents. The questions are illustrated in figure 8.</p>

      <p class="Normal">Each question has four alternatives as answers: bad, regular, 

        good and very good. Weights of one to four, for concepts, were associated with answers, as illustrated in tables 1 and 2.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 8: Agents Questionnaire</p>

      <p class="Normal">These questions follow the same format presented in table 

        1, except the last one, where the learner should choose between &#34;with&#34; 

        or &#34;without&#34;. </p>

      <p class="Normal">The average obtained in the questionnaire was 3.68. We 

        verified that users favour the assistant&#39;s behaviours during the execution 

        of tasks, obtaining an average 3.875. It&#39;s important to say that 

        the other aspects obtained an average superior to 3.6. So, the assistant 

        reached successfully the approaches proposed by Hayes-Roth and Doyle, 

        displaying normal variability in their choice and manner of executing 

        behaviours, and being attractive and interesting to users. Besides, the 

        guide treats visitors in a personalized way, aiding and motivating them 

        to accomplish tasks. </p>

      <p class="Normal">We can conclude that visitors are satisfied with the use 

        of assistants. This satisfaction is explicit, because all the visitors 

        answered <i>&#34;with&#34;</i> to the question <i>&#34; In the future, 

        if you can choose the presentation with or without the personal assistant, 

        which one will you choose?&#34; </i>In this way we verified that the 

        personal assistant was an important aid to visitors during the operation 

        of the system, executing its main functionality and serving as an incentive 

        for future access to the system.</p>

      <h1>6. Conclusions</h1>

      <p class="Normal">The SAGRES system makes the interactive museum of PUCRS 

        remotely available to the public visitor, as well as contributing to the 

        improvement of teaching and promoting the exchange of information among 

        geographically distant visitors.</p>

      <p class="Normal">Personal assistants are used in SAGRES to assist visitors 

        during a visit. They do this by helping visitors in the exploration of 

        information and systems operation, through a friendly interface where 

        visitors interact with animated characters whose behaviours are similar 

        to human behaviours. A questionnaire administered to users of the virtual 

        guide demonstrates that users prefer to operate the system with the virtual 

        guide, because it facilitates navigation, offers personalized help and 

        demonstrates interesting ways to interact with users, achieving its initial 

        aims.</p>
