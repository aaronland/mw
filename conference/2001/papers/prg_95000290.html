      <p class="PaperTitle">Evaluating the Usability of a Museum Web Site</p>

      <p class="Author">Ilse Harms and Werner Schweibenz, University of Saarland, 

        SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany</p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">The paper presents a research project conducted by 

        the Department of Information Science in cooperation with the Saarland 

        Museum, the art museum of the Federal State of Saarland, Germany. The 

        study had two aims. The first was to evaluate some methods of usability 

        engineering for the Web, and the second was to evaluate the usability 

        of the Saarland Museum&#39;s Web site and improve it. The applied usability 

        engineering methods were an expert-judgment-focused evaluation using heuristic 

        evaluation with the <i>Heuristics for Web Communication</i> and a user-focused 

        evaluation conducting a laboratory test with actual users and the thinking-aloud 

        method. The combination of heuristic evaluation and laboratory testing 

        provided interesting results. The heuristic evaluation detected a vast 

        number of usability problems. The laboratory test confirmed most of these 

        findings as usability problems and added some usability problems that 

        experts did not discover because actual users often have a different perspective. 

        The evaluation led to a re-design of the Web site.</p>

      <h1>1. Usability Engineering for Museum Web Sites</h1>

      <p class="normal">The World Wide Web offers museums the possibility to disseminate 

        information about their collections to a world wide public. Therefore, 

        one can state that &#34;museums are in the communiÂ­cation business&#34; 

        (Silverstone 1988: 231) and that there are interesting parallels between 

        museums and the mass media (Schweibenz 1998: 187). When attributing communicative 

        and interactive functions to a museum Web site, it is especially important 

        to keep in mind the users and their needs for easy interaction. Therefore 

        it is essential that &#34;the Web is a domain which must be instantly 

        usable&#34; (Rajani &amp; Rosenberg 1999). This statement evokes the 

        question of what usability means for museum Web sites. According to Garzotto, 

        Matera &amp; Paolini (1998), usability is &#34;the visitor&#39;s ability 

        to use these sites and to access their content in the most effective way. 

        As a consequence, it has become compelling to provide both quality criteria 

        that WWW sites must satisfy in order to be usable, and systematic methods 

        for evaluating such criteria.&#34; Therefore Web usability and Web usability 

        engineering methods have become an important issue (Garzotto, Matera &amp; 

        Paolini 1998, Teather 1999, Cleary 2000). </p>

      <p class="normal">The usability of Web sites can be tested and improved in 

        a process which is called usability engineering. According to KrÃ¶mker 

        (1999: 25), usability engineering is a set of methods to design user-friendly 

        products and enhance the quality of the product. The methods of usability 

        engineering can be categorized in expert-focused and user-focused methods. 

        Expert-focused methods like heuristic evaluation and user-focused evaluation 

        methods like laboratory testing with actual users can be used in combination 

        (Nielsen, 1997a: 1543). Undisputedly, the comÂ­bination of heuristic evaluation 

        and laboratory testing achieves the greatest value from each method (Kantner 

        &amp; Rosenbaum 1997: 160; Nielsen, 1993: 225). Therefore, the Department 

        of Information Science at the University of Saarland, Germany, developed 

        a usability engineering process (Harms &amp; Schweibenz, 2000: 19-20) 

        and tested it in a usability study evaluating a museum Web site. This 

        paper presents the experiences from the study which was conducted with 

        an expert-judgment-focused evaluation using heuristic evaluation based 

        on the <i>Heuristics for Web CommuniÂ­cation</i> and a user-focused evaluation 

        using laboratory tests with actual users and the thinking-aloud method. 

      </p>

      <h1>2. A Survey of Methods for Usability Engineering</h1>

      <p class="normal">The methods of usability engineering can be categorized 

        into expert-focused and user-focused methods. Among the expert-focused 

        methods are several variÂ­ations of heuristic evaluation. According to 

        Nielsen (1997a: 1543) &#34;heuÂ­ristic evaluation is a way of finding 

        usability problems in a design by conÂ­trasting it with a list of established 

        usability principles&#34;. The established usability principles are listed 

        in guidelines or checklists like Keevil&#39;s <i>UsabiÂ­lity Index</i> (Keevil, 

        1998) or Molich &amp; Nielsen&#39;s nine principles for human-computer dialogue 

        (Molich &amp; Nielsen, 1990) or the <i>Heuristics for Web ComÂ­munication</i>. 

        In the evaluation process, experts compare the product with these guidelines 

        and judge the compliance of the interface with recogÂ­nized usability problems. 

        The advantage of expert-focused evaluation is that it is a relatively 

        simple and fast process. A comÂ­paratively small numÂ­ber of five evaluators 

        can find some 75 per cent of the usability problems of a product in a 

        relatively short time (for details see Levi &amp; Conrad, 1996). The disadvantages 

        are that experts have to do the evaluation and that exÂ­perts cannot ignore 

        their own knowledge of the subject, i.e. they cannot &#34;step back behind 

        what they already know.&#34; So they will always be surroÂ­gate users, 

        i.e. expert evaluators who emulate users. </p>

      <p class="normal">In contrast to expert-focused methods, user-focused methods 

        rely on actual users to test the usability of a product. This process 

        is called user testing, and according to Nielsen (1997a: 1543) it &#34;is 

        the most fundamental usability method and is in some sense irreplaceable, 

        since it proÂ­vides direct information about how people use computers and 

        what their exact problems are with the concrete interÂ­face being tested.&#34; 

        There are various methods for user testing. One of the most popular and 

        most efÂ­fective methods is the laboratory test with the thinking aloud 

        method (NielÂ­sen 1993: 195) which was used in our case study. The advantage 

        of user-focused evaluation is that the tests supply a huge amount of qualitative 

        data that show how actual users handle the product. The disadvantages 

        are that the tests take place in a laboratory situation and that a lot 

        of equipment and coordination is necessary to conduct the test, making 

        it labor-intensive. </p>

      <h1>3. Description of the Usability Study </h1>

      <h2>3. 1 The Process</h2>

      <p class="normal">In cooperation with the SaarÂ­land Museum - Stiftung SaarÂ­lÃ¤ndischer 

        KulturÂ­besitz, the art museum of the feÂ­deral state of Saarland, the Department 

        of Information Science at the University of SaarÂ­land evaluated the museum&#39;s 

        Web site (<a href="http://www.saarlandmuseum.de/" target="new">http://www.saarlandmuseum.de</a>). 

        The site is a graphically designed Web site of the third generation (Siegel, 

        1997) and went online in summer 1999. The evaluation project was carried 

        out by sixteen graduate students who had received training in usability 

        engineering in a research class, and two lecturers as coordinators. The 

        study had two aims. The first aim was to evaluate some evaluation methods, 

        especially the <i>Heuristics for Web ComÂ­munication</i>; the second was 

        to improve the usability of the Web site of the Saarland Museum. Therefore 

        we decided to use a comÂ­bination of heuristic evaluation and user testing 

        as suggested in the research literature. Figure 1 illustrates the process.

      <h2>3.2 Heuristic Evaluation With the Heuristics for Web Communication</h2>

      <p class="normal">The first step was an heuristic evaluation. As mentioned 

        above, there is a multiÂ­tude of heuristics. Heuristics can be specific 

        for a certain domain or generally applicable. They can be design-oriented 

        or evaluation-oriented or both. They can be based on research or on experience 

        of practitioners. ThereÂ­fore, heuristics vary in extent and quality. In 

        our case study we used the <i>Heuristics for Web Communication</i>, developed 

        by the faculty of the Departments of Technical Communication of the University 

        of Washington, Seattle, and the University of Twente, the Netherlands. 

        The heuristics are based on research findings in technical writing and 

        cognitive psychology and were evaluated in a workshop with 40 partiÂ­cipants, 

        both students and lecturers of technical communication, and professional 

        Web developers from various Web design comÂ­panies in the Seattle area. 

        The heuristics were revised according to the feedÂ­back of the participants 

        of the workshop and the Web developers and were published in a special 

        issue of the Journal of Technical CommuniÂ­cation in August 2000.</p>

      <p class="normal">The <i>Heuristics for Web Communication</i> consist of five 

        different heuÂ­ristics. The five heuristics deal with all important aspects 

        of Web sites: displaying inÂ­forÂ­mation, navigation, text comprehension, 

        role playing (i.e. author-reader relationship), and data collection for 

        analyzing interaction. The conÂ­tent of the heuristics ca<span class="normal">n 

        be summed up as follows:</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="normal">The heuristic <i>Displaying information 

        on the Web</i> consists of guidelines for visuals, e.g. </span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="normal">how to design and arrange display elements,</span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">how to ensure that text is readable</span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">how to use pictures, illustrations, icons and 

          motion.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="normal"><span class="normal">The <i>Heuristic for Web Navigation</i> 

        deals with hypertext theory and offers guidelines for navigation and orientation, 

        e.g. </span></p>

      <ul>

        (the heuristics on <i>Web Data Collection </i>was not applied due to access

        (1997: 155). The graÂ­duate stu</span>dents, who had received an introduction 

        to the heuristics, worked in teams of four. Each team conducted an evaluation 

        of the same selected number of pages from the chosen Web site. In a two-hour 

        session of individual evaluation, the team members applied one of the 

        four heuristics to the Web site. During the evaluation process they took 

        notes of usability problems according to the various points listed in 

        the heuÂ­ristics. Then the team members gathered and discussed their findings. 

        The usability problems detected in the heuristic evaluation were graded 

        in a severity rating according to Nielsen (1997b) by each team. The rating 

        ranged from 0 (no usability problem) to 4 (usability catastrophe) (cf. 

        Table 1) and was conÂ­ducted with respect to the frequency and persistence 

        of the problems and the impact they have on users. At the end of the evaluation, 

        the four teams presented their findings in a plenary meeting. The evaluation 

        process took about five hours. </p>

      <p class="normal">The most frequent usability problems were navigational and 

        orientation problems as described in the <i>Heuristic for Web Navigation</i>, 

        followed by general design problems as named in the heuristic <i>Displaying 

        information on the Web</i>. After the rating the two lecturers collected 

        the written findings of the team members and compiled a list of all usability 

        probÂ­lems for a re-design of the Web site. The findings were also used 

        to design tasks for a user test in the laboratory.</p>

      <h2>3.3 User Testing in the Usability Laboratory With The Thinking Aloud 

        Method </h2>

      <p class="normal">The next step of the evaluation was a user test in the usability 

        laboratory. Figure 2 shows a sketch of the laboratory in which the tests 

        took place. </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 2: A sketch of the usability lab</p>

      <p class="normal">In the lab, real users have to work on tasks while thinking 

        aloud, i.e. they verbalize their thoughts and comment on their actions 

        while they handle the computer. This &#34;allows a very direct understanding 

        of what parts of the dialogue cause the most problems&#34; (Nielsen 1993: 

        195). During the test, users work on standardized test tasks and are supervised 

        by a test manager. The tests are recorded on video by a technical assistant 

        who operates two video cameras. One of the cameras is focused on the face 

        and hands of the participant, the other one on the computer screen. The 

        recordings of the two cameras are blended together on one screen and recorded 

        on video. In order to catch the details of interaction, a digital screencam 

        records the actions on the screen. In a labor-intensive process, the findings 

        of the tests are transcribed and categorized. </p>

      <p class="normal">As we evaluated an art museum Web site, recruiting particiÂ­pants 

        with an interest in art was suggested. Therefore we asked students of 

        the Arts and Science department and art teachers to participate in our 

        experiments. The teachers were choÂ­sen to increase the average age. The 

        number of participants was decided acÂ­cording to Virzi (1992: 468), who 

        suggests at least 15 participants. In our study, 17 users participated. 

        Five of them were teachers; 12 were stuÂ­dents of the Arts and Science 

        department. Seven participants were male, ten female. The youngest user 

        was 19, the oldest 48, the average age being 27. </p>

      <p class="normal">It takes some time and effort to design the test task scenario 

        for the user test of a large informaÂ­tional Web site (cf. Kantner &amp; 

        Rosenbaum 1997: 154). The test tasks should be as representative as possible 

        of the use to which the system will be put in the field and at the same 

        time small enough to be completed in a reasonable time frame, but not 

        so small as to be trivial (Nielsen 1993: 185f). The test scenario, which 

        had been discussed with the client of our case study, consisted of nine 

        tasks that represented potential usability problems. Table 2 shows a selection 

        of the potential problems and the test tasks.</p>

      <p class="normal">The user tests revealed that all assumed problems were usability 

        problems for test users. The findings were grouped into several categories, 

        e.g. probÂ­lems handling the splash screen (task 1), insufficient use of 

        links betÂ­ween reÂ­lated information (tasks 3 and 4) etc., and illustrated 

        by lively quotes taken from the test protocols. For example, after finishing 

        task 1 a particiÂ­pant stated: &#34;The first screen only shows a headline, 

        a picture and an adÂ­dress but no link. (break) I click on the picture. 

        It works!&#34; Another remarked: &#34;As an Internet beginner I honestly 

        have a problem to get to the next page. I&#39;m a little helpless because 

        I prefer big arrows and buttons that say &#39;next page.&#39; But I made it.&#34; 

        While struggling with task 4, the patience of a participant snapped and 

        he said: &#34;Now I would try to get in touch with someone and write 

        an email, if they offer a guided tour, because all the searching takes 

        far too long.&#34; Trying to use the bookmarks in task 7, a partiÂ­ciÂ­pant 

        said: &#34;Usually I would use the bookmarks. (clicks on bookmarks) Well, 

        now I see that all the bookmarks have the same name.&#34; Another particiÂ­pant 

        used sarcasm: &#34;That&#39;s really funny, because I have five bookÂ­marks 

        all named Saarland Museum SaarbrÃ¼cken. That helps a lot. Great! (laughs).&#34; 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">Quotes like these make usability problems come alive and 

        show the reactions of actual users in real situations. From our experience, 

        these reactions are much more convincing than dry statements of experts 

        no matter how profound these statements might be and no matter on what 

        kind of theory they are based. </p>

      <p class="normal">The test time and performance of the users was influenced 

        by their comÂ­puter literacy, measured by data collected in a questionnaire. 

        The average test time was about 20 minutes and corresponds with the expected 

        test time derived from three pre-tests. The duration of the test shows 

        some connection between the computer literacy level and the amount of 

        time needed to comÂ­plete the tasks. The shortest test of 14 minutes was 

        conducted with a user who had used the Web for two years or longer and 

        several times a week. The longest test of 30 minutes was conducted with 

        a participant with little computer literacy. Further analysis did not 

        seem necessary to us because the duration of a test is also influenced 

        by other factors like interest in the subject and the medium and the method 

        of thinking aloud. </p>

      <h1>4. Practical Experiences With the Different Methods </h1>

      <p class="normal">In our case study the theoretical foundations of the heuristic 

        evaluation were the <i>Heuristics for Web Communication</i>. At the time 

        of our evaluÂ­ation, these heuristics were brand new. Only a little practical 

        exÂ­perience existed in applying these heuristics. Therefore we thought 

        it useful to contrast the <i>Heuristics for Web ComÂ­muniÂ­cation</i> with 

        another heuristic evaluation tool, Keevil&#39;s <i>Usability Index</i>. According 

        to Keevil (1998: 271), the usability index is a &#34;measure, expressed 

        as a per cent, of how closely the features of a Web site match generally 

        accepted usability guidelines.&#34; The Usability Index con<span class="normal">sists 

        of five categories (Keevil 1998: 273): </span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="normal">Finding the information: Can you find the information 

          you want?</span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">Understanding the information: After you find 

          the information, can you understand it?</span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">Supporting user tasks: Does the information 

          help you perform a task?</span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">Evaluating the technical accuracy: Is the technical 

          information complete?</span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">Presenting the information: Does the information 

          look like a quality product?</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="normal"><span class="normal">Judging from the 203 questions, Keevil&#39;s 

        <i>Usability Index</i> seems focused on commercial Web sites. But it seemed 

        adequate to use it for the Web site of a cultural heritage inÂ­stiÂ­tution, 

        because Keevil (1998: 275) points out that the <i></i></span><i>UsabiÂ­lity 

        Index</i> is generally applicable: &#34;Information Developers can use 

        the checkÂ­list to measure how easy it is to find, understand, and use 

        inforÂ­maÂ­tion displayed on a Web site.&#34; </p>

      <p class="normal">In our case study, fifteen students (one of the sixteen 

        didn&#39;t hand in the index) used the <i>Usability Index</i> to evaluate 

        the Web site of the Saarland Museum. The following table (Table 3) shows 

        the results with the categories &#39;N/A&#39; (not applicable), &#39;Yes&#39;, &#39;No&#39;, the 

        sum and the usability in percent, which is calculated from the total number 

        of &#39;Yes&#39; answers divided by the total numbers of &#39;Yes&#39; and &#39;No&#39; answers.</p>

      <p class="normal">Table 3 shows a wide range of usability for the Saarland 

        Museum expressed in per cent. The results reached from 29% to 55%, the 

        arithmetic mean being 47%. The deviation in the perÂ­centage of usability 

        is reÂ­markable. It is due to the bias of the evaluators in interpreting 

        the questions. One reason is that certain sets of questions from the <i>Usability 

        Index</i> did not fit for the Web site under evaluation. In this case, 

        some evaluators chose to vote for &#39;N/A&#39;, while others voted for &#39;No&#39;. 

        This explains the big difÂ­ferences between the &#39;N/A&#39; votes and the &#39;No&#39; 

        votes and in the overall usability because the usability is calculated 

        from the total number of yes answers divided by the total numbers of yes 

        and no answers. Another reaÂ­son is that the checklist, like every checklist, 

        is open to interÂ­pretation. Keevil (1998: 275) was aware of this problem 

        and tried to reduce it by only allowing the answers &#39;N/A&#39;, &#39;Yes&#39;, and 

        &#39;No&#39;. But still, there is consiÂ­derable room for interpretation. Apart 

        from the probÂ­lem of interpretation, the <i>Usability Index</i> has another 

        disadvantage. It gives a number in per cent that indicates the usability 

        and some hints on usability problems that can be deÂ­rived from the 203 

        questions, but it hardly identifies concrete usability problems.</p>

      <p class="normal">The identification of concrete usability problems and suggestions 

        on how to imÂ­prove usability are the practical advantages of the <i>Heuristics 

        for Web ComÂ­munication</i>. The heuristics are not simply checklists that 

        can be ansÂ­wered by &#39;N/A&#39;, &#39;Yes&#39;, and &#39;No&#39;. They are guidelines designed 

        as stateÂ­ments and questions that guide the evaluator to identify concrete 

        usability probÂ­lems by asking guiding questions like, &#34;Can you decipher 

        all of the elements in the display easily? If not, consider making them 

        larger,&#34; or &#34;Which of the organization&#39;s values should be emphasized?&#34; 

        or giving hints like, &#34;Make sure the most important links appear 

        high enough on the page to be visible without scrolling, regardless of 

        the resolution of the user&#39;s monitor. When pages must scroll, provide 

        visual cues to encourage users to scroll down to links that are below 

        the scroll line.&#34; By contrasting these established usability principles 

        with the Web site under evaluation, the evaluator or information designer 

        can decide if usability probÂ­lems exist, what kind they are, and how they 

        can be removed. This is the big advantage of the heuristics.</p>

      <p class="normal">The disadvantage of the <i>Heuristics for Web Communication</i> 

        is that they are very detailed and complicated compared with general heuristics 

        like the ones of Molich &amp; Nielsen. Molich &amp; Nielsen suggest nine 

        basic items of usability (Molich &amp; Nielsen 1990: 338) (Table 4).</p>

      <p class="normal">Although it is possible to do a successful evaluation with 

        these nine basic items of usability, evaluators might need more guidance 

        in the evaluation process, as is ofÂ­fered by the <i>Heuristics for Web 

        CommuniÂ­cation</i>. These heuristics supÂ­port the evaluators by providing 

        a structured &#34;guided tour&#34; for the evaluation process that takes 

        into account both the big picture and important deÂ­tails. They help the 

        evaluators to consider all substantial usability issues and to focus on 

        the important points. MoreÂ­over they generate a profound impression of 

        the overall quality of a Web site. This makes the <i>Heuristics for Web 

        CommuniÂ­cation</i> a valuable tool for Web usability engineering. </p>

      <p class="normal">The four content-oriented heuristics (the fifth heuristic 

        was not applied due to access restricÂ­tions to log files) are very different 

        as far as their ease of application and the level of backÂ­ground knowledge 

        are concerned. We found that the heuristic <i>Displaying information on 

        the Web</i>, the <i>Heuristic for Web Navigation</i>, and the heuristic 

        <i>Text Comprehension and the Web</i> can be successÂ­fully applied if 

        the evaluators have an average level of knowÂ­ledge in information design 

        and Web design. The evaluators in our case study, all graduate students 

        of information science, had no difficulties in applying them. The heuristic 

        <i>Role Playing on the Web</i> requires some special knowledge of hypertext 

        theory as it is based on the quite compliÂ­cated author-reader relationship 

        in hypertext (Michalak &amp; Coney 1993). AlÂ­though it is very interesting 

        and provides promising results, the evaluators in our case study had some 

        difficulties in applying it. </p>

      <p class="normal">As expected from the research literature (Nielsen 1992: 

        378f), the heuÂ­ristics detected a great numÂ­ber of so-called minor usability 

        problems- no disadÂ­vantage at all because user testing is not an adequate 

        means to identify such minor problems. Minor problems were, for example, 

        inconsistent use of link colors, no text messages for graphic links, complicated 

        sentenÂ­ces, deficits in page structure and organization, lack of informative 

        titles, meaningless animation, flaws in the author-reader relationship, 

        etc. Although real usability problems, such minor probÂ­lems are not observable 

        in user testing, because average users do not realize that these kinds 

        of deficiencies cause problems because they lack the backÂ­ground knowledge 

        in information design and Web design. </p>

      <p class="normal">The user tests in the usability lab were very labor-intensive 

        for several reaÂ­sons: the technical equipment had to be arranged, the 

        test scenario had to be designed and tested, participants had to be recruited, 

        and tests had to be conÂ­ducted with two experimenters who had to be present 

        all the time to superÂ­vise the participants and the technical equipment. 

        The analysis and evaluÂ­ation of the test data was also time-consuming 

        because the data had to be transcribed and categorized. The big advantage 

        of this method was that the recordings, especially the screencam files, 

        showed cursor movements that help to identify problems in navigation and 

        orientation. This is especially helpÂ­ful when discussing the findings 

        and suggestions for the redesign with the client. A simplified method 

        of thinking aloud testing, in which the experimenters simply take notes 

        of their observations, is less labor-intensive than videotaping and transcribing 

        the tests. But from our exÂ­periÂ­ence, it is difficult for one or two experimenters 

        to follow the course of the test and take notes at the same time if the 

        test consists of more than some basic functions. Therefore video taping 

        or screencam recording is essential. An alternative to transcribing whole 

        test sessions would be to transcribe only the most important sequences 

        of a test. </p>

      <p class="normal">An important point we noticed when comparing answers in 

        the questionÂ­naires with courses of the tests is that answers about the 

        test experience are often not very reliable. The answers about the satisfaction 

        with the Web site often did not correspond with the actual experience 

        of the participants who were observed during the test. For example, several 

        participants stated that they had no problems with navigation and orientation 

        although they had had serious problems during the test. The reasons for 

        this gap between behaviour and statements cannot be discussed here. From 

        our experience it is important to remark that a questionnaire alone cannot 

        provide reliable results. This is not new but conÂ­firms the phenomenon 

        that impressions of their own behaviour and the behaviour in the situation 

        of social reality show a certain deviation. Despite this fact, from our 

        experience questionnaires or interviews are necessary to give the participants 

        the opportunity to comment on the course of the test. Test users appreciate 

        this opportunity, and the results can be used to derive additional information 

        about the acceptance of the Web site. </p>

      <h1>5. Conclusion</h1>

      <p class="normal">The evaluation method used in usability engineering depends 

        on the subject that is evaluated and the goals of the evaluation. Although 

        the combination of heuristic evaluation and user testing provides good 

        results, it is costly as far as time and resources are concerned. With 

        respect to the cost-benefit ration, in many cases the heuristic evaluation 

        is sufficient to detect a reasonable number of minor and major usability 

        problems. </p>

      <p class="normal">In our case study, the <i>Heuristics for Web Communication</i> 

        proved to be applicable tools for heuristic evaluation. The heuristics 

        support a structured evaluation and help both to find and to solve usability 

        problems. In contrast to checklists, they give the evaluators some scope 

        for interpretation while offering guidance at the same time. The drawback 

        of the heuristics is that they cannot be successfully applied by novice 

        evaluators. The evaluators need some backÂ­ground knowledge in Web design 

        and evaluation. The heuristics were helpÂ­ful in pointing out critical 

        points in the Web site that were evaluated in the user test. Compared 

        to user testing, the heuristic evaluation was less labor-intensive. Nevertheless, 

        user testing is a very valuable tool for usability engineering because 

        actual users give an impression of how the Web site will be used in practice. 

        Moreover, actual users might have problems with features that experts 

        do not realize are problematic. The focus on the actual users and the 

        vivid and expressive statements they give justifies the much higher expense 

        in certain cases. From our experience, the combination of both heuristic 

        evaluation with the <i>Heuristics for Web Communication</i> and user testing 

        with thinking aloud is a very useful method of usability engineering.
