      <h1 class="PaperTitle">Towards a Virtual Community </h1>

      <h2 class="Author">Giuliano Gaia, National Museum of Science and Technology, 

        Italy</h2>

      <h1 class="abstractTitle">Abstract</h1>

      <span class="AbstractText">The Internet is primarily a communication tool. 

      This is easy to forget in a web-browsing era. We should remember that the 

      web was created only in 1990, while the first Internet email message was 

      sent nearly 20 years before, in 1971. Exchanging messages via email, chat, 

      or instant messaging, is the most important activity for the majority of 

      Internet users. </span><span class="AbstractText">Communicating can be very 

      important for a museum too. By using email, you can establish a direct relationship 

      with your public. You collect important feedback from actual and potential 

      visitors. Newsletters can strengthen this relationship. Professionals can 

      be involved in discussion mailing lists about specific themes. Discussion 

      forums and guestbooks can enliven a lot your website. Of course this is 

      not for free; you have to dedicate much time to this activity.</span><span class="AbstractText"> At 

      the Science Museum of Milan we have used many of these communication tools: 

      email, newsletters, forums, chat events, guestbooks, discussion mailing 

      lists, online surveys, etc. Our aim was to create a sort of virtual community 

      with our visitors. The paper will describe this effort, together with an 

      evaluation of the results.</span>

      <p class="normal">&#34;<i>How beautiful it is to talk with a Museum!&#34;.</i> In 

        my opinion, this e-mail we received two years ago states the key concept 

        perfectly. In Italy most museums are focused more on conservation than 

        on communication. This reflects the situation of the whole culture, often 

        seen as a separate kingdom, far from the ordinary life of people. Museums 

        are the temples of this &#34;high&#34; culture.</p>

      <p class="normal">In recent years, however, something has started changing. 

        On one hand, interest in museums and exhibitions from media and people 

        has increased; on the other hand, public funds have diminished, and museums 

        have found themselves forced to adopt some marketing and communications 

        practices in order to survive. </p>

      <p class="normal">The Internet has proved to be a powerful tool for this new 

        attitude. Writing an e-mail is easy and cheap. This makes people write 

        many e-mail messages to museums. But a side-effect is that this people 

        expect a quick response from the museum. Finally people can really &#34;talk&#34; 

        with museums, and they want to.</p>

      <h1>The Science Museum on the Web</h1>

      <p class="normal">The Science Museum opened its website on January 26, 1998. 

        It was the same day that the Museum announced its transformation from 

        state-owned institution to private Foundation. The website opening was 

        significant of a new direction in the museum attitude towards its audience.</p>

      <p class="normal">During the last three years, the website has grown considerably, 

        passing from the initial 100 pages to the 1300 pages of December 2000. 

        A relevant fraction of the website has been translated into English, while 

        only a few pages are in French.</p>

      <h1>The audience of the website</h1>

      <p class="normal">During the year 2000 the Science Museum website received 

        500.000 visits (2.500.000 pageviews, which means an average of 5 pageviews 

        per visit). Going deeper, nearly half of the total visits resulted on 

        the English section (Pict.1)</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="gaia_image1.gif" width="376" height="182" alt="Pict.1 – Visits per section "/><br/>

        Pict.1 -- Visits per section</p>

      <p class="normal">Since the museum is not very renowned outside Italy, we 

        can explain this data only by the presence, in the English section, of 

        an important section about Leonardo da Vinci. In fact, two main audiences 

        can be identified: one, mainly international, interested in Leonardo , 

        and another one, mainly Italian, interested in the Museum itself. This 

        fact is very important for the Museum&#39;s communication strategy, since 

        we can use different tools to communicate with one audience or another, 

        or both. For example, so far the newsletter has been addressed mainly 

        to the audience interested in the Museum, while the forum on Leonardo 

        has proved more appealing to the international audience.</p>

      <h1>E-mail</h1>

      <p class="normal">This is one of the most classic ways of communicating with 

        users. Most websites have a public e-mail address. Every website with 

        a public e-mail address faces two main problems: </p>

      <p class="normal"><b>Stimulate or discourage email from visitors?</b></p>

      <p class="normal">We have decided to stimulate e-mail; this was done by publishing 

        the general e-mail <a href="mailto:museo@museoscienza.org">museo@museoscienza.org</a> 

        <a name="_Hlt503330560"></a> directly on the Home Page. Moreover, the address is 

        repeated in many pages of the website and in a specific section, called 

        &#34;Contact&#34;. In the Contact section you can find, together with the e-mail, 

        a page called &#34;help the museum&#34;. In this page we ask our visitors to send 

        us suggestions, drawings, photos, anything they think could refer to our 

        collections. If they own a website, we ask them to put our logo on their 

        website, an online promotional campaign which has proved successful (Gaia 

        1999). </p>

      <p class="normal"><b>Who answers the e-mail?</b></p>

      <p class="normal">Our policy is: every e-mail, except spam advertising, should 

        get a personal answer in no more than two working days. The webmaster 

        is in charge of answering e-mail messages. He reads the e-mail daily, 

        answers all the messages he can directly, and forwards the other messages 

        to the appropriate staff member. In this case, he also answers the forwarded 

        messages, just saying &#34;we have received your message, which has been forwarded 

        to.. (name and function of the person)&#34;. Some websites use auto-responder 

        software, sending an immediate &#34;acknowledgement message&#34; to 

        sender. We prefer to have the webmaster doing this acknowledgement manually, 

        since a personalized message from a real person is much more satisfying 

        for users. So far, the answering process has worked quite well, generating 

        satisfaction from our users, as witnessed by numerous e-mails thanking 

        us. Moreover, it is useful for the webmaster to read all the e-mail in 

        order to understand better the needs of website users. For example, many 

        requests were about admissions, opening hours, how to get to the museum, 

        etc. All this information was already on the website, but messages proved 

        that it was not visible enough. Of course, so far centralized reading 

        by the webmaster has been possible because the amount of the e-mail to 

        answer has been reasonable. For example, during the month of October 2000, 

        we received 84 e-mails. 17 were unsolicited advertising, something you 

        don&#39;t need to answer to. Of the other ones, 25 were forwarded to 

        our museum staff members, while the webmaster answered directly to 42 

        messages. This means 3-4 messages being processed by the webmaster every 

        working day, something you can cope with. If the amount of the e-mail 

        rises to much more than this, we will rethink our answering process.</p>

      <p class="normal">The relationship with our audience has proved very important. 

        Certainly, the percentage of people writing is low; during the year 2000, 

        we received around 1000 messages, compared to a total of 500.000 visits 

        on the website. Among these 1000 messages, however, there were some useful 

        contacts; for example, we got important information about some of our 

        pieces, sometimes from descendants of people who actually used them. We 

        got donations: a motorbike, old computers. Some messages led to important 

        link-exchanges, or to mirroring of interesting websites, or to new material 

        to publish in the website. Sometimes messages were moving, like the message 

        from Rumania, from a man whose child was passionate of trains. &#34;I hope 

        one day I&#39;ll be able to take him to your museum. Now he is not in: 

        he went with his grandfather to the railway station, to see trains leaving...&#34;</p>

      <h1>Newsletter</h1>

      <p class="normal">Since the opening of the website we have offered our visitors 

        the possibility to subscribe to our newsletter, to receive by e-mail our 

        news (conferences, exhibition openings, new sections of the websites, 

        etc.). On December 2000 our newsletter counted nearly 1400 subscribers.</p>

      <p class="normal">The frequency, size and format of messages all aim at a 

        single goal: not to annoy subscribers, with messages which are too frequent, 

        or too long to download. Frequency is reduced to a message every 2 or 

        3 weeks. Messages are text-only, without attachments or HTML formatting, 

        to make them readable by all users. Messages are composed of 3 or 4 short 

        news items with links to web pages with deeper descriptions; this is to 

        keep them short, and to increase visits on the website.</p>

      <p class="normal">Messages are signed personally by the webmaster, who often 

        writes a short preface in a more personal style. This is done to help 

        establish a more friendly atmosphere between the museum and subscribers. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">Obviously subscribers cannot see other recipients e-mail; 

        this is obtained easily with mailing list software like Majordomo, (a 

        widespread free mailing list package, WEBSITE), but also with the &#34;BCC&#34; 

        option of every e-mail software, like Outlook or Eudora. In fact with 

        Outlook or Eudora you can manage even long lists of addresses (up to more 

        than 1000). </p>

      <p class="normal">In order to understand who our subscribers are, the Marketing 

        Studies Institute of the Catholic University of Milan prepared an online 

        survey about themselves and their attitude towards the website and the 

        Museum. The survey was submitted to our subscribers on June 2000. It produced 

        some interesting results. First, people were willing to participate: more 

        than 20 % of subscribers answered the survey, most in the first 48 hours. 

        Second, it was a mainly local audience: more than 50 % of them were from 

        Milan. This is quite interesting for us: while the main audience of the 

        website is international, a newsletter is a good way to keep in touch 

        with a local audience. We also found that a majority of them visited the 

        website only after having visited the Museum. They used the website to 

        deepen their visit, and the newsletter as a tool to establish a relationship 

        with the Museum. </p>

      <p class="normal">The survey was intended also as a tool to build a sense 

        of involvement in the web site development; for example, many of the subscribers 

        indicated a site map as a tool they would have appreciated on the website. 

        After the survey the map was created, and announced as a direct effect 

        of the survey (and partly it was).</p>

      <p class="normal">The survey was the last of a series of steps intended to 

        reinforce the sense of involvement of the subscribers. For example, in 

        July 1999 we changed the Home Page of the website and asked for their 

        opinion, raising a fair amount of comments, mainly positive. Again, during 

        1999 we had five concerts at the Museum. One of them was especially dedicated 

        to our subscribers: we wrote them that the concert was not going to be 

        promoted on the website but only in the newsletter. It was our gift to 

        them for their fidelity. Only a few of them went to the concert, but we 

        received many e-mails thanking us for the idea. </p>

      <p class="normal">In January 2001 we have prepared a T-shirt of the website 

        to be sold online, in partnership with an e-commerce website. This T-shirt 

        was proposed to subscribers at a special discount rate, and a few of them 

        were sent for free to the oldest subscribers, as a &#34;fidelity reward&#34;.</p>

      <p class="normal">Newsletter results are definitely positive. We know we can 

        promote for free any initiative to a significant number of users certainly 

        interested in Museum activities. This has proved useful, for example, 

        in negotiating sponsorship for small events. People from news websites 

        subscribed to the newsletter, and we often see our news published on other 

        websites or newsletters. This has convinced us to think about specialized 

        newsletters, aimed at journalists, teachers, international audience (news 

        in English about exhibitions and books on Leonardo). They will differ 

        in content and frequency of messages (for example journalists need news 

        much more in advance than the general public), but they will keep the 

        same familiar tone of the general newsletter. </p>

      <h1>Discussion Mailing List &#34;Musei-it&#34;</h1>

      <p class="normal">During 1999 we created a mailing list to discuss the use 

        of Information Technology in Italian museums; its name was &#34;musei-it&#34;. 

        In Dece<span class="Normal">mber 2000 the mailing list counted 133 members 

        with an average of 20-30 messages per month. We created this mailing list 

        to achieve different goals:</span></p>

      <p class="MsoListBullet"> 

      </p><ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Get in touch with other people working in the same 

          field (for example, museum webmasters) 

        </span></li><li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Strengthen the position of the Museum in this field 

        </span></li><li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Get new information and ideas from discussions between 

          subscribers 

        </span></li><li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Select a high-level target audience for promotion 

          of specific initiatives (like conferences) 

      </span></li></ul>

      <p class="normal">After some initial difficulties, the mailing list took off 

        during the year 2000. The creation of a website dedicated to the list 

        has proved very useful. The website had links and materials deriving from 

        the discussions, and a web interface to past messages. The website worked 

        also as an effective promotion of the mailing list subscription.</p>

      <p class="normal">In September we thought the mailing list was mature enough 

        to try a more complex project: joining the VLMP project. The VLMP, acronym 

        for Virtual Library Museum Pages, is a big international directory of 

        museum websites (<a href="http://www.vlmp.org/" target="new">www.vlmp.org</a>, 

        see Bowen 1999). The directory is divided into national sections, each 

        one followed by a volunteer; we have decided to host the Italian section, 

        asking mailing list subscribers to help us in maintaining the directory, 

        searching for new museum websites and checking outdated links. Online 

        projects are very suitable for volunteer work, since they do not require 

        physical presence or fixed working hours; therefore, organization of volunteers 

        is simplified.</p>

      <p class="normal">Discussion mailing lists require much more care than unidirectional 

        newsletters, since discussion is a fragile creature, which has to be nurtured 

        continuously. On the other hand, of course, you get a lot from your users: 

        ideas, feedback, materials, cooperation, and sometimes a true sense of 

        community.</p>

      <h1>Communicating on the website (guestbook, discussion forums)</h1>

      <p class="normal">The main difference between e-mail based communication tools 

        (e-mail, newsletter, mailing list) and website-based tools (guestbooks, 

        discussion forums) is visibility. When you send an e-mail, nobody knows, 

        except you and the Museum. When you post to a forum, everybody can see 

        your question, and the answer you get. It is a powerful feature, because 

        it enables visitors of a website to &#34;see&#34; each other. You know 

        that other people visited the website, and left their comments. This decreases 

        the sense of loneliness, characteristic of web-browsing, and can then 

        be a good way to help the birth of a community.</p>

      <p class="normal">On another hand, visibility is the weak point of these systems, 

        especially from the museum&#39;s point of view. If you do not get enough messages, 

        your forum will appear empty and unsuccessful; if you get nasty messages, 

        they will appear at once on your website.</p>

      <p class="normal">During 1998 we had a guestbook working, where people were 

        encouraged to leave comments about the website. It was a successful experiment: 

        we received a fair amount of messages, mainly positive. When we received 

        messages criticizing the Museum, we decided to keep them on the website, 

        answering them with a message from the webmaster. This showed we did not 

        censor messages, and made the guestbook lively.</p>

      <p class="normal">In 1999 we tried to open a discussion forum about the future 

        of the Museum. Our goal was ambitious: we asked our visitors to suggest 

        to us what new pieces or new directions the Museum should have taken in 

        the next future. It was interesting, we thought, to make people reflect 

        on development of technology. But we got only a few messages, and the 

        forum was definitely unsuccessful. We cannot say whether it was due to 

        the subject, or to the scarce visibility on the website, or to a poor 

        management of the forum (for example, many forums start their activity 

        with some fake messages to ignite discussion, something we decided not 

        to do). </p>

      <p class="normal">During the year 2000 we opened another discussion forum, 

        structured in a different way. It was called &#34;Questions and answers 

        about Leonardo&#34;. People could pose questions about Leonardo, and 

        a Museum expert would answer every question.</p>

      <p class="normal">This time the forum was successful. We got a lot of messages 

        asking every kind of question, in Italian and in English (the same forum 

        was linked from the two sections). The only problem was that questions 

        were very different one from another: some were very easy and fast to 

        answer, other were high-level and required studying the problem, and other 

        ones were too generic to be answered shortly. Questions appeared at once 

        in the forum, but some of them remained unanswered for a long time, since 

        we could not take up too much of our expert&#39;s working time for the website. 

        To solve this situation we have transformed the forum into a &#34;frequently 

        asked question&#34; section. Visitors pose questions with an e-mail form; 

        our expert chooses the question to be answered, and then the question 

        and its answer are published in the same time on the website. </p>

      <h1>Real-Time Communication </h1>

      <p class="normal">Only during the year 2000 have we started to experiment 

        real-time communication tools, such as chat systems. In April 2000 we 

        hosted a chat event in partnership with Webscuola ( <a href="http://webscuola.tin.it/">http://webscuola.tin.it</a> 

        ), a website sponsored by Telecom Italia. Webscuola studies how students 

        and teachers can be involved in cooperative learning experiments using 

        Internet tools. Every year Webscuola organizes many chat events: experts 

        answer questions from students on specific subjects. In April our energy 

        expert joined one of these chat events. We were satisfied because students 

        were very involved, but it proved nearly impossible to discuss complex 

        subjects, due to the fragmentation typical of chat discussions. It was 

        clear that chat should be used in combination with other tools, like E-mail, 

        to take advantage of its best feature: its nature of &#34;warm&#34; 

        medium, capable of rapidly creating relationships between people. </p>

      <p class="normal">This year we will try a more complex project with Webscuola: 

        a website created by students from different part of Italy, coordinated 

        by our staff, with chat and e-mail as the only way to communicate between 

        them. The project is called &#34;Create your own museum&#34;: students 

        will have to search their houses for old objects, and create a virtual 

        museum with photos of the object, organized in different sections. </p>

      <p class="normal">During 2001 we will also try to use chat to communicate 

        with users of our website. We already have a real-time system, Leonardo 

        Virtuale, which has been described extensively in past Museums and the 

        Web conferences (Paolini et al. 1999). Using this system users can join 

        a 3D world and chat with other users&#39; avatars, and operate some of Leonardo&#39;s 

        machines. Users who enter the system tend to remain there for long (Barbieri 

        et al. 2000). What we want to experiment with this year is how the system 

        can help to spread culture. A museum guide will connect at predetermined 

        time (for example every Friday morning) and will offer &#34;virtual guided 

        visits&#34; in the system, chatting with users, and offering explanations 

        about Leonardo&#39;s machines. Something similar will be done for the normal 

        website, using tools like Humanclick ( <a href="http://www.humanclick.com/" target="new">www.humanclick.com</a> 

        ) or Gooey ( <a href="http://www.gooey.com/" target="new">www.gooey.com</a> 

        ). These tools combine web browsing and chat; a person from the Museum 

        will contact users browsing our website, and will offer real-time answers 

        to their question, or address them to a specific section of the website. 

      </p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p class="normal">Communicating with users is a very demanding task. You have 

        to dedicate much time and passion to this task. But a proper communication 

        can produce valuable results. Customer satisfaction is the more evident, 

        but not the only one. You also collect valuable data from your users, 

        explicitly (suggestions, ideas, desires) and implicitly (attitudes, needs). 

        Moreover, you establish a direct relationship with your audience, which 

        can be very satisfying for you too. After all, the possibility of communicating 

        directly with people is one of the things that make our job so interesting.</p>
