      <h1 class="PaperTitle">Digital Strategies</h1>

      <h2 class="Author">Jim Blackaby </h2>

      <div> 

        <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract: </h3>

        <p class="AbstractText">While the National Research Council study, <i>LC21: 

          A Digital Study for the Library of Congress</i>, was developed particularly 

          to address questions about a single institution, the materials in it 

          are instructive for all who manage digital data and content not only 

          for the issues they raise but because the shortcomings of the Library 

          of Congress in these areas tend to be reflected in the practices of 

          the nation&#39;s libraries and the emphases placed by granting agencies 

          on digital projects. In the end, one can see that museums are good 

          partners for libraries in the areas of managing digital materials, especially 

          digital content, because museums have many years of experience in those 

          realms. On that account, at this particular juncture, it is important 

          to work collaboratively.</p>

      </div>

      <h1>Digital Strategies</h1>

      <p class="Normal">In 1998, The Library of Congress (LC) requested the National 

        Research Council to convene a committee to spend a couple of years reviewing 

        &#34;the status of information technology planning and implementation&#34; at 

        the Library -- a digital strategy.</p>

      <p class="Normal">What did they hope for? Probably, what any institution 

        hopes for from an outside study -- some simple answers to questions, 

        a justification for emphasizing some projects and personnel, and, of course, 

        a justification for de-emphasizing others. They specifically asked that 

        the committee not venture into the murky waters of their mission.</p>

      <p class="Normal">What did the committee do? Probably, what any group with 

        such a charge might do -- some of what it was supposed to do, some 

        of what it was not supposed to do, and a quite a bit that no one seemed 

        to have thought of before. The committee thought about LC&#39;s ability 

        to create and manage metadata, to work with digital surrogates of (primarily 

        bibliographic) materials, to collect born digital materials, and to effectively 

        utilize digital content.</p>

      <p class="Normal">The whole report, <i>LC21: A Digital Study for the Library 

        of Congress,</i> can be read on line at <a href="http://books.nap.edu/html/lc21/">http://books.nap.edu/html/lc21/</a> 

        or copies are available from the National Academy of Sciences Press. The bottom line was that while the committee thought that the LC was filled 

        with lots of swell stuff and that it had played a key role in the development 

        of libraries, promotion of standardized information management and exchange, 

        and bibliographic preservation, it had moved with great difficulty beyond 

        its bibliocentric universe and hardly into the realm of digital information 

        and content. The committee did take note of the extraordinary quantities 

        of such digitalia that LC had produced -- the mass of MARC records 

        and the five million digital surrogates of the National Digital Library, 

        but came away unconvinced that either of these efforts included strong 

        platforms from which to address the challenges of the digital revolution.</p>

      <h1>Some high points of the criticisms of LC included the facts that:</h1>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">No highly placed individual was specifically charged 

          with digital strategy for LC. A leadership position was recommended.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">In spite of various efforts, there was no connection 

          between the copyright process and cataloguing process. Improvements 

          in capturing copyright data and using that data as part of the cataloguing 

          process were recommended.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">By selecting an off-the-shelf cataloguing system, LC 

          had locked itself into a backwards looking mode that supported its bibliocentric 

          past rather than a forward looking solution that might accommodate more 

          complex kinds of data. </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">LC had failed to develop metadata standards and tools 

          for coping with much beyond the central bibliographic record (areas 

          like Prints and Photos that have been at the library since the turn 

          of the 20<sup>th</sup> century have received scant supportive development; 

          more recent things like electronic media have received none). In the 

          digital area, in order to receive a certificate of copyright for a website, 

          for instance, one must submit screen printouts of the site.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">The National Digital Library project (NDL) in various 

          forms reflected opportunism more than solid exploration into digital 

          content, its uses, audiences, and so on.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="Normal">Many other issues -- large and small were raised (the 

        need for research into digital preservation, the complex relationship 

        between the various branches of LC and their relationship to managing 

        or collecting digital materials, and so on). </p>

      <p class="Normal">It is easy to not bother looking at this report. After 

        all, it is about a library, and we&#39;re from museums. And, even if 

        we are from a library, we are not from The Library, which has a different 

        set of circumstances than we might. Or, if one does choose to look at 

        the report, it is easy to think of it as being about something quite different 

        from one&#39;s self. Libraries are by nature huge, highly structured, 

        highly specialized and formalized institutions. Museums by comparison 

        have a rustic, amateurish quality. On some level it is comforting to 

        find that the LC is not perfect. But, I want to suggest that in very 

        profound ways, this report, its findings, its implications, and perhaps 

        what grows out of it is important for us to pay attention to. (In the 

        wake of the report, and certainly other efforts as well, Congress has 

        given LC $ 100 million to address digital questions.)</p>

      <p class="Normal">First off, museums have no reason to feel smug. If one 

        looks at any museum, one finds</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">No data czar</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Only the vaguest connections between acquisitions processes 

          and cataloguing</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Backwards looking cataloguing systems</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">No real or active efforts at developing standards </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Opportunism of all kinds</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="Normal">So, why is it okay to throw stones? LC comes to be the 

        library of last resort for those of us who are <i>consumers</i> of library 

        science and its related fields rather than <i>producers</i> of it as a 

        university library might be. In the absence of other places to look, rank 

        and file librarians look to LC for their authority, and it from such rank 

        and file that the librarians and library staff and volunteers are drawn. More important, perhaps, is the effect the LC has on funding for digital 

        projects -- direct (as in the case of their Ameritech grants), indirect 

        (as a model that funding agencies like IMLS might actively look to), or 

        remote (as in the many foundations that support museum and library projects 

        without necessarily having complex knowledge of the state of information 

        science).</p>

      <p class="Normal">Museums have done a poor job of finding any center like 

        the LC for developing standards. For many years, the Smithsonian Institution 

        played such a role informally, until its budget was cut. Then the Getty 

        stepped in to support standards developments, but its priorities changed 

        with new leadership. Off and on the fringes of LC (prints and photos, 

        e.g.) have served the interests of museums, but they have been cut as 

        well. This is a problem, because now LC is moving out into our territory 

        -- the territory of content management.</p>

      <p class="Normal">Museums may not be very good at saying what content management 

        -- digital or not -- should be, but we know when it is being done 

        and we know when it is not being done, and it is fair to say that at this 

        time the NDL is not it in a very big, public way.</p>

      <p class="Normal">Information management tools, like any other tools, reflect 

        the problems and solutions that they enabled. Typically, this is most 

        clearly seen in the way that information is stored. That library systems 

        were developed at an earlier period and on earlier technologies than museum 

        systems helps to explain some of the differences in the ways of thinking 

        between content managers and content holders. Just by virtue of coming 

        later, museum information systems show the potential to do a pretty good 

        job of starting to manage content and complex data -- there is the 

        direct metadata, but then there is associated material as well. A history 

        museum, for instance, has to know about the clock and the clock maker, 

        who he learned from and worked with, and so on, as well as the basic metadata 

        that describes the object. Some of this associated material can be easily 

        brushed off as metadata after a fashion, but some of it -- biographical 

        sketches of makers, for instance -- becomes content in its own right</p>

      <p class="Normal">Note, that just as the Internet brings a new storage paradigm, 

        we also find that metadata and associated materials aren&#39;t quite 

        enough to capture the richness of what museums know about objects (digital 

        or otherwise) or to respond to the kinds of demands that our users put 

        on us. There is something beyond those two kinds of information -- 

        metadata and associative materials -- that has to do with &#34;context&#34; 

        -- in sense of what the (often) fragment of material you are looking 

        at is and how to understand it or how it relates to other things. For 

        example -- museums happen to know a lot about their content -- 

        whether it is an object that is full of specificity (like a log book 

        -- we know about the captain, the owner, the vessel, and maybe some 

        of the crew) or one that represents a class (like a sailor&#39;s bag 

        -- maybe anonymous or not, but we can use this to generalize about 

        sailors and their life).</p>

      <p class="Normal">But we start to move beyond this, growing from knowing 

        things like &#34;this is the oldest piece of upholstered furniture in America&#34; 

        which arises out of 1) having metadata about the piece; 2) having associated 

        material that allows extrapolating from the piece to all furniture; and 

        3) being able to go out to some context of understanding.</p>

      <p class="Normal">There are related &#34;contextual&#34; elements that are being 

        considered by many:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Reliability of metadata and associative material</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Age specific content drawn from information repositories</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Alternative interpretations and their history</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Relations among things or between things and places, 

          people, and events.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="Normal">Others will be discovered and explored.</p>

      <p class="Normal">Museums have succeeded in presenting the mix of content, 

        metadata, associative materials, and contextual elements in a variety 

        of ways -- some more effective and clearly realized than others. But, however well we have done this, it is the case that managing this 

        complex mix of content and data is something that museums have done or 

        tried to do for many years. If nothing else, we do know when we are doing 

        something absurd by following guidelines of other disciplines (though 

        this may not stop museums from doing those things) or throwing out good 

        material to conform to someone&#39;s notion of &#34;standards.&#34; (Consider, 

        for example, that while the basic or even extended data elements of the 

        Dublin Core may work well for purposes of <i>indexing</i>--which was 

        their original intent--they make a particularly tight fitting strait 

        jacket for much of what we know about objects.)</p>

      <p class="Normal">Does LC need to be engaging in the same complex polylog 

        of object, metadata, associative materials, and contextual elements that 

        museums have been? Perhaps not, but they do need to be aware of the need 

        to question what they <i>are</i> doing in these arenas and to constantly 

        make sure that it is something that reflects current Knowledge Management 

        and Information Architecture (which will change) rather than something 

        that is reductive and inward/backward looking. And, again, it is important 

        that even if they do not address these kinds of issues head on, it is 

        important for them to be aware of them so that funding agents look out 

        to new kinds of thinking rather than trying to limit materials.</p>

      <p class="Normal">LC has an obligation to be attentive to those who are 

        experimenting with management of digital assets of all kinds -- and 

        it happens in museums in fumbling kinds of ways and from my experience 

        in Universities away from the mainstream (like in the photo collections 

        or rare books or things that are too odd to be mainstream) -- are 

        too easily squelched by those who are apt to point to the LC and say, 

        &#34;That&#39;s not how Library of Congress does it, and without their authority, 

        it will not be the way that we do it either.&#34; One has to look no further 

        than the words of Thomas Jefferson on providing his personal library as 

        the core of the present collection to see that this kind of reductive 

        and restrictive thinking is not what made LC great: &#34;I do not know 

        that it [the library] contains any branch of science which Congress would 

        wish to exclude from their collection; there is, in fact, no subject to 

        which a Member of Congress may not have occasion to refer.&#34; </p>

      <p class="Normal">So, where might we go from here? LC21 is a start, but 

        it seems to me that those with complex knowledge to manage, those with 

        experience managing such complexities, and those charged with holding 

        content need to think harder about working together. This is a wishy 

        washy kind of conclusion -- we, especially the &#34;we&#34; that is the museum 

        community -- don&#39;t have natural centers to turn to to develop 

        these kinds of programs; we don&#39;t get $100 million just to think 

        about these kinds of things. But, we do think more and less formally 

        about these issues, and a concerted effort to think about how to include 

        universities, libraries, and, yes, even, The Library, in our thinking 

        and discussions is important. In that respect, there are crucial roles 

        that IMLS and foundations can play if they are willing, but together we 

        need to work towards keeping open minds and lines of communication. (Indeed, 

        another reason to read the LC21 report is to imagine the rich complexity 

        of the committee&#39;s ideas coming together as a model for moving forward.)</p>
