      <p class="PaperTitle">Building museum brands for the next generation: Web 

        sites that reach and keep young people</p>

      <p class="Author">Margot Wallace, Columbia College, USA</p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract </p>

      <span class="AbstractText">Just marketing a museum isn&#39;t good enough any 

      more. With increased competition among museums as culture destinations, 

      each must distinguish itself from the others. That&#39;s branding, and all good 

      marketers are doing it. Using the Web only for virtual visits and information 

      is under-utilizing it. The Web is, in fact, a powerful branding tool. For 

      young people especially, the spontaneity and flash of the Web not only sells 

      museums in general, but brands individual museums specifically. Effective 

      Web sites, like all marketing media, utilize consistent images and copy 

      to communicate their brand. Logo, theme line, type face, layout format, 

      design motifs, color, icons, and tone of voice are among the features that 

      must be deployed throughout the Web site to make it coherent, easy to navigate, 

      and fun for young people. The artwork featured on the opening pages helps 

      portray the museum&#39;s brand image, and could determine how long, if at all, 

      a young visitor stops at the site. Appropriateness of the museum store items 

      offered online affects whether young people will literally buy the museum&#39;s 

      image and add their names to its database. The brand image must continue 

      through sticky features such as the calendar, promotions, and links so those 

      youthful surfers make the connection between Web site and actual museum, 

      and start the conversion to repeat visitor, advocate, and member. </span><span class="AbstractText">This 

      study,was conducted in October-November, 2000, examines college students&#39; 

      reactions to a range of art museum Web sites and the brand images they reflect. 

      A different random sample of ten art museum Web sites were given to each 

      of fifty college students. Students were asked to navigate the ten sites 

      and select two that communicate a meaningful brand identity based on a checklist 

      of features such as Web site architecture, copy, design, typography, color, 

      audio, logo, and other iconography. The students also participated in small 

      focus groups to further probe the strength of the Web sites&#39; and museums&#39; 

      brand images. It is anticipated that the study will produce examples of 

      effectively branded museum Web sites and a list of Web site branding tools 

      that any museum marketer can adapt.</span>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class="normal">Just marketing a museum isn&#39;t good enough any more. With 

        increased interest in museums as culture destinations, each must distinguish 

        itself from the others. That&#39;s branding. Creating an identity and recognition 

        is a challenge for all successful marketers, for-profit and not. Few museums 

        have gone beyond generic category sell, Thomas Krens&#39;s Guggenheim and 

        Mikhail Piotrovsky&#39;s Hermitage being conspicuous exceptions.</p>

      <p class="normal">The importance of museum Web sites to branding is just beginning 

        to signal our attention. Two years ago Dr. Michael Shapiro at an International 

        Intellectual Property Conference cautioned Web developers about everything 

        from logos on every site page to domain names. The recent approval of 

        dot-mus finally allows museums to brand their site addresses. Now the 

        task is to present the content in a way that indelibly identifies the 

        whole site, page by page, and goes beyond the generic presentation of 

        art and information.</p>

      <p class="normal">This paper will review three art museum branding studies, 

        all exploratory, conducted among college age students. It will demonstrate 

        how Web developers might evaluate young peoples&#39; interest and involvement 

        vis-a-vis the construction of a marketing-effective Web site. Study #1investigates 

        young people&#39;s understanding of art museum branding as a concept. In Study 

        #2, college students evaluate actual art museum Web sites. Study #3, on 

        art museum gift stores, offers some tangential insights. The information 

        from these studies allows for informed examination of the Web site as 

        the powerful branding tool it can be. It will indicate Web site features 

        that aid branding, and black holes that obliterate branding. Although 

        these studies all concentrate on art museums, the findings have significance 

        for other museums whose branding, by nature of their category specificity, 

        is more easily achieved.</p>

      <p class="normal">For young people, the museum visitor of the future, the 

        spontaneity and flash of the Web not only sells museums in general, but 

        brands individual museums specifically. Effective Web sites, like all 

        marketing media, utilize consistent images and copy to communicate their 

        brand. Logo, theme line, typeface, layout format, design motifs, color, 

        icons, and tone of voice are among the features that must be deployed 

        throughout the Web site to make it coherent, easy to navigate and fun 

        for young people. The brand image must continue through sticky features 

        such as the calendar, promotions, and links so those youthful surfers 

        make the connection between Web site and actual museum, and start the 

        conversion to repeat visitor, advocate, and member. </p>

      <p class="normal">Beyond the specifics of a well-branded Web site is the architecture. 

        Young people require structure with their novelty. They need guidance 

        and respond to clear goals and well-marked paths. A well-constructed, 

        easily navigable Web site must never be compromised by high design.</p>

      <p class="normal">Branding is easier said than done. It&#39;s difficult to stick 

        with a consistent message. One needs only remember the box-office public 

        relations events that reap enormous traffic, but bear no relation to the 

        personality or mission of the museum. With all the technological bells 

        and whistles available to Web designers, it&#39;s tempting to stray off message. 

        To evaluate the success of your branding effort on the Web, it helps to 

        remember the benefits of branding: Identity, recognition, familiarity, 

        and justification. These product features are important to all consumers, 

        and especially to younger ones. </p>

      <h1>ASSESSING THE CONCEPT OF ART MUSEUM BRANDING: EXPLORATORY RESEARCH</h1>

      <p class="normal">Last October, four groups of college students were given 

        assignments to assess their understanding of &#34;museum branding.&#34; 

        A different format, each relevant to the particular class and presumably 

        the students taking the class, was given to each of the four groups to 

        forestall any communications bias. One of the four groups used the Web 

        as a resource. The concepts were discussed in class. A facilitator returned 

        to each classroom one week later to learn how well each group had processed 

        the concept.</p>

      <p class="normal">Methodology</p>

      <p class="normal">Group #1:        Written assignment with Web research</p>

      <p class="normal">Group #2:        Lecture</p>

      <p class="normal">Group #3:        Visual assignment</p>

      <p class="normal">Group #4:        Team assignment</p>

      <p class="normal">Group #1 an Advertising Writing class, was asked to research 

        one museum Web site from a list of five, and then write five taglines 

        for an ad for that museum. </p>

      <p class="normal">Group #2, was given a lecture, with overheads, by an outside 

        presenter. This was a class of marketing students in Not-For-Profit Marketing. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">Group #3, a class focusing on the Art Director/Copywriter 

        Team, was given a visual assignment: sketch visual signatures of either 

        the Art Institute of Chicago or the Museum of Contemporary Art. </p>

      <p class="normal">Group #4, the Culture of Advertising class, heard the same 

        overhead lecture as the marketing class, but was then split into small 

        teams of four to develop a brand image for either the Art Institute of 

        Chicago or the Museum of Contemporary Art. </p>

      <p class="normal">With each group, the presenter returned one week later and 

        asked students to respond in writing to the prompt: &#34;What is museum branding? 

        You may use examples to explain your answer.&#34;</p>

      <h2>Assessing the concept of art museum branding: some conclusions</h2>

      <p class="normal">Despite the expected divergence in the groups&#39; articulation 

        of the concept of museum branding, all groups retained a good grasp of 

        the concept one week later. All but a few individual students could describe 

        branding in some detail. They demonstrated comfort with the topic and 

        a lively interest in image, personality, and identity, the results of 

        effective branding. When one realizes the importance of identity to young 

        people, the value of branding becomes even more significant in marketing 

        to them. </p>

      <h2>Results</h2>

      <p class="normal">The Advertising Writing class answered with reference to 

        specific museums, and gave examples of branding. </p>

      <p class="normal">One would expect verbal people, who were given a verbal 

        assignment, to write expressively. It is clear that having the richness 

        of the Web as a resource sparked their creativity. It should be noted 

        that in the computer lab where they worked they talked easily with each 

        other. Young people thrive on group interactivity, a communication which 

        can be simulated on the Web. </p>

      <p class="normal">The Not-For-Profit Marketing class, who had heard just a 

        lecture, condensed the concept into neat paragraphs and bullet points. 

        They understood the concept perfectly and did not have to search for words 

        to describe it. They did not give examples. Marketing students can be 

        expected to be orderly in their thinking. But their writing conveyed some 

        passion for the subject. They seemed to have absorbed the personality 

        and image of art museums as a category. </p>

      <p class="normal">The Art Direction students, who had been asked to design 

        museum logos or illustrations, were the least comprehensive in their written 

        understanding one week earlier. Art directors are by definition non-verbal, 

        but their diffidence was surprising. If in any lesson can be drawn from 

        such a small sample it is to remember the limitations of graphics in creating 

        anything more than a flash awareness. This is especially important when 

        developing a Web site, where narrative is essential to bringing meaning 

        to the visuals. </p>

      <p class="normal">The Advertising Culture class, which had worked in teams, 

        wrote the most abundant answers. Many took advantage of the opportunity 

        to cite examples. They showed a comprehensive memory of the assignment 

        and reveled in relating it. Again, the give-and-take of conversation, 

        which can be replicated in an interactive Web site, is critical to generating 

        and retaining interest among young people.</p>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>

      <p class="normal">Although the classroom dynamic can positively or negatively 

        affect results, there was a consistent positive response to art museum 

        branding. Young people understand the concept of branding. It is familiar 

        to them. They are comfortable, if not intimate, with art museums. They 

        are engaged by the different images and personalities of museums to which 

        they can relate. They are a cohort for whom affinity is important.</p>

      <h1>EVALUATION OF SPECIFIC WEB SITES AND WEB SITE VISITS</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p class="normal">In late November, 2000, a selected group of seven students 

        was assigned <span class="Normal">a list of eight art museum Web sites 

        and asked to visit them all, then select two to analyze carefully.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">The sites were chosen to meet several 

        criteria:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Large enough for extensive navigation</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Well-known and lesser known names</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Prestigious enough to be a valid tourist attraction 

          in a city a student might be visiting</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">Participants were given a checklist 

        to follow as they visited each site. This was done as much to help them 

        navigate</span> the site, as it was to elicit specific responses. Students 

        are selective users of the Web; until shown, they don&#39;t know how to plumb 

        a new site productively.</p>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Inform</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Interact</span></li>

      </ol>

      <h2>Verbal topline results</h2>

      <p class="normal">Clutter is anathema to students. They like sites that present 

        visuals and text in easy-to-absorb portions.</p>

      <p class="normal">Long copy strains the MTV generation&#39;s attention span.</p>

      <p class="normal">Links allow young people to explore and learn on their own 

        terms.</p>

      <p class="normal">Membership solicitations and the gift store offers should 

        not be too blatant. Students are willing to spend money, but they like 

        to discover purchases.</p>

      <p class="normal">College age students like art.</p>

      <p class="normal">Clutter is intimidating and demeaning. Young people don&#39;t 

        need much handholding in navigating through a site. </p>

      <p class="normal">Without referencing the names of the specific museums, here 

        are some of the participants&#39; initial verbatim comments:</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;You&#39;re going to a museum site on purpose, you don&#39;t 

        need to be told where to go.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;I like all the pictures on the home page. I know where 

        to go next.</p>

      <p class="normal"> &#34;I knew I couldn&#39;t get through it all.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">[to the question, isn&#39;t busy-ness exciting and fun] &#34;No!&#34;.</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;Upcoming event description [on the home page] is too 

        long. I&#39;ll read about it if I want.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;I can&#39;t sit in a movie over two hours.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;People are going to visit these sites for the pictures 

        and to get info on events ... they don&#39;t want a lot of garble.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;Nothing long winded just informative.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;The writing on the site is all very conversational 

        in nature. It has the feel of looking at a friends webpage.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;Museums should act like museum, whatever your image.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;They tried too hard to get everyone involved...avoided 

        the hard-core audience.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;... missing the character, no museumness.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;More art, less talk.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;... should have the air of sophistication ... 

        lose it by giving too much information.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;... it was friendly, neighborhood, informative, 

        here are the artists, now they&#39;re in your living room.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;They kept trying to sell me things.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">When asked their first impression of the Web site:</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;...the artsy pictures.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;... different cultures with pictures.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;...[sketched visuals]</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;... full gallery to view on-line.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;... very attractive pictures..&#34;</p>

      <h2>Written survey results</h2>

      <p class="normal">When the students evaluated the individual sites of their 

        choice, according to the checklist, they became more forgiving and positively 

        critical. Once committed to the site, and involved as a visitor not a 

        surfer, they found more features to like. They were also more thoughtful 

        in their criticisms.</p>

      <h2>Informative aspects of site. </h2>

      <p class="normal">They liked information on future exhibitions and graphic 

        calendars for upcoming events. They noted address and directions. &#34;What&#39;s 

        New&#34; sections were noted as helpful for repeat viewers. They like 

        reading about the artists and the history of the museum. One liked reading 

        the press releases, and one liked the gift store information.</p>

      <h2>Interactivity. </h2>

      <p class="normal">Once introduced to the concept of sitting at a site for 

        a few minutes, interactivity caught on, if done well.</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;Plain&#34; or &#34;boring&#34; home pages discourage 

        additional clicks. Interactivity should be encouraged from the beginning. 

        One student had trouble figuring out how to enter the site from what was 

        to him a splash page.</p>

      <p class="normal">One students recommended &#34;a &#39;random&#39; key, brining up 

        a random piece of art ...this would be a way for those who don&#39;t know 

        much about art to browse the collection without being intimidated.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;They are so full...one could actually spend hours 

        going through ... galleries, read up on specific artists, or shop around 

        in the museum gift shop.&#34;</p>

      <h2>Entertainment value</h2>

      <p class="normal">Again, once young people understand the concept of visiting 

        as opposed to surfing, Web sites become fun.</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;It has the feel of looking at a friends web page.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;The sites are very entertaining will all they offer 

        ... with every click of the bottom there is another great picture or 

        artwork for the viewer.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;I personally was entertained by the constantly moving 

        images.&#34;</p>

      <h2>Five Clicks.</h2>

      <p class="normal">This is probably the easiest metric to establish and evaluate, 

        as well as perhaps the most important. Not only can observational research 

        watch for clicks, and electronics count clicks, researchers can ask young 

        people to remain on the site for five clicks and survey their interest-to-boredom 

        level, which this research did. Clean graphics and brief copy are two 

        ways to lead young people into repeated clicks. No single page in a site 

        should try to show or tell too much. And all pages should load quickly.</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;With every click of the button, there is another great 

        picture or artwork for the viewer.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;It took a long time for the front page to load. However, 

        there is a lot of stuff on the site, and much of it is targeted to me.&#34; 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;It&#39;s a large site, so it would take quite a while 

        to go through all of the ... information offered, so that&#39;s another 

        plus.&#34;</p>

      <h2>Collect names</h2>

      <p class="normal">Free stuff and student-oriented materials are welcomed by 

        young people. They also like to give their opinions. It&#39;s important to 

        remember that they don&#39;t get much mail of their own. </p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;It also offers &#39;Stir It Up,&#39; a student membership 

        program which collects names, addresses, and email addresses.</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;You can purchase tickets on-line.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;...allowed me to fill in a sheet stating my name 

        e-mail address, and my interests in the museum.&#34;</p>

      <h2>Sell something.</h2>

      <p class="normal">Young people like to make purchases. One male considered 

        on-line shopping as entertainment.</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;You can buy tickets on-line.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;One could actually spend hours going through ... 

        Internet galleries ... read[ing] up on specific artists, or shop[ping] 

        around in the museum gift shop.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;I liked the student information page enough to give 

        them my email address and consider a membership to the museum.&#34;</p>

      <h2>Hyperlinks</h2>

      <p class="normal">If appropriate to the museum, hyperlinks and links within 

        the site were enjoyed by the participants.</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;The links were interesting and on topic to the site 

        ... for example, one featured an article written about ...graffiti 

        artists.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;...where to get information on artists ... who 

        do not have a exhibit at the museum to being able to buy artsy things 

        via the mail from unaffiliated stores.&#34;</p>

      <h2>Graphics</h2>

      <p class="normal">Visuals are subjective for young people, and difficult to 

        articulate. Students may use non-complex words like &#34;plain,&#34; 

        or &#34;fun,&#34; but they have exposed to the best designers in everything 

        from CD covers to fashion ads, and they appreciate color and good design. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;A clear sense of their image is done by visuals, their 

        set up, and their easy-to-read text mannerisms.&#34; </p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;It&#39;s for a museum, so it&#39;s obviously very visually 

        captivating.&#34;</p>

      <h2>Copy/text</h2>

      <p class="normal">Once into a site, the visitors understood each one&#39;s message. 

        They liked the depth of information. They enjoyed the variety. They learned.</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;I plan on visiting the site again to digest it all.&#34;</p>

      <h2>Likes</h2>

      <p class="normal">The artwork, the information, the versatility, the fun of 

        clicking around. Students found museum web sites to be treasure troves, 

        as one hopes they would find the bricks and mortar venues to be.</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;I liked the fact that they were connected to the community&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;The sites were very entertaining.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;They are loaded with information, everything from 

        their day-to-day schedule, </p>

      <p class="normal">to ...current exhibits, to the history and experience 

        of the museum itself.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;...showed how to get involved with activities going 

        on in the museum ... dining, online shop, school, collections...&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;...got me interested...by letting me sign up 

        for information.&#34;</p>

      <h2>Dislikes</h2>

      <p class="normal">With the exception of some technological download glitches, 

        there were minimal dislikes. Young people, who love to critique anything, 

        found little to disassemble in museum Web sites. They might have liked 

        more information, or more visuals, but these were seen as quibbles, not 

        problems.</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;Needs more copy on background and history.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;What I don&#39;t like about the sites was menial and minimal.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;I couldn&#39;t print the pictures.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;I found the artwork search intimidating, and the store 

        page was rather pointless since you couldn&#39;t order online.&#34;</p>

      <h2>Image</h2>

      <p class="normal">Brand image, though understood by young people, is easier 

        to create themselves than to find in the real world. The more sophisticated 

        found personality and image in specific sites, presumably the ones they 

        selected.</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;What I like ... was their use of text... letter 

        styles that were ...as contemporary as the museum itself.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;One can sense a specific voice behind the letters...&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;They have been able to portray something that other 

        museums seemed to lack, and that&#39;s &#39;personality.&#39;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;We get the sense of the ... fun and versatility 

        by the way that things are more child-like.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">&#34;... sophisticatedness ... not only great visuals 

        of their artwork, but the way they set their pages up.&#34;</p>

      <h2>Application of findings </h2>

      <p class="normal">At this point the group can suggest a Web site to critique 

        according to the checklist.<b></b></p>

      <h1>Conclusions</h1>

      <p class="normal">Young people are charmed by museum Web sites. After they 

        are introduced to them they will probe them in both depth and breadth. 

        Minority students may need special encouragement to visit museum Web sites. 

        According to some studies, minority young people may not have experienced 

        museums, due to high cost and unavailability, and therefore be intimidated 

        by them. The college students in this study like art museums and they 

        like art. They are willing to buy from the museum stores, order the museum 

        literature, and even join where affordable. They like information and 

        they enjoy seeking it on their own terms, engaging in the do-it-yourself-learning 

        that the Web is superior at providing. They recognize image and personality 

        -- branding, -- when they see it, although they don&#39;t seem to see it in 

        very many sites.</p>

      <p class="normal">Because of young people&#39;s willingness to explore art museum 

        Web sites, there are many ways to evaluate their degree of interest. The 

        honor system visit and report study, outlined here, worked well. One-on-one 

        interviews would produce additional insights. Electronic audits would 

        reach a large audience. </p>

      <p class="normal">It is important to assess duration of visits to, and stickiness 

        (repeat visits), of the site. The impact of involvement adds greatly to 

        brand building. The more customers stay with a product, the more they 

        learn about and accept its brand. Since studies show that most actual 

        museum visitors spend only 20 minutes in a museum, Web visits acquire 

        more importance.</p>

      <h1 class="PaperTitle">EVALUATION OF MUSEUM STORES AND HOW THEY AFFECT BRANDING</h1>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class="normal">How museum visitors view the museum store relates only to 

        the on-line shopping portion of museum Web sites. However, the depth of 

        involvement and interest in museum stores was so pronounced, it bears 

        a closer look.</p>

      <p class="normal">This focus group research was conducted in August 2000, 

        among museum visitors of all ages. One of four groups was a student group. 

        Participants were accepted if they had visited a museum within five years. 

        They were asked about their store experiences, and shown purchases from 

        three different Chicago museums, Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Contemporary 

        Art, Terra Museum of American Art. </p>

      <h1>Results</h1>

      <p class="normal">Without exception, all visitors remembered fondly and in 

        detail their store experience. Highlights:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="Normal"><span class="Normal"> summarized clearly the museum, exhibits, and occasion for visit </span></li>

        <li class="Normal"><span class="Normal"> recalled their purchases, whom they were for, how they were used. 

        </span></li>

        <li class="Normal"><span class="Normal"> associated their purchases with the mission and content of the museum.</span></li>

        <li class="Normal"><span class="Normal"> thought of museum in terms of what they purchased</span></li>

        <li class="Normal"><span class="Normal"> communicated their museum experience to others through the purchases</span></li>

        <li class="Normal"><span class="Normal"> returned to the store to make additional purchases</span></li>

        <li class="Normal">i<span class="Normal">dentified individual museums ( from a list of museums) by items 

          shown them</span></li>

        <li class="Normal"><span class="Normal"> commented vigorously on the museum store shopping bag (a proven branding 

          tool).</span></li>

      </ul>

      <h1>Conclusions</h1>

      <p class="normal">Human beings love to acquire and have done so since the 

        acquisition of the first apple. Ownership makes the intangible tangible. 

        Purchases bring experiences home. To impress the brand mage of a museum 

        on a visitor, one need only place an object on his or her coffee table. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">Special consideration should be given to the gift and purchasing 

        features of a museum Web site.</p>
