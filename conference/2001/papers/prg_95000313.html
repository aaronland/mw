      <span class="AbstractText">Officially titled &#34;Human Embryology Digital 

      Library and Collaboratory Support Tools,&#34; this project is part of the 

      Next Generation Internet Initiative and is funded by the National Library 

      of Medicine, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. The project&#39;s 

      purpose is to demonstrate how leading-edge information technologies in computation, 

      visualization, collaboration, and networking can expand capabilities in 

      science and medicine for developmental studies, clinical work and teaching. 

      It also shows how old collections are being made useful with modern technology. 

      Data for the project comes from the Carnegie Human Embryology Collection 

      at the National Museum of Health and Medicine of the Armed Forces Institute 

      of Pathology in Washington, DC. The project will draw from carefully prepared 

      serially-sectioned specimens acquired between the 1890s and the 1930s.</span><span class="AbstractText">While 

      the project primary focus is on providing a capability for medical professionals 

      and biological scientists to communicate detailed information about development 

      of the human embryo in a visual form, it also contains a component for K-12 

      and the general public to access and view the HDAC collections. For researchers, 

      the project technical team will develop a network of medical collaboration 

      workstations, using high-performance off-the-shelf networked computer systems 

      combined with advanced software for collaboration and medical visualization. 

      The workstations will be installed at eight project locations and interconnected 

      over high performance networks. As a result, physicians and others will 

      be able to visualize and manipulate high-resolution image data collaboratively 

      for diagnoses, clinical case management, and medical education. For the 

      general public an interface using standard Internet technologies will be 

      provided to view lower resolution sets of image data, access educational 

      information, lab tools and animations. </span> 

      <p><span class="normal">The project plans to demonstrate the network of

          and tissue types represented, the specimen to which it belongs, etc. 

          This will provide the basic archive that the other two applications 

          will use </span> 

        </li><li class="normal"><span class="normal">The Embryology Education application 

          will make the visualization tools available for medical student use,

      </li></ul>

      <h1>History </h1>

      <h2>Who is AFIP, NMHM and HDAC </h2>

      <p class="normal">The National Museum of Health and Medicine, formerly the 

        Army Medical Museum, The National Museum of Health and Medicine was established 

        during the Civil War as the Army Medical Museum, a center for the collection 

        of specimens for research in military medicine and surgery. In 1862, Surgeon 

        General William Hammond directed medical officers in the field to collect 

        &#34;specimens of morbid anatomy . . . together with projectiles and 

        foreign bodies removed&#34; and to forward them to the newly founded 

        museum for study. </p>

      <p class="normal">By World War II, research at the Museum focused increasingly 

        on pathology; in 1946, the Museum became a division of the new Army Institute 

        of Pathology (AIP), which became the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology 

        (AFIP), in 1949. The Museum&#39;s library and part of its archives were transferred 

        to the National Library of Medicine when it was created in 1956. The Army 

        Medical Museum became the National Museum of Health and Medicine in 1989. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">As a division of the Museum, the Human Developmental Anatomy 

        Center was the brainchild of the then Assistant Director of the museum, 

        Adrianne Noe. The Carnegie Institute of Washington, from1890 to 1955 amassed 

        a collection of embryos taken upon mother&#39;s autopsy, miscarriage, or therapeutic 

        termination of pregnancy. When the Institute&#39;s Department of Embryology 

        began its move into Cellular Biology and wanted to divest itself of its 

        physical specimens, the Institute was persuaded that the best home for 

        their collection was the National Museum of Health and Medicine. There 

        the collection could become a widely available resource for research and 

        education. With the addition of several other important American embryology 

        collections, the Human Developmental Anatomy Center now houses material 

        from 10,000+ individuals, the largest collection of normal human embryology 

        in the US.</p>

      <h1>Current Project</h1>

      <p class="normal">Officially titled &#34;Human Embryology Digital Library 

        and Collaboratory Support Tools,&#34;(or Visible Embryo for short) this 

        project is part of the Next Generation Internet Initiative and is funded 

        by the National Library of Medicine, which is part of the National Institutes 

        of Health. The project&#39;s purpose is to demonstrate how leading-edge information 

        technologies in computation, visualization, collaboration, and networking 

        can expand capabilities in science and medicine for developmental studies, 

        clinical work and teaching. The Visible Embryo project will draw from 

        carefully prepared serially sectioned specimens acquired between the 1890s 

        and the 1930s. While the project focuses on providing a capability for 

        medical professionals and biological scientists to communicate detailed 

        information about development of the human embryo in a visual form, it 

        also contains a component for K-12 and the general public to access and 

        view the collections. For researchers, the project technical team will 

        develop a network of medical collaboration workstations, using high-performance 

        off-the-shelf networked computer systems combined with advanced software 

        for collaboration and medical visualization. The workstations will be 

        installed at eight project locations and interconnected over high performance 

        networks. Consequently, physicians and others will be able to visualize 

        and manipulate high-resolution image data collaboratively for diagnoses, 

        clinical case management, and medical education. For the general public 

        a<span class="Normal">n interface using standard Internet technologies

          for automating and capturing digital image data, aiding in the development 

          of the knowledge management system (database), and visualization system.

      </span></li></ul>

      <h1>Developing database</h1>

      <p class="normal">During the first proof of concept, users of the collection 

        from various fields were solicited for information about how they used 

        the data, how they accessed the data and what they would like to see in 

        applications and visualizations of the data. This information provided 

        the basis for the design of the database.</p>

      <p class="normal">To try to accommodate all the various applications and uses 

        of the data was something of a logistical challenge. The database would 

        be required to accommodate collection management applications, storage 

        of images and image information, and storage of information generated 

        by researchers while using collaborative tools.</p>

      <h1>Data Definition Tables</h1>

      <p class="normal">After reviewing several data structures from scientific 

        organizations and museums, and identifying the field types required for 

        most of the various applications the database would need to support, Data 

        Definition Tables were generated. DTD&#39;s for collections management 

        and automated microscopy were generated by HDAC. DTD&#39;s for the collaborative 

        tools were written by SDSC in conjunction with Eolas Technologies. </p>

      <p class="normal">With the guidance of the San Diego Super Computing Center, 

        HDAC staff started by modifying some basic collections management type 

        Data Definition Tables created for AMICO by SDSC. By looking at those 

        examples and the tables already in existence at HDAC, a set of ddt&#39;s 

        were developed to accommodate collections management activities, ongoing 

        imaging activities of various types and needs of the users. One of the 

        first considerations in developing the metadata catalogue was whether 

        to use Dublin Core metadata. Several of the basic Dublin Core fields such 

        as Object Title/Name and Materials and Techniques Description, were used 

        to try to provide some useful connectivity should it be requested in the 

        future. Other basic tables for verification had to be identified and created. 

        Metadata as it currently existed had to be converted and put into new 

        table structures. This usually meant moving a field from its current table 

        to the new table. Occasionally, data within a field had to be split apart 

        into to new fields. This was usually done to try to simplify information 

        in fields to one type information. Fields, which were duplicated in several 

        tables, were consolidated by creating one table to contain that data and 

        link keys in other tables to it. </p>

      <h1>Verification Language and Decisions about language</h1>

      <p class="normal">After some searching and discussion, the international standard 

        Nomina Anatomica (formerly Terminologica Anatomica) was chosen for adult 

        anatomical nomenclature, Nomina Embryologica, still in development, was 

        chosen for developing anatomy. Both these thesauruses are juried by international 

        panels and have terms in Latin and English. SNOWMED was chosen for pathology, 

        as it is the most common standard used by hospitals and clinicians, and 

        Art and Architecture for collection management and artifact terms. Investigations 

        of the UMLS system developed by the National Library of Medicine are still 

        ongoing.</p>

      <p class="normal">Oregon Health Sciences University researchers will be outlining 

        and labeling structures on embryo section images. Working with OHSU will 

        be Dr. Cornilius Rosse who developed the hierarchical naming system for 

        the Digital Anatomist Program at the National Library of Medicine, and 

        Dr. Raymond Gasser a prominent embryologist on the Nomina Embryologica 

        panel. These annotations will provide researchers and viewers a set of 

        section images from embryos with all the prominent structures visible 

        outlined and labeled. </p>

      <h1>Developing the automated imaging process</h1>

      <p class="normal">Hardware</p>

      <p class="normal">SONY DTK5 digital video cameras attached to Nikon E800 microscopes 

        with plan apo lenses. 2000X2000 resolution images are 15mb each. Ludl 

        stages allow for automatic 3 dimensional stage movement. Dell computers 

        with high-end video cards and extra memory provide local storage, and 

        microscope control. A Silicon Graphics Origin 200 with a 200 GB RAID works 

        as a local data server and short-term storage. </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="lockett.image2.jpg" width="308" height="238" alt="Fig2: Workflow and software development"/></p>

      <p class="normal">Fig2: Workflow and software development</p>

      <p class="normal">Off the shelf products form the core of tools used to image 

        and visualize data. ImagePro (Media Cybernetics) provides basic RS-232 

        control in support of stage manipulation. This includes client development 

        API to script end-user modifications written by graduate student from 

        George Mason University, Dave Brooks. Imagewhere software from Where?media 

        ltd. Was modified to create several watchdogs to help automate the archiving 

        process and provide a tool to view data via regular Internet.</p>

      <p class="normal">Current imaging procedure was reviewed to see where automated 

        processes could be added. After review, a decision was made to dedicate 

        one microscope to 2x capture and 2 scopes to 20x capture. This eliminated 

        problems in variations due to adjusting condensers and filters and lenses. 

        All slide capture begins with calibration of the 2X and 20X scopes by 

        using travel limits of the stage, x0,y0 in the upper left. A spectral 

        calibration is made and stored as metadata, and on 20x capture a verification 

        of overlap between tiles is done. </p>

      <p class="normal">On the 2X capture scope, software functions are exercised 

        to automatically capture tiled images of the cover slipped area of a 2X3 

        slide. These images provide the spatial map for the 20x capture which 

        follows. On the 20X scopes, Imagepro calls up the 2X spatial map of the 

        slide. On this image the user must draw boxes called the Regions Of Interest 

        (ROI) around areas containing data. These will be the areas, which are 

        captured at 20X. These coordinates are stored as metadata, incorporated 

        into the XML document later. </p>

      <h1>Collection and storage of data</h1>

      <p class="normal">Tissue section images form the largest portion of the data 

        collected and served by this project.</p>

      <p class="normal">Tiles - 15 MB per tile</p>

      <p class="normal">Sections - up to 100 tiles per section - 1.5 GB</p>

      <p class="normal">Embryo - up to 700 sections per embryo - 1 TB</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="lockett.image3.jpg" width="226" height="243" alt="fig3"/></p>

      <p class="normal">Collected data is stored initially as a lossless TIFF image. 

        Metadata such as session information, information about the lens and filters, 

        regions of interest and XY coordinates necessary for reconstruction of 

        tiled images is transferred via software generated XML documents. Imagewhere 

        watchdogs, internal scripts that monitor specified directories for new 

        files, move images from capture stations to a UNIX based RAID large enough 

        to hold 3 days of capture information, ~200 GB. Using conversion tools 

        resident on the UNIX machine, smaller lossey JPEG sets are created of 

        the 2X maps for use in regular net viewing tools. Imagewhere archives 

        a set of metadata, which stays resident on a local server, as well as 

        a set of the smaller lossy images. This provides search and visualization 

        capability for users via html. Images and metadata are grabbed by other 

        archiving watchdogs that automatically push images and metadata to the 

        San Diego Super Computing (SDSC) facility where 10 terabytes of on-line 

        storage are available for the project. Where?media&#39;s interface also 

        provides a tool for visual checks of the data before and during transfer 

        to SDSC, as well as the broad internet user interface. </p>

      <p class="normal">SDSC serves and controls data with the Storage Resource 

        Broker (SRB). This tool acts as an intermediary, locating data through 

        out a distributed system for any requestor by giving data URL and updating 

        that URL association on the fly so if data is moved to another location, 

        the SRB will keep track and automatically update the database and metadata 

        catalogue with the new URL.</p>

      <h3><b>Educational tools</b></h3>

      <p class="normal">The University of Illinois Chicago Medical School, working 

        with the Biomedical Visualization Department, are creating embryo models 

        using the images collected from the project. These are being combined 

        with other technologies to create on-line courses in embryology, which 

        are being incorporated into the University curriculum. These tools will 

        be evaluated and modified over the 3-year project. </p>

      <h3><b>Collaborative Tools</b></h3>

      <p class="normal">The first of the collaborative tools to be developed was 

        the incorporation and modification of on-line conferencing tools by George 

        Mason University. Using M-Bone technology video and whiteboard tools provide 

        ways for remote collaborators to meet bi-weekly to discuss the project. 

        The second tool underdevelopment by Eolas Technologies has been an on-line 

        annotation system that will allow researchers in OHSU to outline and label 

        structures on the embryo section images. These annotations and labels 

        are saved into the database and become part of the information that all 

        researchers and students are able to query and access on-line. The outline 

        of the structures and organ systems become the basis for 3-D computer 

        models which are created &#34;on-fly&#34; by SDSC servers as requested. The labels 

        associated with a structure in 2-D stay associated in the 3-D map by using 

        associations in the hierarchical naming system. </p>

      <p class="normal">Other interactive tools for the clinical teams are in very 

        early stages of development and will be produced in later stages of the 

        project.</p>

      <h1>Future</h1>

      <p class="normal">The neuro anatomical collections in the museum has many 

        similar requirements to those of HDAC. The current initiative will translate 

        well to this other department and provide many useful tools that are not 

        currently available to its researchers. Use of the labeled models for 

        gene mapping and gene expression is currently under investigation.</p>
