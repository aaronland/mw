      <h1 class="PaperTitle">Building a Web-based Collaborative Database--does 

        it work?</h1>

      <h2 class="Author">Nuala A. Bennett, Trevor Jones Digital Imaging and Media 

        Technology Initiative University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA</h2>

      <h1 class="abstractTitle">Abstract:</h1>

      <p class="AbstractText">Designed to create a model collaborative environment, 

        the Digital Cultural Heritage Community Project (DCHC) focuses on the 

        digitization of materials from Central Illinois museums, archives and 

        libraries for integration into elementary grades&#39; social science 

        curricula. Using teachers&#39; curriculum units and the Illinois State 

        Board of Education Learning Standards for Social Sciences as a framework, 

        curators, librarians and archivists identify primary source materials 

        from their collections for inclusion in a Web-based database to be used 

        in third, fourth and fifth grade classrooms. The DCHC provides a means 

        for museums, libraries and archives to identify common ground among their 

        collections, and to provide schools with digital access to these materials. 

        The Early American Museum (EAM) joined the DCHC out of a desire to digitize 

        and increase electronic access to its collections. In this paper, we will 

        discuss both the initial aims and goals of the DCHC from the standpoint 

        of a large university library responsible for administering the project, 

        as well as from the perspective of a smaller participant museum. We will 

        discuss the artifact selection process for the database, and the implementation 

        of a single database for a wide variety of collections, with particular 

        reference to how the database design was viewed by the Early American 

        Museum. Finally, we will explain how the project worked in reality.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class="normal">Designed to create a model collaborative environment, the 

        Digital Cultural Heritage Community Project (<a href="http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/dchc">http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/dchc</a>) 

        focuses on the digitization of materials from Central Illinois museums, 

        archives and libraries for integration into elementary grades&#39; social 

        science curricula. The ultimate goal of the project is to enable early 

        and late elementary grade teachers in the locality to integrate digital 

        cultural heritage materials into their curriculum, utilizing the Illinois 

        State Board of Education Learning Standards. The project, which is administered 

        by a unit of the University of Illinois Library at Urbana-Champaign, involves 

        five other museum, archive and library partners and three elementary schools. 

      </p>

      <h1>Project Participants</h1>

      <p class="normal">The Digital Imaging and Media Technology Initiative (<u><a href="http://images.library.uiuc.edu/">http://images.library.uiuc.edu</a></u>) 

        administers the Digital Cultural Heritage Community (DCHC) project. The 

        Digital Imaging and Media Technology Initiative (DIMTI) is a part of the 

        University of Illinois Library at Urbana-Champaign. The unit was originally 

        established in 1994 to perform research with collections and users to 

        determine the best methods of providing digital access to the University 

        Library&#39;s collections, The overall goals of the Digital Imaging and Media 

        Technology Initiative program include: utilizing digital methods to preserve 

        and to make accessible fragile and under-utilized visual resources; to 

        promote the use of digital media throughout the campus and scholarly community; 

        and to conduct research that advances the creation and use of these resources. These goals are met by establishing &#34;best practices&#34; for digitizing 

        various classes of visual and textual materials, by developing multimedia 

        databases that deliver visual resources and other media in innovative 

        ways, and by conducting research on the ways in which visual information 

        (photographs, drawings, illustrations, etc.) is used in the digital environment.</p>

      <p class="normal">Other museum and library participants in the DCHC include 

        the Illinois Heritage Association, the McLean County Museum of History, 

        Lincoln Trail Libraries System, the Rare Book and Special Collections 

        Library at the University of Illinois and the Early American Museum. The 

        Early American Museum (<u><a href="http://node-02.advancenet.net/~early/">http://node-02.advancenet.net/~early/</a></u>), 

        which is accredited by the American Association for Museums, is located 

        in Mahomet, Illinois and is a facility of the Champaign County Forest 

        Preserve District. It has an extensive collection interpreting 19th- and 

        early 20th-century life in east-central Illinois. Two floors of exhibits 

        present information on architecture, agriculture, trades and occupations, 

        decorative arts, and childhood and domestic life in the past. The Discovery 

        Room offers hands-on opportunities for children, and educational programs 

        are offered for all ages throughout the year. The museum has an annual 

        budget of under $250,000 and a full time staff of three. The museum&#39;s 

        mission is to collect, preserve and interpret the history of East Central 

        Illinois, specifically Champaign County, for the education and enjoyment 

        of present and future generations. </p>

      <p class="normal">In this paper, we will discuss both the initial aims and 

        goals of the DCHC from the standpoint of a large university library responsible 

        for administering the project, as well as from the perspective of one 

        smaller participant museum, the Early American Museum (EAM). EAM joined 

        the DCHC out of a desire to digitize and increase electronic access to 

        its collections. The EAM curator was excited by the project&#39;s goal 

        of putting &#34;primary materials at teachers&#39; fingertips through the 

        Internet&#34; [1] and hoped that it would provide an effective way for the 

        museum to make its artifacts available in local classrooms. The experiences 

        or comments of other curators or librarians participating in the DCHC 

        might differ from those of the museum&#39;s curator, but this paper will 

        only discuss the EAM experience.</p>

      <h1>Time Commitment</h1>

      <p class="normal">Before the proposal for the project was finalized and submitted 

        to the IMLS for funding, the director of each participating museum and 

        library was asked to sign a letter of commitment agreeing that a staff 

        person would work on the project for a minimum of two hours a week. Similarly, 

        school principals also signed a letter showing that they understood the 

        project would involve teacher time of two hours a week. In order to monitor 

        each partner&#39;s contributions, time sheets were distributed and each 

        partner submitted their hours to the Project Coordinator on a monthly 

        basis. There was also an online version of the time sheet so that those 

        who wished could submit their hours online.</p>

      <p class="normal">It was appreciated by DIMTI that it was up to each partner 

        to fulfill their obligation to the project, and that the work might require 

        more than two hours a week. At the EAM, the curator sometimes spent much 

        longer than two hours in one week doing work for the DCHC. However, while 

        some weeks the curator would spend a lot more time than two hours working 

        on the project, during other weeks he would put in considerably less time. 

        At the end of the year, he calculated that he had spent approximately 

        100 hours over the course of a full year, which averages out to slightly 

        less than two hours a week. </p>

      <p class="normal">The EAM is open on a seasonal basis throughout the year. 

        Because of this, the amount of time the curator spent working on the project 

        did not necessarily detract from other projects at the museum. The biggest 

        issue in terms of time was trying to create enough free time for extensive 

        research that would benefit the DCHC. Although the process of digitizing 

        information was not particularly time-consuming, the curator needed larger 

        blocks of time to consider the interpretation of artifacts for the database. 

        Experience now tells us that it would have been easier for the curator 

        if artifacts chosen for the DCHC database could somehow also have been 

        coordinated with exhibit development at the museum. </p>

      <p class="normal">As at most small museums, artifact research at the Early 

        American Museum is almost always undertaken only in conjunction with the 

        exhibit development process. The museum usually completes one major exhibit 

        project each year. If, for example, the museum were working on an exhibit 

        about growing up in the early 1900s, it would have been easiest for the 

        museum to digitize and interpret artifacts related to this theme. The 

        problem of course, is that the museums and the teachers, as well as the 

        libraries, are rarely flexible enough to change their plans for a specific 

        project like the DCHC. Collaborative projects, however, that served both 

        the teacher&#39;s educational objectives and the museum&#39;s exhibition objectives 

        could potentially serve both parties well. This type of collaboration 

        was beyond the scope of our project, but it raises intriguing possibilities 

        for the future.</p>

      <h1>Choosing Materials for Digitization</h1>

      <p class="normal">The DCHC was set up to provide a means for museums, libraries 

        and archives to identify common ground among their collections, and to 

        provide schools with digital access to these materials. One of the first 

        aspects of the project was to choose the collections that would be digitized 

        for the online database. The teachers participating in the DCHC project 

        were teaching third, fourth and fifth grade students. In order to give 

        a sense of what kinds of artifacts and items the teachers would like in 

        the database, they first shared with the museum curators, librarians and 

        archivists, their curriculum units for social sciences (<u><a href="http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/dchc/resources.htm">http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/dchc/resources.htm</a></u>).</p>

      <h1>Illinois Learning Standards</h1>

      <p class="normal">In Illinois schools, the teachers must adhere to learning 

        standards, as recommended by the Illinois State Board of Education. Adopted 

        in 1997, the Illinois Learning Standards for Social Science (<u><a href="http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ils/socscience/social.html" target="new">http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ils/socscience/social.html</a></u>) 

        outline expectations for student learning in the classroom from early 

        elementary through high school education. The standards are a means to 

        assess student achievement and &#34;define what Illinois citizens believe 

        all students should know and be able to do as a result of their public 

        schooling&#34; [2]. They also help to provide fair and equitable education 

        for all students throughout the state. </p>

      <p class="normal">The teachers also included the Illinois State Board of Education 

        Learning Standards for Social Sciences appropriate to each curriculum 

        unit. The third grade curriculum units were more appropriate to the early 

        elementary level of Learning Standards, while the fourth and fifth grade 

        units corresponded to the late elementary Learning Standards. Curriculum 

        units covered a broad spectrum within the social sciences. The Third Grade 

        units ranged from &#34;How we learn about communities&#34;, &#34;Communities and their 

        geography&#34; to &#34;Celebrations and Festivals&#34;, while the Fourth Grade units 

        included &#34;French in Illinois&#34;, &#34;Prehistoric Indians of Illinois&#34; and &#34;Government 

        in Illinois.&#34; Fifth Grade units covered topics from &#34;The English Colonies&#34;, 

        &#34;U.S. Constitution and Government&#34;, &#34;Westward Expansion&#34; to &#34;Revolutionary 

        War.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">Using the Illinois State Board of Education Learning Standards 

        for Social Sciences as a framework, and the teachers&#39; curriculum 

        units as a guiding source, the curators, librarians and archivists then 

        identified primary source materials from their collections for inclusion 

        in a Web-based database to be used in the third, fourth and fifth grade 

        classrooms. They were to choose materials that would be particularly appropriate 

        to the curriculum units submitted by the teachers. At DIMTI, we had anticipated 

        that there would be many artifacts in each of the participating museums 

        and libraries that could be digitized for use in the classroom by the 

        teachers.</p>

      <p class="normal">Deciding what to digitize for the project proved to be a 

        major challenge for the EAM. Within their curriculum units, the teachers 

        had some specific requests, but they were unsure of the type of things 

        museums had in their collections and how those artifacts could help with 

        their classroom teaching. The curriculum units each listed a theme, the 

        time spent on that theme, and the major historical events and figures 

        addressed. While the units provided the museum with some new ideas, they 

        also presented new problems. The units primarily focused on state and 

        national history, and only infrequently made use of local examples. </p>

      <p class="normal">Using the state&#39;s Learning Standards for Social Studies 

        alone to determine what artifacts to digitize would also prove very difficult 

        to implement. By using the standards, museums and libraries should theoretically 

        have been able to digitize artifacts that would mesh with social studies 

        curricula not only in the participant classrooms but also throughout the 

        state. A more challenging obstacle for determining what to digitize turned 

        out to be the vagueness of the standards themselves. Designed to provide 

        a broad framework for teaching, the standards include very few specific 

        recommendations, making it arduous to determine which specific artifacts 

        in the museum&#39;s collection could serve each particular learning goal. 

        At the same time, the curator could also think of several hundred other 

        artifacts that might serve equally well. The scope of the standards was 

        so broad that it was necessary to find a way to narrow down the list of 

        potential artifacts. </p>

      <h1>Curriculum Units</h1>

      <p class="normal">The vast scope of the curriculum units again created problems 

        for the EAM. The museum focuses on the history of East Central Illinois, 

        and consciously works to interpret the lives of ordinary people who do 

        not often show up in history textbooks. As a result, the collection includes 

        few objects of state or national significance, and has a limited chronological 

        scope. The collection includes some artifacts pertaining to Native Americans 

        and the expansion of the west, but the majority of artifacts were made 

        after Champaign County, Illinois (the county where the EAM is situated) 

        was founded in 1833. The museum collections could easily support the &#34;Westward 

        Expansion&#34; unit, a small section of the &#34;French in Illinois&#34; and &#34;Revolutionary 

        War&#34; units, but very little of the others. </p>

      <p class="normal">The museum had problems not only finding artifacts for the 

        teachers, but also in answering other requests which they posed. To the 

        EAM curator, the teachers often seemed to be seeking not simply images 

        of artifacts, but rather entire educational components which could be 

        used to expand their curriculum. Their requests for &#34;a pictorial timeline 

        of different transportation methods&#34; for a unit on &#34;American Communities 

        in History&#34;, or &#34;theories about the decline of the Hopewells and the Mississippians&#34; 

        for a Native American unit made it clear that the teachers were looking 

        to the museums and libraries for answers that required substantial historical 

        interpretation. </p>

      <p class="normal">Through subsequent online discussions with all project participants, 

        the museum curators, archivists and librarians suggested artifacts from 

        their collections that might be digitized to match the teachers&#39; 

        curriculum units. They also suggested resources that the teachers might 

        not have considered using, but which the curators and librarians felt 

        matched the Illinois State Learning Standards corresponding to the teachers&#39; 

        units. Artifacts were eventually chosen for digitization through extensive 

        online discussions with the teachers. In the end a substantial number 

        of artifacts were chosen not because of the teachers originally requested 

        them, but because the museum curators and librarians suggested items to 

        the teachers who in turn agreed that they would be useful. </p>

      <h1>Digitization of Materials</h1>

      <p class="normal">DIMTI organized a scanning workshop to ensure that all museum 

        curators and librarians would be able to produce quality and consistent 

        images for use in the final online database. The focus of the workshop 

        was the capture of print or graphical materials and creation of digital 

        files, as opposed to other aspects of scanning such as file storage, object 

        description or intellectual property issues. Participants were introduced 

        to scanner operation, the use of scanning utilities, image manipulation 

        software, resolution, color-depth, and quality indices as well as calibration 

        of scanners and monitors for optimal digitization. They also learned about 

        the general guidelines for digitization as presented by the Library of 

        Congress [3] and also, using the Cornell University digitization formulae 

        [4]. The Library of Congress guidelines cover formats used for archiving 

        and for Web access to their American Memory collections (<u><a href="http://memory.loc.gov/">http://memory.loc.gov/</a></u>). 

        The Library of Congress guidelines are an &#34;attempt to balance reproduction 

        quality, convenience of access, likely longevity of the format itself, 

        production cost, and a preference for true standard formats or for industry 

        formats that have been widely adopted&#34;. </p>

      <p class="normal">Guidelines have been set up at the Library of Congress for 

        three categories of image -- thumbnail, access and archival. For example, 

        the Library of Congress guidelines recommend that thumbnail images of 

        photographs be 72 dpi and 150-200 pixels across the long dimension. The 

        access image is a higher quality image that has been compressed for speed 

        of access and has a lower spatial resolution than the archival image. 

        In turn, the archival image is an uncompressed image, which would be useful 

        for users for reproduction efforts or held for future reprocessing as 

        compression or other image-processing standards might change. In the 

        case of a photograph, the image should be 3,000 to 5,000 pixels across 

        the long dimension. The Library of Congress recommends guidelines for 

        different types of artifacts. For the DCHC, we concentrated on those guidelines 

        for scanning text documents, photographs, maps, and graphic materials 

        such as artwork.</p>

      <p class="normal">Although all of the project participants agreed to adhere 

        to the standards, they had little experience of digitizing for archival 

        purposes or for specific online databases, and it took time for some participants 

        to become familiar with the requirements for the DCHC database. Creating 

        archival images at local museums and libraries would take up a lot of 

        computer storage, and take up costly space to download the images directly 

        into the database over a modem connection. Therefore, participants were 

        also supplied with CD writers in order to able to burn their images onto 

        CD. The complete CDs were subsequently mailed to the Digital Imaging and 

        Media Technology Initiative in order to download the images into the database. 

        It is worth pointing out that for a bigger project, this would create 

        a lot of CDs for storage, so other storage facilities might be investigated.</p>

      <h1>Artifact Description</h1>

      <p class="normal">The participants simultaneously determined the steps necessary 

        to make the final digital content available to teachers and students, 

        and to create the digital repository that would be accessible through 

        the project Web site. In order to create an integrated system usable by 

        each participant institution, the use of metadata for the image database 

        was of major concern. The next workshop held in conjunction with the DCHC 

        was a daylong session to address metadata issues. Participants came to 

        terms with metadata topics and then discussed their institutional concerns 

        about metadata. For example, the museum participants were all very concerned 

        about interpretive comments about artifacts, while library participants 

        were less concerned about interpretation. We believe all DCHC project 

        participants would agree with Abby Smith from the Council of Library and 

        Information Resources, when she said, &#34;Museums ... have a mandate to 

        interpret. Librarians ... traditionally place a high value on making 

        information accessible without mediation&#34; [5].</p>

      <h1>Database Design</h1>

      <p class="normal">DIMTI had to develop a set of guidelines and standards for 

        the museums and libraries to enable the creation of a consistent database 

        that would easily map between different controlled vocabularies and organizational 

        data. It was decided to base the fields in the database on the Dublin 

        Core (DC) fields, but due to the diversity of the partners and their collections, 

        some adjustment of the original fifteen DC fields was necessary. Figure 

        1 shows a sample record from the database with each of the fifteen fields 

        shown in bold. Almost none of the participants had worked with DC before 

        their involvement in this project, so it was imperative to set very specific 

        guidelines to enable the entering data into the database with complete 

        consistency. </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="bennett-fig1.jpg" width="400" height="274" alt="Example record from the Illinois Heritage Association.  The fields are listed in bold type."/><br/>

        Figure 1. Example record from the Illinois Heritage Association. The 

        fields are listed in bold type.</p>

      <p class="normal">Dublin Core is a set of fifteen elements, or fields, that 

        are intended for facilitation of electronic resources. This element set 

        has several characteristics that made it ideal for the DCHC. In particular, 

        its relative simplicity enabled us to ensure that all project participants 

        could quickly grasp the relevant issues. Its semantic interoperability 

        also made it a prime candidate for project users at museums and libraries, 

        with very diverse collections. Finally, the DC extensibility also allowed 

        for additional metadata elements, which could encompass the variety of 

        the participating institutions. (There is a more detailed discussion of 

        the database fields in [6]). </p>

      <h1>Interpretation of Artifacts</h1>

      <p class="normal">While the DCHC database was designed to digitize and make 

        accessible items from the partner institution&#39;s various collections, 

        it was not specifically intended as an aid to interpreting the meaning 

        of these artifacts for teachers. Digital and cataloging expert Jim Blackaby 

        wrote in his letter of support [7] for the DCHC that the project &#34;focuses 

        on making primary materials available in a context that is enabling. It 

        is not the delivery of interpreted materials, such as an exhibit, which 

        is momentarily satisfying and may address immediate needs, but in the 

        long run may lose some of its efficacy. Where libraries and archives have 

        focused on building a solid core of information systems that provide access 

        to primary materials, museums have not. In this respect, those institutions 

        and their methods bring museums along&#34;.</p>

      <p class="normal">The decision originally not to build an interpretive component 

        into the original DCHC design proved to be very frustrating for the EAM 

        and reflects philosophical differences between museums (especially history 

        museums) and libraries. Historians believe that historical events must 

        be placed in a broader context in order to have meaning, while libraries 

        often feel that their primary role is to provide objective access to information. 

        Museum professionals in general are keenly aware that it is almost impossible 

        to provide objective information in the museum context. The process of 

        choosing which objects to exhibit, how they are labeled, and the decision 

        whether to mount them at front or the back of a case all work to tell 

        visitors what we think is important for them to know. In the words of 

        M. Jane Young, simply placing an object on a shelf &#34;changes the shape 

        of the object, divorcing it from contextual relationships, isolating it 

        from experience, and thus largely predetermining the visitor&#39;s perception 

        of it&#34; [8].</p>

      <p class="normal">While it is also true that libraries interpret data, their 

        interpretive functions are less pervasive than in museums. Libraries interpret 

        by choosing which books to purchase or not purchase and by recommending 

        titles to their patrons. Regardless of whether interpretation is typically 

        a library function, it became one for all of the DCHC partners during 

        the course of the project. All of the partner institutions performed a 

        clear interpretive task by choosing which artifacts, photographs and maps 

        to digitize and place on the DCHC database. </p>

      <p class="normal">Interpretation is much more powerful and useful, however, 

        when interpretation of artifacts is acknowledged as important, and a conscious 

        effort is made to do it well. Good interpretation does not mean telling 

        visitors or patrons what to think, but rather provides a basis for them 

        to ask questions and learn answers for themselves. Museums can play an 

        important role in this process by providing access to artifacts and contextual 

        information about them. In general people &#34;respond more directly and immediately 

        to objects than to verbalized concepts. Artifacts do seem to inspire, 

        excite, motivate and communicate&#34;<sup> </sup>[9]. This concept of interpretation 

        of artifacts was very new to almost all the librarians participating in 

        the DCHC.</p>

      <p class="normal">At the EAM, the goal is to help teachers use artifacts to 

        inspire and motivate their students to get excited about history. An important 

        part of the museum&#39;s educational role is to provide teachers with 

        the type of specialized historical information they might not have the 

        time or expertise to gather. The museum curator sees artifacts as useful 

        in that they help to communicate ideas to the public. The power of artifacts 

        stems from the stories they can tell about the lives of people in the 

        past, and our lives in the present. Originally the DCHC database made 

        no provision for communicating these stories to the teachers who would 

        use the artifacts in the classroom. All of the partner teachers wanted 

        to use artifacts to teach their students, but most knew little about 19th 

        century material culture or how to effectively incorporate it into their 

        lesson plans. </p>

      <p class="normal">An artifact from the DCHC database, as seen in Figure 2, 

        helps illustrate the importance of contextual information. One artifact 

        the Early American Museum digitized was a bed key. The description in 

        the DCHC database states that it is made of wood, is 12.25&#34; long, consists 

        of a Y-shaped shank with a round cross bar pegged near the top, and was 

        made between 1775 and 1830. This information is descriptive, but it does 

        not help elementary school students learn about the past. Adding interpretive 

        information might make a digital image of this artifact more useful: &#34;In 

        the 19th century many bed frames used ropes to hold up mattresses which 

        were often filled with corn husks. It was hard to sleep well on a saggy 

        mattress, so periodically people had to tighten the ropes in order to 

        sleep well -- this is where the phrase &#34;sleep tight&#34; comes from.&#34; This 

        snippet of interpretive information connects the past to the present and 

        helps the artifact come alive. By using the artifact as an introduction, 

        a teacher could use it as a springboard to discuss the cycle of a pioneer&#39;s 

        day, sleeping habits, notions of privacy, the importance of corn in pioneer 

        life, or any number of other things. </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="bennett-fig2.jpg" width="400" height="243" alt="Bedkey, example image from the Early American Museum."/><br/>

        Figure 2. Bedkey, example image from the Early American Museum.</p>

      <p class="normal">Although the original DCHC concept contained no provisions 

        for interpretation, the project&#39;s database, based on Dublin Core, 

        was modified to include a separate interpretive field. The new field provided 

        a method to add the interpretive information, which the EAM feels is so 

        crucial. The addition of Interpretation was considered a major improvement 

        to the database, but additional work could still be done. Even with the 

        interpretive field in place the majority of the artifacts in the database 

        are still expected to &#34;speak&#34; for themselves, and most of the information 

        entered into the interpretation field remains superficial. Ideally, the 

        museum curator would like interpretation to be a central part of the DCHC 

        database. Each digitized image could be tied to an appended list of potential 

        sources, links to other sites, comparisons with similar objects, and tie-ins 

        to larger historical themes and arguments.</p>

      <p class="normal">Unfortunately, the problem with good interpretation is that 

        it takes a lot of time. Writing even a short descriptive paragraph with 

        minimal interpretive information for each digitized item is a painstaking 

        process, and placing each item into a broader historical context would 

        be an even greater challenge. The amount of time necessary to do this 

        could run into many more hours than the two hours each week originally 

        agreed to by all participants. Nevertheless, the EAM curator thinks it 

        is worth doing. Putting images in a database facilitates access to museum 

        and library collections, which may be useful to researchers, but it can 

        fail to make history come alive for elementary school students. If projects 

        like the DCHC are truly more interested in assisting educators do a better 

        job teaching American history, rather than simply providing access to 

        information, we need to spend more time making what we digitize useful 

        for teachers and students and less time worrying about getting it on the 

        Web. In fact, every participant of the DCHC feels so strongly about the 

        importance of using the database for education that we are planning for 

        2001-2002 to work on a new project, &#34;Teaching with Digital Content--Describing, 

        Finding and Using Digital Cultural Heritage Materials&#34; (<u><a href="http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/tdc">http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/tdc</a></u>), 

        where we hope such issues can be addressed.</p>

      <h1>Agreements between Partners</h1>

      <p class="normal">Intellectual property issues involved in the digitization 

        of images include the right to distribute materials, permissions to host 

        materials, institutional ownership, content that could be offensive to 

        some users, and conditions of use. Because the DCHC partners were concerned 

        with these matters, the partners worked to develop a set of terms and 

        conditions into a Collaborative Agreement for digital access to their 

        collections. </p>

      <p class="normal">The agreement ensures that there are no misunderstandings 

        among partners either during the course of the project or after it is 

        officially completed. Project participants agreed to provide selected 

        images and accompanying information in digitized form. The agreement outlines 

        procedures for making the digitized images, descriptive text and other 

        media available to participating institutions in agreed upon formats, 

        and confirms how works are selected for inclusion in the project. The 

        agreement also covers copyright issues, such as whose responsibility it 

        is to obtain permissions to digitize objects, and it confirms that images 

        and their accompanying metadata remain the intellectual property of the 

        partner. </p>

      <p class="normal">As well as the collaborative agreement for each partner 

        institution, a &#34;Conditions of Use&#34; (<a href="http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/dchc/conditions.htm">http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/dchc/conditions.htm</a>) 

        statement for the project Web site was also created. In this case, the 

        statement was created for the protection of the project participants and 

        the database users. </p>

      <p class="normal">The EAM supports the commitment to maintain the database 

        for at least two years beyond its official end date. The EAM was not particularly 

        concerned with possible copyright violations, as it does not generate 

        revenue from its collection the way that a larger museum might. A larger 

        institution might be concerned with possible revenue losses if the database 

        was maintained for a longer term. The EAM is, however, concerned about 

        the interpretation of artifacts and the use of the interpretation as it 

        sits on the DCHC web site. This will have to be monitored as closely 

        as possible over the next few years.</p>

      <h1>Future Plans</h1>

      <p class="normal">From the perspective of the university library, the project 

        has been a success. The DCHC was set up as a &#34;Model Program of Cooperation&#34; 

        and in that perspective it was an excellent example of cooperation among 

        several diverse institutions. Work was carried out collaboratively in 

        various forms. There were several workshops and meetings with all project 

        participants, as well as many on-site visits from project staff. Communication 

        was also carried out by telephone, email, initially using a Listserv and 

        subsequently switching to an online web-based discussion board (WebboardTM). 

        Everything that was initially planned for the project was carried out. 

        The project began with a timeline of activities set out for the course 

        of the project. While the activities on the timeline may have moved during 

        the project lifespan, the actual activities were all completed, some more 

        or less than initially planned. Some parts of the project, such as selection 

        of artifacts and entering them into the database took considerably longer 

        than anticipated. Nevertheless, the database took shape and became available 

        to the teachers for use in their classrooms.</p>

      <p class="normal">The true test of the usefulness of the database itself is 

        how it is used by teachers and students. The most exciting part about 

        the DCHC is that it can make it easier for teachers and students to view 

        a diversity of collections in their own classroom. We are currently carrying 

        out more research into how the teachers actually use the database images 

        in their curriculum. As part of this research, future extensive outcome-based 

        evaluation studies will help us ascertain how much use the database is 

        actually receiving from our local users as well as from users worldwide. 

        Further work will be done to develop innovative ways in which teachers 

        may further develop their curriculum units using the images in the database. 

        In order to continue to push the boundaries of the project we have also 

        have enlisted the support of an Advisory Group of eight experts from various 

        fields who provide suggestions on how to improve the DCHC in the future.
