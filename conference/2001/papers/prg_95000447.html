      <p class="PaperTitle">The Virtual Aura - Is There Space for Enchantment in 

        a Technological World? </p>

      <p class="Author">Susan Hazan, The<span lang="EN-GB"> Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 

        Israel</span></p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">As Walter Benjamin described in his famous essay, 

        &#34;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&#34;, the 

        role of art in society and the notion that art has become modified through 

        mechanical reproduction has engaged not only artists, but also curators 

        and the museum public. Benjamin embraced the severing of the quasi-mystical 

        &#39;aura&#39; from the original as a potentially liberating phenomenon, both 

        for the reproduction of works of art and for the art of film, thereby 

        making works of art widely available, introducing new forms of perception 

        in film and photography and allowing art to move from private to public, 

        from the elite to the masses. While the loss of the aura for Benjamin 

        represented new possibilities, what was forfeited in this process were 

        the &#39;aura&#39; and the authority of the object containing within it the values 

        of cultural heritage and tradition. This paper evaluates the different 

        ways that museums are responding to life on the Net, and will look to 

        three models of museum Web-sites: the documentation of traditional collections 

        through online databases, the virtual museum with no concrete counterpart 

        to resonate the online experience and the proliferation of Web based contemporary 

        art. This attempt to map out the different ways that museums formulate 

        their identity on the Net will address the notion of the lost aura or 

        perhaps the emergence of new cultural phenomena, the virtual aura.</p>

      <p class="AbstractText"><b>Key Words</b>: Walter Benjamin, aura, Michel Foucault, 

        Scott Lash &amp; John Urry, Anthony Giddens, Alfred Gell, magic, enchantment</p>

      <p class="Normal">There are as many reasons to seek out an online museum as 

        there are to visit the real museum, and museum Web sites are addressing 

        a wide range of these experiences. While some Web sites demand that we 

        sit upright in our chairs for a traditional, pedagogical kind of experience, 

        at other times, we are less focused and enjoy a more passive, relaxed 

        kind of interaction with the screen. In much the same way as we may watch 

        a film or a television program in a state of distraction, we act as observer, 

        but an absent-minded one. As we sit in front of the monitor and connect 

        to the dancing images in front of us, we allow electronic images and sounds 

        to radiate from the screen and seep into our inner world. In a post-modern, 

        wired society, the online museum brings the virtual image from remote 

        locations into the foreground. This paper will investigate different models 

        of online museum and the cultural processes involved when objects in the 

        concrete museum are not only represented by surrogates, but also have 

        been liberated or dispelled from their rhizome and distributed in electronic 

        packets to remote locations in a networked world.</p>

      <p class="Normal">This paper evaluates the different ways museums are responding 

        to life on the Net, and will explore three models of museum Web sites. 

        The first model provides a metaphor for the traditional museum which provides 

        access to digital collections through online databases such as the <b>Thinker 

        ImageBase, </b>(<a href="http://www.thinker.org/" target="new">http://www.thinker.org/</a>) 

        of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (the de Young Museum and the 

        Legion of Honor), USA. In the second model, the virtual museum metaphor 

        is explored in <b>MUVA, El Pais Virtual Museum of Art</b> (<a href="http://www.diarioelpais.com/muva2/" target="new">http://www.diarioelpais.com/muva2/</a>). 

        The El Pais site exemplifies a virtual construction which maintains a 

        tenuous base in reality. For the third model I have selected two further 

        web sites, both net art projects: <b>&#34;Uncomfortable Proximity&#34; 

        (</b><a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/" target="new">http://www.tate.org.uk</a> <a name="_Hlt507672071"></a> 

        ) at the Tate Modern Web site, and <b>&#34;Geist&#34;</b>, (<a href="http://www.mediascot.org/geist" target="new">http://www.mediascot.org/geist</a>). 

        Where the &#39;real&#39; Tate provides floor plans, the Tate Mongrel project, 

        created by Harwood, takes us under the floor of the Tate. The Geist Project, 

        by Colin Andrews of the New Media Group, Scotland, presents an eerie Web 

        site involving ghosts.</p>

      <p class="Normal">This paper will attempt to map out the different ways museums 

        formulate their identities on the Net and will address the notion of the 

        lost aura or perhaps the emergence of a new cultural phenomenon, the virtual 

        aura.</p>

      <h1>The Age of Mechanical Reproduction</h1>

      <p class="Normal">Walter Benjamin, writing against the backdrop of the Nazi 

        era in 1936, in his famous essay, &#34;The Work of Art in the Age of 

        Mechanical Reproduction&#34;, described the role of art in society and 

        the way in which art had become modified through mechanical reproduction. 

        Benjamin embraced the severing of the quasi-mystical &#39;aura&#39; from the original 

        as a potentially liberating phenomenon. Making works of art widely available 

        opened new forms of perception in film and photography, and the accessibility 

        of art could move from private to public, from the elite to the masses. 

        While at the same time questioning the need for authenticity, Benjamin 

        welcomed the close-ups and slow motion of the moving image in that they 

        opened up new art values that were no longer so dependant on cult values 

        or ritual. Thus Benjamin&#39;s work was seminal in bringing into focus the 

        notion of art as politic. This insight, according to Benjamin, meant that</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">For the first time in world history, mechanical reproduction 

        emancipates the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual. 

        (Benjamin: 1935, 1992). </p>

      <p class="Normal">What had been forfeited in this process, were the &#39;aura&#39; 

        and the authority of the object, scarred, yet also embellished with the 

        patina of time and prismatic with the marks of human endeavour. It was 

        the aura that contained within it the values of cultural heritage and 

        tradition. Even though for Benjamin, the loss of the aura meant the loss 

        of the original, the transformation or liberation of the art object to 

        the ordinary represented a gain. For Benjamin, what had then replaced 

        the original at that time was the illusion of the moving image, and the 

        duplication of the photograph. For post-modern society, it has become 

        the digital image. While Benjamin celebrated the magical aura that had 

        been forfeited as a <i>liberating phenomenon</i>, one cannot help but 

        speculate whether there is still a need for a space of wonder or enchantment 

        in a technological world. Perhaps society still craves such a space, now 

        more than ever, and seeks it in extraordinary places, such as in the museum. 

        If so, then can this lost aura be compensated for or reconstituted in 

        any way in a virtual environment in a networked society?</p>

      <h1>Click to Go!</h1>

      <p class="Normal">The speed with which we are able to access remote museums 

        and pull them up side by side on the screen is alarmingly immediate. We 

        do this at the click of a mouse, and in a nano-instant of time. Scott 

        Lash and John Urry, (1994), argue that in the wake of organized capitalism, 

        the flows of objects (goods, capital, money, communications, commodities) 

        as well as subjects (labor, immigrants, tourists) are accelerating in 

        ever widening trajectories. According to Lash and Urry, this has disturbing 

        implications for society. As social relations are &#39;distanciated&#39;, it &#39;compresses&#39; 

        time and space, and is leading to an emptying out of both subjects and 

        objects. This accelerated mobility causes objects to become disposable 

        and to decline in significance, while social relationships are emptied 

        of meaning (Llash and Urry, 1994). With one click we can access an entire 

        museum. We are able in one glimpse to visualize in miniature all of its 

        multi-functions represented on its home page. While there is no doubt 

        that this provides efficient and meaningful information for remote visitors 

        regarding potential visits, should we query what kind of experience visitors 

        gain when they view the digital collections represented as tiny, two dimensional, 

        electronic reflections of the original works? Should we conclude that 

        this medium is orientated exclusively towards information and interpretation, 

        or could there be more to it?</p>

      <p class="Normal"><a>Anthony Giddens, (1990), argues that in post modern society 

        there has been a separation of time and space, and their recombination 

        in forms which permit precise time-spacing &#34;zoning&#34; of social 

        life, but which has consequently led to the disembedding of social systems 

        (Giddens, 1990). Giddens points to this severing of time as the cause 

        of place becoming increasingly <i>phantasmagoric</i> in that locales are 

        thoroughly penetrated by and shaped in terms of social influences that 

        are, in fact, quite distant from them (Giddens, 1990). Giddens emphasizes 

        that, </a> </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">What structures the locale is not simply that which 

        is present on the scene; the &#34;visible form&#34; of the locale but 

        what is present is also the relations concealed in the distance, and it 

        is the remote relations that is determining the nature of the local (Giddens, 

        1990)</p>

      <p class="Normal">For example, the city with numbered houses based on boulevards 

        and a grid structure, in which the high street has its Benettons, McDonalds, 

        and Nexts, is more abstract, more emptied out than the pre-modern city 

        of winding streets and numberless houses. The remotely accessed database 

        of museum collections seems to offer a similarly disembedded experience. 

        The vast distance covered in mere nano-seconds acts to dissolve the concrete-ness 

        of the real museum in front of our eyes, resulting in an emptying out 

        of the traditional visitor/museum experience and the disembedding of cultural 

        systems reflected in the museum.</p>

      <h1>Living In-Vitro</h1>

      <p class="Normal">In post-modern society, our participation in the public 

        sphere, understanding of current events, entertainment, and life long 

        education have come to depend more and more on mediated resources rather 

        than first hand, <i>getting our boots dirty</i> experience. The second 

        hand, virtual narratives, either through television or digital interaction, 

        cause us not merely to reflect on these experiences but to actively construct 

        our daily lives through them. We cannot be physically present at every 

        national celebration, and we do not want to be present in a war-zone. 

        We are content to let the camera be our eye and the anchorman our mouthpiece. 

        Where much of our life is <i>lived </i>through mediated rather than first 

        hand experience, much of our daily interaction is becoming more vitreous 

        than visceral. Over the last 40 years, most of the world&#39;s populations 

        have spent countless hours watching the world <i>in vivo, in vitro</i> 

        on screens in their living rooms, bedrooms and classrooms. We are content 

        to watch live sporting events from the comfort of an armchair; we receive 

        the daily fix of news on the allotted time slot; and we are faithful voyeurs 

        of other people&#39;s lives, some real, some not, playing out on weekly dramas 

        on the screen. Marc Auge reminds us of,</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">The false familiarity the small screen establishes between 

        the viewers and the actors of big-scale history, whose profiles become 

        as well known to us as those of soap-opera heroes and international artistic 

        or sporting stars 

      </p><p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Auge, 1995).</p><p></p>

      <p class="Normal">On the screen, the remote players become miniaturized in 

        our own personal microcosm, and as these tiny, yet familiar images flicker 

        into our internal vistas, they penetrate our lives just as potently as 

        other daily interactions and are often just as persuasive in their messages. 

        How often have we put down a book only to be rudely awakened to the reality 

        that we are sitting in our favorite armchair? How is it that we are shocked 

        by the brutality of the house lights turning on as the last scene of a 

        film fades away from our inner eye? Margaret Morse, (1998), describes 

        this state of distraction as the <i>fiction effect</i>; that is, the partial 

        loss of touch with the here and now, a state of distraction experienced 

        on the freeway, in shopping malls, and in television viewing (Morse, 99, 

        1998). Can digital images and messages be just as compelling as the magic 

        of literary space and cinematic experience? Can the tiny electronic stage, 

        set for one person and for one person only, be a convincing space of enchantment?</p>

      <h1>Seeking the Sacred Space</h1>

      <p class="Normal">According to Michel Foucault, (1964) we live our lives within 

        many kinds of intersecting social relations that overlap yet remain discrete. 

        He argues that while social space has been moving towards de-sacralization 

        since the time of Galileo, this process has been mainly theoretical. Where 

        once there was a hierarchy of sacred and profane spaces, as Foucault describes, 

        &#34;all laden with qualities and haunted by fantasy&#34;, in practical 

        terms, both in private and public space, relations are still being controlled 

        by an unspoken sacralization (Foucault, 1964). In order to fulfill this 

        desire for the sacred, contemporary society seeks to define spaces, separate 

        from mundane, everyday living. Foucault describes these spaces as <b>utopias</b>, 

        as spaces having no real place, as fundamentally and essentially unreal 

        where they act as an analogy with the real space of society. However, 

        according to Foucault, every civilization creates <i>real</i> places, 

        actual places, that serve to stage experiences, and consequently sets 

        them aside for extraordinary action. Despite Benjamin&#39;s celebration of 

        the mechanical reproduction that caused the separation of art from cult 

        values and ritual, we cannot deny that there is still a need for the sacred 

        in post-modern society. The liminal spaces that Foucault calls <b>heterotopias</b>, 

        while based in objective reality, act as the mirror that reflects. While 

        this reflected space may be concrete, in that it exists in a real location, 

        its social function at the same time serves to provide society with an 

        abstract locale to act out experiences at a time of crisis; a locale for 

        adolescents, menstruating women, women in labor, old people and so on 

        (Foucault, 1964). A derivation of the heterotopian space, according to 

        Foucault, is the heterochronia of time that accumulates indefinitely - 

        for example, museums and libraries. </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#34;Museums and libraries are heterotopias in which 

        time never ceases to pile up and perch on its own summit, whereas in the 

        seventeenth century, and up to the end of the seventeenth century still, 

        museums were the expression of an individual choice. By contrast, the 

        idea of accumulating every-thing, the idea of constituting a sort of general 

        archive, the desire to contain all times, all ages, all forms, all tastes 

        in one place, the idea of constituting a place of all times that is itself 

        outside time and protected from its erosion, the project of thus organizing 

        a kind of perpetual and indefinite accumulation of time in a place that 

        will nor move - well, in fact, all of this belongs to our modernity (Foucault, 

        1964).</p>

      <p class="Normal">If we follow Foucault&#39;s argument that the museum is already 

        an exceptional space, set aside by society for extraordinary activity, 

        when we view this already fabricated construction remotely through the 

        glass of the television or computer monitor, we surely will encounter 

        a further dislocation. In order to separate technological determination 

        from aesthetic experience, it would be useful to look to Alfred Gell&#39;s 

        approach on what it is that makes an artwork compelling in the first place. 

      </p>

      <h1>Enchanting Technology</h1>

      <p class="Normal">In his essay, <i>&#39;TheTechnology of Enchantment and the Enchantment 

        of Technology</i>&#39; (1992), Gell attempted to evaluate this mystical yet 

        nebulous trait from a socio-anthropological perspective. He looked to 

        the technological processes of <b>evolution of the artwork</b> to ascertain 

        what it was that was inspiring enchantment in the beholder. Gell determined 

        an essential property imbued within the art object that served as a component 

        of social systems. In his search for an overarching anthropological theory 

        to explain not only Western art, but what he terms non-Western art, he 

        implied that art objects cannot be evaluated when dislocated from their 

        social systems, but need to be seen in light of their circulation in society. 

        In this circulatory format, art is thought of as agency, invoking a series 

        of responses or interpretations perceived as indexes of relations to the 

        object, the artist, and the recipient (Gell, 1998, in the foreword by 

        Thomas, ix). Gell does not deny the aesthetic component of art, but considers 

        art as a technical system producing social consequences in much the same 

        way as a religion or belief system weaves the social fabric of a community. 

        This he calls <i>the technology of enchantment</i> and proposes that art-systems 

        be considered networks in society where neither the individual creator, 

        nor the agent, nor the <i>enchanting</i> art object itself, can be separated 

        from the collective process. This over-arching technical system, contributing 

        to the dynamic of culture, embodies a mystical process that &#34;<i>casts 

        a spell over us so that we see the real world in an enchanted form</i>&#34;. 

      </p>

      <p class="Normal">The technology of an art object differs from other objects 

        valued by society, such as beautiful horses, beautiful people, (Gell: 

        1992, 43) in that it is <i>man made,</i> emerging from the alchemy of 

        the occult technician, and reflects what Gell defines as the <i>&#39;enchantment 

        of technology.</i>&#39; The magic, or the aura of the art object, is brought 

        into being through the technological process itself. He<b> </b>illustrated 

        the universal attributes of technology common to all categories of man 

        made art objects, including classical oil paintings, sculptures by Picasso 

        and Matisse, as well as the canoe prow-board of the Trobriande Islands 

        of Papua New Guinea (Gell: 1992, 44). Gell emphasizes the technological 

        process whereby all of these artefacts came into being and suggests that 

        these &#39;outcomes of the technical process&#39; have all been produced by magical 

        means. It is through this magic that the object evokes a profound sense 

        of awe in the beholder, a potent visceral response that Gell identifies 

        as the &#39;halo-effect&#39; and Benjamin would connote the aura. But how does 

        the artist/sculptor/carver produce this magical &#39;halo-effect&#39;? Gell reminds 

        us in discussing J.F. Petos&#39; <i>Old Time Letter Rack, </i>1894, that:</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">People have great difficulty in working out how colored 

        pigments (substances with which everybody is broadly familiar) can be 

        applied to a surface so as to become an apparently different set of substances, 

        namely, the ones which enter into the composition of letters, ribbons, 

        drawing pins, stamps, bits of string, and so on (Gell, 1992, 49).</p>

      <p class="Normal">Gell acknowledges that this mystical process does occur, 

        but questions if it is simply a matter of a fascination with colored pigments. 

        As Gell goes on to explain, it is in this process, the way in which the 

        object has come-into-being, which eludes us, and forces us to interpret 

        it as magical (Gell: 1992, 49). Gell compares other technological processes 

        as having <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> <i>prestige</i> and cites the <i>lowly 

        button-pressing</i> of the photographer as having <i>&#39;no prestige&#39;</i> 

        unless there is perceived to be virtuosity in the photographic process 

        and sophistically produced image. Only then would the photograph reflect 

        a skill that exists beyond the beholders&#39; capabilities. Gell identifies 

        &#39;concept&#39; art within his &#39;interpretive&#39; theory of art, as being more attuned 

        to the realities of the present-day art world which, according to Gell, 

        has long abandoned the making of &#39;beautiful&#39;-looking pictures and sculptures 

        in favor of &#39;concept&#39; art. Gell points to Damien Hirst&#39;s dead shark, in 

        a tank of formaldehyde, &#34;The Impossibility of Death in the Mind of 

        Someone Living&#34;, 1992, as, </p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">An object that could not be called appealing, nor a 

        work of any excellence in terms of craftsmanship. But Hirst&#39;s shark is 

        a highly intelligible gesture in terms of contemporary art-making and 

        thoroughly grounded in the post-Duchampian tradition of concept art, and, 

        as such, is capable of being evaluated as good art, bad art, middling 

        art, but definitely art of some kind (Ibid. 1996).</p>

      <p class="Normal">Fredric Jameson, (1992), describes conceptual art as &#34;perceptual 

        paradoxes that we cannot think or unravel by way of conscious abstractions 

        and which bring us up short against the visual occasions&#34;. Jameson compares 

        conceptual art to some of the classic texts of deconstruction and anchors 

        conceptual art to the spatial relationship of the gallery space. The art 

        form creates a material pretext to make a mental circuit from the institution, 

        into its network of trustees, their affiliations with multiple corporations, 

        and finally the global system of late capitalism proper (Jameson, 1991).</p>

      <p class="Normal">In trying to explain the source of this magical potency, 

        Gell describes how the Trobiande carvers spiritually prepare themselves 

        in order to overcome technical obstacles in the carving process. Only 

        then can this magic be transposed through channels of exchange into the 

        perfect &#39;performance&#39; of the canoe-board, allowing it to slip effortlessly 

        through the water.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"> </span>Carvers undergo 

        <i>magical procedures</i> which open up the channels of their minds, so 

        that both the carved designs and the canoe will flow smoothly. This was 

        accomplished, according to Gell, by means of the metaphoric use of water 

        and other liquids, especially blood and bespelled betel-juice (Gell. 1992). 

        Gell compares this moment to a musician in our culture getting technically 

        prepared to give a perfect performance of an already existing composition, 

        such as the &#39;Moonlight&#39; Sonata (Gell, 1992). Gell acquiesces to Duchamp&#39;s 

        accomplishments, in spite of the banality of the urinal, and recognizes 

        the alchemy of the artist, in that he had the capacity to transform, which 

        Gell describes as</p>

      <p class="Normal">The essential alchemy of art, which is to make what is not 

        out of what is, and to make what is out of what is not (Gell, 1992).</p>

      <h1>Museumification</h1>

      <p class="Normal">The visitor in a museum is responding to cultural processes 

        that are reflected through the trajectories of the aggregated and contextualized 

        objects. These sometimes precious, sometimes mundane objects are modified 

        in the exhibition context where they go through a process of <i>museumification</i>, 

        extracted from distant locations and placed on a spotlighted pedestal, 

        or isolated in a glass cage. They become re-conceptualized and re-contextualized 

        and serve to petrify cultural values in much the same way as the theatre 

        projects the human condition through metaphor and allegory. While both 

        the theatre and the heterochronical spaces of a museum are both artificial 

        and temporary projections, the structure of the exhibition relies on &#39;real&#39;, 

        culturally robust objects. Could this wonder resonate in the digital image 

        of the new media? Could there even be such a thing as a virtual aura?</p>

      <p class="Normal">While the exhibition is a discursive space of a mediated 

        message or sets of messages, visitors traditionally expect to encounter 

        the &#39;<i>real</i>&#39; object. If visitors come to the museum and find, say, 

        videos, why would they even need to come into the museum in the first 

        place when they could enjoy the work equally well from the comfort of 

        home on private television sets or video players? In a media saturated 

        society we are bombarded with a surfeit of images that have been mechanically 

        reproduced all around us: advertising on the street, art posters in public 

        institutions and art catalogues in school and home. If the museum were 

        to be relied on as a location of culturally robust<i> </i>objects, the 

        exhibiting of videos, electronic interactives, and virtual reality installations 

        would seem to defeat the purpose of the art museum experience.</p>

      <p class="Normal">The history of photography has long left behind the notion 

        of the photograph as historical document, and through aesthetic appreciation 

        it has come to be a theoretical object, no longer perceived merely as 

        a stand-alone simulacrum, eventually attaining a status of its own. This 

        ontological evolution took almost a century and we now recognize the capacity 

        of the photographic image to stir emotions and evoke wonder. Roland Barthes 

        (Barthes, 1981, 2000) affirmed that photographs do radiate a certain kind 

        of &#39;aura.&#39; The aura of the lost in <i>me</i> and of lost memories act 

        in much the same way that Proust&#39;s textual reminiscences of the Madeleine 

        pastry and the potency of its smell served to evoke buried memory. Barthes 

        distinguishes the &#34;<i>punctum</i>&#34; as that accident of photographic 

        detail that pricked him, bruised him and was so poignant to him that it 

        evoked an almost transcendental experience, conjuring up poignant lost 

        memories of his mother. The historical process of the photographic image 

        emerged from <i>window</i> to artefact, much as video has migrated from 

        documentation tool to art form. Perhaps we need to maintain aesthetic 

        distance from the World Wide Web to distinguish the parameters of this 

        still new medium, in order to identify new spaces of enchantment amongst 

        the cacophony of information.</p>

      <p class="Normal">Culturally robust objects serve as referents to cultural 

        discourses and historical processes, and we are all aware of the many 

        ways they evoke wonder in us. For the majority of society, without the 

        capital to surround themselves with the original, the museum, the zoo, 

        and the botanical garden offer a public space to languish in the authentic. 

        However, with leisure time a limited asset, we depend on the mediated 

        experiences and the surrogate to fill in the gaps. For many years, our 

        reliance on the signifier rather than the signified, the Baudrillard simulacra, 

        a duplicate without an original, has been constantly debated. It has even 

        caused us to take actions in surprising ways that are not based in objective 

        reality. The alarm over the Y2K bug that increased as the new millennium 

        drew closer was an example of the fear of the signifier, a mere numerical 

        representation, rather than of a concrete historical event. According 

        to Kevin Robins,</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">The idea that we are already living in a simulation 

        culture has now almost become a cliche. We have actually come to feel 

        rather comfortable with our new condition of derealisation (Robins, 1996).</p>

      <p class="Normal">In order to ascertain if the potency of Gell&#39;s enchantment, 

        the Barthes &#34;<i>punctum</i>&#34; or the resonance of Benjamin&#39;s 

        lost aura can be found online, I will turn to the online projects and 

        investigate how they have made their screen debuts.</p>

      <h1>Ghosts, Magic and Enchantment</h1>

      <p class="Normal">The Thinker ImageBase<b>,</b> from the collections of <b>The 

        Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco</b> (the de Young Museum and the Legion 

        of Honor), USA, represents the traditional museum metaphor, including 

        activities, visitor information, membership, education activities and 

        online shopping at the museum store. At the same time, the site offers 

        the visitor or surfer access to the digital holdings of the real museums. 

        While the de Young Museum is closed to the public until Spring, 2005, 

        the databases provide authoritative background material both on the exhibitions 

        on display as well as the collections behind the scenes. According to 

        the Web site, the collections belong to the public, and because the museum 

        is able to show less than 5% of the collections in the galleries at any 

        given time, they feel a special responsibility to make them accessible 

        in other ways. The ImageBase is a fully keyword searchable database containing 

        110,000 images from the collections and is promoted as an expression of 

        the museum&#39;s mission to provide meaningful public access to the collections.It 

        behaves more like a resource and less like a repository. The database 

        offers a compelling educational experience, and recalls Andre Malraux&#39;s 

        message of universality in his &#34;<i>Museum Without Walls</i>.&#34; 

        Just as Malraux predicted and applauded the globalization process that 

        was yet to evolve, both he and Walter Benjamin would undoubtedly have 

        celebrated the unrestricted distribution of art resources that are now 

        freely bestowed upon remote visitors by such museums over the Internet. 

        While the educational value of such a site is indisputable, in that it 

        effectively replaces the traditional learning tool of slides or exhibition 

        catalogue, I would question the notion of &#39;meaningful access.&#39; While Web 

        authors invest considerable time and energy in making images speedily 

        accessible through limiting to low resolution and cropping, it is precisely 

        this immediacy of access that makes the process so alarmingly effortless. 

        The speed factor, the &#39;click to go&#39; phenomenon, may actually act as a 

        disservice to the collections and act as the antithesis of the enchantment 

        of technology, that in fact causes the disembedding of cultural systems. 

      </p>

      <p class="Normal">A museum that does not exist in objective reality and is 

        exclusively constructed electronically on the World Wide Web is the<b> 

        MUVA, El Pais Virtual Museum of Art</b>. This museum is a virtual fabrication, 

        and maintains only a tenuous connection to reality. MUVA utilizes a 3D 

        technique, Web2mil, to conjure up a magic environment. Alicia Haber, the 

        Director of the museum, welcomes visitors to the museum, which specializes 

        in contemporary Uraguayan and Latin American art, and hosts extensive 

        collections of paintings by leading Uraguayan artists. Four architects, 

        Jaime Lores, Raul Nazur, Daniel Colominas and Marcelo Mezzottoni, were 

        commissioned to prepare the plans for the building, on Avenida 18 de Julio, 

        the main artery of Uruguay&#39;s capital, Montevideo. They created a fine 

        arts museum consisting of galleries for permanent and temporary exhibitions, 

        as well as spaces for informal shows, sculpture garden, restoration workshops, 

        and administrative service areas. The building has five main floors where 

        galleries are open to the public, twenty-four hours a day... virtually 

        that is! Some sixteen graphic and Web designers, programmers, photographers 

        and system managers modeled textures of the walls, stairways, windows, 

        sidewalks, roofs and elevator, pixel by pixel, to provide a sense of &#39;reality&#39; 

        for the visitors. Intuitive navigation tools, allowing for fluid exploration 

        around the galleries and collections, were studiously hung and discretely 

        lit. Through embedded &#39;hot-spots&#39; in the paintings, click-able links refer 

        to in-depth studies of the artists&#39; work, biographies and further information 

        on the thematic presentation of the exhibition.</p>

      <p class="Normal">To construct the same museum in concrete, steel and glass 

        would have cost over 100 million dollars, a prohibitive sum for the Uruguayan 

        reality. Due to the efforts of this highly motivated and imaginative team, 

        Uruguay&#39;s artists can now show their works collectively, substituting 

        their own virtual museum for that impossible museum. This echoes Gell&#39;s 

        comment that the essential alchemy of art is to make what is not out of 

        what is, and to make what is out of what is not. In this case one is not 

        describing an art object, but an entire museum. But we might also be reminded 

        of Lash, Urry and Giddens&#39; dubious implications for society and discern 

        that the virtual metaphor of a museum might be a reflection of the emptying 

        out of subject and object. Even so, while we do recognize a substantial 

        loss, we might also side with Benjamin that, in this loss, there is also 

        a welcome gain. The liberation of the original object and its distribution 

        over the Internet opens up, for the first time, the availability of Uruguayan 

        art for remote visitors and the opportunity for these artists to reach 

        a broader audience.</p>

      <p class="Normal">&#34;Uncomfortable Proximity&#34; is the project created 

        by Harwood, a member of the Mongrel collective with critical texts by 

        Mathew Fuller and commissioned by the Tate. While the &#39;real&#39; Tate provides 

        floor plans, the Mongrel version takes us to what is beneath the floorboards 

        of the Tate. The texts and images introduce us to the precarious foundations 

        of the Tate galleries, the Millbank penitentiary, the filth of the Thames 

        and the hidden history of the slave trade. The accrual of wealth through 

        the slave trade had implications for generations of British aristocracy 

        that inevitably translated into the currency of art, some of which found 

        its way into the Tate collections. The Web site may be accessed via the

        take you into the underbelly of this institution of Britain&#39;s national 

        heritage and the decaying matter of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century. This 

        challenge to the very institution that is partner to the project and acts 

        as host to the scathing message is remarkable in itself. However, what 

        this project does is to limelight the very foundations of the Tate <i>cathedral</i>, 

        the circulatory system of art in society, and specifically the sacredness 

        of the British art system. This recalls Gell&#39;s observation that art objects 

        cannot be evaluated when dislocated from their social systems but need 

        to be seen in light of their circulation in society, where art, as art 

        agency, the object, the artist, and the recipient, invokes a series of 

        responses or interpretations. The use of this media is resourceful, perniciously 

        using the electronic stage to challenge all that is embedded in the mythological 

        nature of the circulatory art system, and symbiotically located inside 

        of the very fabric of its embodiment, the official Web site.</p>

      <p class="Normal">The Geist Project, by Colin Andrews, of the New Media Group, 

        Scotland, is an eerie Web site involving ghosts, and was exhibited at 

        The Pier Art Centre, Stromness, in November, 2000. Four remote sites across 

        Scottish, traditionally &#39;haunted locations&#39; are networked and act as nodes, 

        gathering data such as changes in temperature and fluctuations in electromagnetic 

        radiation. The information is then relayed via electronic networks to 

        the library at the Pier Arts Centre, Stromness, Orkney where it is used 

        to &#39;feed&#39; an audio installation. The audio is derived from traces of &#39;voices&#39; 

        recorded at each location. The work is experienced as a four channel audio 

        installation, with each of the four channels representing one of the four 

        remote &#39;haunted&#39; locations. The audio is derived from traces of &#39;voices&#39; 

        extracted from recordings made at each location at an earlier time. According 

        to the New Media Scotland Commission, Geist is not about the existence 

        or otherwise of ghosts, but rather about ghost or spectrality as metaphor. 

        It attempts to explore our contemporary condition of omnipresent absence 

        - presence through the use of haunted locations, recorded sound, and network 

        technology. This spine-chilling project reminds us that contemporary communications 

        technologies belong to unseen places - they connect us instantaneously 

        across vast distances yet make our words, impulses and feelings pass through 

        an uninhabited and invisible domain.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">Geist is about being and not being here and there simultaneously. 

        It is about communication through the exchange of electrical energy, about 

        recording and playback, about returns and repetition. It is the domain 

        of specters and spirits, of slippages in time and space and communications 

        across boundaries&#34;</p>

      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(From the New Media Scotland Commission electronic 

        promotion). </p>

      <p class="Normal">The World Wide Web offers many kinds of spaces, and while 

        the traditional museum flows through and into many kinds of cultural discourses, 

        the art and the artistic processes provide the vehicles of enchantment 

        for society. Artists are beginning to realize the potential of the interconnectivity 

        of the medium and respond to its resonance. Geist is a project that clearly 

        articulates these phenomena. The enchanting technological processes of 

        networked art, firmly embedded in circulatory, social systems, propel 

        sacred spaces from remote locations across vast distances into our foreground 

        at the blink of an eye. We recognize the inextricable link between art 

        and culture, yet we are awed by what we do not fully understand. When 

        we are able to step back and maintain critical distance from these experiences 

        and appreciate the craftsmanship of the new medium, we might even be able 

        to discern the patina of human endeavour and regain in some way the lost 

        aura; the virtual aura.</p>

      <p class="Normal">The next time you sit in front of your computer and crank 

        up the pixels, don&#39;t be surprised if you find a poltergeist hanging out 

        there inside your hard disk, dancing across the fiber optic connections, 

        or lurking somewhere out there online, waiting to find you!</p>
