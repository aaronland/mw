      <p class="PaperTitle">Re-Purposing of Content and Digital Delivery Convergence: 

        Implications for Interface Design</p>

      <p class="Author">Slavko Milekic, M.D., PhD, The University of the Arts, USA</p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">With the introduction of the digital medium, an abundance 

        of content previously obtainable through other media became available 

        in digital form. Digital delivery implied the necessity for some kind 

        of content modification dictated by the specific characteristics of the 

        digital medium. </p>

      <p class="AbstractText">The situation is further complicated by the convergence 

        of different media used for the delivery of digital/digitized information. 

        The same content has to meet the constraints of different display devices 

        and bandwidth limitations. Furthermore, digital delivery makes possible 

        adaptations of content not only in regard to characteristics of hardware 

        used to display it, but also in regard to individual user&#39;s goals and 

        needs. </p>

      <p class="AbstractText">In this paper I will present the implications for 

        content re-purposing with the migration from the traditional to the digital 

        medium as well as the problems that arise from convergence of different 

        types of digital delivery mechanism.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class="normal">The effects of the &#39;discovery&#39; of the digital medium are 

        global and profound. I have described some aspects of these changes elsewhere 

        (Milekic, 1999). In this paper I will analyze two currently observable 

        trends connected to the introduction of the digital medium. These trends 

        are:</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">a) re-purposing of content previously available through 

        other media for delivery through the digital medium;</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">b) convergence of means (physical devices) used for 

        the delivery, display and manipulation of digital content.</p>

      <p class="normal">Each of these trends creates complex constraints but also 

        opens up new possibilities for content delivery/exchange. These possibilities 

        can be explored only by modifying the traditional interface design practices 

        of applications created for digital content delivery. However, before 

        proceeding to the analysis of general effects of these trends, it is advisable 

        to clarify the consequences and implications of each one separately. </p>

      <h1>Re-purposing</h1>

      <p class="normal">According to the on-line version of Merriam-Webster dictionary, 

        a literal definition of re-purposing would be that it is a new way (from 

        Latin re-, again) of achieving the same outcome (from Latin <i>proponere</i> 

        /to propose/: something set up as an object or end to be attained: INTENTION). 

        In most general terms re-purposing can be described as manipulations of 

        <i>space</i>, <i>time</i> and <i>meaning</i> within the new medium. Most 

        often reâpurposing involves some kind of <i>compression</i>. Compression 

        of data space (ultimately corresponding to the physical storage space 

        necessary for storing it) in a medium currently constrained by bandwidth 

        limitations is frequently proportional to time compression. However, with 

        bandwidth limitations resolved, the space compression will be relevant 

        only in regard to the characteristics of a user&#39;s display device. This 

        does not mean that the need for time compression will disappear. In future, 

        time compression will not be tied to how long it takes an image to be 

        downloaded to one&#39;s hard drive, but to how quickly one is able to use 

        (understand) the content. In other words, time compression will be related 

        to the <i>compression of meaning</i>. </p>

      <p class="normal">In regard to the digital medium, one can distinguish two 

        different kinds of re-purposing: a) one that refers to re-purposing of 

        content from another medium (that of print, audio or video, etc.) for 

        delivery in the digital medium, and b) re-purposing that occurs within 

        the digital medium. These two forms of reâpurposing can be labeled 

        as <i>inter</i>-media and <i>intra</i>-medium re-purposing. </p>

      <h2>Inter-media re-purposing</h2>

      <p class="normal">Inter-media re-purposing is historically not a new occurrence. 

        A clear example is a shift from oral tradition to written transmission 

        of myths and folk tales. In order for oral content to be successfully 

        transferred into the new medium, it had to be adapted to the constraints 

        imposed by the new medium. In this process some of the characteristics 

        of the content and possible interactions with it were lost or changed, 

        while new ones were gained. For example, oral traditions rely on a very 

        undependable storage medium -- human memory. Historically it has often 

        been the case that certain folk tales and myths were confined to the brain 

        of a single individual, upon whose death they would be irretrievably lost. 

        Committing these to print preserved the content and made it available 

        for transition to any number of (literate) individuals in the future. 

        The other side of this transition is that some possibilities were lost. 

        Human memory may be unreliable as storage medium, but it is inherently 

        flexible and creative. Storytellers freely added and embellished the story 

        so that it suited particular circumstances. This led to the enrichment 

        and the creation of differe<span class="normal">nt versions of popular 

        myths. Transferring such material to print meant that it had to be &#39;edited&#39;; 

        that is, redundancies had to be removed, inconsistencies corrected, and 

        one had to settle for a single &#39;true&#39; version of the content (it is only 

        much later that the value of the diversity of oral interpretations was 

        recognized and is now extensively documented). It is important to note 

        that these changes were mandated by the characteristics of the medium 

        itself. </span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="normal">Transferring (re-purposing) content 

        from any other to the digital medium will be affected in a similar way 

        by properties of the digital medium. In order to anticipate the effects 

        this transfer will have on content accessibility and usability (and user 

        interface design), it is important to identify in advance the specific 

        characteristics of the new medium. Properties unique to the digital medium 

        are consequences of binary encoding of information and, as I argued elsewhere 

        (Milekic, 1999), at the most general level they can be labeled as:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="normal">reproducibility</span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">transferability</span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">pervasiveness </span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">manipulability</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="normal"><span class="normal"><i></i></span><i>Reproducibility</i> 

        refers to the fact that any content transferred into the digital form 

        becomes instantaneously reproducible. As a matter of fact, the very act 

        of making it available to our senses (by displaying it on the monitor 

        screen) involves reproduction. Reproduction in a digital medium is perfect; 

        that is, reproduced code (even if it was reproduced millions of times) 

        is indistinguishable from the &#39;original&#39; one. Thus, the notion of the 

        original in the digital medium is going to be very different from the 

        one used for works in traditional media. Most likely, it will be defined 

        temporally as the time of the first occurrence of a certain binary pattern, 

        before digital &#39;originals&#39; started multiplying. </p>

      <p class="normal">As instantaneous as reproduction, <i>transferability</i> 

        refers to re-creation of a binary code at another location, with the loss 

        of the &#39;original&#39; code. The ease with which any portion of binary code 

        can be reproduced, transferred and modified led to the <i>pervasiveness</i> 

        of the medium. We are already at the level where any bit of information 

        stored in this medium is <u>simultaneously</u> accessible to anyone with 

        access to a digital portal. </p>

      <p class="normal">It is the level of control over manipulations in this medium 

        that is unlike any other traditional medium. Not only can one manipulate 

        information at the level of a single bit, but one can also selectively 

        interact with the data specified at a level of a particular <u>pattern</u>. 

        For example, it is possible (and trivially easy with modern rendering 

        software) to change only those data bits corresponding to a certain shade 

        of red in a digital photograph. Hyper-linking of data (which may be in 

        different modalities) represents yet another level of <i>manipulability</i>, 

        the one at the level of meta-structure. Thus, the information in the digital 

        medium is infinitely personalizable, malleable, modifiable and adaptable. 

        Because of its creative potential the manipulability of digitally encoded 

        information has been the driving force behind the globalization of digitization. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">However, blind use of recognized properties of the medium 

        can also lead to less-than-perfect results. Good examples are early attempts 

        to re-purpose text documents for use on the World Wide Web. Re-purposing 

        was done with a knowledge that the medium allows for hyper-linking of 

        any two points in the information space. Although the abundance of hyper-links 

        made the text seem more usable, their net effect was not any greater than 

        what would be achieved with an automatic page-turner. </p>

      <h2>Intra-medium re-purposing</h2>

      <p class="normal">Re-purposing within the digital medium is achieved by <i>modification</i> 

        of certain aspects of the content or its delivery mechanisms. Depending 

        on the motivation for re-purposing of the content, one can distinguish 

        two broad categories which I will label</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">a) device-centered content adaptation</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">b) user-centered content adaptation</p>

      <p class="normal">Very often the line between the two is blurred because the 

        distinction is not made between the users who access certain content and 

        the devices that they use for this purpose. Needless to say, equation 

        of a user&#39;s goals with the characteristics of the device being used to 

        reach it leads to serious flaws in interface design. For this reason, 

        I will describe these two different categories separately.</p>

      <h3>a) Device-centered content adaptation</h3>

      <p class="normal">In the field of HCI, re-purposing of the content focused 

        mostly on technological constraints of different devices used to access 

        the content and not on user interests, goals. etc. Examples of device-centered 

        content adaptation are provided in an excellent paper by Ma, Bedner, Chang, 

        Kuchinsky and Zhang (Ma, Bedner, Chang, Kuch<span class="normal">insky 

        and Zhang, 2000). They provide five general categories of content adaptation 

        applicable to different data modalities within the digital medium: video, 

        image, audio and text.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="normal">They label these categories as:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="normal">data prioritization</span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">data transcoding</span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">modality transformation</span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">information abstraction</span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">purpose classification</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="normal"><span class="normal"><i>Data prioritization</i> is achieved 

        by assigning different levels of delivery priority to different content 

        aspects. These could be related to content modality, for example, by assigning 

        priority to delivery of text prior to the deliv</span>ery of images or 

        audio and video information. Or it can be achieved by prioritized progressive 

        delivery within the same media type, for example, by delivering images 

        first in low-resolution version, and then filling-in more detail if time 

        and/or user display device allow.</p>

      <p class="normal"><i>Data transcoding</i> is the process of converting data 

        format. In their paper the authors (Ma et al., 2000) refer to data transcoding 

        only in the context of client display device characteristics. This would 

        include transcoding of original images to display-appropriate format; 

        for example, GIF-to-JPEG or color-to-grayscale. However, it is important 

        to note that some forms of data transcoding may also provide other forms 

        of content adaptation, like information abstraction. This is demonstrated 

        in Figure 1 which depicts the same information (photograph of a young 

        woman) transcoded to formats compatible with different display and bandwidth 

        characteristics.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="milekic.fig1.jpg" width="540" height="415" alt="Figure 1. Sequence of images with different levels of data (and hence time) compression, ranging from 232 kilobytes for uncompressed image in TIF format to less than 10 kilobytes for duo-tone image. "/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 1. Sequence of images with different levels of 

        data (and hence time) compression, ranging from 232 kilobytes for uncompressed 

        image in TIF format to less than 10 kilobytes for duo-tone image. </p>

      <p class="normal">Notice, however, that image 4, although claiming the least 

        amount of data space (and thus the least amount of download time) provides 

        the viewer with much more information due to the addition of a &#34;thought 

        bubble&#34; which provides relevant contextual information for the interpretation 

        of the image. </p>

      <p class="normal"><i>Modality transformation</i> is the translation of the 

        information delivered in one modality into another modality. Examples 

        include transforming digital video stream to a series of still images, 

        delivering only the audio component of the video, or closed caption text. 

        True modality transformation would not be characterized by loss of information, 

        and therefore one should distinguish it from modality transformation-based 

        reduction. </p>

      <p class="normal"><i>Information abstraction</i> refers to the procedures 

        that reduce bandwidth requirements by delivering extracted information 

        to the user. Ma and his colleagues (Ma et al., 2000) provide examples 

        such as video highlights, video frame and/or rate reduction, image dimension 

        reduction, image data size reduction (by increasing compression rate), 

        stereo-to-mono conversion, text summarization, font size reduction etc. 

        However, these examples mix both semantic and non-semantic information 

        abstraction -- reducing image data by using a better compression algorithm 

        does not have to lead to perceptible loss of information and have an effect 

        on meaning, while text summarization may. </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="milekic.fig2.gif" width="313" height="273" alt="Figure 2-3. Information abstraction by reduction of font size and reduction of white space allows the text to fit into the browser window without scrolling and without any change to the text itself."/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="milekic.fig3.gif" width="313" height="272" alt="Figure 2-3. Information abstraction by reduction of font size and reduction of white space allows the text to fit into the browser window without scrolling and without any change to the text itself."/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 2-3. Information abstraction by reduction of 

        font size and reduction of white space allows the text to fit into the 

        browser window without scrolling and without any change to the text itself.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="milekic.fig4.gif" width="314" height="273" alt="Figure 3-4. Further compression is achieved by condensing the text and presenting it in a list form."/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Figure 3-4. Further compression is achieved by condensing 

        the text and presenting it in a list form.</p>

      <p class="normal">Another difference is that some of the given examples use 

        automatic algorithmic procedures (like image compression, thumbnail generation, 

        audio subsampling) while the other ones depend on human editing (text 

        summarization, video description and such) to achieve data compression. 

        Thus, it may be useful to divide this category into two separate ones: 

        <i>data compression</i> achieved through different automatic procedures, 

        and true <i>information abstraction</i> achieved (at least for the time 

        being) through human intervention. </p>

      <p class="normal"><i>Purpose classification</i> is the least clear category 

        suggested in the above-mentioned article (Ma et al., 2000). While it is 

        definitely true that &#34;a typical Web page contains a lot of information 

        and media objects that are redundant or may not be of interest to a user&#34; 

        by which they refer to advertisements, banners and promotional material, 

        it is often the case that the very existence of a particular page depends 

        on displaying this (redundant) information. Although the authors invoked 

        this category with the goal of meeting low bandwidth characteristics of 

        different user devices, they are coming very close to userâcentered 

        content adaptation, by discussing the purpose and usefulness of ads for 

        a user. </p>

      <h3>b) User-centered content adaptation</h3>

      <p class="normal">Adapting the content so that it can efficiently accommodate 

        users with different needs, skills, backgrounds, knowledge level, etc., 

        is another challenge in the research agenda for universal usability (Shneiderman, 

        1999). It is worth noting that tools for user-centered content adaptation 

        focus on different kinds of problems compared to the device-centered content 

        adaptation. In this case the problem is often not the network bandwidth 

        but rather the <i>cognitive bandwidth</i>. The unique properties of the 

        digital medium also play a much larger role in user-centered content adaptation 

        by providing the opportunity for the development of new cognitive tools 

        for knowledge sharing and discovery. For example, the potential of the 

        digital medium to log all of the interactions that take place in it can 

        be used for a qualitatively different level of the <i>preservation of 

        the past</i>. In the following section I will briefly outline different 

        user populations and possible strategies for re-purposing the content 

        to suit their needs.</p>

      <p class="normal">Adapting content for use by different age groups (from preliterate 

        children to adults) has traditionally been resolved by creating a new 

        genre; for example, children&#39;s books, movies etc. This approach has been 

        implemented successfully on the Web on the NASA space mission sites that 

        have sections designed for K-12 children. Ideally, the content should 

        be made adaptable for different age groups (children, adults) by creating 

        an interface mechanism that would enable the user to fine-tune the level 

        of complexity of the displayed content. </p>

      <p class="normal">The content should also be made available to fit a user&#39;s 

        interest and immediate goals. Relative failure of algorithm-based search 

        engines to satisfy user needs indicates that this challenge has not been 

        satisfactorily resolved. More successful Web portals, like Yahoo, owe 

        their success to the fact that segmenting of the content to fit different 

        users&#39; interests has been done by humans. However, recent advances of 

        &#34;data mining&#34; techniques (also known as &#34;knowledge discovery 

        in databases&#34; - KDD) hold promise that in very near future one will 

        be able to &#34;build knowledge&#34; by searching vast amounts of text 

        available on the World Wide Web or be able to search through video materials 

        in the same way one searches text today. Other examples of making the 

        content of other media (TV) more adaptive by transferring it into the 

        digital form include ReplayTV and TIVo, devices which allow users automated 

        recording and replay of preferred shows (and even learn from viewing behavior), 

        slow motion replay, pause and resume of live TV broadcast.</p>

      <p class="normal">On the side of content providers, re-purposing is necessary 

        for achieving different goals. The same content has to be presented and 

        interacted with in a different way depending whether it is going to be 

        used for teaching/learning, information, or as a data base. This idea 

        is still in its infancy, although some large content providers (NASA, 

        NY Times, as well as some museum sites) are making an effort to present 

        part of their content in form suitable for use in education. </p>

      <p class="normal">Re-purposing of content should also address the issues involving 

        different cultural expectations. Currently, English language and Western 

        cultural models dominate the World Wide Web. Issues of culture-specific 

        content delivery have potential broad economic implications, and there 

        are already some services that provide automatic translations of Web pages 

        into different languages (AltaVista). However, the quality of automatic 

        translation is severely limited, and commercial Web sites catering to 

        users belonging to different cultures resorted to the creation of multiple, 

        human translated and acculturated mirror sites.</p>

      <p class="normal">Adaptation of content for users with special needs is a 

        large and looming issue that has not been satisfactorily resolved. It 

        is worth noting that answering the needs of these populations has historically 

        been the path to improvement in general usability or led to the introduction 

        of appliances with global impact (like the telephone, tape recorder, etc.). 

        Technologies like continuous speech recognition, screen readers and haptic-enabled 

        interaction devices (like the iFeel<span>Ã</span> mouse) will play a major 

        role in this area.</p>

      <h1>Convergence</h1>

      <p class="normal">The term convergence has several meanings (Merriam-Webster), 

        of which two are especially applicable to the topic of this paper:</p>

      <ol>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">the act of converging and especially 

          moving toward union or uniformity; </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> independent development of similar 

          characters (as of bodily structure or cultural traits) often associated 

          with similarity of habits or environment</span></li>

      </ol>

      <p class="normal"><span class="normal">The two above definitions illustrate 

        both the problems and the state of affairs in the arena of digital convergence. 

        Wireless telephones, PCs, television and various other Internet appliances 

        are competing with each other in taking each other&#39;s function. One can 

        get the weather report on the display of mobile phone</span>, watch TV 

        on a computer screen, and interactively shop over TV. This, in itself, 

        can only benefit the end user if there is true uniformity between the 

        platforms. However, this is not the case. The number of c<span class="normal">ompeting 

        standards and architectures is staggering.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="normal">There are three major aspects of digital 

        convergence (Forman and Saint John, 2000):</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li> <span class="normal">convergence of content (audio, video and data);</span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">convergence of platforms (PC, TV, Internet appliances, 

          game machines);</span></li>

        <li> <span class="normal">convergence of distribution (how the content 

          gets to a user)</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="normal"><span class="normal">What is evident today is the user-demand-driven 

        convergence of content -- the use of reâwritable CD ROMs is increasing 

        because of the possibility of storing large amounts of digital data that 

        </span>are common household items - like digital photographs, music files 

        in MP3 format, multimedia presentations, etc. That the trend is going 

        in this direction is also evident from the fact that DVD players/recorders 

        (which can store even larger amounts of data) are the most successful 

        electronic product in recent years. </p>

      <p class="normal">Convergence of delivery platforms is a much thornier issue 

        that has not even been resolved for the shift from analog to digital television. 

        We are witnessing a kind of parallel evolution similar to the second definition 

        of convergence quoted above: different platforms are developing similar 

        characteristics, and the &#39;selection forces&#39; are user preferences and the 

        characteristics of the medium itself. </p>

      <p class="normal">The questions of delivery of digital content are also far 

        from being resolved. Whether the content will reach us via fiber-optic 

        cable, broadcast or satellite is not clear. Although it may seem that 

        the questions of the delivery method are irrelevant, for the end user 

        they have enormous implications for the future of power and control over 

        the media. </p>

      <h1>Design implications</h1>

      <p class="normal">While it may seem pointless to speak about interface design 

        in light of chaos and unresolved issues in the domain of digital convergence 

        (further complicated by lack of clarity regarding the characteristics 

        of the digital medium), there are some general design guidelines that 

        seem evident. In simple terms, the design has to be device-aware and user-aware. 

        This means that the content has to be <u>scalable</u> (useable with devices 

        with different display characteristics, storage space, processor power) 

        and <u>adaptive</u> (useable by users of different abilities, goals, backgrounds 

        and cultures). Use of intelligent algorithms and adoption of common hardware 

        standards can resolve scalability of the content. Creation of truly adaptive 

        content is still a huge challenge and currently can be resolved only by 

        human effort in creating adequate redundant content representations that 

        suit different needs. On the other hand, adaptive delivery of content 

        (and &#39;awareness&#39; of user actions) is part of the digital medium potential, 

        and will eventually determine the ways in which the medium is used.</p>

      <p class="normal">Ultimately, delivery in the digital medium (and use of the 

        term digital medium) will include any end-user delivery method where the 

        content, at some point, was encoded in binary form in order to use some 

        of the advantages of the digital medium (for example, reproducibility). 

        This would include a printed page (from a printer), or an email message 

        retrieved with a mobile phone via text-to-speech software.</p>

      <p class="normal">Theoretically, the need for re-purposing should disappear 

        if the medium is used to its potential: that is, the delivery of practically 

        limitless accumulated content becomes infinitely adaptive (and user adaptable) 

        to meet any individual&#39;s need, knowledge level or cultural background. 

        Of course, we are far from this ideal, and in the meantime, we still have 

        to develop efficient ways of inter- and intra-medium re-purposing of content.</p>
