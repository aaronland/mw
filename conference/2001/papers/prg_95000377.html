        to the Web</span></p>

      <p class="Author">Carrie Adams, Traci Cole, Christina DePaolo, Susan Edwards, 

        Seattle Art Museum, USA<span class="normal1"></span></p>

      <p class="AbstractText"><span class="normal1">The </span><span class="normal1">Seattle 

        Art Museum&#39;s <i>My Art Gallery</i> Web site was born out of an actual 

        experiment in the galleries of the museum itself. The project was called 

        &#34;Growing Up With Art&#34; and was funded by a four-year grant from 

        the Pew Charitable Trusts. SAM invited sixth-grade classes from local 

        schools into the museum to curate two exhibitions using the museum&#39;s permanent 

        collection. It was a project requiring collaboration from many corners 

        of the institution--curators, educators, and registrars--as well 

        as teachers and students in the public schools. Achieving an actual exhibition 

        in the museum&#39;s galleries after only a ten-week lesson was an ambitious 

        goal. Educators and a curatorial associate developed lessons for the students 

        that would take them step by step through a &#34;curatorial process.&#34; 

        This process was designed to incorporate key elements of a curator&#39;s exhibition-development 

        process and to tie into a sixth-grade curriculum as well as Washington 

        State learning objectives.</span><span class="normal1"> </span></p>

      <p class="AbstractText"><span class="normal1">The very nature of this project 

        was clearly experimental and brought up many issues within the museum 

        about the display of art and the role of the museum in relation to its 

        community. Because of the intense time commitment and expense required 

        for the project, the museum was able to give this experience to only a 

        limited group of sixth-grade students. Not wanting to retire our efforts 

        to the archives, we turned to the Internet as a way to extend a version 

        of the unique experience to a wider audience</span><span class="normal1">. 

        </span></p>

      <p class="AbstractText"><span class="normal1">As the project was winding down, 

        SAM had completed the transfer of its object collection data to a new 

        system, allowing the data to be accessed through the Web. Using the Web 

        to engage our audience with the permanent collection became a new possibility. 

        The idea was to build a Web site where students could be introduced to 

        the elements of the curatorial process online: a process of visual analysis 

        that includes observation, questioning, research, comparison, and label 

        writing. Students, specifically in grades 6-10, could create a virtual 

        exhibition by choosing from the group of works used in the actual student-curated 

        exhibition and writing the results of their research and observations 

        into a database-driven notebook. The notes and images would then dynamically 

        generate html pages displaying their work. As a reward, students could 

        pick their own gallery backdrops for their exhibition and send &#34;gallery 

        opening&#34; emails to friends and family. </span></p>

      <p class="AbstractText"><span class="normal1">This paper will explore the transformation 

        of classroom curriculum into an engaging, Web-friendly, interactive experience, 

        pointing out the Web-management and structural-design challenges that 

        were faced to achieve this goal. Similar to the program that resulted 

        in the physical exhibitions, the Web site project was ambitious; it required 

        museum staff to work collaboratively and face new issues that were pushed 

        to the forefront by this medium.</span><span class="normal1"> </span></p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class="normal">Using the Web to teach the complexities of curating an art 

        museum exhibition, with the goal of having the user complete the process 

        in twenty minutes, is no small feat. Yet perhaps giving the user a <i>sense</i> 

        of the complexities involved, from research and visual analysis to design 

        and writing, is possible. The Seattle Art Museum developed an interactive 

        site that allows users to interact with the museum&#39;s permanent collection 

        in a new way and create their own online exhibition, thereby beginning 

        to grasp the knowledge and experience required of today&#39;s museum 

        curators.</p>

      <p class="normal"><i>My Art Gallery</i> is a Web site that was developed out 

        of a four-year grant entitled <i>Growing Up with Art</i> (see Appendix 

        A for granting information), which brought local sixth-graders into the 

        Seattle Art Museum to co-curate two actual exhibitions using objects from 

        our permanent collection. In ten one-totwo-hour lessons in their classrooms, 

        museum staff taught the sixth-graders a simplified version of the curatorial 

        process. It was an ambitious pedagogical program for the sixth grade, 

        introducing the students to visual analysis, research, comparison, developing 

        interpretations, and writing explanatory labels, all within a period of 

        six months. A central goal of the project was to find new ways to present 

        the museum&#39;s permanent collection and improve how the public interacts 

        with it. Another important goal was to foster collaboration both within 

        the museum and without, working with museum departments, teachers, and 

        students.</p>

      <p class="normal">After the exhibitions were installed, the question remained 

        of how to maintain the relationships forged between the public schools, 

        the teachers, the students, and the museum, and how to use what was learned 

        from the project to help future users engage with the permanent collection. 

        These exhibitions were intense administrative feats made possible by a 

        large grant and will not likely become part of the museum&#39;s regular 

        program due to limited funding, time, and resources. In addition, though 

        the project was a great experience for about one hundred students, we 

        wanted to find a way to expand our reach. Thus, three years into the four-year 

        grant, the curatorial associate involved in the project approached the 

        Web team with an idea to transfer the curatorial process that the students 

        underwent in the classroom on to the Web, allowing the lessons developed 

        for the project to live beyond the grant period. It was an ambitious idea--to 

        create a highly interactive learning environment on the Web modeled on 

        ten classroom lessons. The site would give any users a glimpse into the 

        world of an art museum curator and give them their own virtual &#34;gallery&#34; 

        where they would choose a work of art, research it, and develop their 

        own interpretations. </p>

      <p class="normal">Many of the goals for the exhibitions were carried through 

        to the Web site, though they sometimes manifested themselves in new incarnations. 

        From the beginning, the project to create student exhibitions was envisioned 

        as a cross-cultural one because the Seattle Art Museum&#39;s collection 

        includes works of art from North and South America, Europe, Africa, and 

        Asia, with particular strengths in Chinese, Japanese, African, and Northwest 

        Coast Native American art. Development of the Web site also corresponded 

        with the launch of our online collection database, which is accessible 

        through the museum Web site. <i>My Art Gallery</i> would provide a structured 

        environment in which a user of the Seattle Art Museum site could explore 

        a portion of the permanent collection online. </p>

      <p class="normal">In addition, the cross-cultural comparisons and themes chosen 

        for the exhibitions came from the students&#39; own impressions of the 

        world around them. We hoped this approach to the exhibitions and the Web 

        site would help to make a connection between our collection and our users&#39; 

        personal experiences. Finally, the Web site allowed us to continue collaboration 

        and outreach efforts into the future by marketing the site to teachers 

        and allowing users to experiment with our permanent collection. Theoretically, 

        the expense and risk involved in pursuing such experimental projects in 

        the physical space of the museum is reduced on the Web. The assumption 

        was that the Web is more flexible and forgiving, and therefore a perfect 

        place for the eclectic and experimental nature of these exhibitions. </p>

      <p class="normal">The process of developing this site was complicated, especially 

        for a Web team of three developers (graphic designer, programmer, and 

        manager) and one content provider (curatorial associate). What made this 

        project such a challenge was transforming a model for teaching students 

        in a structured classroom setting into a free-for-all Web environment. 

        The existing process for the museum&#39;s Web site development presented 

        a great stumbling block for this type of project--we had simply never 

        attempted such an interactive, process-oriented Web site before. We knew 

        we needed to build a site where graphics, images, and rollovers were used 

        to create an interactive learning experience that would engage our users 

        and take them through the process. Users needed to learn on the Web from 

        doing, and the site needed to give them all the tools necessary to do 

        this without supervision.</p>

      <p class="normal">The idea of developing a &#34;notebook,&#34; a place where students 

        would do their own work and start creating their own exhibition, was essential 

        to early site development. A vehicle was needed for students to select 

        art images from the collection and write notes about their selections. 

        A database had to be developed where &#34;notebook&#34; images and text could 

        be saved and retrieved to create the content for the individual online 

        exhibitions. It needed to be both a programming tool and a learning tool, 

        giving users ownership of their process.</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Final notebook</p>

      <p class="normal">One early realization was that if we didn&#39;t engage 

        our users immediately in the learning process, we would lose them. We 

        also couldn&#39;t assume students would know who a curator is or what 

        one does. So the first task was to introduce the idea of a curator in 

        a fun and interesting way. Once we knew how to accomplish that, we could 

        roll up our sleeves and build the remainder of the site.</p>

      <p class="normal">Some of the questions we needed to answer included, How 

        do you get students to think about looking at art online? How can we get 

        them to leave the site to research the work of art they chose and then 

        come back to the site? What happens if they go to a search engine and 

        can&#39;t find any information? Finally, how do we make them feel rewarded 

        for completing the process of building their own exhibition?</p>

      <p class="normal">It took several months of meeting, developing flow charts, 

        drafting text, and building models to come up with a design solution to 

        the &#34;questions&#34; the site posed. The key challenge was coming up with an 

        interface design that combined all the components into one dynamic learning 

        experience. Everything on the site had to work together. We needed to 

        simplify a very complex set of ideas. We knew this thorough development 

        process was necessary to avoid the pitfalls before us--possibly building 

        a site where the components competed with each other, lacked focus, and 

        were confusing to the user. </p>

      <p class="normal">Throughout the months of the production process, we constantly 

        had to redefine and lock in our established goals. This was necessary 

        for two reasons. First, the site kept evolving and changing as we worked; 

        we needed to produce one section of the site in order to understand how 

        to build the next. We weren&#39;t always sure of the end result, so revisiting 

        our goals kept us focused and on the right path. Second, each person working 

        on the project contributed distinct expertise and brought a particular 

        perspective to the project. This dynamic intensified when staff members 

        from several different departments were pulled into the project at various 

        stages of development. It took a lot of negotiating and working together 

        to pool the necessary skills into a shared vision for the site. Unlike 

        a traditional museum project with a clear beginning, middle, and end and 

        clearly defined staff roles, the site development was much more dynamic 

        and cyclical. </p>

      <p class="normal">Over a year and a half, we worked through a process of constant 

        redesign and rewrites of text and code. We developed new models for management, 

        as well as site structure, design, and content. The evolution of our process 

        grew out of the lesson we were learning about the Web: that it is a unique 

        environment where complex concepts can become lucid in a way that is not 

        possible in the classroom or in the gallery.</p>

      <h1>Simple Structures for a Complex Project</h1>

      <p class="normal">As various museum staff members contributed and developed 

        content, the Web team found it necessary to establish content-organization 

        tools which would be used both to guide the project along in a focused 

        fashion and to guide the user along within the Web site itself. A main 

        challenge was to restructure the original goals and materials for the 

        actual exhibition process into content suitable for the Web environment. 

        In order to simplify both the management of the project and the structure 

        of the site, the Web team developed a clear mission statement and defined 

        the target audience. Then, the graphic designer developed a storyboard, 

        using it as a tool to create one interface to integrate all the components 

        of the site: the introduction, the curatorial lessons, the notebook idea, 

        and the ability for users to create their own exhibition site. Crucial 

        to this storyboard process was the development of an illustrated character 

        (and eventually the development of two characters) to guide and motivate 

        the user through the site.</p>

      <h1>A Focused Mission Statement Creates a Focused Web Experience</h1>

      <p class="normal">Defining a target audience is key in the early stages of 

        developing a Web site, as it can often lead to the success of a site. 

        It may be necessary to elaborate on the definition of the target audience 

        and outline the kind of experience they should have. This can be called 

        a &#34;mission statement,&#34; where the target audience demographics and goals 

        for their experience are melded into a clear statement. </p>

      <p class="normal">Choosing a target audience for the site became an essential 

        tool for focusing the content during early development of the site. Not 

        only did we need a good solid understanding of the audience, but we also 

        needed to understand how this group uses the Web. The target audience 

        for the Web site differs in many ways from the students who participated 

        in the physical exhibition project. One difference is that Web users can 

        abandon the process any time they want by clicking out of the site. Another 

        difference is that they can&#39;t ask questions or have direct dialogue 

        with a teacher if they have difficulty understanding a step in the curatorial 

        process. Within the Web site, the users are on their own and in control 

        of their experience.</p>

      <p class="normal">These limitations challenged us to further streamline the 

        content and take several approaches that departed from the classroom experience. 

        Initially, we assumed our target audience would be the same demographic 

        as the students, with the exception that the target age would be expanded, 

        focusing on grades six through ten. As we proceeded further into the Web 

        project, it became clear that, along with retrofitting the content, we 

        would need to create a focused &#34;mission statement,&#34; outlining the kind 

        of experience we wanted the user to have.</p>

      <p class="normal">For example, we decided that the Web experience needed to 

        be completed within a shorter period of time than originally planned. 

        We initially thought of the notebook as a tool the users could save their 

        work in and then log back into if they wanted to take a break. They could 

        log in upon return and continue where they had left off in the process. 

        On further thought, we realized that this kind of open-ended learning 

        experience could result in confusion. Allowing the user the freedom to 

        break the flow of learning could come at the cost of losing them all together. 

        As a result, we decided to create a two-part Web experience. </p>

      <p class="normal">The first portion of the site would be dedicated to introducing 

        the users to the curatorial process, having them participate in five &#34;lessons&#34; 

        as they went along. On the Web the five lessons are called learn from 

        looking, asking questions, research, compare, and interpret. Only after 

        the learning occurred and their online exhibit was posted did we give 

        them free rein to work within their notebook and choose additional works 

        of art. The mission statement was our saviour in many regards, as it helped 

        us clarify the user goals and focus on creating a more organized Web experience. 

        We would often refer to the mission statement as a focal point as we continued 

        to develop the site.</p>

      <h1>Storyboards: Streamlining Content into a Web Experience Conducive to 

        Learning</h1>

      <p class="normal">Storyboarding can be helpful if there is a lot of content 

        to organize but design is not yet developed. The storyboards we created 

        helped to approximate the number of pages the content would require and 

        how much text and graphics might go on each page. Simply presenting a 

        masked-out visual representation of each page helped the team easily grasp 

        whether our ideas and content were working.</p>

      <p class="normal"><span>Originally, content for </span><i>My Art Gallery</i><span> 

        came from various worksheets, diagrams, and notes from educators who participated 

        in the physical experience. This content was useful in the physical experience, 

        as it promoted two-way interaction with the students and educators. The 

        lesson tools could be used to explain complex concepts and generate discussion. 

        Working with this content, however, the Web team found the Web site was 

        developing into an unfocused experience for our users. Based on the original 

        content, many of the five lesson components repeated concepts, provided 

        too many options, and offered intricate cross-references to other lesson 

        components. We realized that the original content and ideas generated 

        for the site were impossible to fit into a restricted Web environment.</span></p>

      <p class="normal">As a result we prioritized content, focusing on the material 

        crucial to understanding the curatorial process. Content was streamlined 

        into a straightforward learning approach that would work on the Web. Other 

        ideas and components that were interesting but did not fit into this approach 

        were discarded. The storyboard we developed illustrated to all non-Web 

        team staff how the original content needed to be streamlined for the web. 

        It gave everyone working on the project a visual guide that became the 

        framework from which all content and ideas were generated. </p>

      <h3>  </h3>

      <h1>Mona, A Hip &#39;Learning Tool&#39; for Kids</h1>

      <p class="normal">During the first project meetings we brainstormed the idea 

        of having a guide to take users through the lessons. The graphic designer 

        developed an illustrated character who would act as an anchor point within 

        the site, add personal interest, and work with the content in a way that 

        our target audience could relate to<span>.</span><span></span></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="depaolo_SAM.fig.4.gif" width="350" height="520" alt="Mona"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Mona</p>

      <p class="normal">We felt it was important that the character be a compelling 

        peer who goes through the curatorial process on a level similar to our 

        users, but also explains the concepts and lessons as they proceed through 

        the site. The character developed was first called &#34;Annie Art&#34; but she 

        was eventually christened &#34;Mona.&#34; Used as a main tool for organizing the 

        content, she became the backbone around which we worked the other elements. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">Through her positioning, and the use of dialogue (called 

        &#34;bubble text&#34;) and rollovers, Mona operated interactively with the users, 

        providing a context for the content and accommodating different learning 

        styles. Some users have found they read Mona&#39;s bubble text while 

        others find they learn better relying solely on the visuals. </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="depaolo_SAM.fig.5.gif" width="400" height="242" alt="Mona with bubble text"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Mona with bubble text</p>

      <p class="normal">In addition to Mona, we developed a second character, her 

        dog Pablo, to keep students motivated, guide them through help screens, 

        and chart their progress throughout the site. Pablo became the icon giving 

        a consistent presence to the help function. </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="depaolo_SAM.fig.6a.gif" width="250" height="217" alt="Pablo"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Help box icon<span></span></p>

      <h1>Evolution of the Character and Script</h1>

      <p class="normal">The original text for the Web followed the course of the 

        lesson plans despite the fact that in the classroom the lessons were presented 

        for one to two hours over a period of ten weeks. The resulting text was 

        cumbersome, repetitive, and dry. Part of the problem was lack of experience. 

        The curatorial associate who helped write the original lessons and taught 

        them in the classroom was also writing the copy for the site. Her task 

        was formidable; she had to write for a format she had little experience 

        working with and for an interactive framework that did not yet exist. 

        Likewise, the Web team understood the technical and design possibilities 

        of the Web, but did not have the experience of creating an exhibition 

        with the students, nor were they experts on the curatorial process. Clearly, 

        the linear model that worked on simpler site projects &#34;first copy, then 

        design, then post&#34; was not going to work here. </p>

      <p class="normal"><span>Initially, we felt that Mona would appear intermittently 

        throughout the Web site, appearing only when necessary to add visual focus 

        and help explain a complex lesson. </span>As the lesson sections were 

        laid out graphically with the first draft of text, it became apparent 

        that the text and our character seemed disjointed. In fact, in early testing, 

        our user was not reading the text at all. This was partially a design 

        issue, but the illustrative examples that came out of the classroom were 

        detracting from the visual and interactive nature of the Web experience. 

      </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="depaolo_SAM.fig.7.jpg" width="400" height="254" alt="Round 1 Design: Mona with no “bubble” text - lesson text at bottom"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><span>Round 1 Design: Mona with no </span>&#34;bubble&#34; text 

        - lesson text at bottom</p>

      <p class="normal">During the next redesign Mona became the unifying structure 

        for the site, and text was streamlined to work with her. We added a text 

        bubble above her head and drastically cut the script to fit comfortably 

        within it. We were able to move much of the longer explanatory text into 

        Pablo&#39;s help screens, assuming that those who needed this extra information 

        would seek it out. Finally, text that did not have a direct visual relationship 

        to what was going on in that page was eliminated. </p>

      <p class="normal">Placing all of the instructional text in Mona&#39;s bubble 

        intensified the interactive quality that she now embodied. As users rolled 

        over the various interactives, Mona&#39;s position and bubble text changed 

        accordingly. A once static page was now full of action. </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="depaolo_SAM.fig.8.jpg" width="400" height="260" alt="Final Design: Lesson text integrated with Mona"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><span>Final Design: Lesson text integrated with Mona</span></p>

      <p class="normal">With Mona and Pablo established as our tour guides, the 

        text for the site shifted from a descriptive lecture into a narrative 

        dialogue. The curatorial associate and Web manager had many two-hour writing 

        sessions that were more like drama workshops<span>. </span>The graphic 

        designer also rewrote much of Mona&#39;s text; perhaps because the design 

        is so central to a site of this nature, she clearly understood what Mona 

        should say.</p>

      <p class="normal">Much of the narrative couldn&#39;t be written until the 

        basic design of each section of the site had been sketched out. We needed 

        an idea of what Mona would be doing and how the user to the site would 

        be interacting with her before we could write carefully focused text. 

        This back-and-forth exchange between design and copy writing allowed us 

        to make use of the unique abilities of the Web to illustrate complex ideas 

        (especially visual ones), and to streamline the text as we went. As the 

        programmer noted, there was one point where she realized that one rollover 

        allowed us to get rid of a whole page of text.</p>

      <p class="normal">Project staff had decided to write Mona in the youth vernacular 

        in order to appeal to the target audience. We did not want her to &#34;talk 

        down&#34; to the user but be an equal, someone they could feel comfortable 

        with when learning about the complexities of art. Internally there was 

        some concern about this language. We wondered if using words such as &#34;dude&#34; 

        and &#34;rock on&#34; could potentially alienate the students and trivialize the 

        process. We were sensitive to the fact that, as writers, we are much older 

        than our target audience. We didn&#39;t want to assume we knew what would 

        work for them. We also didn&#39;t want the site to become out of date 

        by using trendy language. </p>

      <h1>Testing Our Audience</h1>

      <p class="normal">During the writing process we struggled to keep our users 

        in mind. We realized that we were really working in the dark and were 

        plagued by the question, &#34;Will kids really do this?&#34; The next step was 

        to have both students and teachers review our materials to let us know 

        if we were on the right track. It was important to get feedback on what 

        we were building and also to get a sense of whether or not our target 

        audience would be interested in using the site. </p>

      <p class="normal"><span>Through informal testing we evaluated the site with 

        three different groups of users that we knew would be invaluable to our 

        development process: teacher consultants, students in the target age group, 

        and museum staff.</span> The graphic designer created two questionnaires 

        --one for the students and one for the teachers. She also created 

        design boards featuring Mona and Pablo, the site layout, and text. We 

        scheduled several one-hour testing sessions and recorded them. These sessions 

        kept us focused on the needs of our user throughout the rest of the development 

        process. </p>

      <p class="normal">What we found is that each student and teacher had contrasting 

        opinions of the Web, based on both level of interest and access to technology 

        resources. Regardless, each person responded with genuine interest in 

        learning what a curator does and in building their own exhibition site 

        on the Web. In fact, everyone seemed excited and interested in the concepts 

        of the site and the direction it was going. Reaction to the character 

        illustrations was positive, as was reaction to the text.<span></span></p>

      <p class="normal">Teachers were among the first testers of the site. They 

        encouraged a youth-oriented dialogue and alleviated our initial concerns 

        about the text. This core group of teachers became vital consultants whose 

        feedback proved invaluable throughout the development of the site. <span>Because 

        much of the site&#39;s content had to be reshaped from the original classroom 

        lessons for the web, we also wanted to verify that the content was still 

        solid from a pedagogical point of view. We also got their advice on the 

        logistics and feasibility of using an interactive Web site in a classroom. 

        The teachers supported our decision to make the site a personalized process 

        for the students, pointing out that the tools to let them pick their own 

        works of art and write their own notes were important motivators.</span> 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">As part of the testing process, we also interviewed a group 

        of middle school students. We were curious to see how they would respond 

        to Mona and the language in the script, as well as what interest they 

        would have in creating an art exhibition online. The graphics and text 

        were generally well received, with requests from various students to &#34;tone 

        down&#34; the use of the vernacular. We learned that they mainly use sites 

        targeted to adults, feeling strongly that education sites developed for 

        their age group were &#34;cookie cutter&#34; and that the language used was often 

        &#34;too cute.&#34; They encouraged us to create a Web site that gave them the 

        ability to make choices and trusted their intelligence. </p>

      <p class="normal">It was important to schedule constant review into the many 

        phases of the production process. Project staff , often consisting of 

        more that the central group of four, had long review meetings going over 

        each page of the site both during the initial design and throughout the 

        various redesign phases. We asked other museum staff to walk through the 

        site at several key points during production. These feedback sessions 

        were instrumental in fine-tuning the flow and troubleshooting technical 

        problems.</p>

      <h1>Redesigning the Curatorial Process Online</h1>

      <p class="normal">A good illustration of the development process for <i>My 

        Art Gallery</i> is the evolution of the research lesson design, which 

        was the most challenging to build. This section needed redesigning three 

        times, managed to dodge several deadlines, and caused widespread panic 

        among the Web team. The problem with this section was threefold: 1.) We 

        invited our users to leave our site to conduct research; 2.) We couldn&#39;t 

        assume they knew how to do this; and 3.)We had to acknowledge that researching 

        works of art could be an ambiguous and open-ended process. </p>

      <p class="normal">When we decided to encourage users to leave the site and 

        use search engines, we feared we would lose them. We worried that there 

        would not be enough incentive for them to return to our site even if we 

        used all the limited programming tools available to make coming back effortless. 

        As a result of our concern, Pablo was engineered to eagerly await their 

        return to the site.</p>

      <p class="normal">Another concern was how to explain the complex process of 

        conducting research online. Similar to how we first approached the original 

        text, we started with classroom technique and tried to model the process 

        by example. We took screen shots of some popular search engine sites that 

        Mona &#34;used&#34; to research the work of art she chose, hoping visuals would 

        effectively explain how to use search engines to some one who may have 

        never done it. However, we had problems securing permission from several 

        of the search engines to capture screen shots, so we had to abandon this 

        first design concept.<span> </span></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="depaolo_SAM.fig.9.jpg" width="400" height="256" alt="Round 1 Design: Research section with search engine screen shots"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Round 1 Design: Research section with search engine 

        screen shots</p>

      <p class="normal">This turned out to be a mixed blessing. We were trying to 

        balance the need to guide novice researchers while providing a more streamlined 

        presentation that would not bore those with more online experience. In 

        the end, we broke with the narrative script and replaced it with a central 

        research portal. </p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="depaolo_SAM.fig.10.jpg" width="400" height="249" alt="Final Design: Research section with search engine logo portal"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Final Design: Research section with search engine logo 

        portal</p>

      <p class="normal">Using various search engine logos, users can link to several 

        examples of search results and explore them in detail if they wish, before 

        moving on to do their own research. This simple design provides a needed 

        structure without being too didactic.<span> </span></p>

      <p class="normal">Research is a vital step to the curatorial process, including 

        understanding that there isn&#39;t necessarily one right answer to a 

        question raised. Sometimes finding an answer at all can be challenging, 

        especially for some of our collection&#39;s works that the students can 

        chose from. To prepare for this eventuality, we used <span>Mona to explain 

        that there can be many different opinions about one work of art, and they 

        are not necessarily right or wrong. She lets the user know that it is 

        ok if they can&#39;t find specific information about a chosen work of 

        art. Mona selects a photograph as an example, but fails to find explicit 

        details about it. However, after more research, she finds information 

        about the photographer and the subject of the photo, allowing her to hypothesize 

        what the answer to her question might be.</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span>Realistically, our concerns about this section could 

        not be dispelled easily since the actual process of research is, in and 

        of itself, inconclusive at times. There was also little we could do other 

        than hope the site was compelling enough to draw users back in to finish 

        their exhibit.</span></p>

      <h1>Use</h1>

      <p class="normal">During our testing phase we asked the teachers what they 

        thought the best way to market the Web site to Seattle-area educators 

        would be. Each teacher said an attractive postcard would stand out among 

        the multitude of solicitations they receive. Our Web designer produced 

        a postcard that was mailed in conjunction with the launch of the site 

        in September 2000. We used our own mailing list of Puget Sound-area schools 

        and education-related institutions that represented our target audience. 

        Our press department also sent out a release that generated national coverage 

        in education and art-related publications.</p>

      <p class="normal">The postcard mailing was very successful in reaching a local 

        audience, and several area teachers have integrated the site into their 

        curriculum. Some teachers have contacted us to discuss the site and provided 

        informative feedback. Most reviews have been favorable, but we ran into 

        an unforeseen roadblock: notebook identification. Following protocol adopted 

        by other Web sites, we had chosen the users&#39; email addresses as the unique 

        identifier for the notebooks. This identifier has the advantage of allowing 

        us to email forgotten passwords to users--important in ensuring continued 

        use of the site. However, we learned that many students do not have their 

        own email addresses. In one instance, a resourceful teacher allowed her 

        students to use her email address; unfortunately, this meant that all 

        the students were actually writing to the same notebook, resulting in 

        quite a mess. In other instances, the students mistyped their email address 

        in the initial setup, rendering their notebook inaccessible when returning 

        to the site. The programmer and Web manager worked with affected teachers 

        to come up with short-term solutions so their students could continue 

        to work on the site. </p>

      <p class="normal">Many of the teachers who contacted us did so specifically 

        to discuss technical difficulties, but this also gave us the opportunity 

        to interview them to understand how the site was being used. It is interesting 

        to highlight one teacher&#39;s experience with the site. She had an ongoing 

        discussion with her students about attitudes toward works of art. Her 

        students argued that all artworks could be judged equally, that merely 

        by being art they were &#34;all the same.&#34; She wanted to find a way to prove 

        to them that works of art are held up to standards and that each work 

        of art had to be understood within its own context. After receiving our 

        postcard, she thought the <i>My Art Gallery</i> Web site would be a good 

        tool to use to prove her point. Along with using the site, she also required 

        the students to hand in a paper. She did feel that the students&#39; 

        assumptions about art were being tested as a result of using the site. 

        Through their exploration of the five interactive lessons, they were discovering 

        the complexities involved in researching art. As a result, they had many 

        questions about the works they chose, and some students came to her for 

        guidance when they could not find adequate research to explain them. This 

        feedback supported our initial fears about developing the research section. 

        However, with this teacher&#39;s guidance, the students did not give 

        up and learned a valuable lesson about the process of research itself 

        and also the intricacies of researching two very different works of art.</p>

      <p class="normal">Another indication of use is the online exhibitions that 

        are created after the users go through the lessons. As of this publication, 

        254 users have logged on and 64 exhibitions have been created. Many of 

        the exhibitions submitted are similar; the majority include two works 

        of art and one paragraph describing and/or comparing the works. This may 

        indicate that our user expectations were too high, since we were hoping 

        the submissions would be more extensive and dissimilar. We knew from the 

        beginning that our goals were ambitious, expecting users to go through 

        the five lessons to launch their online exhibition. After going through 

        all of that, it may be unrealistic to expect the students to go back to 

        their notebook to continue to choose, research, and write about additional 

        works of art. </p>

      <p class="normal">In the spring of 2001, we will evaluate the use of the site 

        to determine what further enhancements should be made. We will review 

        a wide range of issues: long-term solutions for the technical problems, 

        analysis of the quality of the exhibition submissions, limitations of 

        the research section, and whether or not we should provide more information 

        about the works of art from our collection that are on the site for users 

        to select. Important to this discussion is what amount of museum resources 

        is available to further market, maintain, and enhance the site.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p class="normal">The Seattle Art Museum staff working on this project learned 

        several invaluable lessons. First, we learned that the organization of 

        a complex Web site has to come from the Web site producers in the form 

        of a storyboard, mission statement, and production timeline. Staff with 

        Web expertise understand how a project idea can be best translated into 

        a successful online experience. Second, a level of trust in the Web team 

        is needed from all staff participants in order to do this. Staff members 

        need to trust that their goals and expertise will not be lost or misinterpreted 

        through the Web development process. This trust is built when all project 

        participants gain an understanding of how the Web works. Also, positive 

        working relationships among staff can be further established if all participants 

        on a project have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities 

        and are kept informed. Third, effective project coordination and communication 

        is difficult to implement with new initiatives such as the <i>My Art Gallery</i> 

        Web site, but it is one of the most important factors in its success. 

        We encountered many stumbling blocks in this area, but came out of it 

        with clear communication models that we are now using, making current 

        Web site projects much easier.</p>

      <p class="normal">Interestingly, the Web site ignited many of the contentious 

        issues raised as a result of the <i>Growing Up with Art</i> project. This 

        project sparked discussion within the institution about the role of the 

        curator in a museum and whether a sixth-grader could be a substitute for 

        a real curator. Our efforts to highlight this experience and put it on 

        the web, in a very public format, brought this issue back into the spotlight. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">The management challenges of a Web project with this level 

        of complexity seemed daunting at times because protocol was lacking within 

        the museum to guide us through the unique issues that arose. Many of these 

        issues demanded attention, and meetings were held to explore and create 

        new guidelines. Some of the questions raised included, Do we need to review 

        the online exhibitions users created? Or is it acceptable to post them 

        automatically to the site? Since this was a project of complex collaboration 

        across museum departments, who was ultimately responsible for it? The 

        meetings convened to answer these questions resulted in innovative problem 

        solving, but also led to more questions that we are confident will be 

        answered over time. Eventually, we started to see <i>My Art Gallery</i> 

        as one pioneering answer to meeting the museum&#39;s important initiatives 

        and as an exciting pilot project to lay groundwork for future Web projects.
