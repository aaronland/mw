      <h1 class="PaperTitle">Making good use of user input: Incorporation of public 

        evaluation into the system development process</h1>

      <h2 class="Author">Fiona Marshall, The British Museum, UK</h2>

      <h1 class="abstractTitle">Abstract:</h1>

      <span class="AbstractText">Predicting the structure and function of a public 

      system without user input is fraught with danger, but this user input is 

      very difficult to obtain without a working prototype. Traditional system 

      design methods make little provision for evaluation and testing by public 

      users. Weaving the results of evaluation and testing into the end of the 

      system development process presents risks: how, for example, can we address 

      unforeseen navigation problems identified during user evaluation, while 

      at the same time ensuring that tight deadlines are met? Another challenge 

      is that we often work with teams of specialists (interface designers, HTML 

      developers, database specialists, content creators etc): alteration of one 

      element often has knock-on effects on other team members. </span><span class="AbstractText"> 

      Drawing on experience with the COMPASS project at the British Museum, the 

      author will present practical ideas for incorporating evaluation into the 

      system development process.</span>

      <p class="AbstractText">Keywords: Evaluation, Prototyping, Usability testing, 

        User interface design, COMPASS, British Museum.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class="normal">In this paper, I shall consider how the results of usability 

        and prototype testing can be fed into the development process most effectively. 

        Much has been written about the need for user input in system development, 

        but do we test our systems with prospective users at the optimum time 

        in the development process? I shall discuss a number of alternative methodologies 

        for evaluation and prototyping, highlighting the challenges they present. 

        Finally, I shall suggest a possible way forward, based on my experience 

        with the COMPASS Project.</p>

      <p class="normal">User interface design and testing</p>

      <p class="normal">A plethora of published information exists on the design 

        of user interfaces. A gem amongst these is Nielsen (2000), which provides 

        excellent advice - including many examples - on designing usable websites. 

        Schofield &amp; Flute (1997) provide similarly practical advice on designing 

        kiosk software and hardware. The case for usability testing and prototyping 

        is well made by Nielsen (1993) and Preece (1994), both of which describe 

        alternative procedures. Mitchell and Economou (2000) advise on the practice 

        of formative evaluation, prototyping and summative evaluation in museums.</p>

      <p class="normal">These references show that there are many methods of evaluation 

        and prototyping; Shackel in Preece (1994) explains that you will probably 

        need to use different methods at different stages of the project. There 

        are two basic types of prototype: evolutionary and throw-away. The best 

        prototypes are probably those that are produced quickly and thrown away. 

        They are produced near the start of the development cycle, before too 

        much costly work has been invested in interface design. In the case of 

        complex systems using a range of software tools, the further you get into 

        development without prototyping, the less chance you have to change the 

        interface and the greater the risk of failure.</p>

      <br clear="all"/>

      <p class="normal">Costs are always a major factor in any project, but they 

        seem to be dwelt on most particularly when working with a commercial supplier. 

        My perception from talking to a number of suppliers is that they are often 

        reluctant to prototype. In the context of competitive bids and cost cutting, 

        they may feel that prototyping is too expensive. Some developers seem 

        to think that the <i>client</i> should know how the end users of their 

        system will want it to function. Other developers claim <i>they</i> know 

        what system users want, based on previous projects. Neither assumption 

        is true: both client and developer needs to find out what prospective 

        users want and the best way to do that is by prototype testing.</p>

      <p class="normal">Below I shall describe different types of usability testing 

        and prototyping and examples of how they were applied to the COMPASS project 

        at the British Museum. First, though, some brief information about COMPASS.</p>

      <h3>COMPASS</h3>

      <p class="normal">COMPASS (Collections Multimedia Public Access System) is 

        a database-driven multimedia guide to a selection of around 5,000 of the 

        Museum&#39;s objects. The system is aimed at adults with no prior knowledge 

        of the collections, as well as school children aged 8-11 and family groups. 

        More information is given in the Appendix to this paper.</p>

      <p class="normal">The full COMPASS system will be available in the British 

        Museum on wide screen format touchscreens linked to the Museum&#39;s 

        internal high speed network. The content includes high quality images, 

        3d reconstructions, animations and specially-written text narratives. 

        The interface - designed to be used from a touchscreen only - uses DHTML 

        templates accessing System Simulation Ltd&#39;s Index+ database. </p>

      <p class="normal">A web version, using a different design of user interface 

        (HTML templates), was launched on the web in June 2000 ( (Note that this 

        is currently separate from the British Museum&#39;s main website, although 

        linked - if you can find the link. The Museum plans to bring the two systems 

        closer together.) The internet interface is deliberately low tech, ensuring 

        that it can be used without plug-ins on low-end PCs with low-speed internet 

        links, as are still widely used in UK schools and homes. Accessibility 

        for users with visual impairments was a key factor in design of the graphical 

        and text-only web interfaces. </p>

      <p class="normal">The commercial software supplier System Simulation Ltd (SSL) 

        provided the database (based on Index+) and user interfaces for the Reading 

        Room and internet. Due to the number of contributors involved in the project, 

        development occurred in three separate, but linked, strands: content production, 

        development of the production database and specification and design of 

        the user interface. </p>

      <p class="normal">All content on COMPASS has been produced with our different 

        audiences&#39; needs in mind. On many public systems, the user needs 

        prior knowledge of the content to know what they can search for. To make 

        things easier, we are providing indexes which use terms in common usage 

        - rather than technical/curatorial terms. On the touchscreen version, 

        users just point at the word they want. In addition, on both versions 

        we provide virtual &#39;tours&#39; of groups of objects in familiar 

        themes, objects of the month available from the Home page and thousands 

        of links between the objects and to background information.</p>

      <p class="normal">The Museum&#39;s emphasis has been on developing high quality 

        content rather than a high tech user interface. We wanted a clean design, 

        through which our rich content would shine through, without the need for 

        plug-ins and frames. Intuitive and readable were two key requirements. 

        The Museum worked closely with SSL, different target groups and experts 

        in evaluation in an effort to realise its aims of ease of use and accessibility.</p>

      <p class="normal">Development and revision of the user interface has been 

        one of the most challenging aspects of the project. Based in part on this 

        experience, I shall now describe some evaluation and prototyping methods 

        and the challenges they present.</p>

      <h3>Evaluation and prototyping</h3>

      <h2>Informal interviews </h2>

      <p class="normal">The first stage in any system development is, of course, 

        to find out about the target users and what they want from your system. 

        This could involve talking to prospective users (eg teachers, visitors) 

        direct and referring to organisations (including museums) who have already 

        done this type of research. </p>

      <p class="normal"><b>Challenges:</b> The main challenge with asking potential 

        users what they want is trying to get a reliable response:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Firstly, if you ask people what they want in a system, 

          they might not appreciate the possibilities. You might have to provide 

          mock-ups to explain your plans - or even prototypes.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Secondly, some people might say they would like the 

          proposed system - and then don&#39;t use it when it is released. Alternatively, 

          they might say they would never use it in a million years - and then 

          become system junkies. (Neilsen (2000) gives some examples of this.) 

        </span></li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Surveys </h3>

      <span class="Normal">A more reliable approach is to analyse things like 

      public enquiries to your Information desk. With COMPASS, we were able to 

      use the results of general visitor surveys which indicated that a significant 

      proportion of visitors to the Museum would like more information about the 

      collections - including online. </span> 

      <h3>Formative prototype </h3>

      <p><span class="Normal">In an ideal world, everyone would produce prototypes 

        before they embark on any development work at all, in order to see whether 

        the public like their initial ideas. In 1998, the British Museum produced 

        a &#39;throw-away&#39; prototype COMPASS system which was evaluated by museum 

        visitors and professional colleagues. The main emphasis of this early 

        prototype was the evaluation of different technical options for delivery 

        of multimedia. The prototype enthused curators about the potential of 

        multimedia and helped to obtain management - and, most importantly, donor 

        - support.</span></p>

      <p><span class="Normal"><b>Challenges:</b> </span> </p>

      <ul>

        <li><span class="Normal"> The work involved in such an early prototype 

          is, even without the development of much live content, likely to be 

          very intensive - and therefore very costly. Of course if funding is 

          obtained as a result of this work, the effort will be well repaid. </span> 

          <p class="normal"> 

        </p></li><li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Time gaps between initial prototyping and obtaining 

          funds for full development may be significant enough to see major developments 

          in technology. This might reduce the value of the early prototype in 

          providing lessons for the full system. 

      </span></li></ul>

      <h3>Written specifications </h3>

      <p class="normal">These are supposed to describe exactly what the system must 

        and should do, often for the purposes of producing a contract between 

        museum and supplier.</p>

      <p class="normal"><b>Challenges: </b>Designed to ensure that the client and 

        the developer knows what to expect and that neither side changes the requirement 

        halfway through the contract, a written specification for user interfaces 

        and screen designs can cause all sorts of misunderstandings and problems. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal"> 

      </p><ul>

        <li><span class="Normal"> Words used to describe required screen designs 

          (eg &#39;clean&#39;, &#39;intuitive&#39;) are open to differences 

          of interpretation. </span> 

          <p class="normal"> 

        </p></li><li class="normal"><span class="normal"> More fundamentally, though, formal system specifications 

          were traditionally produced in conjunction with the end-users. Probably 

          possible (although difficult) with internal systems, where future users 

          can define their work processes, it would be nearly impossible to produce 

          such a specification in conjunction with public users. While you might 

          be able to form a focus group to assist with the process, if you involved 

          the same people for too long, they would become familiar with your plans 

          and would not adequately represent the average real user, who arrives 

          at your site with no prior knowledge. 

      </span></li></ul>

      <h3>Mock-up screens </h3>

      <p class="normal">My own preference is for sketches produced as a result of 

        brainstorming sessions, but some designers will prefer to work up full 

        graphical designs on screen. </p>

      <p class="normal"><b>Challenges:</b> </p>

      <p class="normal"> 

      </p><ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Design work can be labour intensive. A team might 

          be able to produce 20 rough sketches in an afternoon and will have lost 

          little time if they decide to throw them all away. 20 designs produced 

          on screen will take much longer and if the client doesn&#39;t like 

          them, much more money has been spent and there is less room for manoeuvre. 

        </span></li><li class="normal"><span class="normal"> You might want to use these mock-ups for evaluation, 

          but it is difficult for prospective users to understand how static graphical 

          layouts link together to form a live system. 

        </span></li><li class="normal"><span class="normal"> As Verplank explains in Preece (1994), production 

          of very attractive graphical designs on screen can encourage designers 

          to &#39;fix&#39; on a particular solution too soon, rather than exploring 

          alternatives. 

      </span></li></ul>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal"><b></b></span><b>Horizontal prototypes 

        </b></p>

      <p class="normal">A horizontal prototype provides most of the user interface, 

        but without the depth (eg content, links). It could be useful for testing 

        usability.</p>

      <p class="normal"><b>Challenges:</b> The lack of content could distract testers. 

        (With COMPASS, the developer produced a full working system, to which 

        we added limited content for testing with visitors (see below). Although 

        the tests were generally useful, testers were frustrated that their efforts 

        frequently yielded &#39;no hits&#39;.)</p>

      <p class="normal"><b>Vertical prototypes </b></p>

      <p class="normal">A vertical prototype is a working system developed for one 

        specific part of the required functionality, eg searching. It is good 

        for testing particularly complex functionality.</p>

      <p class="normal"><b>Challenges: </b>Production of such a prototype could 

        be very time consuming for complex systems. </p>

      <p class="normal"><b>Scenarios </b></p>

      <p class="normal">A scenario is a way of describing how a system is used in 

        a particular situation, i.e. when a user carries out a specific task or 

        set of tasks. It might be used to demonstrate a system or to see whether 

        testers can carry out one particular course of action. Scenarios can be 

        presented in text format or can be built in systems such as Macromedia 

        Director. We used the latter approach to test the COMPASS touchscreen 

        searches. The COMPASS designer mocked up screen designs, initially in 

        Photoshop, and then stitched them together into a Director movie. We asked 

        visitors to try to search for specific things using these; if they pressed 

        the correct buttons in the correct order, they found the records in question. 

        This test yielded very useful results about usability in this specific 

        area.</p>

      <p class="normal"><b>Challenges:</b> </p>

      <p class="normal"> 

      </p><ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> The linear, fixed nature of a scenario might limit 

          the value of a test, particularly for a non-linear system. 

        </span></li><li class="normal"><span class="normal"> The limited nature of a scenario means that an interviewer 

          generally needs to be on hand to help the tester. This reduces the scope 

          for discrete observation. 

      </span></li></ul>

      <p class="normal"><b>Full working prototypes/Observation and interviews</b></p>

      <p class="normal">A full working prototype generally uses the same software 

        tools as the final version and is not thrown away at the end of testing. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal"><b>Challenges: </b>With a very complex system, much effort 

        goes into production of this prototype. Subsequent changes can have major 

        implications for the developer, who would have to redesign screens and 

        HTML templates and recode links to the database. Changes can also affect 

        content developers.</p>

      <p class="normal">For the COMPASS website, our developer produced full graphical 

        designs, converted them to HTML and linked the templates to the database. 

        This full working system was released for evaluation, complete in most 

        respects apart from the content. The COMPASS team set up standalone PCs 

        in one of the Museum galleries. Visitors were asked to try out the system 

        and were observed (at distance) and then interviewed by COMPASS staff. 

        We found the observation results particularly useful. Both the graphical 

        interface and the text-only version were also evaluated by blind and partially 

        sighted users using screen reader software at the Sensory Disability Research 

        Unit at Hertfordshire University, where testers were interviewed and recorded 

        on video as they used the system. </p>

      <p class="normal">Results were generally positive, but many useful observations 

        were made. Many of the required changes were addressed, although this 

        required screen redesigns and much effort from the developer. The complexity 

        of producing a working prototype of a system that knits together a database, 

        HTML templates, designs and evolving content, cannot be underestimated. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">Despite some minor issues, the team was keen to release 

        COMPASS on the web, partly to elicit feedback (via a questionnaire and 

        email) which would inform ongoing content development and design of the 

        touchscreen interface. Secondly, we were able to test our publication 

        process from database to live site before the greater complexity of publishing 

        from database to two live sites (internet and intranet). Thirdly, difficulties 

        with the user interface design process for the web system led us to try 

        alternative methodologies for the touchscreen development, including the 

        scenarios explained above.</p>

      <p class="normal">We are now planning the development of the Educational COMPASS 

        website. What lessons have we learnt and how will we change the methodology 

        for the Education site?</p>

      <p class="normal"><b>Advice on the system development process</b></p>

      <p class="normal">Although the COMPASS team wants to make some changes to 

        the web interface, user reaction so far has been very positive. The team 

        is very pleased with the touchscreen interface and early testing with 

        potential users was encouraging. However, the actual <i>process</i> of 

        user interface design and development has been very challenging and quite 

        painful for both client and developer. If we were starting again today, 

        we would do things differently in places. Some of the following is therefore 

        based on exp<span class="Normal">erience of trying it another way (in 

        other words: do as I say, not as I did...!).</span></p>

      <ol>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Find out as much as you can about your target users 

          (age range, IT knowledge, interests etc). If you have a fairly definable 

          audience (eg schools, users with particular disabilities), go and talk 

          to them or to organisations which have done this sort of research already.<br/>

          <br/>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Read as much as you can about design principles, prototyping 

          and evaluation before you select your software developer. You need to 

          know what to ask them to do and how long it should take. Do not assume 

          that your supplier will know best. (Of course, they should know best, 

          but they should find it much easier to work with a well-informed client.)<br/>

          <br/>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">In planning your content, do plenty of formative evaluation 

          before you start, eg ask for advice from colleagues in other museums, 

          your reception desk staff, analyse your public enquiries. You could 

          talk to visitors, Friends organisations etc, but as explained in Informal 

          Interviews above, be slightly wary of subjective answers unless you 

          have an early prototype on which to base your questions.<br/>

          <br/>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Look at websites and CD-ROM&#39;s and make notes on 

          what you like and don&#39;t like - and why. This can be a huge help 

          to your designer to give them an idea of where to start and what to 

          avoid.<br/>

          <br/>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Hold brainstorming sessions with your designers and 

          try to sketch out as many wild and wacky ideas as you can possibly manage. 

          Try to dissuade your designer from narrowing down the options too early 

          as this could limit creativity.<br/>

          <br/>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Discuss your sketches and select your chosen way forward. 

          Build flow diagrams and navigation schemes to show how the system would 

          work from the user&#39;s point of view. &#39;Walk&#39; through them 

          with your colleagues to make sure that they make sense.<br/>

          <br clear="all"/>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Produce a &#39;grey&#39; (ie un-&#39;designed&#39;) 

          prototype of parts of the system to show to potential users. This could 

          be built using a simple HTML authoring tool or Director and could be 

          done by the client rather than the developer. The grey prototype will 

          emphasise the navigation though the system (eg menus, options, searches). 

          You will probably need to include some &#39;dummy&#39; content. Ask 

          a representative sample of potential users to try out the prototype. 

          Observe (from a discrete distance) how they use the system and where 

          they have problems. Interview them afterwards. Update the prototype 

          in line with the results. Note: Testing and documenting the results 

          can be very time consuming. Your developer should make sure that they 

          have plenty to do in parallel while you are testing, or you may feel 

          pressurised into cutting back on testing to keep the project on track.<br/>

          <br/>

        </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Ask your designers to develop the second prototype. 

          Depending on the nature of your system, this could either:</span></li>

        <ul>

          <p class="normal"> 

          </p><li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Use the same &#39;grey&#39; screens, but with 

            links to your database behind the scenes to allow more testing of 

            functionality or 

          </span></li><li class="normal"><span class="normal"> It could be based on new graphical screens, much 

            closer to the final interface, but with no functional links to a database. 

            This would allow more accurate testing of the usability of the interface. 

            If you have to keep to a corporate style, you might want to involve 

            museum designers in the screen design discussions, but do make sure 

            that graphic designers who are more used to working with traditional 

            print media understand the fundamental differences in aim and approach 

            of computer interfaces. <br/>

            <br/>

        </span></li></ul>

        <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">Again, observe testers trying the 

          system and interview them afterwards. Final sign off of the prototype 

          screens should be conditional on the developer ensuring that the live 

          system will reflect the results of usability testing. If sign off has 

          to be done by senior managers, they must be kept up to date with the 

          test results.</span></p>

        <p class="normal"> 

        </p><li class="normal"><span class="normal"> If all goes well, your developer should now be able 

          to proceed with the full development, secure in the knowledge that you 

          will not make any more fundamental changes to the interface which cost 

          very large sums (and time) to change. If you are still not sure on this 

          point, you need another round of prototype testing. Obviously, technical 

          issues will arise as the developer moves to using the &#39;real&#39; 

          software tools, rather than those used for the prototype. You should 

          work closely with the developer to ensure that any limitations are spotted 

          early on and that decisions are made on consequent revisions to the 

          specification. 

      </span></li></ol>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p class="normal">The above process is not, of course, the only way to develop 

        a system. I hope, however, that this paper will encourage museums to think 

        about the process and how best to work with their software developer. 

        Whether to test at all is no longer in question, but museums should consider 

        what sort of prototype to develop and when to test it with prospective 

        users. Too early and the target audience may not understand what you can 

        offer them. Too late and it can cost a fortune to put your system right. 

        The timing of the usability testing may be up for discussion, but one 

        thing is not: go live without testing at all and you could end up with 

        an ignominious flop on your hands</p>

      <p class="normal">COMPASS is a database-driven multimedia guide to a selection 

        of around 5,000 of the Museum&#39;s objects, mainly those on display. 

        The system is aimed at adults with no prior knowledge of the collections 

        as well as school children aged 8-11 and family groups. The full COMPASS 

        system will be available in the Museum&#39;s recently restored Reading 

        Room from Spring 2001, where visitors will be able to use the 50 wide 

        screen format touchscreens linked to the Museum&#39;s internal high speed 

        network. The content includes high quality images, 3d reconstructions, 

        animations and specially-written text narratives. The interface uses DHTML 

        templates accessing the Index+ database. </p>

      <p class="normal">A web version, using a different design of user interface 

        (HTML templates), was launched on the web in June 2000 ( The internet 

        interface is deliberately low tech, ensuring that it can be used without 

        plug-ins on low-end PCs with low speed modems as are still widely used 

        in UK schools and homes. Accessibility for users with visual impairments 

        was a key factor in the design of the graphical and text-only interfaces. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">We have incorporated several features to simplify access 

        for users with no prior knowledge of the collections. Online &#39;tours&#39;, 

        for example, group together objects into familiar themes. Some have been 

        written for children aged 8-11 and for family groups; one (on the Year 

        of the Dragon) was written by pupils from a Chinese school in London. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">A full educational version of COMPASS is being developed 

        for use on the web. As well as using pre-set groups of objects assembled 

        into subject areas to support the UK National Curriculum, teachers are 

        expected to make strong use of the &#39;personal folder&#39; facility. 

        This will enable all users - both on the web and in the Museum - to store 

        personal selections of objects in their own folder. Selections made on 

        the web will be retrievable in the Museum and can be printed on purchase 

        of a BM smartcard.</p>

      <p class="normal">The COMPASS project has been wholly funded by a very generous 

        donation from the Annenberg Foundation in the US. As well as funding hardware 

        and software, this donation paid for all content creation. A team of specialists 

        in text editing, imaging, educational multimedia, 3d reconstruction and 

        animation has been appointed and the COMPASS budget compensates curatorial 

        departments, photographers etc for their time. All content has been produced 

        by or under the direction of over 90 museum curators and must be &#39;signed 

        off&#39; by the curators before it is published. Guidance on text production 

        etc was provided by the COMPASS team, who edit all material prior to sign 

        off. </p>
