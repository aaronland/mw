      <p class="PaperTitle">Augmenting On-line Exhibitions: Building a Multimedia 

        Knowledge Repository: Multimedia: From Wagner to Virtual Reality on Artmuseum.net</p>

      <p class="Author">Randall Packer, University of Maryland,USA</p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">This paper focuses on the creation of a knowledge 

        base that provides educational support for museum exhibitions in the hypermedia 

        environment. The subject of this report is &#34;Multimedia: From Wagner 

        to Virtual Reality,&#34; a project commissioned by Artmuseum.net and 

        created by multimedia artist and historian Randall Packer. The site explores 

        the broad historical trajectory in the arts and sciences that has converged 

        as multimedia, providing a critical foundation of media history, aesthetic 

        inquiry, and social critique that enriches the viewer&#39;s visit to Artmuseum.net. 

        &#34;Multimedia: From Wagner to Virtual Reality&#34; embraces the dynamics 

        of multimedia in its study of the medium, providing the on-line visitor 

        with a better understanding of the language of media, the complexity of 

        non-sequential learning and exploration, and new ways of thinking about 

        essential concepts of media such as interactivity, immersion, hypermedia, 

        integration and narrativity. The site&#39;s contents, which include a timeline 

        of multimedia&#39;s pioneers, an illustrated historical narrative of multimedia, 

        and in-depth studies of the creative work of seminal artists and scientists, 

        serves as a knowledge base that provides historical and theoretical context 

        for several of Artmuseum.net&#39;s exhibitions that showcase media art. A 

        section devoted to using the site in the classroom, from which teachers 

        can derive presentations, enrich on-line syllabi with links, and give 

        students research assignments, becomes a model and educational tool for 

        both students and teachers - guiding them in the use of Artmuseum.net 

        and how it extends itself into the classroom. The paper will include a 

        detailed explanation of the specific educational objectives of the site, 

        its integration with Artmuseum.net exhibitions, and how it is being prototyped 

        in digital arts curriculum, notably Randall Packer&#39;s courses at the Maryland 

        Institute, College of Art in Baltimore. </p>

      <p class="AbstractText">This project is part of a larger hybrid-publishing 

        project, which includes the book of the same name, co-edited by Randall 

        Packer and Ken Jordan and published by W.W. Norton for April 2001. </p>

      <h1>Historical Background</h1>

      <p class="normal">Vannevar Bush, in his famous treatise from 1945, &#34;As We 

        May Think,&#34; declared that some day the world&#39;s &#34;cultural record,&#34; 

        as he described it, would be accessible to all of mankind. Despite the 

        fact that the first electronic digital computer (ENIAC) was just completed 

        that year, a hulking, non-programmable device that took up 18,000 square 

        feet, Bush foresaw a miniaturized information workstation that he dubbed 

        &#34;Memex&#34; as the future of how knowledge workers would some day store, access, 

        and retrieve information. </p>

      <p class="normal">Bush was so far ahead of his time that his Memex was conceived 

        to operate as a microfilm reader, the technology of his day; it would 

        take many technological strides before the information workstation would 

        be based on digitally stored 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s. Nevertheless, it was 

        here that Bush conceived the notion of indexed information that could 

        be linked associatively, a formidable breakthrough that would lead to 

        the concept of the hyperlink. But even more importantly, Bush&#39;s groundbreaking 

        ideas guided many generations of scientists, engineers and scholars in 

        diverse fields to pursue an effective means of storing large quantities 

        of data, as well as suggesting that some day there would exist a system 

        for easily creating and organizing information in its various forms. These 

        individuals included Ted Nelson, whose own concept of Xanadu, a revolutionary 

        new system for publishing and accessing digital information. preceded 

        the Web by over twenty years; Douglas Engelbart, whose invention of the 

        mouse and other essential information technologies during the 1960s enabled 

        him to realize his dream to facilitate collaboration teams or communities 

        of knowledge workers with the tools for boosting the &#34;collective IQ; and 

        J.C.R. Licklider, director of ARPA during the 1960s and guiding light 

        behind the formation of the Internet, who imagined a symbiosis between 

        man and computer, inspiring many scientists to think about the possibilities 

        of human-computer interactivity. </p>

      <p class="normal">Eventually, with the widespread use of the World Wide Web, 

        Bush&#39;s dream of a vast information space became a reality, and it 

        was only a few short years before countless institutions, from museums 

        to libraries to government agencies, began to publish the global cultural 

        record he envisioned. </p>

      <h1>The Knowledge Repository</h1>

      <p class="normal">Bush, Nelson, Engelbart, and Licklider, long before the 

        Web, felt that the widespread creation of an information network would 

        lead to digital libraries and collective repositories of Knowledge. They 

        envisioned that these knowledge bases would result in any number of applications, 

        from Engelbart&#39;s &#34;community handbooks,&#34; living, dynamic collections 

        of shared data documenting the changing policies of an institution, to 

        Nelson&#39;s Xanadu, where writers could deposit their intellectual property 

        and receive royalties every time the public accessed a work from anywhere 

        in the world. Engelbart and Nelson could not have imagined how dramatically 

        their ideas would be adopted. Although history did not exactly imitate 

        their vision, it is now a fact that institutions all over the world are 

        creating repositories of cultural information, scientific research, and 

        commodity space that truly boggle the imagination. Who could have imagined 

        that virtually every museum in the world would someday have a Web site 

        containing some portion of their collection on-line, generating an extraordinary 

        database of artworks accessible to anyone with a personal computer and 

        a modem? Projects such as AMICO (<a href="http://www.amico.org/" target="new">http://www.amico.org</a>) 

        have attempted to take advantage of this widespread digitalization of 

        intellectual property by creating a higher level system of access and 

        organization. </p>

      <p class="normal">It suffices to say that repositories of information are 

        increasingly becoming the valuable cultural resource foreseen by Bush. 

        Once a repository is put into place by a museum, a university, or network 

        of universities, this repository becomes the resource of any individual 

        or institution that incorporates it into its own applications. With the 

        ease of hyperlinking, it is possible to build interactive educational 

        materials that seamlessly link to any number of repositories that provide 

        relevant and related information. </p>

      <h1>Overview of the Site</h1>

      <p class="normal">Inspired by Bush&#39;s notion of the knowledge base, I 

        created a site for Intel&#39;s Artmuseum.net, entitled &#34;Multimedia: From 

        Wagner to Virtual Reality&#34;. In this project, I organized over ten years 

        of research in the history of multimedia, including rare and often unknown 

        analysis and documentation on pioneering artists and scientists whose 

        work was seminal to the evolution of the digital medium. The project was 

        created in association with W.W. Norton, publisher of the book of the 

        same title (to be released this spring), and the other half of this hybrid 

        publishing project that joins print with the World Wide Web.</p>

      <p class="normal">The site is organized into four main parts: (1) Overture, 

        a hyperlinked narrative that overviews the history of the medium: its 

        themes, pioneers, and the essential paradigms that underscore the intersection 

        between the arts and sciences; (2) Pioneers, a chronological, interactive 

        timeline that focuses on the medium&#39;s pioneers and the concepts that 

        inspired their artistic and technological work; (3) Concepts, the conceptual 

        framework of ideas and paradigms and how they emanate from five essential 

        underlying concepts: integration, interactivity, hypermedia, immersion, 

        and narrativity; (4) In Depth, an archive of documentation profiling five 

        leading pioneers in the arts and sciences drawn from the timeline.</p>

      <h1>Educational Objectives</h1>

      <p class="normal">&#34;Multimedia: From Wagner to Virtual Reality&#34; was commissioned 

        by Intel&#39;s Artmuseum.net and their Arts and Education program. The 

        purpose of the site is to function as an educational resource on the history 

        of art and technology, critical to their mission to support and develop 

        on-line museum exhibitions, many of which have focused on contemporary 

        media art. These exhibitions include the Bill Viola Retrospective, Refresh 

        (on-line screensavers), and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art&#39;s 

        recent 010101: Art in Technological Times. </p>

      <p class="normal">The site is specifically designed to allow viewers the opportunity 

        to explore how the work of Bill Viola, for example, fits into the larger 

        historical context, noting his artistic influences and mentors, including 

        Nam June Paik and John Cage. It also broadens the viewer&#39;s knowledge 

        of the key concepts that underlie the work of media artists. For example, 

        it discusses Viola&#39;s concept of &#34;dataspace,&#34; and how this idea has 

        evolved in the work of both artists and scientists. It is possible to 

        hyperlink from &#39;dataspace&#39; in the Concepts section to the many 

        related ideas that reveal the shifts in narrativity as a result of new 

        media technologies. One could also travel from Viola, to the work of such 

        seminal engineers like Billy Klüver, who in the 1960s pioneered many of 

        the earliest works of art and technology by artists such as Cage, Rauschenberg, 

        Tinguely, Warhol, and Johns, many of whom were highly influential on Viola 

        and the emerging media artists of his generation. </p>

      <p class="normal">In 010101, a very forward-looking exhibition of art and 

        technology, &#34;Multimedia: From Wagner to Virtual Reality,&#34; reveals the 

        historical precedents for the changing aspects of art, the individual, 

        and society, the subject of this show. It is surprising to many, however, 

        including the artists working in the new media, to discover that early 

        20<sup>th</sup> Century artists, such as the Futurists, were envisioning 

        similar social, political, and artistic transformations through the incorporation 

        of the technology of their day. At the time of the Futurists, the medium 

        was cinema; their Manifesto, &#34;The Future of &#34;Cinema,&#34; is an important 

        historical precedent for the way information technologies have become 

        the catalysts of change today. </p>

      <h1>Current and Future Implementation</h1>

      <p class="normal">We have just completed the first phase of the project, which 

        was to build this site detailing the history of multimedia. But we are 

        still only scratching the surface of how a repository of information can 

        serve as the foundation for a variety of educational applications. </p>

      <p class="normal">One of these applications is distance learning. Currently, 

        I teach the history, theory and practice of multimedia at the Maryland 

        Institute, College of Art in Baltimore, Maryland. I am currently using 

        the site as a repository for my courses, linking to specific topics according 

        to my syllabus. In fact, I am using an on-line syllabus that allows me 

        to link directly into the site for the purpose of giving classroom presentations, 

        particularly since the site itself was specifically designed with this 

        in mind. Furthermore, students are able to use the syllabus and its links 

        into the site for their own research and study. </p>

      <p class="normal">Since this is such a new area, there are relatively few 

        texts available on the subject, and unfortunately, they become too quickly 

        outdated. With &#34;Multimedia: From Wagner to Virtual Reality,&#34; the extensibility 

        and changeability of the site affords the unique opportunity to maintain 

        it as a dynamic, living document on the history of art and technology, 

        keeping it relevant and useful as a resource for academics working on 

        the leading edge of the field.</p>

      <p class="normal">Additional educational components for the site are planned 

        to provide teachers, with templates for organizing their own syllabi, 

        as many them are creating new curricula, programs and departments around 

        the burgeoning new field of the interactive media arts. These templates 

        will provide professors with effective educational materials that will 

        serve as essential tools for their teaching. </p>

      <p class="normal">Additionally, we are exploring opportunities for distance 

        learning through the creation of a prototypical on-line course on the 

        history of art and technology to maximize the educational and exhibition 

        resources of Artmuseum.net.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p class="normal">In the spirit of Vannevar Bush&#39;s dream of the &#34;cultural 

        record,&#34; our efforts attempt to achieve these results through the creation 

        of specific educational resources that make available to the public a 

        vast repository of materials and resources that can be used freely and 

        openly by scholars, artists, scientists, and general audiences exploring 

        the genesis of multimedia. It may appear an idealistic notion, but it 

        is in fact the world that Bush envisioned. Tim Berners-Lee, who invented 

        the Web, intended that it be used without commercial or government restriction. 

        While he is still fighting that battle, his dream, as inspired by his 

        predecessors, has made it possible for such projects as ours to heighten 

        the collective knowledge of audiences all over the world by expanding 

        on the &#39;cultural record.&#39; </p>
