        for Connections</h1>

      <h2 class="Author">Trudy Lane, Walker Art Center, USA</h2>

      <h1 class="AbstractTitle">ABSTRACT</h1>

      <span class="AbstractText">In following a thread of projects, this talk 

      investigates the Walker Art Center&#39;s work with environments of creation, 

      play, surprise and discovery. </span><span class="AbstractText">From early 

      work in creating online activities for <i>ArtsConnectEd</i> (<a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/" target="new">http://www.artsconnected.org/</a>),

      to a more recent exploration of the online medium&#39;s ability to convey artistic

      the work created at the Walker Art Center, is the online work of various 

      artists. As solutions are sought to the various problems of presenting conceptual 

      relationships online, how does it effect things to have artists running 

      around nearby, working in the same medium that you are, making archives 

      with attitude, para-site systems that question and track visitors, conceptual 

      portals that direct you places you didn&#39;t expect, and asking your opinion 

      of such statements as &#34;the curator as conceptual artist, the exhibition 

      as performance, the museum as web design, the web as readymade.&#34; Through 

      the lens of the ideas of experiential learning, we can see connections and 

      interplay between art, interface and the creation of learning environments.</span> 

      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

      <p class="normal">Through the recent creation of <i>SonicFlux</i> (<a href="http://www.walkerart.org/pa/sonicflux/" target="new">http://www.walkerart.org/pa/sonicflux/</a> 

        <a name="_Hlt504496211"></a> ), a series of online interactives that explore the 

        ideas of an artist or composer, an interest developed in the ideas of 

        Experiential Learning. In looking back over the last three years of work 

        created at the Walker, a progression can be seen in the development of 

        small sets of highly engaging and interactive content explaining and/or 

        exploring a concept or idea.</p>

      <p class="normal">While an effective and engaging learning method, the production 

        of such content can be very intense in time and resources, and so could 

        not be created for, nor would it fit, all content areas. Many museums 

        are not in a position to be creating encyclopedic content around their 

        collections, presentations and exhibitions. Much online content created 

        by museums is often re-purposed from exhibition labels, calendar copy 

        and images, program notes and so on. This is due to limits in (often curatorial) 

        people-time and resources for the creation of new content. Many museums 

        however, have created or are creating databases of their collections, 

        archives, and resources such as the above-mentioned re-purposed texts, 

        to provide them online. For the Walker Art Center (and our partner The 

        Minneapolis Institute of Arts), this database is given it&#39;s most visible 

        form in the educational site aimed primarily at K-12 teachers, <i>ArtsConnectEd</i> 

        (<a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/" target="new">http://www.artsconnected.org/.</a>)</p>

      <p class="normal">A new and separate online manifestation of that database, 

        <i>Collections and Resources,</i> is a project being developed which focuses 

        on the Walker&#39;s areas of content-expertise and seeks to set in motion 

        a long-term plan of effective digitization and engaging delivery of our 

        archival and other materials. A question I raise in developing an online 

        resource such as this, is how can these large, databased and template-driven 

        environments be created in such a way that the often disparate elements 

        might be presented in an engaging, and even intimate way? Are there aspects 

        of the smaller, interactive projects that might be possible, or at least 

        helpful to consider?</p>

      <h1>I. Searching for Solutions</h1>

      <p class="normal">In addition to Experiential Learning Theory, one other tool 

        to help think through this difficulty might be the education psychology 

        theory of Constructivism. A currently prevalent idea in education based 

        on the accumulation of knowledge through self-discovery, there seems to 

        be a significant sympatico between it&#39;s ideas, the Net as a medium, and 

        many of the goals of presentation for a cultural organization in a postmodern 

        age.</p>

      <h2><span> </span>Micro / Macro</h2>

      <p class="normal">As Experiential Learning Theory (ELT) deals most directly 

        with the experience, and Constructivism can be construed as the accumulation 

        of experiences, I am to some extent working with these ideas in a sort 

        of micro/macro fashion. The micro of the project level with it&#39;s singular 

        interactions/experiences as are contained within SonicFlux, and the macro 

        or meta-project of something like <i>Collections and Resources</i> (C+R). 

        It is hoped that the analysis of these ideas might be useful in creating 

        and evaluating the design for these spaces.</p>

      <h3><b>Input from Artists and Creative Practitioners</b></h3>

      <p class="normal">Another lens with which to view the creation of our various 

        resources, large and small, is the now large and varied resource of work 

        created by artists/creative-practitioners working in the online medium. 

        Much work has been done that explores many different kinds of collaborative 

        and co-creative spaces, social spaces, the visualization of conceptual 

        matter and many other ideas important to both ELT and Constructivism. 

      </p>

      <p class="normal">In this paper I endeavor to give a brief but useful outline 

        of both Constructivism and Experiential Learning Theory, with additional 

        notes added on relevant examples by artists or others. Followed by a breakdown 

        of the thread of projects created at the Walker, and intended goals and 

        issues remaining to be resolved for <i>Collections and Resources</i>. 

        Also included is a listing of relevant interesting artworks online.</p>

      <h1>II.CONSTRUCTIVIST AND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING THEORY</h1>

      <h2>Taking pointers from two Learning Theories</h2>

      <h3>Constructivism</h3>

      <p class="normal">Constructivism is typically presented in opposition to &#34;transmission&#34; 

        models of learning such as the stimulus-response mechanisms of Behavioralism. 

        Constructivist learning is viewed as the active construction of knowledge 

        by the learner, rather than the transmission of information from teacher 

        (or parent or museum exhibit) to the learner. </p>

      <p class="normal">This however is not a literal building of blocks, as the 

        founding figure of Constructivism, Jean Piaget, began his career as a 

        biologist, and his subsequent work was deeply influenced by biological 

        ideas and biological ways of thinking. The Piagetian dynamic between assimilation 

        and accommodation was clearly inspired by his observations of biological 

        phenomena. Piaget viewed learning not as a mechanical construction but 

        as a complex, dynamic interplay in which the mind refashions certain ideas 

        to fit into its existing models and structures -- and sometimes refashions 

        its models and structures to better accommodate new ideas.</p>

      <p class="normal">Constructivist learning is concerned with how the learner 

        is being provided with the means to self-construct and discover for themselves. 

        It is believed that &#34;learners construct their own reality or at least 

        interpret it based upon their perceptions of experiences, so an individual&#39;s 

        knowledge is a function of one&#39;s prior experiences, mental structures, 

        and beliefs that are used to interpret objects and events.&#34; &#34;What 

        someone knows is grounded in perception of the physical and social experiences 

        which are comprehended by the mind.&#34; (1). </p>

      <p class="normal">There are obvious parallels here to the common philosophy 

        of museums, especially con<span class="Normal">temporary art institutions, 

        as to the multi-interpretation of art-objects and ideas. </span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">Going further into this idea gets us 

        into interesting epistemologic territory, for if each person has their 

        own view about reality, then how can we as a society communicate and/or 

        coexist? Jonassen, addressing this issue in his article <i>Thinking Technology: 

        Toward a Constructivist Design Model </i>(9), makes the following comments:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">&#34;Perhaps the most common 

          misconception of constructivism is the inference that we each therefore 

          construct a unique reality, that reality is only in the mind of the 

          knower, which will doubtlessly lead to intellectual anarchy.&#34;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">&#34;A reasonable response to 

          that criticism is the Gibsonian perspective that contends that there 

          exists a physical world that is subject to physical laws that we all 

          know in pretty much the same way because those physical laws are perceivable 

          by humans in pretty much the same way.&#34;</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">&#34;Constructivists also believe 

          that much of reality is shared through a process of social negotiation...&#34; 

          </span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">This social negotiation is mediated 

        in it&#39;s online guise, through the use of mechanisms such as message boards, 

        chat rooms and other communication forums. The encouragement of this kind 

        of social communication and resolution can be seen as an important goal 

        for a cultural online resource.</span></p>

      <h3>Cognitive Constructivism </h3>

      <p class="normal">In Cognitive Constructivism we become the facilitators of 

        learning. Piaget (3) posits that humans cannot be &#34;given&#34; information 

        which they immediately understand and use. They instead &#34;construct&#34; their 

        own knowledge. They build their knowledge through experience. Experiences 

        enable them to create schemas -- mental models in their heads. Teachers 

        are required to provide a rich environment for the spontaneous exploration 

        of the child.</p>

      <p class="normal"><i>Learning is an active process:</i> Direct experience, 

        making errors, and looking for solutions are vital for the assimilation 

        and accommodation of information. How information is presented is important. 

        When information is introduced as an aid to problem solving, it functions 

        as a tool rather than an isolated arbitrary fact. </p>

      <p class="normal"><i>Learning should be whole, authentic, and &#34;real&#34;:</i> 

        Piaget helps us to understand that meaning is constructed as children 

        interact in meaningful ways with the world around them. Thus, That means 

        less emphasis on isolated &#34;skill&#34; exercises that try to teach 

        something like long division or end of sentence punctuation. Students 

        still learn these things in Piagetian classrooms, but they are more likely 

        to learn them if they are engaged in meaningful activities (such as operating 

        a class &#34;store&#34; or &#34;bank&#34; or writing and editing a 

        class newspaper). Whole activities, as opposed to isolated skill exercises, 

        authentic activities which are inherently interesting and meaningful to 

        the student, and real activities that result in something other than a 

        grade on a test or a &#34;Great, you did well&#34; from the computer 

        lesson software, are emphasized in Piagetian classrooms.</p>

      <p class="normal">In a Piagetian classroom, students must be given opportunities 

        to construct knowledge through their own experiences. They cannot be &#34;told&#34; 

        by the teacher. There is less emphasis on directly teaching specific skills 

        and more emphasis on learning in a meaningful context. Technology, particularly 

        multimedia, offers a vast array of such opportunities. With technology 

        support such as videodisks and CD-ROMs, teachers can provide a learning 

        environment that helps expand the conceptual and experiential background 

        of the reader. Although much of the educational software created in the 

        1970s and 1980s was based on behavioral principles, much of the new multimedia 

        educational software is based on constructivist theories. Technology provides 

        essential tools with which to accomplish the goals of a constructivist 

        classroom. </p>

      <h3>Constructivism and Computers </h3>

      <p class="normal">With personal computer technology came the popularity of 

        constructivist approaches to educational technology, where open-ended 

        environments provided individual students with tools to experiment and 

        build their own learning constructs. In the last few years, as the internet 

        and World Wide Web have matured; the social aspects of learning as described 

        by Vygotsky (10) have become useful for those looking to design educational 

        projects involving a distributed but intercommunicating audience. Indeed, 

        close analogies came to be made between the learning mind and the computer:</p>

      <h3>Constructivism and the Network</h3>

      <p class="normal">The World-Wide Web is a meta-medium which combines aspects 

        of many other media, such as television, radio and print. Text, image, 

        sound, voice, video, illustration, and animation are all commonly used. 

        A 1999 Museums on the Web paper by Slavko Milekic and others define some 

        of the unique aspects of the online medium (12). These are adapted and 

        re-summarized here as the fol<span class="Normal">lowing:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>Easy access </b>-- relatively 

          easy-to-use and accessible</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>Easy copying, reproduction, 

          modification -- </b>allows for the manipulation/recombination of materials</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>Easy searching, classification, 

          reclassification </b>-- allows for multiple access-points into information</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>Anonymity and Aliases</b> -- 

          results in more freely expressed opinions and ideas</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>Intimacy</b> -- encourages 

          the establishment of relationships with a work of art or concept</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>New social/collaborative space</b> 

          -- ability to participate and become involved</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>History log</b> -- the ability 

          to trace and re-construct a person&#39;s reactions/experiences</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"><b>Cumulative knowledge accrual</b> 

          -- logs that can later be searched and classified</span></li>

        <li><span class="Normal"><b>Endless storage capabilities</b> -- extendable 

          media and the global network </span> </li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Virtual Learning Environments (VLE&#39;s)</h3>

      <p class="normal">Because of these multiple aspects to the medium, there has 

        been an increasing amount of development in networked computer-based learning. 

        The environment may utilize various technologies and communication protocols 

        and has come to replace previous distance-learning media. There are several 

        commercial software available for the both the creation and use of such 

        learning spaces. Among these are TopClass, LearningSpace and Web Course 

        in a Box. Below is an overview of the elements that have come to be expected 

        from a VLE :<b> </b>Noticeboards, Course Outline/Schedule, E-mail, Conferencing 

        Tools, Class Lists &amp; Student Homepages, Metadata/Categorization of 

        objects, Assignments, Assessments, Synchronous Collaboration Tools, Multimedia 

        resources, File Upload Area, Calendar, Search Tools, Bookmarking, Integrated 

        Navigation Model</p>

      <p class="normal">As institutions seek ways to use technology to make teaching 

        more effective both off and on-campus, there are a number of alternate 

        systems currently under-development such as CoMentor, Learning Landscapes, 

        and CoSE.</p>

      <h3>Constructivist Learning Environments (CLE&#39;s)</h3>

      <p class="normal">Investigating the creation of these environments as is specific 

        to<span class="Normal"> constructivist thinking, Jonassen (1) proposes 

        that there are eight characteristics that differentiate constructivist

      <h2>Interesting Examples of Constructivist Learning Tools</h2>

      <h3>SimCity (<a href="http://www.simcity.com/" target="new">http://www.simcity.com/</a>)</h3>

      <p class="normal">SimCity provides a thoroughly implemented example of the 

        use of simulation as both a game and as education. A city simulator -- 

        SimCity a dynamic model of urban life, complete with simulated citizens 

        (Sims), traffic, commerce, industry, utilities, taxes, and other important 

        aspects of city life. It is created for both children and adults to use. 

        Text from SimCity&#39;s Teacher&#39;s <span class="Normal">Guide (13) clearly

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Using a computer simulation like 

          SimCity 3000 is more than a single learning experience; it is an introduction

      <h3>LEGO/Logo and StarLogo by Mitchell Resnick (14)</h3>

      <p class="normal">Mitchell Resnick&#39;s recent work has examined the types of 

        learning experiences made possible by new computational tools. Two tools 

        that the author helped develop are LEGO/Logo and StarLogo. LEGO/Logo is 

        a type of creature construction kit. With LEGO/Logo, children can build 

        robotic &#34;creatures&#34; out of LEGO pieces, using not only the LEGO 

        building bricks but also newer LEGO pieces like gears, motors, and sensors. 

        Then, they write computer programs to control the behaviors of the creatures. 

        StarLogo is a massively-parallel programming language, designed especially 

        for nonexpert programmers. With StarLogo, people can write rules for creature-environment 

        interactions.</p>

      <h2>B. EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING THEORY</h2>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><i><span class="BlockQuote">&#34;Learning is the process whereby knowledge 

          is created through the transformation of experience&#34;</span></i><span class="BlockQuote"> 

          (7)</span></p>

        <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">-- David A. Kolb</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p class="normal">In the early 1980&#39;s, Mezirow, Freire and others stressed 

        that the heart of all learning lies in the way we process experience, 

        in particular, our critical reflection of experience. They spoke of learning 

        as a cycle that begins with experience, continues with reflection and 

        later leads to action, which itself becomes a concrete experience for 

        reflection. Kolb (7) further refined the concept of reflection by dividing 

        it into two separate learning activities, perceiving and processing. He 

        thus added another stage, called &#34;Abstract Conceptualization.&#34; 

        Whereas in the Critical Reflection stage we ask questions about the experience 

        in terms of previous experiences, in the Abstract Conceptualization stage, 

        we try to find the answers. We make generalizations, draw conclusions 

        and form hypotheses about the experience. The Action phase, in light of 

        his interpretation, then becomes a phase of Active Experimentation, where 

        we try the hypotheses out. As Kolb says:</p>

      <h3>Abstract Conceptualization</h3>

      <p class="normal">&#34;In this stage, learning involves using logic and ideas, 

        rather than feelings to understand problems or situations. Typically, 

        you would rely on systematic planning and develop theories and ideas to 

        solve problems.&#34;</p>

      <h3>Active Experimentation</h3>

      <p class="normal">&#34;Learning in this stage takes an active form - experimenting 

        with, influencing or changing situations. You would take a practical approach 

        and be concerned with what really works...&#34; (7)</p>

      <p class="normal">Where there is dialectic tension and conflict between immediate, 

        concrete experience (i.e., reality) and analytic detachment (i.e., abstraction) 

        constitutes the first dimension called <i>prehension</i>. In fact, contributions 

        from psychoanalysis provide evidence that the left hemisphere of the human 

        brain is concerned with abstract symbolic representation while the right 

        hemisphere is isomorphic with reality. The second dimension involves the 

        actions of the learner which transforms experience into knowledge and 

        ranges from a totally physically active to a totally passive (i.e., reflective) 

        state and constitutes the<i> transformation</i> dimension. </p>

      <p class="normal">The prehension dimension ranges from <i>concrete experience</i> 

        to <i>abstract conceptualization</i> whereas the transformation dimension 

        ranges from <i>active experimentation</i> to <i>reflective observation</i>. 

        The polarity between concrete experience and abstract conceptualization 

        explains why some learners, young and adult, sometimes favor learning 

        methods which combine work and study, theory and practice resulting in 

        a more familiar and therefore more productive arena for learning.</p>

      <p class="normal">The ideas for experiential learning and a systematic breakdown 

        of the elements to consider in the development of digital learning environments 

        are well summarized in Juan R. Pimentel&#39;s paper<b><i>, </i></b><i>Design 

        of Net-learning Systems Based on Experiential Learning</i> (2). This information 

        is below edited, adapted and summarized for the main applicable points.</p>

      <h3>The Environment</h3>

      <p class="normal">One of the most fundamental requirements that facilitates 

        learning is an appropriate <i>environment</i> where learners can have 

        <i>experiences.</i> Within Experiential Learning there are described four 

        learning environments which support four different learning modes. These 

        environments are named <i>affectively complex, perceptually complex, symbolically 

        complex</i> and <i>behaviorally complex</i>. Environments which are primarily 

        affectively and perceptually complex are believed to be the most suitable 

        for the teaching of humanities, and are summarized as following: </p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p class="BlockQuote">An <i>affectively complex</i> learning environment 

          emphasizes experiencing what it is like to be a professional in the 

          field of study. Learners are engaged in activities that simulate or 

          mirror what they would do as graduates, or they are encouraged to reflect 

          upon an experience to generate these insights and feelings about themselves. 

          The information discussed and generated is more often current and immediate. 

          It often comes from expressions of feelings, values, and opinions by 

          the learner in discussions with peers or the teacher.</p>

        <p class="BlockQuote"><i>Perceptually complex</i> -- primary goal is to 

          understand something: to be able to identify relationships between concepts, 

          to be able to define problems for investigation, to be able to collect 

          relevant information, to be able to research a question and simlar activities. 

          View the topic from different perspectives. (themselves, experts, literature) 

          and in different ways (listen, observe, write, discuss, act out, think, 

          touch and smell.) ... (2)</p>

      <h3>The Experience </h3>

      <h4>A breakdown</h4>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">The specifics elements of a learning 

        experience are theorized by Fritz, et al. to be the following:</span></p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">A <b>sensation</b>, <i>n</i>, 

          is the way a learner perceives the virtual environment (i.e., through 

          text, image, animation, simulation and visualization).</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">A <b>situation</b>, <i>s</i>, 

          is a special condition on the numerical values of a sensation. For example, 

          a particular situation could be an audio explanation of a particular 

          homework problem or assignment.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">An <b>action</b>, <i>c</i>, executed 

          by a learner is any activity that transforms the current situation or 

          state into the next situation or state. Actions are performed by the 

          learner on the environment thus changing the situation or state.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">The <b>state</b>, <i>z</i>, of 

          the learner is the information necessary to uniquely characterize the 

          learner&#39;s progress relative to the execution of a mission.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">The <b>pleasure level</b>, <i>u</i>, 

          is the measurement of the pleasure as a result of executing one action 

          or a history of actions.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">The <b>performance level</b>, 

          <i>P</i>, of a learner while performing a mission is a set of measures 

          indicating how well the learner is achieving its mission.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">A single <b>experience</b>, <i>x</i>, 

          is a tuple of five elements: current situation, action, pleasure level, 

          performance level and next situation.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">A single <b>lesson</b>, <i>L</i>, 

          is an abstraction of a set of experiences as it relates to the execution 

          of the mission. A lesson involves learning through experiences. The 

          abstraction could be achieved through <i>generalization </i>or <i>specialization.</i> 

          For example, as a result of the abstraction, a lesson can be represented 

          as a tuple of four elements: action, pleasure level, performance level 

          and task.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">A <b>mission</b>, <b>task</b>, 

          or <b>subtask</b> is to learn a subject, be trained in a specific function 

          or develop competency in a specific endeavor. (8)</span></li>

      <h3>Perceiving the Environment </h3>

      <p class="normal">Immediacy in relevance is particularly critical in adult 

        education. Adults are continually bombarded by new information and are 

        quick to discard anything that may appear to be irrelevant. Therefore, 

        including experiential learning as part of class room or Learning Environment 

        provides the learner an opportunity to draw the connection between new 

        information and the real world.</p>

      <p class="normal">The importance of quick perception is so that the learner/visitor 

        be able to assess the scenario they find themselves in and so decide how 

        to react. It helps for the user to have a clear idea their current &#34;state&#34; 

        - whether it is so literally an assessment of their course-completion 

        or just evidence of their progress within the environment. The ease with 

        which they have a clear idea of where in the system they are, how they 

        are faring, and their impact would seem t<span class="Normal">o complete 

        the circle of optimal learning as summarized by Pimentel:</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">To optimize learning, learners must 

        perform the following activities:</span></p>

      <p class="normal">

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">

      <h2>Interesting Examples and Possibilities</h2>

      <h3>Data Visualization and Navigable Space</h3>

      <p class="normal">The outcomes of these ideas and thinking similar to the 

        above may account for the increasing interest in the use of data visualization 

        as navigable space. In his paper <i>Navigable Space </i>(11), artist and 

        media theorist Lev Manovich analyses the significance, appropriateness 

        and cultural context of the creation of navigable space. Lev argues navigable 

        space to be a key and unique aspect of computer-based media that is currently 

        under-examined and gives an overview of it&#39;s wide-ranging uses, including 

        data visualization. </p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p class="BlockQuote">Since navigable space can be used to represent both 

          physical spaces and abstract information spaces, it is only logical 

          that it also emerged as an important paradigm in human-computer interfaces. 

          Indeed, on one level HCI can be seen as a particular case of data visualization, 

          the data being computer files rather than molecules, architectural models 

          or stock market figures. The examples of 3-D navigable space interfaces 

          are the Information Visualizer (Xerox Parc) which replaces a flat desktop 

          with 3-D rooms and planes rendered in perspective;<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup> 

          </sup></span>T_Vision (ART+COM) which uses a navigable 3-D representation 

          of the earth as its interface; and The Information Landscape (Silicon 

          Graphics) in which the user flies over a plane populated by data objects.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p class="normal">Due to the increasing use of databases and the interest 

        in having a site that seems &#34;alive&#34; or at least lively, web-site information 

        spaces are often continually changing and growing. This has lead to a 

        growing field of investigating dynamic data visualization.<b> </b>In Martin 

        Wattenberg&#39;s and SmartMoney&#39;s <i>Map of the Market</i> (<a href="http://acg.media.mit.edu/people/fry/thesis/" target="new">http://www.smartmoney.com/</a> 

        <a name="_Hlt504523618"></a><a name="_Hlt504523607"></a><a name="_Hlt504523667"></a> 

        ) a graphic interface takes direct feed from the stock market to create 

        an instant indicator of a stock&#39;s current trend. Benjamin Fry investigates 

        this and other dynamically driven visualization tools in his thesis paper 

        <i>Organic Information Design</i> (6). <i>Anemone</i>, an example of his 

        own work in dynamic data visualization, transforms current web-traffic 

        data into an organic ever-evolving form.</p>

      <p class="normal">As our vision is one of our most immediate and efficient 

        means of perceiving, and information spaces are growing increasingly complex, 

        there are many possible benefits of using such technology to cre<span class="Normal">ate 

        online spaces which are Benefits as they apply to the fore-going ideas 

        of the experiential learning environment are:</span></p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">What is also significant of Map of 

        the Market though, is it is an interface that gives access many layers 

        of further information. The <i>10_dencies</i> database of Christian Hubler 

        and Alexander Tuchacek and others at Knowbotic Research is a project underdevelopment 

        that should also be interesting to watch to see how it deal with these 

        multiple layers of information beyond the visualization, that needs to 

        be accessed.</span></p>

      <h1>III. A RELEVANT SAMPLING OF WALKER PROJECTS</h1>

      <h2>An overview and analysis of projects, use of resources and media</h2>

      <p class="normal">Below is a listing of projects that may hold interesting 

        models worth investigating for the new C+R system. Of particular note 

        are the programming of events, commissioning of essays, discussion group 

        invites and other such dialog building initatives. The source of content, 

        is noted as a reference to the style of it&#39;s written content. </p>

      <p class="normal">The Online Activities created several years ago for ArtsConnectEd, 

        was the earliest of the sets of small, highly interactive pieces created 

        in a series. The second was the short-lived series of the Interactive 

        Art Activity where an artwork from the permanent collection was taken 

        as a beginning point for the creation of the interactive. And lastly/most 

        recently, that of Sonicflux. A series inspired by the scores of Fluxus, 

        whose potential for online realization were brought forth by an album 

        by the band Sonic Youth. </p>

      <h2>Questioning the commonplace and exploring the extraordinary in cyberspace</h2>

      <p class="normal">As we create in this medium, so along side us are many artists/creators 

        -- often using the very same constructs, yet experimenting, playing, stretching, 

        and in some cases torturing the medium a little further. Their exploration, 

        challenge and critique of this medium and it&#39;s various forms are an informative 

        source of thought for our own work. Much of it is interesting in the context 

        of constructive and experiential learning in it&#39;s exploration of the medium&#39;s 

        communicative and collaborative potential. There is also much use of play, 

        surprise and discovery. Also important is the critique and challenge of 

        the online medium&#39;s so newly but already highly established forms. </p>

      <p class="normal">Much dialogue and support of this work has been created 

        through the Walker&#39;s online exhibition space, Gallery 9. Outlined below

      <h1>V. PROBLEMS AND UNANSWERED QUESTIONS</h1>

      <h2>Build it and they will come?</h2>

      <p class="normal">It all seems like a great idea, collaboration, discussion, 

        live forums, the social negotiation of ideas. But what happens if they 

        don&#39;t come? There are many technically well-executed message boards and 

        chat area and even make your own exhibit areas of sites out there that 

        are going unused. What can be done to ensure it is an environment to which 

        people will return? Is it regular scheduled events such as online discussions? 

        The co-ordination of online exhibitions and the discussions surrounding 

        that (as in Shock of the View, see URL above) exhibition? How can the 

        variety in the audience be accounted for so that they will find their 

        niche somewhere in the space (kids and art professionals alike)? </p>

      <h2>Categorical Decisions</h2>

      <p class="normal">As we continue to create sites that stay &#34;open&#34; after the 

        show has long closed, there will only be an ever-increasing need for storage 

        and classification of content produced. The only alternative being the 

        adoption of an institutional policy to either throw away or archive older 

        projects. This may become much more necessary as the technologies continue 

        to develop, and older forms are no longer supported.</p>

      <h2>The System within the Building</h2>

      <p class="normal">Much of the user&#39;s experience is determined by the &#34;situations&#34; 

        or media elements that they are presented with. In an automated system 

        data delivery system of so many different media types of different lengths 

        and descriptions, a pre-database system of content selection needs to 

        be defined and implemented with the staff that it involves. This would 

        be for the intention of providing the immediacy and relevance needed for 

        an adult learner -- and would ensure for example, that when following 

        a line of enquiry to Pauline Oliveros, they would be presented with a 

        short, great video clip, if we have one, a quote and/or sound sample of 

        her work. This sort of work to give an initial impression of her work 

        and inspire the visitor to seek further. Details of this system will need 

        to be defined per media and per staff situation, especially as to how 

        to implement this selection loop in a curatorially sensitive and efficient 

        way. Examples of this might be to involve the curator in selecting samples 

        to draw out from the archives around the time of an exhibition on a particular 

        person or movement -- while the archival and other possible resources 

        to draw from are fresh in their mind. This in-building system would also 

        need to apply to the digitizing of ongoing events such as lectures and 

        performances. The difficulty in creating these systems is the multitude 

        of situations and creating the least extra work for people, for the best 

        results. </p>

      <h2>Time commitment</h2>

      <p class="normal">Because of the size of many collections, these systems will 

        need to be in place for significant periods of time for the casual online 

        visitor to see any significant increase in meaningfully selected content. 

        Due to time and people resource constraints, to implement a long-term 

        solution seem in the long-run, the best. Careful work has to be done however, 

        to ensure that the requirements set on others are as easy and wherever 

        possible fit in with their existing workload, in order for the scheme 

        to survive.</p>

      <h1>VI. CONCLUSION</h1>

      <p class="normal">The Internet is a powerful constructivist environment for 

        learning. It is an organic system which grows and responds to human participation. 

        It allows for generative learning where participants, through interaction, 

        can add value to the resources they exploit. </p>

      <p class="normal">Many sizeable museums may come to have large databases of 

        disparate elements. Without some means or strategy of making meaning between 

        them that tackles any staffing or other resource difficulties, their value 

        will be greatly lost to all but the experienced researcher. Conscious, 

        possibly curated strategies for digitizing assets and the creation of 

        programming of events or other meaning-generating focuses within the environment 

        may help to create those connections. The ideas of Constructivism and 

        Experiential Learning may serve us well as we endeavor to create these 

        environments, though adapted for the adult life-long learner, not a school 

        curriculum. Ideas of dynamic data visualization and other means of rendering 

        comprehensible large, evolving data sets, might be one of the most efficient 

        ways of creating context for the user in what is at the same time a navigable 

        space.</p>

      <p class="normal">If we are to treat constructivism as an organically evolving 

        and emerging learning theory, as Mitchell Resnick believes Piaget intended, 

        then there seems to be a beautiful correlation possible between the combination 

        of these ideas with organic-dynamic information design, multiple viewpoints 

        in accessing the information, where visitors&#39; creation of small collections 

        or other participatory actions would add to and alter the information 

        space. Mitchell Resnick talks below of this possible symbiosis and his 

        experiences of constructive learning in the classroom:</p>

      <p class="normal">We believe that these biologically-inspired concepts and 

        metaphors could be particularly useful in the study of learning and education. 

        In particular, the idea of &#34;emergence&#34; can provide a valuable 

        new framework for thinking about the nature of human learning, the design 

        of learning environments, and even the process of reform in the educational 

        system.</p>

      <p class="normal">The idea of emergence can also be useful in thinking about 

        the design of learning environments. When we set up The Computer Clubhouse, 

        an after-school learning center for inner-city youth, we wanted to encourage 

        collaborative activities. But we did not want to assign youth to teams, 

        as is often done in classroom-based collaborative activities. Rather, 

        we wanted collaborative groups to emerge as a natural part of ongoing 

        activities. Projects at the Clubhouse are not a fixed entity; they grow 

        and evolve over time. An adult mentor might start with one idea, a few 

        youth will join for a while, then a few others will start working on a 

        related project. Design teams form informally, coalescing around common 

        interests. Communities are dynamic and flexible, evolving to meet the 

        needs of the project and the interests of the participants. A large green 

        table in the middle of the Clubhouse acts as a type of village common, 

        where people come together to share ideas, visions, and information (not 

        to mention food). Often, communities will coalesce suddenly, in a type 

        of phase transition, when the ideas and participants cross some type of 

        critical threshold. (15)</p>
