      <p class="PaperTitle">Accessibility Techniques for Museum Web Sites</p>

      <p class="Author">Susan Anable, The Dayton Art Institute and Adam Alonzo, 

        Wright State University, USA</p>

      <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>

      <p class="AbstractText">Like other public institutions, museums strive to 

        make their facilities accessible to people with disabilities, yet these 

        same patrons may be hindered in their use of museum Web sites by electronic 

        accessibility barriers. This presentation will demonstrate that access 

        was a primary design factor in the Virtual Museum Tour, part of the Web 

        site of The Dayton Art Institute. Developed in collaboration with Wright 

        State University, planners of the Virtual Museum Tour faced the challenge 

        of making a variety of Internet technologies accessible to people with 

        visual or hearing impairment or mobility limitations. By adopting a set 

        of Web accessibility guidelines and utilizing them in creative ways, the 

        Virtual Museum Tour provides an enlightening art experience for all visitors.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p class="normal">The Dayton Art Institute has served residents of southwestern 

        Ohio since 1919. The museum operates on the premise that art is for everyone, 

        and provides the community with free general admission 365 days a year. 

        In addition, the Art Institute&#39;s physical facility is free of architectural 

        barriers that might prevent people with disabilities from accessing exhibitions 

        or participating in programs. Rated &#34;superb in quality&#34; by the 

        American Association of Museums, The Dayton Art Institute has one of the 

        finest mid-size museum collections in the country. As the Art Institute 

        began to make this Collection available on the World Wide Web, the same 

        commitment to barrier-free access was demonstrated.</p>

      <p class="normal">The Virtual Museum Tour is an interactive learning environment 

        for Web visitors to explore The Dayton Art Institute (<a href="http://www.daytonartinstitute.org/" target="new">http://www.daytonartinstitute.org/</a>). 

        The Tour came about through a collaboration between the Art Institute 

        and Wright State University (<a href="http://www.wright.edu/" target="new">http://www.wright.edu/</a>), 

        located in Dayton and known for its outstanding support program for students 

        with disabilities. One of the primary goals of this project was to provide 

        Web visitors with an informative and absorbing experience equal to or 

        better than what they might have in the Museum&#39;s actual galleries. This 

        naturally implied the inclusion of visual and auditory technologies to 

        enhance the visitor&#39;s examination of works of art. Yet the Tour also needed 

        to be as accessible as possible for everyone, including people with disabilities, 

        as prescribed by the U. S. Department of Education grant that funded the 

        development of the Tour. Although the idea of accessibility may seem incongruous 

        to a Web site enriched with images and sounds, it is not impossible. Through 

        cooperation and creativity, the project partners were able to achieve 

        both objectives.</p>

      <p class="normal">One important factor that had to be determined early in 

        the project was the definition of accessibility as it pertains to a Web 

        site. There is a great deal of information about the topic available from 

        books, Web sites and conferences, but the recommendations given by these 

        sources do not always concur. Fortunately, a single authoritative source 

        has emerged from the World Wide Web Consortium, the international body 

        that leads the development of the Web. The Web Accessibility Initiative 

        (WAI) within that organization has published a set of fourteen Web Content 

        Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/" target="new">http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/</a>) 

        to help designers create accessible sites. Developed through a process 

        of extensive research and review by a team of experts, the WAI Guidelines 

        were adopted as the accessibility standard for the Virtual Museum Tour 

        project.</p>

      <p class="normal">Because the WAI Guidelines are designed to be universal 

        in scope, they do not specifically address the needs of unique audiences 

        such as museums. As a result, they often require interpretation or simplification 

        in order to be applied. This paper documents how the Guidelines were implemented 

        in practical ways on the Virtual Museum Tour, thereby creating a type 

        of accessibility style guide suitable for other museum Web site designers. 

        Due to the limitations of this paper, only a few of the fourteen Guidelines 

        can be addressed, but more extensive information about accessibility techniques 

        will be available on the Virtual Museum Tour site itself.</p>

      <h1>Accessibility Techniques</h1>

      <p class="normal">Among the fourteen WAI Guidelines, there are a few which 

        have particular relevance to museum Web sites. These are listed in the 

        sections below, along with the techniques used to implement them on the 

        Virtual Museum Tour.</p>

      <h2>Guideline 1. Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual 

        content.</h2>

      <p class="normal">Provide content that, when presented to the user, has conveys 

        essentially the same function or purpose as auditory or visual content.</p>

      <p class="normal">This is perhaps the most basic of the fourteen Guidelines, 

        but it is also the most important. The Web in general, and museum sites 

        in particular, rely heavily upon images to convey information; audio content 

        is also found on many Web sites. But people with visual or hearing impairments 

        may be unable to perceive multimedia features such as images, sounds or 

        video. If a Web page includes equivalent alternatives, however, all Web 

        visitors will be able to experience to some degree the content conveyed 

        by these visual and auditory elements. Equivalent alternatives frequently 

        take the form of text, which is the most broadly accessible type of content 

        available on the Web. It is important to note that Guideline 1 does not 

        prohibit the use of multimedia such as images and sounds, but rather suggests 

        how to convey that content in different ways so all users can understand 

        its meaning.</p>

      <h3>Audio</h3>

      <p class="normal">The Virtual Museum Tour contains a large number of audio 

        clips, spoken by various commentators, containing information about works. 

        In order to implement Guideline 1, each narration is accompanied by a 

        text transcript. All of the recordings were carefully transcribed to ensure 

        that the speaker&#39;s exact words were accurately rendered into text (including 

        sentence fragments and grammatical errors), and to ensure that names, 

        places and terms were spelled correctly.</p>

      <p class="normal">A typical audio segment on the Tour contains the comments 

        of Alexander Lee Nyerges, Director of The Dayton Art Institute, recounting 

        how the Museum acquired the painting <i>Waterlilies</i> by Claude Monet 

        (Fig. 1). The excerpt below shows how the transcript captures the conversational 

        style of the narration, and also demonstrates the need for accuracy in 

        transcribing names and places.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#34;It really isn&#39;t &#39;til you get to Monet&#39;s highest 

        points, his series which include his series of <i>Waterlilies</i>, that 

        we find the fully developed and fully mature essence of what we now regard 

        as classical Impressionism. This was done in his garden in 1903, and probably 

        represents the highest point of his entire <i>Waterlilies</i> series. 

        This work was given to the Art Institute by a gentleman by the name of 

        Mr. Joseph Rubin, who ran a company in New York City called the Loma Dress 

        Corporation. And sometime before 1953, Dr. Esther Seaver, who was the 

        Director of The Dayton Art Institute in the first part of the 1950s, had 

        encountered this picture and was acquainted with a dealer in New York 

        by the name of Silberman . . . &#34;</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="anable.fig1.jpg" width="365" height="292" alt="Fig. 1: Claude Monet (1840-1926) French, WATERLILIES, 1903, Oil on canvas, 32 x 40 inches, Gift of Mr. Joseph Rubin, 1953.11"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Fig. 1: Claude Monet (1840-1926) French, WATERLILIES, 

        1903, Oil on canvas, 32 x 40 inches, Gift of Mr. Joseph Rubin, 1953.11</p>

      <p class="normal">When incorporated within the Virtual Museum Tour, text transcripts 

        are provided alongside the audio clip itself, so Web visitors can choose 

        the format that is appropriate for them. They can select either a link 

        that plays the recording or a link that leads to the transcript on another 

        page. In this manner, the two formats appear truly equivalent, since one 

        is not presented as subordinate to the other.</p>

      <p class="normal">Although not applicable to the Virtual Museum Tour, it may 

        be necessary to expand text transcripts if there is meaning conveyed by 

        more than just the words themselves. For instance, if an audio clip contains 

        music or sound effects, these should be briefly described in the transcript. 

        In addition, if the tone of voice is significant, or the speaker is portraying 

        a particular character, this may also be alluded to in the transcript</p>

      <h3>Images</h3>

      <p class="normal">In addition to audio, Guideline 1 also applies to visual 

        content such as images, certainly the most common medium found on the 

        Web. In the context of a museum Web site, images can be roughly categorized 

        into two types: simple graphics such as logos, and complex pictures of 

        artwork. Depending upon their type, two different approaches may be used 

        to provide equivalent alternatives to images.</p>

      <p class="normal">Simple graphics can be dealt with relatively easily by taking 

        advantage of a feature of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the language 

        that controls the format and function of Web pages. To place an image 

        on a Web page, a designer inserts a particular HTML element into the document; 

        this element is referred to as an &#34;image tag&#34; and appears as 

        a three-letter abbreviation between brackets.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&lt;img&gt;</p>

      <p class="normal">In addition to this term, another statement (called an &#34;attribute&#34;) 

        must be placed inside the brackets. This attribute indicates the filename 

        or &#34;source&#34; of the image; it too is abbreviated.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&lt;img src = &#34;filename&#34;&gt;</p>

      <p class="normal">While no further information is required to produce a visible 

        image on the page, there are several optional attributes that may be used 

        to control properties of the image such as its size and its relation to 

        surrounding screen elements. One such optional attribute can be added 

        to provide a text alternative that briefly describes what the image is. 

        The alternative attribute is also abbreviated, and is used alongside the 

        source attribute within the same image tag.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&lt;img src = &#34;filename&#34; alt = &#34;description&#34;&gt;</p>

      <p class="normal">Text alternatives are not captions that appear alongside 

        the image, and in most cases they will not even be visible on the page. 

        However, there are several ways in which they benefit visitors, particularly 

        those with visual impairments. Web visitors who are blind typically use 

        specialized computer software and hardware that reads pages aloud to them. 

        If a Web page includes text alternatives, they too will be vocalized, 

        informing users about the images found on the page. Without text alternatives, 

        users will not know what the images are or why they are there. Further 

        information on the use of text alternatives is available from the World 

        Wide Web Consortium (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/objects.html#adef-alt" target="new">http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/objects.html#adef-alt</a>).</p>

      <p class="normal">Every image on the Virtual Museum Tour is accompanied by 

        a text alternative that is generally no more than a few words in length. 

        Because of their brevity, text alternatives are not used to describe the 

        appearance of images, but simply to identify what they are. For example, 

        the following line of HTML code could be used to identify the Art Institute&#39;s 

        logo (Fig. 2):</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&lt;img src = &#34;logo.gif&#34; alt = &#34;The Dayton 

        Art Institute logo&#34;&gt;</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="anable.fig2.gif" width="150" height="146" alt="Fig. 2: The Dayton Art Institute logo"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Fig. 2: The Dayton Art Institute logo</p>

      <p class="normal">For simple graphics such as a logo, a brief text alternative 

        may be adequate, but pictures that show works of art require a more detailed 

        visual description. Visual descriptions are short paragraphs that verbally 

        describe the appearance of images for the benefit of Web visitors who 

        are unable to see them. They serve the same role in the visual arts as 

        audio descriptions do for the performing arts, since both provide participants 

        with a verbal impression of things they cannot see. The Virtual Museum 

        Tour provides a visual description for every piece of artwork presented.</p>

      <p class="normal">The WAI Guidelines suggest different techniques for including 

        visual descriptions with complex images (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#long-descriptions" target="new">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#long-descriptions</a>), 

        but there is currently no standard practice in use. The Virtual Museum 

        Tour uses visual descriptions to supplement rather than replace text alternatives: 

        a text alternative gives the title of a work while a visual description 

        tells what it looks like. Links to visual descriptions are prominently 

        placed on a navigation menu alongside links leading to other sources of 

        information about the artwork, thereby presenting them as simply another 

        resource for everyone, not just people with disabilities.</p>

      <p class="normal">Developing quality visual descriptions is a time-consuming 

        task that should be done thoughtfully by individuals with excellent writing 

        and editing skills. No instructions for doing so were available during 

        the creation of the Virtual Museum Tour, but in the course of preparing 

        approximately 100 visual descriptions, a standard process was developed. 

        This process is summarized in the following six Recommendations which 

        can be applied to other Web projects that involve images of artwork. </p>

      <h1>Recommendation One: Be Objective</h1>

      <p class="normal">The sole function of a visual description is to describe 

        the appearance of a work of art. In brief, it should simply answer the 

        question, &#34;What does the object look like?&#34; Descriptions should 

        avoid analytical interpretations or emotional responses. In other words, 

        they should not explore questions like, &#34;What does it mean?&#34; 

        or &#34;How does it make you feel?&#34; Descriptions help visitors to 

        visualize an object, thereby providing a context for other information 

        about the work found elsewhere, such as historical background, the artist&#39;s 

        style, or critical commentary. By combining this factual information with 

        an objective description, Web visitors are sufficiently informed to make 

        a personal analysis or achieve their own emotional response.</p>

      <p class="normal">Objectivity should also be exercised when referring to characters 

        portrayed in a painting or other work of art. Though it is appropriate 

        to describe their appearance, clothing and actions, visual descriptions 

        should not attempt to explain their motivations or feelings, even if these 

        are implied by gestures or context. If the emotions of the characters 

        are obvious in the artwork, then they will likely be apparent in the visual 

        description as well.</p>

      <p class="normal">In this example (Fig. 3), the description was written without 

        references to emotion, although the mood implied by the painting may still 

        be perceived.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#34; . . . The girl&#39;s body is turned partially 

        to her left while her head is turned to look to her right. Her brown hair 

        is parted in the middle and pulled to the back of her head. She has heavy 

        eyebrows, dark eyes and reddish cheeks. Her mouth is small and her red 

        lips are closed. Both arms are extended and her hands rest on her knees 

        with their fingers intertwined . . . &#34;</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption"><img src="anable.fig3.jpg" width="295" height="467" alt="Fig. 3: William Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) French, THE SONG OF THE NIGHTINGALE, 1895, Oil on canvas, 55 x 35 inches, Gift of Mr. Robert Badenhop, 1954.12"/></p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Fig. 3: William Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) French, 

        THE SONG OF THE NIGHTINGALE, 1895, Oil on canvas, 55 x 35 inches, Gift 

        of Mr. Robert Badenhop, 1954.12</p>

      <p class="normal">Finally, because artistic taste varies according to the 

        individual, visual descriptions should not contain value judgements on 

        the quality of the art object, nor on the skill of the artist who created 

        it.</p>

      <h1>Recommendation Two: Be Brief</h1>

      <p class="normal">Although length will vary according to the piece of artwork 

        being described, visual descriptions should be as brief as possible. In 

        some settings, visual descriptions are presented as audio recordings read 

        by a narrator. Other times they are provided as text that visitors have 

        to read by themselves. In either case, since extremely long descriptions 

        are tiresome, they should be limited to 250 to 300 words. Depending on 

        the context, visual descriptions may be accompanied by catalogue data 

        about the artwork (such as the artist&#39;s name and life span, title, medium 

        and dimensions). If so, this information need not be included in the overall 

        word count.</p>

      <p class="normal">For better word economy, exclude redundant phrases like 

        &#34;rectangular in shape&#34; or &#34;blue in color.&#34; Simply 

        use &#34;rectangular&#34; or &#34;blue&#34; instead. Likewise, avoid 

        obvious statements such as &#34;she wears a necklace around the neck&#34; 

        or &#34;gloves on her hands.&#34;</p>

      <h1>Recommendation Three: Be Descriptive</h1>

      <p class="normal">Visual descriptions should utilize a broad vocabulary of 

        vivid terminology to describe various features of art objects. Some common 

        terms are categorized below.</p>

      <p class="normal">Shapes can be described as square, cubed, rectangular, flat, 

        straight, circular, spherical, cylindrical, curved, rounded, triangular, 

        conical, pyramidal, angular, irregular, jagged, sloped, diagonal, horizontal 

        and vertical. These words can be used not only to identify the overall 

        shape of the object, but also to describe geometric patterns within it. 

        Avoid words that imply action unless the object actually does move; for 

        instance, &#34;curved&#34; is preferable to &#34;curving.&#34; Also, 

        colloquial terms such as &#34;squiggle&#34; or &#34;zigzag&#34; should 

        not be used.</p>

      <p class="normal">Size can be described as small, tiny, short, miniature, 

        large, tall, monumental, thick, thin, narrow, wide, life-size, true to 

        size, large scale and small scale. The object&#39;s dimensions, provided with 

        the catalogue data, will inform visitors of its actual size.</p>

      <p class="normal">Texture can be described as smooth, glossy, coarse, grainy, 

        rough, worn, weathered, scratched, cracked, broken, rippled, grooved, 

        patterned, striped, dotted and perforated.</p>

      <p class="normal">Color can be described as intense, vivid, bright, light, 

        dark, dull, pale, faint, solid or blended. There is no need to avoid references 

        to color on the assumption that they will be meaningless to visitors who 

        are blind. First of all, descriptions will be used by people without visual 

        disabilities. Second, many people who are now blind were able to see in 

        the past and are able to recall colors. Third, colors sometimes have symbolic 

        meaning in works of art (although interpretive phrases like &#34;warm 

        gold&#34; or &#34;angry red&#34; should not be used).</p>

      <p class="normal">Composition (or the arrangement of elements in a work) can 

        be described as low, high, above, below, parallel, perpendicular, in the 

        foreground (or background), and to the left (or right). When referring 

        to relative locations, describe objects from the viewer&#39;s perspective, 

        unless referring to the left or right of a character portrayed in the 

        work.</p>

      <p class="normal">Artistic technique can be described as realistic, abstract, 

        unnatural, simplified, detailed, precise, imprecise, sharply defined, 

        blurred, splashed, brushed or stroked.</p>

      <h1>Recommendation Four: Be Logical</h1>

      <p class="normal">In order to be easily understood, visual descriptions must 

        describe objects according to a logical sequence. Descriptions should 

        begin with a general overview of what the object is and what it portrays. 

        Depending upon what type of object it is, it may be appropriate at the 

        outset to mention its color and surface texture, and perhaps its construction. 

        Following the overview, the various portions of the object should be described 

        in detail, in some orderly fashion such as left to right or top to bottom. 

        After one portion of the work has been described, an explicit transition 

        should be used to identify the next area and its spatial relationship 

        to the last. If part of the object is extremely complex, it is best to 

        describe each segment separately, perhaps in a numbered sequence.</p>

      <p class="normal">In the following example (Fig. 4), the location of objects 

        in a painting are described in relation to other elements, providing the 

        reader with an understanding of the overall composition of the work.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#34; . . . To the left of the barn is an area of crisscrossed 

        black strokes like a shadow. Below the barn is a red and gray machine 

        placed awkwardly on its side. Its large wheels and gears give it the appearance 

        of a piece of farm machinery. To the right of the machine are two brown 

        and angular tree branches that rise upward from the bottom edge of the 

        picture. Between the branches, several small scenes are crudely rendered 

        one above another . . . &#34;</p>

      <p class="MsoCaption">Fig. 4: Stuart Davis (1894-1964) American, LANDSCAPE 

        WITH BROKEN MACHINE, 1935, Gouache on paper, 15 1/4 x 22 1/8 inches, Bequest 

        of Virginia Rike Haswell, 1977.39</p>

      <p class="normal">Depending on their design, sculptures or other three-dimensional 

        works will likely need to be described from more than one angle. A logical 

        sequence should be used when doing so, as if the viewer was moving in 

        a circle around the object.</p>

      <p class="normal">When using descriptive words such as adjectives, it is often 

        best to place them after the word they modify, so visitors know what the 

        object is before they are told what it looks like. For example, use &#34;his 

        fingers are long and thin&#34; instead of &#34;he has long, thin fingers.&#34;</p>

      <h1>Recommendation Five: Be Accurate</h1>

      <p class="normal">Because visual descriptions are part of the overall learning 

        experience of art patrons, they should be factual and consistent with 

        other sources of information about the artwork. Background research may 

        be necessary to correctly identify historical figures, religious personalities, 

        geographical locations, types of clothing, breeds of animals, architectural 

        elements and so on. However, descriptions should avoid jargon or specialized 

        terminology that may be unfamiliar to most visitors. For example, the 

        stylistic terms &#34;abstract&#34; and &#34;realistic&#34; are likely 

        to be understood, but &#34;Geometric Abstractionist&#34; and &#34;French 

        Academic&#34; are not.</p>

      <p class="normal">It is strongly recommended that a describer look at the 

        actual object when making initial notes, because color and small details 

        are most accurately observed in person. When these notes are refined into 

        the actual description, slides or photographs may be used as a reminder 

        of the object&#39;s appearance and composition.</p>

      <h1>Recommendation Six: Miscellaneous</h1>

      <p class="normal">Because visitors on a virtual tour may access works of art 

        in any order, writers of visual descriptions should not assume that readers 

        have followed a particular sequence. References to other artwork should 

        not be made within a visual description, not even to works by the same 

        artist or from the same gallery.</p>

      <p class="normal">For the benefit of Web visitors using screen reading software, 

        numbers should be spelled out as words, as in &#34;nineteenth century&#34; 

        rather than &#34;19th century,&#34; and &#34;two and a half&#34; instead 

        of &#34;2 1/2.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">Descriptions ought not to assign gender to animals, such 

        as &#34;the dog stands on his hind legs.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">When describing the clothing of characters in a work, monotony 

        can be minimized by using varied phrases like &#34;dressed in,&#34; 

        &#34;is wearing&#34; and &#34;has on.&#34;</p>

      <p class="normal">Once visual descriptions have been written and edited, several 

        reviewers (including people with visual disabilities) should provide suggestions 

        for improvement. As a final check, descriptions should be compared, by 

        a team member, in person, to the actual works of art in the galleries.</p>

      <h3>Video</h3>

      <p class="normal">Although the Virtual Museum Tour currently does not contain 

        video clips, the principle of equivalent alternatives also applies to 

        video. In general, it is necessary to provide synchronized captions for 

        all spoken words, as well as descriptions for sound effects, music and 

        visuals. Further details and examples are available at the National Center 

        for Accessible Media (<a href="http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/ncam/richmedia/index.html">http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/ncam/richmedia/index.html</a>).</p>

      <h2>Guideline 4. Clarify natural language usage</h2>

      <p class="normal">Use markup that facilitates pronunciation or interpretation 

        of abbreviated or foreign text.</p>

      <p class="normal">The purpose of this guideline is to make it easier for people 

        using adaptive computer equipment to understand the content of Web documents, 

        particularly those that contain periodic language changes. For example, 

        a Web visitor who is blind will probably utilize a certain type of adaptive 

        software called a screen reader to vocalize the words on a page. By identifying 

        the language of the text, the screen reader may be able to respond with 

        the proper pronunciation and accent. This technique can also benefit people 

        who read Web pages with the aid of a Braille device, since words or characters 

        may be displayed differently depending upon the language in use.</p>

      <p class="normal">For a museum Web site this Guideline is crucial due to the 

        frequent use of terminology from a variety of languages. As the Virtual 

        Museum Tour was being developed, a large number of new documents were 

        written, and existing documents were adapted for the site. In both cases, 

        these catalogue entries and commentaries were closely checked, and variations 

        in language were noted. This process was also applied to all visual descriptions 

        and text transcripts of audio segments, which are accommodations themselves.</p>

      <p class="normal">In order to implement Guideline 4, the primary language 

        of a document must first be identified,; then any subsequent changes in 

        language must be indicated. The initial step is accomplished by adding 

        the language attribute to the opening HTML tag found at the top of the 

        document. Instead of using the full name of a language (such as English), 

        a two-letter abbreviation is used.</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&lt;html lang = &#34;en&#34;&gt;</p>

      <p class="normal">A lengthy list of these two-letter language codes is available 

        from the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards 

        (<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/iso639a.html" target="new">http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/iso639a.html</a>).</p>

      <p class="normal">Once the primary language of a document is identified, changes 

        in language that occur within the text also need to be declared. This 

        can be done by using a pair of span container tags with the language attribute. 

        The opening span tag marks the beginning of a new language segment while 

        the closing tag indicates the end. After the closing span tag, the document 

        reverts to the primary language previously declared. The following example 

        is an excerpt from commentary written by Clarence W. Kelley about a pair 

        of Japanese screen paintings (Fig. 5).</p>

      <p class="BlockQuote">&#34; . . . By the end of the 17th century, a distinctive 

        association had developed between classical literature and a type of screen 

        painting known as &lt;span lang = &#34;ja&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;byobu-uta&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 

        (poems for screens), as seen in this pair of screen paintings . . . &#34;</p>

        1960.24a-b</p>

      <p class="normal">In addition to language changes, Guideline 4 also applies 

        to the use of abbreviations and acronyms within Web documents. Further 

        details are available from the Web Accessibility Initiative (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#text-abbr" target="new">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#text-abbr</a>).</p>

      <h2>Guideline 8. Ensure direct accessibility of embedded user interfaces.</h2>

      <p class="normal">Ensure that the user interface follows principles of accessible 

        design: device-independent access to functionality, keyboard operability, 

        self-voicing, etc.<i></i></p>

      <p class="normal">This Guideline refers to various Web site features that 

        present users with some sort of onscreen controls besides the typical 

        buttons and menus found in a browser. It is important that these controls 

        be operable through different methods, to accommodate as many people as 

        possible. Computer users with disabilities frequently utilize input devices 

        other than a mouse, since using a mouse requires both sight and manual 

        dexterity. A person who is blind, for instance, might rely upon the keyboard, 

        while someone with a mobility impairment might use a head-mounted pointing 

        device. While Web browsers themselves can be controlled through these 

        methods, additional interfaces may not have the same functionality. A 

        common example found on museum Web sites is an image enlargement system 

        that allows visitors to view works of art in detail. Depending upon the 

        technology, users may be required to click the mouse on the image itself 

        to zoom in. If so, this feature may be difficult for people with certain 

        disabilities to use.</p>

      <p class="normal">In the process of selecting an image enlargement system 

        for the Virtual Museum Tour, keyboard operability was a primary concern. 

        Many popular technologies failed in this respect, but a suitable product 

        was found in the EyeSpy<sup>TM</sup> Image Server from AXS Technologies 

        (<a href="http://www.axs-tech.com/" target="new">http://www.axs-tech.com/</a>). 

        It allows visitors to use a mouse to click on the image, but it also provides 

        a keyboard-accessible interface (Figs. 6 and 7).</p>

      <h1>Conclusions</h1>

      <p class="normal">When considering the topic of Web accessibility, it is beneficial 

        to note how the addition of ramps and automatic doors have made access 

        to museum buildings easier not only for people with disabilities, but 

        also for all visitors. A similar phenomenon is likely to take place as 

        museums improve the accessibility of their Web sites. By observing the 

        WAI Guidelines, designers will make their pages more usable by everyone. 

        For instance, text transcripts and described videos can be used by those 

        who do not have the computer hardware or software to play multimedia, 

        and by people with a slow Internet connection. Likewise, visual descriptions 

        may be appreciated even by people with normal eyesight, since the descriptions 

        point out details that they might not have noticed. By incorporating the 

        WAI Guidelines into their design procedures, museums will take a major 

        step toward accomplishing the goal of making art accessible to everyone.</p>
