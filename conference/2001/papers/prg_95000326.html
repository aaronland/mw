      <p class="PaperTitle">On-line Collections Access at the Museum of English 
        Rural Life</p>
      <p class="AbstractTitle"><span>Jonathan Bowen</span>, South Bank University, 
        Roy Bridgen, Mary Dyson, Kevin Moran, The University of Reading, UK<br/>
        Abstract</p>
      <p class="AbstractText">The Rural History Centre at the University of Reading, 
        which includes the Museum of English Rural Life, holds extensive collections 
        of material relating to the history of food, farming, and the countryside. 
        As a result, it operates as the leading research and resource center for 
        the subject in the country. The collections have been Designated of national 
        importance and are now in receipt of a grant from the UK government-funded 
        Designation Challenge Fund for a project designed to greatly enhance access 
        to the collections via the World Wide Web. The aim is to have a dynamic, 
        database-driven website which will present a thematic route of entry for 
        exploration of the collections. </p>
      <p class="AbstractText">This collections access project aims to make the information 
        available to a variety of users in an appropriate manner. Specifically 
        targeted users are primary school children (and teachers), the general 
        public (including secondary school children) and expert researchers (e.g., 
        from academia). Different interfaces are provided within the website to 
        accommodate these various types of user in the INTERnet Farm And Countryside 
        Explorer (<i><a href="http://www.ruralhistory.org/interface/">INTERFACE</a></i>) 
        section designated as schools, public and advanced users. For example, 
        story-based environments are being included, extracting information from 
        the database. The stories themselves are being generated by hand as static 
        pages based on templates, but the database can be used at any time to 
        include further information on objects or areas of interest. Primary school 
        children can be limited to records that include graphical images, with 
        access via story-based presentations suitable for use as educational resources, 
        with associated teacher support. The public interface provides hierarchical 
        exploration of subject areas. For experts, a more traditional form-based 
        database interface with many fields will provide access to the full database. 
      </p>
      <p class="AbstractText">One of the key considerations in developing on-line 
        content for museums is bringing together collection management systems 
        and exhibition information into one system. The manner in which collections 
        are integrated into websites is likely to have implications for their 
        accessibility. For example, the location of the access to collections 
        within the overall site and the graphic presentation of the interface 
        may influence visitors&#39; search and navigation behavior. This paper includes 
        information on an evaluation approach that was developed as part of the 
        initial stages of the project. The objectives of the initial evaluation 
        were to identify other sites which provide access to a collections database; 
        to observe how functionality has been implemented; to consider which aspects 
        of the interfaces may be adopted or adapted for the project. The outcome 
        of the evaluations is described, identifying strengths and weaknesses 
        of existing sites. As the sample of sites analyzed is small, this data 
        is discussed in relation to potential uses for this methodology. A technical 
        evaluation of the first version of the new website is also included.</p>
      <p class="AbstractText">The last part of the paper gives an overview of what 
        is planned for the last part of the project. Not many museum collections 
        are available on-line in a comprehensive form, especially from smaller 
        museums, so this project aims to be exemplary of what can be achieved 
        given appropriate resources</p>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p class="BlockQuote"><i>&#34;There is no wealth but life.&#34; </i></p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"></p><p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">- John Ruskin (1819-1888), 
        &#39;Ad Valorem&#39;</p><p></p>
      <p class="normal">The <a href="http://www.ruralhistory.org/">Rural History 
        Centre</a> (RHC) at the <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/">University of Reading</a> is a national center 
        for the study of the history of farming, food and the countryside. It 
        began in 1951 as the <a href="http://www.museums.reading.ac.uk/merl/">Museum of English Rural Life</a> 
        (MERL) as a university museum (Boylan, 1999) when recognition of the impact 
        of sweeping changes in agricultural practice led to the acquisition of 
        material reflecting the pre-tractor era (Holt, 1977). Over the intervening 
        half century, the collections have grown continuously and now include, 
        in addition to the objects, a library of 50,000 books, one million photographic 
        images, and extensive archival holdings relating to life and work in the 
        countryside. The Rural History Centre today has many functions: as a university 
        department engaged in teaching and research; as a public resource and 
        information center on the subject; as a museum with a wide general audience, 
        and special organized activities for school children.</p>
      <p class="normal">In 1997, the Rural History Centre achieved &#34;designation&#34; 
        status under a new government scheme to throw the spotlight on collections 
        considered to be of national and international importance. It was followed 
        by the creation of a £15 million ($22 million) Challenge Fund to be distributed 
        amongst the 50 Designated Museums on improvement projects for the collections. 
      </p>
      <p class="normal">The response from the Rural History Centre was the Collections 
        Access Project, designed to develop new forms of online access to its 
        materials. This is a three-year scheme that began in the summer of 1999 
        with a total projected budget of just over £300,000 ($450,000). It fits 
        within a broader picture of the Rural History Centre planning a move to 
        new premises on the University site, reviewing its operations generally 
        and recognizing the potential of the Internet for expanding access to 
        the collections.</p>
      <p class="normal">This paper presents an overview of this project. It includes 
        more detailed information on evaluation studies that were undertaken at 
        the start of the project and after the production of the initial website, 
        an aspect of increasing concern to museums (Schweibenz, 2001). These looked 
        at existing museum websites to help determine good and bad aspects of 
        such sites and also used a questionnaire to obtain feedback from children 
        using the website. More recently some technical evaluation of the initial 
        website has been undertaken, especially with respect to enabling wider 
        and easier access to the site. The project is on-going so the paper finishes 
        with consideration of the project benefits so far and plans for the rest 
        of the project.</p>
      <h1>The Project</h1>
      <p class="normal">The principal objective was to devise a means of online 
        exploration of the collections, bearing in mind the diverse nature and 
        requirements of potential users, that was capable of indefinite expansion 
        and development. This immediately produced two main aspects to the project: 
        the creation of an online database (Bowen, 2000c) for the collections 
        and of a new front end operating over the top of it to deliver material 
        dynamically in different forms for different audiences. Thereafter, both 
        elements involved a number of contributory factors. The database already 
        in use for the Centre&#39;s library had to be adapted to accommodate 
        a whole range of non-book material from objects to photographs to archives 
        and film. It is an Oracle based product called OLIB, licensed from Fretwell-Downing 
        Informatics Ltd of Sheffield, UK. Once the cataloguing mechanics had been 
        worked out, a plan was devised for the transfer of existing collection 
        records on to the system. As the ability to view the collections online 
        was important, a scheme for digitally photographing the collections was 
        also put in train. Initially, an external photographer was contracted 
        in to do the objects, while two-dimensional material was sent out to be 
        scanned by a commercial firm. Increasingly, as the project has progressed, 
        more of this work has been taken on by the in-house project team. High-resolution 
        TIFF files are kept on CD-ROM, from which lower resolution JPEG files 
        are created for mounting onto the server and linking to the database. 
        The cataloguing and photography activities are ongoing through the duration 
        of the project.</p>
      <p class="normal">Creating a new front end to operate online over the top 
        of the database required considerable thought and planning. From experience 
        of the Centre&#39;s existing operations, three main categories of user 
        were identified: (younger) school children; the general public (includes 
        older school children); and specialists, whether they be academics, commercial 
        researchers or members of the public with a particular interest. The new 
        system needed to be able to serve up material from the database in a form 
        suited to the needs of each category. </p>
      <p class="normal">A simple subject heading system that would make navigation 
        through the collections easily understood was devised. It moves from three 
        primary headings - Farming, Country People and The Countryside - through 
        secondary and tertiary lists of progressively more specific subjects. 
        It was then possible to tag individual database records with their respective 
        subject key words and with three separate and sequentially numbered captions, 
        one for each user category. The system would then be able to deliver online 
        a series of captioned images within each subject and user category. </p>
      <p class="normal">For general and specialist users, the layout of the system 
        is the same, operating on screen from the subject listings on the left 
        hand side. They differ in that the caption sequence is longer in the specialist 
        section and the amount of information given is greater. In the children&#39;s 
        section, the approach is different. The starting point is a colorful picture 
        of a fictional village and its surrounding countryside. When particular 
        features, such as the blacksmith&#39;s shop or the farm, are &#34;moused&#34; 
        over this activates the link to the relevant series of captioned images 
        generated by the database. Additional interactive features, including 
        a quiz, are also built into the village scene. </p>
      <p class="normal">The great benefit of the system overall is its flexibility: 
        the captioned image sequences can be extended indefinitely, the captions 
        themselves can be altered at any time on the database and further subject 
        headings can be added. In this way, it will continue to grow and develop 
        along with the collections. </p>
      <p class="normal">Packaging of the system online involved the complete re-design 
        of the Rural History Centre&#39;s website in order to set it within a logical 
        arrangement. A local Reading firm, <a href="http://www.designation.com/">Designation.com</a>, 
        was engaged to do this and to carry out all the associated design work 
        on the new access system, which came to be called <i><a href="http://www.ruralhistory.org/interface/">INTERFACE</a></i> 
        - standing for the Internet Farm and Countryside Explorer. From the new 
        website [<a href="http://www.ruralhistory.org/" target="new">www.ruralhistory.org</a>], <i>INTERFACE</i> 
        is accessed directly from the home page. The raw data of the online catalogue 
        can be viewed elsewhere from the Collections link on the site. Other links 
        provide more information about the Centre and its activities; there is 
        also provision for virtual exhibitions, the first of which will be developed 
        during 2001.</p>
      <p class="normal">The new website with the mark I version of <i>INTERFACE</i> 
        went live in June 2000. Although the basic framework of the system is 
        in place, much work remains to be done in filling out all the subject 
        areas with a first round of captioned image sequences. A process of user 
        evaluation has also been under way and an online feedback facility for 
        comments has been incorporated. As a result, revisions and adjustments 
        will be fed in at the end of 2000 in preparation for the launch of the 
        Mark II <i>INTERFACE </i>in spring 2001. After that, the remaining twelve 
        months of the project will be primarily taken up with further database 
        input and sequence development.</p>
      <h1>The Project Team</h1>
      <p class="normal">The project has recruited a team of four young committed 
        graduates, all in their twenties, who have been trained in the various 
        component tasks - cataloguing, digitizing, authoring, evaluation, etc. 
        - and have done a remarkable job in the short space of time to date. They 
        are part of a wider team, which includes:</p>
      <p class="normal">Members of the RHC&#39;s own specialist staff, especially 
        the project manager, Dr Roy Brigden and the technician, Robin Harrison;</p>
      <p class="normal">Two expert academic advisers, Dr Mary Dyson from the Department 
        of Typography (Dyson <i>et al.</i>, 2000) and <a href="http://www.jpbowen.com/">Professor Jonathan Bowen</a> of the School of Computing, 
        Information Systems and Mathematics, South Bank University, London (Bowen, 
        1995-2000);</p>
      <p class="normal">Reading University&#39;s IT Services department which manages 
        the RHC&#39;s server;</p>
      <p class="normal">Fretwell Downing Informatics Ltd of Sheffield the database 
        providers;</p>
      <p class="normal">Designation.com Ltd of Reading, the web interface designers;</p>
      <p class="normal">Realvision Ltd of Portsmouth, commercial producers of digitized 
        material.</p>
      <h1>Pre-Development Evaluation Process</h1>
      <p class="normal">A preparatory stage of the project in the summer of 1999 
        provided a basis for future work by researching the existing situation 
        with regard to web access to collections. This included a review of literature 
        and an evaluation of a small sample of relevant sites. This research led 
        to a set of recommendations and proposals on the information design of 
        sites which provide access to collections databases, ways of dealing with 
        multiple users, the generation of story-based environments, and how the 
        collections database might be searched and returned (see Dyson and Moran, 
        2001). </p>
      <p class="normal">In this paper, the framework developed to evaluate the usability 
        and presentation of the sample of sites is described with summaries of 
        example outcomes of the evaluation. The approach aims to provide a systematic 
        method to identify and evaluate the dimensions that affect the usability 
        of websites. The framework proposes criteria that may be considered in 
        both formative and summative evaluations. These criteria may be translated 
        into specific guidelines for the design of sites incorporating access 
        to collections, but could also have more general application. The specific 
        outcomes of the evaluations can provide direction in improving the design 
        of websites by identifying good and bad practice. </p>
      <h1>The framework</h1>
      <p class="normal">A descriptive approach was adopted which combined the Systematic 
        Usability Evaluation (SUE) of Garzotto, Matera and Paolini (1998) with 
        aspects of a framework proposed by Walker, Reynolds and Edwards (1999). 
        The resulting dimensions are modified to suit the purpose of the evaluation. 
        This analysis is a variation on the method of heuristic evaluation [<a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/" target="new">http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/</a>] 
        involving a systematic inspection of an interface. The heuristics are 
        defined within the framework. This procedure is normally part of an iterative 
        design process, and has been shown to be more successful with multiple 
        evaluators. However, since the purpose of this evaluation was to identify 
        strengths and weaknesses of existing sites to inform future designs, a 
        single evaluator who was experienced in web design was considered appropriate.</p>
      <p class="normal">A key feature of the SUE is that it considers the specific 
        nature of the application to be evaluated, rather than addressing only 
        general interface features. The method takes into account the structure 
        of the information alongside the presentation and allows for discussion 
        and interpretation of sites. Issues related to access and navigation, 
        typography, use of images and text were taken from Walker <i>et al.</i> 
        (1999).</p>
      <p class="normal">The dimensions of the framework cover:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <span class="Normal">Consistency in the treatment of content, navigational 
          tools, typographic and graphic presentation; </span></li>
        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Predictability evaluated in terms of regularity in 
          structure and logical orders;</span></li>
        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Accessibility evaluated by the provision of navigational 
          tools and their appropriateness;</span></li>
        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Orientation of users based on the availability of 
          facilities to identify their location and knowledge of where links lead;</span></li>
        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Typography evaluated in terms of clarity and effectiveness 
          in signalling the content&#39;s structure; </span></li>
        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Images and text evaluated in terms of the clarity 
          of pictures and their relationship with text; </span></li>
        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Overall presentation judged in terms of attractiveness 
          and ability to engage.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="normal"><span class="Normal">Examples of strengths and weaknesses 
        identified through this evaluation are:</span></p>

      <h1>Evaluation of INTERFACE Mark 1</h1>
      <p class="normal">Once the initial website had been produced, evaluation of 
        this was undertaken. The primary aim of this evaluation is to assess the 
        effectiveness of the website interfaces to the collections in communicating 
        to the intended audiences. In this context, effectiveness is defined in 
        terms of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Appropriateness of content (depth, language);</span></li>
        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Ease of navigation; </span></li>
        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Satisfaction; </span></li>
        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Meeting educational objectives.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="normal">At the time of preparing this paper, data has been collected 
        from evaluating the school&#39;s section of the site. The online questionnaire 
        to gain feedback from the general public has not yet produced many responses.</p>
      <h2>Method</h2>
      <p class="normal">A sample of 43 children between the ages of 8 and 13 years 
        responded to questions about their general interests, preferences and 
        experiences before answering questions about the RHC website. The children 
        were either visiting the museum or were visited at their primary school. 
      </p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p class="normal">Two thirds of the sample use computers at home, with the 
        remaining third using computers at school. These are mainly used with 
        CD-ROMs (30%) or for accessing the Internet (28%). </p>
      <p class="normal">The personal information collected from children on their 
        interests etc. gives a good indication of the factors to be considered 
        when planning the addition of new material to the site. The favorite subject 
        at school is Art (27%), closely followed by Math (22%). This preference 
        for Art might be exploited in the future design of new material. Quiz-like, 
        logical problems may also be attractive. </p>
      <p class="normal">A clear preference for novels (41%) over magazines (29%), 
        comics (17%), factual books (10%) and newspapers (3%) supports the introduction 
        of narrative elements to the web pages. The addition of facilities to 
        create material, such as a diary entry, would also introduce greater interactivity. 
        Although factual books appear to be unpopular, examples were cited as 
        favorite books. Children may therefore not perceive such books as factual 
        or may not understand the categorization. The style used in favorite books 
        (e.g., the <i>Horrible History</i> series) may be an appropriate model 
        for developing further material.</p>
      <p class="normal">Many children had difficulty locating the children&#39;s 
        section of the site from the home page. This will be remedied in the mark 
        II version, by introducing a more obvious link. Once the <i>INTERFACE</i> 
        page was reached, the instructions were considered easy to follow. </p>

      <h1>Technical Evaluation</h1>
      <p class="normal">As well as evaluation of the website from a user point of 
        view, the initial website has been evaluated for its use across a range 
        of browsers and to check its adherence to web standards. It is important 
        that a museum website is user-centered (Bowen &amp; Bowen, 2000) and also 
        accessible by a wide range of browsers (Bowen, 2000b). A graphic design 
        company who have moved into the area of web design designed the site. 
        This means that the look-and-feel of the site is good. However, such companies 
        tend to design for the currently most widely used web browsers, with little 
        consideration given to lesser-used browsers. This is fine in an intranet 
        situation, where most users may have a recent version of Internet Explorer 
        for example. Even on the Internet itself, around 43% of clients visiting 
        museum websites were using Internet Explorer version 5 in the year 2000 
        (Bowen, 2000b). Around 27% were using Netscape 4 and 20% Internet Explorer 
        4. This leaves about 10% of people using other browsers. Of course the 
        situation is changing all the time. Netscape 6 is now available and access 
        via WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) mobile phones may increase in 
        the future.</p>
      <p class="normal"><span lang="EN-GB">Certainly the initial version of the website 
        works well with the three most popular web browsers (see Figures 1 and 
        2 for the main home page and the initial <i><a href="http://www.ruralhistory.org/interface/">INTERFACE</a></i> page). Here we 
        consider the use of the website with some other web browsers, its conformance 
        to standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [<a href="http://www.w3.org/" target="new">www.w3.org</a>], and its suitability for 
        disabled access.</span></p>
      <h2>Browser access</h2>
      <p class="normal">A good browser for testing cross-compatibility is the Lynx 
        text-based browser [<a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">lynx.browser.org</a>] 
        freely available on many operating system platforms, including Unix, DOS 
        and Windows [<a href="http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx/lynxport.htm" target="new">www.fdisk.com/doslynx/lynxport.htm</a>]. 
        Accessing the main page of the current site results in the following display:<span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>
      <p class="MsoCaption"><a href="bowenfig3.html" name="fig3"><img src="bowen.small.fig3.jpg" width="400" height="220" alt="Fig. 3: Initial homepage using the text-based Lynx browser" border="0"/></a><br/>
        Fig. 3: Initial homepage using the text-based <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx browser</a><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>
      <p class="normal">This is due to a &#34;redirect&#34; from the initial homepage to 
        the &#34;index.html&#34; file containing the actual homepage, done automatically 
        by most (but not all) web browsers. The <a href="http://www.ruralhistory.org/index.html" target="new">http://www.ruralhistory.org/index.html</a> 
        link can be followed manually to obtain:</p>
      <p class="MsoCaption"><a href="bowenfig4.html" name="fig4"><img src="bowen.small.fig4.jpg" width="400" height="220" alt="Fig. 4: Redirected homepage using the text-based Lynx browser" border="0"/></a><br/>
        Fig. 4: Redirected homepage using the text-based <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx browser</a></p>
      <p class="normal">Here it becomes obvious that a large number of the images 
        in the page have not been given &#34;ALT&#34; attribute tags to define alternative 
        text (e.g., see &#34;[shim.gif]&#34;, &#34;[bw_2.gif]&#34;, etc., above). This is now 
        a required attribute in recent Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) standards. 
        Note that it is relatively easy to fix such problems. Here is an example 
        of the same page, slightly modified to work more effectively with a wider 
        range of web browsers:</p>
      <p class="MsoCaption"><a href="bowenfig5.html" name="fig5"><img src="bowen.small.fig5.jpg" width="400" height="220" alt="Improved homepage using the text-based Lynx browser" border="0"/></a><br/>
        Fig. 5: Improved homepage using the text-based <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx browser</a></p>
      <p class="normal">Of course, the above page is not as attractive as the graphical 
        presentation in Figure 1, but it is much more usable by those without 
        advanced web browsers. It is also a considerable improvement over the 
        previous Lynx screen.</p>
      <p class="normal">Viewing the homepage with Amaya [<a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/" target="new">www.w3.org/Amaya/</a>], a web browser 
        produce by <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> to promote the use of 
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">Extended Markup Language</a> (XML), illustrates 
        some further problems that may occur even with graphical browsers:</p>
      <p class="MsoCaption"><a href="bowenfig6.html" name="fig6"><img src="bowen.small.fig6.jpg" width="400" height="324" alt="Homepage using the advanced Amaya browser" border="0"/></a><br/>
        Fig. 6: Homepage using the advanced <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/">Amaya browser</a></p>
      <p class="normal">The alignment for the homepage is very critical since part 
        of the graphic design (specifically, the pale colored rectangular potions 
        of the display) is included as a &#34;background&#34; image to the page. This 
        means that the rest of the graphic design must be laid out with margins 
        of size zero at the top and left for correct alignment of the rest of 
        the design. Both Internet Explorer and Netscape allow this using HTML 
        attribute tags that have not been accepted in the latest HTML standards. 
        Thus, it is highly likely that other browsers will misalign the design 
        slightly, as illustrated above. Fortunately, this is not immediately obvious 
        to many viewers, but the labeled square hyperlink images are positioned 
        somewhat to the right and down a little compared with the paler background 
        images.</p>
      <p class="normal">Notice also that the font selection has not been recognized 
        and the default Roman serif font is used instead at the bottom of the 
        screen. It is important not to rely on a particular font typeface or size 
        in web page design since these are not under the total control of the 
        designer. Of course, selecting a <i>preferred</i> font, size, etc., is 
        a good idea, and has been done in the design of this website.</p>
      <p class="normal">Further potential problems include the use of &#34;rollover&#34; 
        graphics using JavaScript where the graphical image changes as the mouse 
        moves over a portion. Around 94% of museum web visitors have JavaScript 
        enabled browsers (Bowen, 2000b), leaving 6% who do not. Rollovers provide 
        an attractive addition to the web interface, but it is a good idea not 
        to rely on their use for important aspects of any website. In Figure 2, 
        the graphic at the top right of the screen is a navigation aid making 
        use of rollovers. Fortunately, navigation is also possible via the text 
        links at the bottom of the page, although it could be argued that these 
        could be nearer the top of the page to allow those with small screens 
        to access them without the need for scrolling to the bottom of the page.</p>
      <h1>Standards conformance</h1>
      <p class="normal">The standards for HTML coding are set by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C). They provide an 
        on-line HTML validator accessible under <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a>. 
        The home page was tested using this validator. Below is a selection of 
        errors discovered, and information on how these errors can be corrected:</p>
      <p class="normal">Line 1, column 1: <span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>
      <p class="normal"><span> </span><code>&lt;html&gt;</code></p>
      <p class="normal"> <span class="markup">^</span></p>
      <p class="normal"><span class="error">Error: Missing DOCTYPE declaration at 
        start of document (<a href="http://www.htmlhelp.org/tools/validator/doctype.html">explanation...</a>)</span></p>
      <p class="normal"><span class="error">It is quite common for the document type 
        to be omitted from web pages. This is used to describe the type of markup 
        used in the rest of the page. In a web context, HTML is assumed. However, 
        it is helpful to include the DOCTYPE declaration at the start of web pages 
        to give information on which version of HTML is being used in the page. 
        For example, for version 4.0 of HTML, the following could be included:</span></p>
      <p class="normal">&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &#34;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&#34;&gt;</p>
      <p class="normal">There are a number of other possibilities, depending on 
        whether strict or loose checking is required.</p>
      <p class="normal">Line 5, column 29: </p>
      <p class="normal"><code>&lt;script language=&#34;JavaScript&#34;&gt;</code></p>
      <p class="normal">           <span class="markup">^</span></p>
      <p class="normal"><span class="error">Error: required attribute &#34;TYPE&#34; 
        not specified</span></p>
      <p class="normal"><span class="error">HTML is constantly in a state of transition. 
        The latest versions of HTML (e.g., 4.01) are moving from using the &#34;language&#34; 
        attribute tag to the &#34;type&#34; attribute tag for specifying the language 
        used in any scripts included in a web page. For JavaScript, this following 
        is now appropriate for backwards and forwards compatibility:</span></p>
      <p class="normal">&lt;script language=&#34;JavaScript&#34; type=&#34;text/javascript&#34;&gt;</p>
      <p class="normal">Line 31, column 784: </p>

      <p class="normal"><span class="error">Error: there is no attribute &#34;MARGINHEIGHT&#34;</span></p>
      <p class="normal"><span class="error">All of the above attribute tags have been 
        introduced by Internet Explorer and/or Netscape, but have not been accepted 
        by recent HTML standards. Thus although they work with the major browsers 
        at the moment, this situation could easily change in the future. They 
        have been included here to ensure the correct alignment of the graphical 
        background and other graphical elements in the page design. A more reliable 
        way to do this would be using Cascading Style Sheet (CCS) markup [<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS" target="new">www.w3.org/Style/CSS</a>]. 
        For example, the following could be included in the body markup:</span></p>
      <p class="normal">&lt;body style=&#34;margin: 0em&#34; ...</p>
      <p class="normal">This works with current widely used browsers and is more 
        likely to work with future browsers.</p>
      <p class="normal">Line 35, column 64: </p>
      <p class="normal"><code>&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;assets/shim.gif&#34;

      <p class="normal"> <span class="markup">^</span></p>
      <p class="normal"><span class="error">Error: required attribute &#34;ALT&#34; 
        not specified</span></p>
      <p class="normal"><span class="error">The &#34;ALT&#34; attribute tag for alternative 
        text with graphical images is now required by recent HTML standards. Many 
        web pages, even those designed professionally, omit these. On the initial 
        version of the home page, this error occurs no less than 52 times. Even 
        if no text is appropriate, this should be explicitly included as &#34;alt=&#34;&#34;&#34; 
        since the default for a specific web browser is unknown and may not be 
        the empty string (as for the Lynx browser for example where the file name 
        of the image is included in square brackets by default). Further examples 
        of this error are omitted for brevity.</span></p>
      <p class="normal">All of the above errors are relatively easy to correct, 
        once the problems are understood. Indeed, this has been done in a revised 
        version of the homepage accessible on-line for experimentation purposes 
        [<a href="http://www.museophile.sbu.ac.uk/merl" target="new">www.museophile.sbu.ac.uk/merl</a>]. 
        Unfortunately, many tools used for the production of web pages do not 
        adhere to official HTML standards, but rather conform to accepted practice 
        by currently available web browsers at the time the tool was originally 
        produced. The web is a fast changing environment, and using current HTML 
        standards means there is more likelihood that the web page will continue 
        to be rendered successfully with future browsers. Using ad hoc markup 
        acceptable by current browsers gives no such assurance.</p>
      <h1>Disabled access</h1>
      <p class="normal"><span lang="EN-GB">Museums generally pride themselves on disabled 
        access to their facilities and in general try to avoid turning minorities 
        away. The same has yet to translate itself in the context of the web to 
        any large extent. Many museums attempt to produce websites that are accessible 
        to the majority with standard browsers such as Internet Explorer and Netscape, 
        without much thought for those with more unusual browser technologies. 
        For example, audio web browsers aimed at the blind are now available (Bowen, 
        2000b). Unfortunately many web pages do not work well with these. The 
        Bobby website [</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.cast.org/bobby" target="new">www.cast.org/bobby</a></span><span lang="EN-GB">] 
        provides a facility for checking accessibility of web pages. The main 
        &#34;Priority 1&#34; accessibility error found with the existing home page is 
        the lack of &#34;ALT&#34; attribute tags for alternative explanatory text with 
        images. There are also five suggested user checks prompted by specific 
        features in the page. It thus does not achieve &#34;Bobby Approved&#34; status 
        as it stands. There are also three &#34;Priority 2&#34; accessibility errors and 
        three &#34;Priority 3&#34; errors. Bobby also recognizes browser compatibility 
        errors, as also found by the W3C validator. The TOPMARGIN, MARGINWIDTH, 
        MARGINHEIGHT and LEFTMARGIN attributes in the BODY element are flagged 
        as unknown in HTML4.0 and the ALT attribute is flagged as required for 
        the IMG element (52 times).</span></p>
      <p class="normal">Another useful indication provided by Bobby is an estimate 
        of the download time for images, applets and other objects in the page 
        and the HTML page itself on a 28.8 kilo-baud modem. This is summarized 
        in the following table based on information taken directly from the Bobby 
        results page:</p>

      <p class="normal">The first column in the table above contains the URL of

        third column the approximate download time for each file on a 28.8 kilo-baud 
        line. The homepage contains 14 images (some used more than once, but local 
        caching means these do not need to be reloaded). An arbitrary 0.5-second 
        delay is added for each file to allow for Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
        (HTTP) connection times. In this case, the total delay is around 23.5 
        seconds for 58 kilobytes of material. A more modern 56 kilo-baud line 
        would halve this delay to about 12 seconds, assuming no delays are introduced 
        elsewhere on the Internet. This is on the high side, but is reasonably 
        acceptable.</p>
      <p class="normal"><span lang="EN-GB">This technical evaluation has revealed 
        a large number of problems, but most are fortunately minor and easily 
        correctable. None of the problems encountered during the various evaluations 
        is insoluble and the project has the opportunity to improve access to 
        the resources in the final stages of the project. Evaluation is certainly 
        a very important aspect of the production of a professional website that 
        should not be overlooked by museums.</span></p>
      <h3>Conclusion and Future Plans</h3>
      <p class="normal">The project continues to run until 2002, but already a range 
        of benefits can be identified. Above all, the project has facilitated 
        a major re-think on the development of the Rural History Centre&#39;s 
        services for the future. Extending access to collections is currently 
        a key political maxim in the UK museums sector and a vital key for unlocking 
        sources of funding. The Internet is seen as having great potential in 
        this respect and there are a number of government inspired initiatives 
        under way designed to make more cultural and educational material available 
        online through, amongst other things, a National Grid for Learning. By 
        means of its Collections Access Project, the Rural History Centre has 
        been able to move directly into the mainstream of these developments. 
        The necessary pre-requisites, namely the wholesale transfer of manually 
        held records onto database and the production of digital image files, 
        could hardly have been attempted without the special funding that the 
        project brought. The launch of a new website putting the Rural History 
        Centre online as a hub for information, resources and links on the history 
        of food, farming and the countryside also has beneficial spin-offs for 
        the emerging network of rural and agricultural museums in the UK. The 
        co-operative elements within the project have also been very important. 
        The whole enterprise has been an exercise, or an experiment, in working 
        together across a range of disciplines and specialisms, producing a number 
        of papers and reports (e.g., Dyson <i>et al.</i>, 2000) along the way 
        for future reference. </p>
      <p class="normal">The key objective for the final year is to make full use 
        of the expertise now built into the in-house team to consolidate and complete 
        this phase of the project. Some of the principal tasks envisaged include:</p>
      <p class="normal">Online cataloguing. This will be the role of the Cataloguer 
        and Assistant Cataloguer. Both are fully trained, achieving the target 
        outputs of 65 objects or 100 photographs each week. This material goes 
        on to our OLIB database, the online version of which is available from 
        the <a href="http://www.rhc.reading.ac.uk/">RHC website</a>.</p>
      <p class="normal">Digital photography. The Project Assistant will continue 
        to create digital images of objects in the collection, to feed into the 
        system. The target will be a further 2,500.</p>
      <p class="normal">Scanning images from the photographic and archive collections. 
        Some of this will be done externally, the rest in-house on a piecework 
        basis. It is hoped that at least 10,000 new image files will be added.<b><i></i></b></p>
      <p class="normal">Population of the existing subject areas within the <i><a href="http://www.ruralhistory.org/interface/">INTERFACE</a></i> system. Currently 
        there are a total of 51 subject headings on the system, each of which 
        by the end of the project will have five database-generated captioned 
        image entries at the General Public level and ten at the Specialist level. 
        The production of these caption sequences is the single most time-consuming 
        element in the whole project. It will therefore be an important feature 
        of the final year, occupying much of the available time of two of the 
        project team and the project manager.<b></b></p>
      <p class="normal">Evaluation. This has been built into the project from the 
        beginning and feedback from it has informed the changes that are to be 
        implemented in the <i><a href="http://www.ruralhistory.org/interface/">INTERFACE</a></i> 
        system. We shall be carrying out some further evaluation, gathering and 
        collating comments and returns made by users. There will also be an overall 
        evaluation of the project itself. The whole scheme has been a major undertaking 
        for the Rural History Centre and there will be lessons to be usefully 
        learned in subsequent work.</p>
      <p class="normal"><span lang="EN-GB">The web continues to develop apace (Berners-Lee, 
        1999) and museums with continue to be affected by this (Bowen, 2000b; 
        Farnell, 2000). Future interesting possibilities for the Rural History 
        Centre website include learning and collaboration (Bowen &amp; Houghton, 
        1999), visual search as opposed to text search for photographs and other 
        images (Lew, 2000) and e-commerce activities (Bowen, 2000b). The need 
        for efficient provision of ever-growing image resources on-line will increase 
        (</span>Talagala <i><span lang="EN-GB">et al.</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">, 2000). The end of the current project 
        will by no means be the end of on-line developments for the Centre, which 
        must always aim to keep abreast, and where finances permit at the forefront, 
        of the ever-changing world of the web.</span></p>
