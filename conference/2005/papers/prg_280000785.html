      <h1>The accessibility of Museum Web Sites: Results From An English Investigation 
        And International Comparisons</h1>
      <h2>Helen Petrie, Neil King, Centre for Human Computer Interaction Design, 
            City University London and Marcus Weisen, The Council for Museums, Libraries 
        and Archives, United Kingdom</h2>
      <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="Abstracttext" id="abstract">Museums, like many other organizations, 
            now use the Web to interact with their audiences.  Thus the accessibility 
            of museum web sites is as important as the accessibility of their premises 
            and services.  This paper presents the results of an audit of 125 museum 
            Web sites, 100 in England and 
            a group of 25 museums from around the world as a comparison group.  
        The technical accessibility of the Web sites was assessed against the 
        WCAG1 checkpoints using the accessibility tool WebXM™. In addition, 
            the extent to which disabled people could use the Web sites was assessed 
            by a panel of 15 people with disabilities (5 blind people, 5 partially 
            sighted people and 5 people with dyslexia) who undertook two simple 
            tasks on each Web site and rated the site on a number of dimensions. 
            The results of the automated testing showed that only 30% of English 
            museum Web sites and 20% of the international group could meet even the 
            most basic accessibility criteria.  The user testing showed that disabled 
            people could successfully complete very basic tasks on the Web sites 
            only 76.2% of the time and got lost on over one third of the sites.  
        However, further analyses showed that these problems were originating 
        from a relatively small number of accessibility issues that are not 
        especially complex to address.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Disabled people are among the most excluded in society and face many 
            barriers in accessing the premises and services of museums.  Disability 
            legislation in a number of countries (e.g. Australia, 
            Germany, the U.K. 
            and the U.S.A.) establishes 
            a right of access to services for disabled people, with some legislation 
            specifically recognising Web sites as a service.  For example, in the 
            U.K., although the Disability 
            Discrimination Act (1995) makes no explicit reference to Web sites, the 
            accompanying legally recognised Code of Practice produced by the Disability 
            Rights Commission (2002) makes it clear that a Web site constitutes a 
            service.  U.K. government policy 
            also requires that public sector Web sites meet moderate levels of web 
            accessibility (WCAG1 Level AA, see Methodology section for a further 
            explanation) by 2005.  Similarly, in Germany, 
            the disability equality law (Bundesbehindertengleichstellungsgesetz, 
            2002, see <a target="_blank" href="http://217.160.60.235/BGBL/bgbl1f/bgbl102s2654.pdf">217.160.60.235/BGBL/bgbl1f/bgbl102s2654.pdf</a>), 
            in which barrier-free access is a central concept, requires that Web sites 
            meet the same level of accessibility.  The European Union&#39;s eEurope 
            Action Plan 2005 (see <a href="http://europa.eu.int%20/information_society/eeurope/2005/index_en.htm" target="_blank">europa.eu.int /information_society/eeurope/2005/index_en.htm</a>) 
            also states that public Web sites should be accessible.  In the cultural 
            sector, the European MINERVA Project (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.minervaeurope.org/">www.minervaeurope.org</a>) 
            has established quality principles that will help the sector turn these 
            policy objectives into practice.  In the U.S.A., 
            the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) also makes no explicit reference 
            to Web sites, but a number of legal cases (although not all cases) have 
            found that Web sites come within the scope of the Act.  For example, 
            a recent ruling in New York State found that two major travel Web sites 
            were in breach of the ADA; the Web site owners were fined and required 
            to make efforts make their Web sites more accessible (see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2004/aug/aug19a_04.htm">www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2004/aug/aug19a_04.htm</a>).  
      </p>
      <p>Providing access to Web sites for disabled people is clearly a challenge 
            museums cannot afford to ignore. In 2003, the English Council for Museums, 
            Libraries and Archives (MLA) commissioned an investigation of the accessibility 
            of museum, library and archive Web sites in England 
            with an appropriate international comparison.  MLA is the government 
            agency that provides strategic guidance, advice and advocacy to U.K. 
            Government departments on museum, library and archive matters.  MLA&#39;s 
            Operational and Strategic Plan sets out a vision for the central role 
            of the sector in enabling easy access to knowledge, information and 
            inspirations for all; supporting the Government&#39;s access, learning and 
            inclusion agendas and driving forward the knowledge society and economy. 
        The main objectives of the audit were:</p>
            <ul>
          <li> 
             to establish the current state of accessibility 
              of museum, library and archive Web sites in England; 
            </li>
          <li>to benchmark the current state of accessibility against national and 
            international standards; </li>
          <li> 
             to identify current areas of best practice and 
              those which require improvement; and</li>
          <li> 
             to create a strategy for improving accessibility 
              of web sites in the sector.  </li>
        </ul>
         
          <p>This paper will concentrate on the audit of English museum Web sites 
            and the international comparison.</p>
          <p>The audit was inspired by a study conducted by City University London 
            in 2003/2004 of the accessibility of 1,000 general Web sites for the 
            Disability Rights Commission (2004).  This was the largest and most 
            comprehensive web accessibility audit ever undertaken and unusual in 
            prominently involving extensive user testing to complement automatic 
            testing of Web sites.  A similar methodology for the MLA audit of museum 
            Web sites was used, creating baseline data of unprecedented scope and 
            breadth.</p>
          <h1>Methodology for the audit</h1>
          <p>A sample of 100 English museum Web sites was chosen to reflect the 
            range of different museums: academic museums, those funded by local 
            authorities, national museums and independent museums.  Within each 
            of these domains, a random selection was made from the complete listing 
            of museums provided by MLA.  The number of Web sites in each domain 
            is given in Table 1, below. A sample of 25 national museums from across 
            the world was selected to form the International comparison group.  
            Two criteria were used in making this selection: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
             that the museum have an English language Web 
              site (to allow us to understand the results of the automated accessibility 
              testing and to have English speaking disabled people conduct user 
              testing with some of the Web sites, see below); </li>
          <li>that Web sites were chosen from all the continents of the world and 
            a broad range of countries; and</li>
          <li> 
             the museums be of national or international standing.</li>
        </ul>

          <p>The criterion for technical accessibility was the extent to which the 
            Web sites conformed to the World Wide Web Consortium&#39;s (W3C) Web Content 
            Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG, version 1, henceforth WCAG1) (see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/">www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/</a>) 
            developed by the Web Accessibility Initiative (see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">www.w3.org/WAI/</a>).  
            WCAG1 provides 14 Guidelines that are divided into 65 specific Checkpoints.  
            Each Checkpoint has a priority level (1, 2 or 3) assigned to it, based 
            on the Checkpoint&#39;s expected impact on accessibility.  Thus, violating 
            Priority 1 Checkpoints are said to have the largest impact on a Web 
            site&#39;s accessibility, while violating Priority 3 Checkpoints are said 
            have the least impact on accessibility.  If a web page passes all the 
            Priority 1 Checkpoints, it is said to be Level A conformant; if it passes 
            both Priority 1 and 2 Checkpoints, it is said to be Level AA conformant; 
            and if it passes all Checkpoints, Priority 1, 2 and 3, it is said to 
            be Level AAA conformant.  If a whole Web site achieves a particular 
            level of conformance, it may wish to display the corresponding logo 
            from the WAI (see Figure 1).</p>
          <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a><img src="petrie.fig1a.jpg" width="110" height="39"/>  <img src="petrie.fig1b.jpg" width="110" height="39"/>  <img src="petrie.fig1c.jpg" width="110" height="39"/></p>
          <p class="caption">Figure 1: WAI logos for Web site accessibility conformance</p>
          <p>An automated tool was used to check conformance to WCAG1, the accessibility 
            module of WebXM™ from Watchfire (see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.watchfire.com/products/webxm/%20accessibilityxm.aspx)">www.watchfire.com/products/webxm/ 
            accessibilityxm.aspx)</a>.  Like other automated testing tools (see 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3c.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html">www.w3c.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html</a> 
            for a comprehensive listing of such tools), it can check the conformance 
            of a Web site against some of the 65 Checkpoints.  However, it should 
            be remembered that many of the Checkpoints require some human judgement. 
            For example, an automated tool can check whether images on a web site 
            have descriptions associated with them (Checkpoint 1.1: Provide a text 
            equivalent for every non-text element), but at the moment, an automated 
            tool cannot check whether the colour contrast on the page is adequate 
            (Checkpoint 2.2: Ensure that foreground and background color combinations 
            provide sufficient contrast when viewed by someone having color deficits 
            or when viewed on a black and white screen), this requires a human judgement.  
            However, automated tools can give warnings, that is, indicate aspects 
            of a page that should be manually checked by a human. To ensure that 
            a site is fully conformant with the WAI guidelines, both automatic and 
            manual checking of WCAG1 Checkpoints is required.</p>
          <p>The home pages of all 125 museum Web sites were tested using the accessibility 
            module of WebXM.  Following this initial audit, 7 English and 5 international 
            museum Web sites were selected for in-depth automated and user testing. 
            The selection criteria for these Web sites took into account the different 
            museum domains, the varying popularity of the sites, the results of 
            the initial automated testing and whether the site was embedded into 
            a host site.  Up to 700 pages of each of these 12 sites (or the whole 
            site if smaller) were tested with the WebXM™ accessibility module.</p>
          <p>The 12 Web sites were also tested by a User Panel of 15 disabled people 
            and accessibility experts at City University. The User Panel included 
            blind people, partially sighted people and people with dyslexia. Previous 
            research conducted into Web site accessibility by City University showed 
            that these three groups are amongst the most disenfranchised users of 
            the Web (Disability Rights Commission, 2004) and that testing by these 
            groups detects most accessibility problems.  </p>
          <p>The User Panel consisted of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
             five people who are totally blind or have no 
              functional vision (who use screen readers with synthetic speech or 
              Braille output to interact with the Web)</li>
          <li> 
             five people who are partially sighted (who may 
              use screen magnification programs or large screen monitors to interact 
              with the Web)</li>
          <li>five people with dyslexia (who may use specialist text to speech Web 
            browsers to interact with the Web)</li>
        </ul>
         
          <p>As far as possible, the User Panel reflected the diversity of disabled 
            people in Britain in terms 
            of age, gender, technology, computing, and internet experience and assistive 
            technologies used.  Although the research took place in London we included 
            people from other parts of England 
            in the User Panel. </p>
          <p>The user evaluations of Web sites were run individually in dedicated 
            testing areas at City University.  Participants were provided with the 
            assistive technologies they normally use such as JAWS, ZoomText, Read-Please 
            and large screen monitors.  All the sites were evaluated three times 
          – once by a member of each of the three User Panel groups.  </p>
          <p>Each User Panel member assessed four Web sites, undertaking two representative 
            tasks with each site:  </p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
             What time does the museum open on Mondays?</li>
          <li>What facilities does the museum provide for disabled visitors?</li>
          <li> 
            Information collected for each task included:</li>
          <li>Time spent attempting to complete the task </li>
          <li> 
             Whether the User Panel members succeeded or failed 
              to complete the task </li>
          <li>How easy the Panel members found it to perform the task, irrespective 
            of whether or not they succeeded (rated on a scale of 1 to 7, where 
            1 indicates &#34;very difficult&#34; and 7 indicates &#34;very easy&#34;)</li>
          <li> 
             What made it particularly easy or difficult to 
              do the task</li>
          <li>How easy the Panel members found it to navigate the site when attempting 
            the task (rated on a scale of 1 to 7)</li>
          <li> 
             Problems encountered, as articulated by the User 
              Panel members or observed by the experts</li>
        </ul>
         
          <p>Additional information collected for a whole site included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
             The extent to which the Panel members believed 
              each site took their impairment into account (rated on a scale of 
              1 to 7)</li>
          <li> 
             Whether the Panel members experienced a feeling 
              of being &#39;lost&#39; when navigating around the site</li>

          <h1>Results</h1>
          <h2>WCAG Conformance</h2>
          <p>34% of the English museum home pages and 20% of the International comparison 
            group had no WCAG1 Priority 1 Checkpoint violations that automated testing 
            could detect (see Table 2).  However, all these home pages did attract 
            WCAG1 Priority 1 &#39;warnings&#39; (for an average of 7.9 Checkpoints for the 
            English sites and 9.6 Checkpoints for the International sites). For 
            pages to be WAI Level A conformant, they must pass both the automated 
            Level A checks and the manual checks indicated by the warnings. It is 
            almost certain that some of the home pages would have failed some of 
            the manual checks, so 34% is the <em>maximum</em> percentage of home 
            page accessibility at Level A.  </p>
          <p>Of the different domains in the English museums, the Local Authority 
            and National museums fared best, each with 42% of home pages passing 
            WCAG1 Level A for automated tests. Academic museums fared somewhat less 
            well with 30% of home pages passing and only 23% of home pages for independent 
            museums passing.  However, all these figures are higher than the corresponding 
            figure found in the Disability Rights Commission&#39;s (2004) general investigation 
            of British Web sites, which found that only 19% home pages in a more 
            general sample passed the automated Level A tests.</p>

          <p>Only 1 homepage, of an English national museum, had no automatically 
            detectable Priority 1 and Priority 2 Checkpoint violations and was thus 
            potentially Level AA conformant.  However, this home page did have both<strong> 
            </strong>Priority 1 and 2 &#39;warnings&#39; and may therefore not have been 
            AA compliant.  Nonetheless, this museum is to be congratulated for its 
            efforts in accessibility.</p>
          <p>No home pages achieved AAA Compliance, having no automated Priority

          <h2>Designer Metric and User Measures of Web Site Accessibility</h2>
          <p>Looking at whether a web page passes a particular WCAG1 level of accessibility 
            provides only a very basic and rather crude measure of its technical 
            accessibility.  A web page might miss achieving Level A conformance 
            by failing on only one instance of one Priority 1 Checkpoint, or it 
            might have 20 instances of 10 different Priority 1 checkpoints.  At 
            the other extreme, one can try to digest the full set of figures available 
            on the technical accessibility of a web page: for example, the number 
            of different Checkpoints violated, the number of instances of those 
            violations, the number of different Checkpoints giving warnings and 
            the number of instances of warnings (see Table 3).  This overwhelms 
            one in information and makes it very difficult to make meaningful comparisons.</p>

          <p class="caption">Table 3: Mean number of Checkpoints (CPs) violated, 
            instances (Insts) of such violations and mean number of Checkpoints

            Checkpoint priority </p>
          <p>To try to provide more detailed, but comprehensible, information about 
            technical accessibility, we have developed two measures of accessibility: 
            the &#34;designer measure&#34; and the &#34;user measure&#34; (Petrie 
            and Hamilton, 2004).  The number of different Checkpoints violated (at 
            any level of priority) we have termed the &#34;Designer measure&#34; 
            of accessibility.  This is because it indicates the number of <em>different</em> 
            accessibility issues the web designers of the particular site need to 
            consider and understand in order to develop a process for implementing 
            a design solution which will yield an accessible Web site.  The number 
            of instances of violations of all Checkpoints we have termed the &#34;User 
            measure&#34; of accessibility.  This is because every single instance 
            of a violation of a Checkpoint is a potential stumbling block to using 
            a web page for a disabled user.  These stumbling blocks may range from 
            a page which completely prevents a disabled web user from progressing 
            any further in a Web site (which following Nielsen, 19xx, might be termed 
            an &#34;accessibility catastrophe&#34;) to aspects of a page which 
            simply cause irritation.  Of course, not all disabled web users will 
            be affected by all the instances of all the accessibility problems.  
            Some instances relate specifically to the use of the Web by blind people, 
            others relate to use by dyslexic people and so on.  In addition, disabled 
            users will not always read every part of a Web page, and will therefore 
            not encounter every accessibility problem.  Nonetheless, the total number 
            of instances of violations of Checkpoints on a web page is a reasonable 
            measure of its overall accessibility and usability from the viewpoint 
            of disabled users, and the quality of the disabled user experience.  
            This analysis of automatically detected violations of Checkpoints, in 
            terms of number of Checkpoints and instances of violations of those 
            checkpoints, can also be applied to the warnings for manual checks.</p>
          <p>To illustrate the relationship between the Designer Measure and the 
            User Measure, consider the following example.  On a particular home 
            page there may be violations of two Checkpoints: failure to provide 
            ALT text for images (Checkpoint 1.1) and failure to identify row and 
            column headers in tables (Checkpoint 5.1).  Therefore, the number of 
            different Checkpoints violated, the Designer Measure, is 2.  However, 
            if there are 10 images that lack ALT text and 3 tables with a total 
            of 22 headers, then the number of instances of violations of all Checkpoints, 
            the User Measure, is 32. This example also illustrates how violations 
            of a small number of Checkpoints can easily produce a large number of<strong> 
            </strong>instances of violations, and potentially a very poor disabled 
            user experience.</p>

          <p class="caption">Table 4: Average Designer and User Measure per museum 
            home page</p>
          <p>The Designer Measure (Violations), the mean number of different Checkpoints 
            violated, was 5.8 per<strong> </strong>home page for the English museums 
            and 6.9 for the International comparison museums (see Table 4). In other 
            words, the average museum home page violates approximately 6 to 7 different 
            WCAG1 Checkpoints.  This means that there are 6 to 7 issues that the 
            average web design team need to address to make the home page accessible 
          – not such a daunting task.  The difference between the English 
            and International museums was significant (F 1, 123 = 5.3, p &lt; 0.05) 
            showing that the English museums fared significantly better on this 
            measure.</p>
          <p>The differences between the four English museum domains showed a trend 
            towards a difference (F 3, 96 = 2.5 p = 0.065)  The academic museum 
            home pages fared best, with an average of only 5.3 different Checkpoints 
            violated and the National museums fared worst, with an average of 6.9 
            different Checkpoints violated.  Note that this ordering of the different 
            domains is different from that revealed by the percentage of museums 
            passing Priority Level 1.  The higher number of Checkpoints violated 
            by national museums may reflect the use of more ambitious web designs 
            by these museums (a possibility being investigated in current research 
            at City University). </p>
          <p>The User Measure (Violations), the mean number of instances of all 
            Checkpoint violations, was 49.4 per home page for English museums and 
            67.9 for the International comparison museums.   Note how the typically 
            small number of different Checkpoints violated produces a large number 
            of instances of violations, and hence a potentially poor user experience. 
            The difference between the English and International museums was not 
            significant, in spite of the large difference in the mean values (F 
            1, 123 = 1.84), undoubtedly because of the large variance within the 
            English museum domains.  Clearly the division here is between the English 
            academic and Local Authority funded museums that fare much better than 
            the English Independent and National museums and the International museums 
            that fare much less well.  Again, this may well reflect more ambitious 
            web designs in the later group, and is currently being investigated 
            further.  </p>
          <p>Taking the same analysis for warnings rather than actual violations, 
            the Designer Measure (Warnings) produced a mean of 32.4 for English 
            museums and 35.2 for the International comparison museums.  Thus there 
            are many Checkpoints that the average web design team need to address 
            to make the home page accessible – which seems quite a daunting 
            task.  However, the Disability Rights Commission (2004) study found 
            that there was quite a low rate of &#34;conversion&#34; of warnings 
            to actual violations.  This is clearly an area where the automated tools 
            could attempt to improve the information they are providing to web developers.  
            Indeed, this is an area where groups who provide such tools are working 
            to improve the support they offer.  The difference between the English 
            and the International museums was significant (F 1, 123 = 4.05, p &lt; 
            0.05), with English museums again faring better on this measure.  The 
            differences between the different English domains were also significant 
            (F 3, 96 = 5.05, p &lt; 0.005), with the National museums clearly faring 
            worse than the other domains.</p>
          <p>The User Measure (Warnings) produced a mean of 126.6 instances of warnings 
            for English museums and 171.5 instances of warnings for the International 
            comparison museums.  One now begins to understand now why disabled people 
            find browsing web pages so difficult.  The average English museum home 
            page presents a disabled user with a mean of 159.0 potential stumbling 
            blocks (32.4 actual violations and 126.6 warnings of possible problems). 
            The corresponding figure for the International comparison group is 206.7 
            potential stumbling blocks (35.2 actual violation and 171.5 warnings 
            of possible problems). The difference between the English and International 
            Museums was not significant for this measure.  However, the differences 
            between the different English domains was highly significant (F 3, 96 
            = 7.10, p &lt; 0.0005), with Local Authority funded museums faring best 
            and national museums faring worst.</p>
          <h1>User evaluations</h1>
          <p>Technical accessibility, the conformance to the WCAG1 Checkpoints, 
            is one vital aspect of the accessibility of a Web site.  However, equally 
            important is whether users with disabilities can use the site.  As outlined 
            above, for a subset of 12 of the 125 Web sites studied, this was investigated 
            by a user evaluation study.</p>
          <p>The User Panel members succeeded in 76.2% of the attempted tasks for 
            the English museums and 73.3% of attempted tasks for the International 
            comparison museums (see Table 5).  Blind User Panels members had the 
            most difficulty in using the Web sites, succeeding in only 62.5% of 
            their tasks, compared to 82.5% success for partially sighted User Panel 
            members and 83.3% success rate for dyslexic User Panel members.  These 
            success rates compare favourably with the Disability Rights Commission 
            study, which found an overall task success rate of 76%, but only 53% 
            for blind Web site users. (Inferential statistics comparing the different 
            museum and user categories will not be presented in this section, as 
            a factorial design was not employed - not all users assessed all the 
            museums, making such an analysis very difficult with the numbers involved).</p>

          <p class="caption">Table 9: Most frequent accessibility problems from 
            user testing of Web sites</p>
          <p>The 9 problems listed in Table 9 constituted 79% of all the problems 
            uncovered during the user testing evaluations. Over half of these problems 
            relate to orientation and navigation issues. </p>
          <p>It is worth considering the 9 most frequent problems uncovered in more 
            detail to highlight the very real difficulty and frustration experienced 
            by disabled User Panel members, thus preventing them from utilising 
            the full potential of museum Web sites. The problems below are grouped 
            under three separate headings: alternative descriptions for images and 
            other media; issues related to presentation of content; and navigation 
            and orientation problems.</p>
          <h3>Alternative descriptions for images and other media</h3>
          <p>All controls, links and other elements should have clear and informative 
            labels or descriptions associated with them that are both meaningful 
            and add to a user&#39;s understanding. This was not often the case, especially 
            on the International museum Web sites where four of the five sites evaluated 
            carried image description violations, two of them so critical that they 
            rendered the site impossible for a blind person to successfully use. 
            One of these museums even stated that: &#34;<em>Our staff is committed 
            to making the Museum accessible to all&#34;</em> but as one blind User 
            Panel member commented: &#34;...they certainly aren&#39;t with regards 
            to their Web site ... none of the links have Alt tags so I can&#39;t even 
            get past the homepage!&#34;</p>
          <p>This problem not only applies to links, images and pictures, but also 
            to graphical text.  For example, one site used graphical text for their 
            &#39;Accessible Site&#39; link but failed to provide any form of ALT tag to 
            it, therefore blind users were unaware that this option even existed.</p>
          <h3>Issues related to presentation of content </h3>
          <p>Partially sighted and dyslexic User Panel members often found the use 
            of presentation features made text harder to read and understand.  For 
            example, Web sites that include <strong>bold text</strong> within the 
            main content, in a manner that does <strong>not</strong> appear to highlight 
            <strong>specific </strong>information, or convey any extra information, 
            becomes a distraction.  The presentation of the content on a web page 
            needs to be carefully chosen as to aid the user experience and special 
            features limited to headings or key words. </p>
          <p>Many of the complaints from the dyslexic and partially sighted members 
            of the User Panel related to the color scheme and color contrast used 
            for page designs. While some of these complaints were of a purely subjective 
            nature, the color scheme often affected these Panel members abilities 
            to perform tasks, particularly when the contrast between the text and 
            the background was inadequate.  Pale text on pale backgrounds was a 
            common problem.  Moreover, different people benefit from different colour 
            schemes.  For example, while many people are happy with black text on 
            a white background, some partially sighted people find this contrast 
            too &#39;harsh&#39;, and benefit from a very strong inverted contrast such as 
            yellow text on a black background.  On the other hand, dyslexic people 
            often prefer a reduced contrast, with a pastel background.  The ability 
            to easily change the color of text and background allows people to view 
            a page and read its text with presentation combinations that suit their 
            particular needs.</p>
          <h3>Navigation and orientation problems</h3>
          <p align="left">In terms of navigating sites, two key problems emerged.  
            Firstly, ambiguously named links that led to unexpected content were 
            responsible for many of the navigation problems User Panel members encountered.  
            For example, opening times were often found under the link <em>Contact 
            Us</em>.  As one dyslexic User Panel member commented &#34;...important 
            information like opening times and disabled access should not be hidden 
            under other obscure titles... why can&#39;t they just put a link saying 
            <em>Opening Times</em>”.  Secondly, many sites offered inconsistent 
            navigational mechanisms.  Links were not located in navigation bars 
            but dispersed across the page, and icons and images were inconsistently 
            used as active links.</p>
          <p>Poor page design (in terms of layout) led to recurrent orientation 
            problems for all the user groups involved in the evaluations.  Both 
            the experts at City University and the members of the User Panel considered 
            many sites to have overly complex and &#34;cluttered&#34; pages with 
            dense blocks of text.  No clear indication of main headings, secondary 
            headings and so on was a recurring problem throughout the sites evaluated.  
            While sighted people would be able to infer some of this logic from 
            text sizes, colour coding, etc, blind User Panel members did not have 
            access to this visual information and so pages were experienced as &#34;illogical&#34;, 
            apparently lacking a logical structure. </p>
          <h3>Good accessible design features</h3>
          <p>In addition to the specific problems they encountered, the Panel members 
            were also asked to report what they particularly liked about the sites 
            they evaluated. Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of the positive aspects 
            were the opposite of the problems outlined above.  For example, blind 
            Panel members appreciated headings and links marked-up with &#34;sensible 
            names&#34;.  The other user groups appeared to share these sentiments, 
            with Panel members also liking sites that had clear navigation mechanisms, 
            logical page layouts, clear contrast and straight-forward language.</p>
          <h1>Discussion and Conclusions</h1>
          <p align="left">This research has shown that the level of accessibility 
            of English and international museum Web sites is not high.  On technical 
            accessibility, only 30% of English museum sites and 20% of international 
            museum sites passed the basic accessibility Level A, even on the subset 
            of automated tests.  However, when one investigates these finding further, 
            the average museum home page has approximately seven known accessibility 
            problems (Designer measure - mean for English museums 6.8 and for international 
            museums 6.9), which means there are not a large number of problems to 
            be solved.  The calculation of the Design and User measures shows how 
            this relatively small number of different problems can lead to a poor 
            user experience, with an average of approximately 36 instances of known 
            accessibility problems per home page (37.2 for English museums and 35.2 
            for international museums).  </p>
          <p align="left">These findings on technical accessibility are reinforced 
            by the user testing data which found that disabled users could only 
            successfully complete 75% of very basic tasks on the Web sites and 36% 
            of disabled users feeling lost on at least one occasiong.  Blind people 
            in particular found the sites difficult to use with only a 62.5% success 
            rate.  However the user testing data also showed that the number of 
            problems that developers of museum Web sites need to address is not 
            particularly long or difficult to address.  Nearly 80% of all the problems 
            encountered by the disabled users were addressed by nine accessibility 
            issues (see Table 9).  </p>
          <p align="left">Web sites are now an integral part of the public-facing 
            presence of most museums.  Disabled people find information provided 
            on the Web an extremely useful format, if it is provided in ways that 
            are appropriate for them, or allow them to transform the information 
            into appropriate formats such as synthetic speech for visually impaired 
            people.  Currently museum Web sites are not meeting that challenge very 
            well.  However, this research has shown that the issues that need to 
            be addressed to change this situation and provide exemplary digital 
            access to museums are not difficult to meet.</p>
