        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This paper explores the usefulness of the ecology concept as an analytical 
          framework for designing interactive technology in museums. We aim to 
          describe and evaluate an ecological approach to understanding museums 
          and to examine information and cultural ecologies as analytical tools 
          for guiding the design of interactive systems. The paper will be of 
          potential benefit for designers, researchers, developers, and museum 
          administrators with an interest in interactive museum guides. </p>
        <p>We focus on two related concepts of ecology, <em>cultural ecology </em>(Bell 
          2002) and <em>information ecology</em> (Nardi and O&#39;Day 1999). We begin 
          by providing an overview of the role of ecologies in helping designers 
          better understand museums, and an overview of the case study, an ambient 
          intelligence museum guide. The paper then discusses each ecology concept 
          separately. In each case we provide an introduction to the concepts, 
          the relevancy of the concepts to our case study, and an analysis of 
          our design ethnography data or design process based on the ecology frameworks. 
          This is followed by a discussion of design implications of the ecology 
          analysis and its usefulness in describing museums for the design of 
          technology.</p>
        <p>Ambient intelligence computing is the embedding of sensor and display 
          technologies in architectural environments that are supported by artificial 
          intelligence such that the overall system responds and &#39;reasons&#39; 
          about the human actions and behaviours within the environment. The aim 
          is to distribute technology away from people into the surrounding environment 
          in order to better support interactivity. </p>
        <p>The idea of an ecology framework emerged from the research and development 
          of the case study project. Our design was guided by an understanding 
          of information ecologies as an approach to understand appropriate interventions 
          through design in existing social systems such as museums. We had not 
          yet encountered the concept of cultural ecologies but have since found 
          it to be an applicable schema for our design ethnography. In this paper 
          we found that an ecology framework is highly appropriate for representing 
          the complexities of activities, relationships, technologies and people 
          connected to museums. We also found the frameworks support appropriate 
          and localized design decisions in creating interactive systems.</p>
        <h1>Ecologies, Museums and Design</h1>
        <p>Nardi and O&#39;Day&#39;s notion of <em>information ecologies</em> describes 
          a system of people, practices, values, and technologies in a local environment 
          (Nardi and O&#39;Day 1999). They argue that the ecology metaphor shifts 
          the focus to human activity from technology. For example, a library 
          is an ecology for accessing information. It is a space with books, magazines, 
          tapes, films, computers, databases and librarians to help find information. 
          The technology components of the ecology are balanced to shape the environment 
          around human action in accessing information. From the perspective of 
          sociology, Bell has described museums in terms of <em>cultural ecologies 
          </em>(Bell 2002). Both the museum space and museum visit experience 
          are bound by interrelated ecological components. </p>
        <h2>Why Is This Relevant?</h2>
        <p>Our design choices were strongly influenced by the awareness of museums 
          as deeply complex and dynamic spaces. Von Lehn, Heath and Hindmarsh 
          have described museum experiences as <em>multivariate</em>; that is, 
          they cannot be assessed by a single factor such as exhibit design, signage, 
          or time spent in front of an artifact (Lehn, Heath et al. 2001). Instead, 
          the museum experience is subject to multiple influences and results 
          in multiple outcomes. Our design aimed to limit the degree to which 
          we <em>intervened </em>in what is already a complex situation. We attempted 
          to leverage existing actions, localized knowledge, and attributes of 
          a museum. In support of these aims, we chose to develop an ambient intelligent 
          system that utilized an audio display interface, a tangible interface, 
          and a user-model and adaptive information retrieval system.</p>
        <p>The audio display allowed us to provide a virtual context without having 
          to explicitly impose a new visual interface on the museum visitor. We 
          viewed the exhibition space to be made up of existing layers of visual 
          interfaces from the objects themselves, to the didactics, the display 
          cases, and the architecture of the space. The use of a tangible interface 
          allowed us to move between the physical space and the virtual information 
          space. We wanted to minimize the degree to which visitors had to learn 
          something new in an environment where they were already learning interface 
          conventions such as display cases, didactics and the exhibition itself. 
          We aimed for the information the visitors received to be both responsive 
          to them as well as specific to the knowledge and practices of museums 
          – the locale of the experience.</p>
        <p>The ecological model allows us to look further into the design process, 
          past the interface, for guidance in our design intervention. Our aim 
          is to examine the degree to which we as designers understand the museum 
          as an existing ecology, thus capturing it in its <em>multivariate</em> 
          state. A second goal is to examine how integral our design decisions 
          were to the ecology or ecology inhabitants, thus developing appropriate 
          design responses.</p>
        <h2>Case Study</h2>
        <p>The case-study is of the design process for an ambient intelligent 
          museum guide known as <em>ec(h)o </em>(Wakkary, Newby et al. 2003; Hatala, 
          Kalantari et al. 2004). The prototype is an integrated audio, vision 
          and location tracking system installed as an augmentation of an existing 
          exhibition installation. <em>ec(h)o</em> is designed to create a museum 
          experience that consists of a physical installation and an interactive 
          layer of three-dimensional soundscapes physically mapped to museum displays 
          and the exhibition installation. Each soundscape consists of zones of 
          ambient sound and <em>soundmarks</em> generated by dynamic audio data 
          that relate to the artifacts the visitor is experiencing. The soundscapes 
          change based on the position of the visitor in the space, the visitor&#39;s 
          history with viewing the artifacts, and their individual interests in 
          relation to the museum collection. Through a tangible interface, a wooden 
          cube, the visitor can interact with a single artifact or multiple artifacts 
          in order to listen to related audio information. The audio delivery 
          is dynamic and generated by agent-assisted searches inferred by past 
          interactions, histories and individual interests (Hatala, Kalantari 
          et al. 2004). The prototype was installed and tested in the <em>Finders 
          Keepers </em>exhibition at the Canadian Museum of Nature. The exhibition 
          theme was collecting natural history artifacts in Canada.</p>
        <p>In this paper we discuss aspects of the design process behind the development 
          of the prototype. Many of the design choices for implementation were 
          driven by a series of participatory design workshops and scenarios, 
          details of which have been written in another paper (Wakkary 2005). 
          Our particular attention here is on our design ethnography data and 
          an analysis of our collaborative design with the staff members of the 
          museum. We examine the data we retrieved and the documentation of the 
          process through the ecological frameworks.</p>

        <h1>The Museum as Cultural Ecology</h1>
        <p>The anthropologist Genevieve Bell has described museums in terms of 
          <em>cultural ecologies</em> (Bell 2002). As an ecology, the museum space 
          and experience are bound by interrelated components and attributes of 
          the given museum ecology. For example, Bell identifies three significant 
          components of all museum ecologies, <em>liminality</em>, <em>engagement</em> 
          and <em>sociality</em>. <strong>Liminality</strong> defines museums 
          as places that embody an experience apart from everyday life – 
          as such, the experience can be transforming. <strong>Engagement</strong> 
          defines museums as places where people go to learn, often in an entertaining 
          and exploratory way. <strong>Sociality </strong>defines museums as social 
          places for groups such as pairs and families:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           <strong>Liminality:</strong> A museum visit is 
            liminal in that it is experientially set apart from everyday life. 
            Positive museum experiences are transformative, spiritual, and moving. 
            A museum visitor should be inclined to pause and reflect. Liminality 
            permits a deeper engagement. </li>
        <li> 
           <strong>Sociality</strong>: People attend museums 
            in groups such as couples, families, classes, friends, and dates. 
            Museums have become social spaces; for example, supporting elements 
            of this include cafes, gift shops, and lobby spaces. Museums are seen 
            as safe places for families. They often include games and are designed 
            to guide supported activities that increase the interaction between 
            parents, children and artifacts.</li>
        <li> 
           <strong>Engagement: </strong>People go to museums 
            to learn. This engagement is often packaged in an entertaining way; 
            for example, museums are increasingly viewed as tourist destinations. 
            Museums are a balance between learning and entertainment spaces.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>Bell sees the museum visit as a ritual determined by space, people 
          and design. She decomposes the visiting ritual into three observational 
          categories: space, visitors, and interactions and rituals. Altogether 
          the ritual has design implications in relation to technology. Among 
          the different museum ecologies Bell has described, she outlines two 
          museum ecologies: <em>art museum ecologies</em> and <em>science museum 
          ecologies</em>. These ecologies are seen to be distinct and supportive 
          of very different kinds of museum visits. In order to better understand 
          the specific nature and differences among the ecologies, we&#39;ve compared 
          Bell&#39;s analysis of the two museum ecologies (see Table 1).</p>

        <p>In our case study, a natural history museum, it became evident that 
          it closely followed the science museum ecologies. For example, the attributes 
          of space were explicitly instructional, provoked play, and often demanded 
          interaction.</p>
        <h2>Relevant Aspects Of A Cultural Ecology For Our Case-Study</h2>
        <p>Not unlike Bell, we observed the Canadian Nature Museum visitors through 
          traditional ethnographic techniques. While we had a different and more 
          descriptive schema for analysis, we found that all our data fit well 
          in Bell&#39;s ecology components. The design implications of the science 
          museum ecology are directly in line with our own assumptions coming 
          in to the project. Yet we had not systematically connected these assumptions 
          to our observations as Bell&#39;s framework does.</p>
        <h2>Analysis Of Our Case Utilizing Cultural Ecologies</h2>
        <p>What follows is a summary analysis of some of the observational data 
          we collected based on the cultural Bell&#39;s science museum ecologies&#39; 
          framework.</p>
        <h3>Visitors</h3>
        <p>Many examples of diversity in visitors and visit rituals reported by 
          Bell were indeed observed in our own study. For example, the cultural 
          diversity of visitors noted in the science museum ecologies was found 
          in our observations, particularly across student and tourist visitors. 
          Bell states that in contrast to art museums, &#34;science museum ecologies 
          seem to teem with activity and noise&#34; (Bell 2002 p. 11). It is 
          clear from both Bell&#39;s observations and our own that this can be attributed 
          to the large number of children and teenaged visitors to science museums. 
          Bell observes a strong presence of middle school and high school students. 
          This was in keeping with our own analysis; however visitors were typically 
          on the younger end of the range (between 8 -14 years of age), and often 
          as groups on school field trips. Though visiting as part of a large 
          group, these visitors often fragmented into smaller groups and clearly 
          enjoyed a level of autonomy - running, jumping, speaking loudly, laughing, 
          and exploring the space as if it were a playground, despite the accompaniment 
          of adult teachers; for example see figure 2 (below). This speaks to 
          the safe social spaces that museums have become. Similarly aged visitors 
          were observed as members of families. Despite parental supervision, 
          the playful nature of the visit ritual was only slightly more tempered. 
        </p>
        <p>Most of the adults observed in the museum space were younger or middle 
          aged, with few instances of elderly visitors. Most adults were observed 
          as couples or parents, with their typical visitation ritual being a 
          quiet, semi-absorbed inspection of the space. This contrast between 
          the adult ritual and the youth ritual was noted both by Bell and ourselves. 
        </p>
        <p>Like Bell, we observed very few instances of individual visitors. Although 
          visitor groups dominated, we did note many instances of individual exploration. 
          In these instances members of a group would venture off, explore the 
          space for experiences of interest, and then report back to the group 
          their discoveries. The younger visitors in particular seemed to enjoy 
          this pattern of interaction. We made note of numerous instances where 
          groups of students would disperse and come back together, or younger 
          members of a family would explore and report back to their parents.

        <p class="caption">Figure 2. The Finders Keepers exhibition at the Canadian 
          Nature Museum.</p>
        <h3>Space</h3>
        <p>Strong similarities between Bell&#39;s ecologies and our observations occur 
          in other categories as well. For example, Bell&#39;s discussions of space 
          and displays matched our observations. Bell argues that displays and 
          installations tend to be demanding of the visitors&#39; attention. We found 
          these characteristics in the four exhibitions we analyzed. For example, 
          in the mammals exhibit was a series of dioramas depicting animals in 
          their natural habitat. In addition to the visual scene, the dioramas 
          were accompanied by ambient sound effects, a detailed didactic, and 
          at least two tactile artifacts; such as fur samples, hoof imprints, 
          and horns busts, relevant to the mammal on display.</p>
        <p>Another key characteristic of Bell&#39;s ecologies is that installations 
          in science museums are explicitly educational. Bell reminds us that 
          this differs from art museum ecologies where information tends to be 
          sparse and the aim is to facilitate interpretation over education. Our 
          observations noted numerous instances of explicit educational and instructional 
          approaches to the information design of the displays. For example, in 
          the <em>Creepy Critters</em> exhibit, living specimens in terrariums 
          and aquariums were supported by graphical representations on didactics 
          coupled with a short paragraph on each species. This information was 
          further supported by a collection of nearby reading materials (books, 
          magazines, species sheets) related to the display. </p>
        <h3>Interactions and Rituals</h3>
        <p>The displays and installations revealed diverse forms of interaction: 
          microscopes with adjustable slide wheels that could be turned to explore 
          different specimens; wooden puzzles which, once completed, would fall 
          apart at the pull of a handle, creating a loud crashing sound that captured 
          the attention of others; a collecting game called <em>The Rat Pack Challenge</em> 
          which tasked visitors to search the room and discern collectable artifacts 
          from non-collectable ones; discovery drawers filled with objects like 
          fossils, fur pelts, and minerals which visitors could touch and inspect 
          at close range; push button audio and video installations; scale models 
          and artist recreations of dinosaurs that people could walk up to and 
          touch; terrariums and aquariums filled with living specimens; magazines, 
          coloring books, and a small library of natural history artifacts that 
          were lent to students. </p>

        <p class="caption">Fig 3: Full-scale wooden puzzle that, once completed, 
          would create loud crashing sounds at the pull of a lever (on the left)</p>
        <p>Bell notes that an attribute of science museum ecologies is to support 
          the fact that people learn in a variety of ways. Alternative approaches 
          to learning turned up throughout our observations. Examples include 
          interactive puzzles, quizzes, and games that require visitors to explore 
          and think about the artifacts being displayed; multimedia stations provided 
          for deeper investigation into a topic or subject area; and dioramas 
          and immersive displays allowing visitors to imagine through visual simulations 
          of historical periods.</p>
        <h1>Museum as Information Ecology</h1>
        <p>Bell&#39;s ethnographic efforts focused on observational experiences of 
          the museum visit. Anthropologists Bonnie Nardi and Vicki O&#39;Day draw 
          on activity theory (Vygotsky 1925/1982; Nardi 1996) and field studies 
          of technology libraries, virtual worlds, an architectural firm, high 
          schools and a teaching hospital in order to develop their concept<em> 
          information ecologies</em>. The concept they describe strives for a 
          more systematic view of organizations, based on the relationships among 
          people, practices, technology, values and locale.</p>
        <p>Nardi and O&#39;Day use the concept of ecology to critique current understandings 
          of technology as autonomous. The authors aim to reframe the metaphoric 
          underpinnings of certain views of technology such as <em>technology 
          as a tool</em>, <em>technology as text</em>, and <em>technology as system</em>. 
          They argue for a more complex understanding of interdependent elements 
          and influences of which technology is only one part; a view that holds 
          a sense of urgency due to opposing possible outcomes of entropy and 
          failure or growth and dynamism. Constituent elements of information 
          ecologies include system, diversity, co-evolution, keystone species, 
          and locality: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>System:</strong> Information ecologies are distinct through 
          their strong relationships and dependencies among the different parts. 
          The parts may be different, yet they are complimentary and extend each 
          other in capabilities. Change can also be seen to be systemic; when 
          one part changes, it affects all others.</li>
        <li>
           <strong>Diversity: </strong>As in a biological 
            ecology, different species thrive in different niches in the ecology. 
            The complex interdependencies ensure that many different kinds of 
            roles and functions exist. An information ecology contains a diverse 
            set of people, activities and technologies. It in fact relies on diversity 
            in order to successfully respond to change and potential chaos.</li>
        <li><strong>Co-evolution:</strong> Parts of the information ecology adapt 
          to each other or co-evolve as change occurs, only to be reintegrated 
          later. The ecology is always balancing the various toeholds of co-evolving 
          parts.</li>
        <li>
           <strong>Keystone Species: </strong>Ecologies 
            are marked by the presence of certain keystone species whose presence 
            is crucial to the survival of the ecology itself. Often such species 
            take the role of mediators who bridge institutional boundaries and 
            translate across disciplines. Introduction of new technologies in 
            an ecology is often reliant on mediators who shape tools to fit local 
            circumstances. </li>
        <li><strong>Locality</strong>: The participants within the ecology aid 
          in giving identity and place to things. For example, the <em>habitation</em> 
          of technology provides us with a set of relationships within the ecology: 
          to whom a machine belongs determines the family of relationships connected 
          to the technology. We all have special knowledge about our own local 
          ecologies; it is inaccessible to anyone outside, thus giving us local 
          influence on change. Only those who are integral to the ecology can 
          provide a local habitation and name to technology. </li>
      </ul>
      
        <h2>Relevant Aspects Of An Information Ecology For Our Case-Study</h2>
        <p>Can an information ecology understanding of a museum positively inform 
          our design process and outcome? In our design approach, we contextualized 
          our efforts within the concept of information ecologies. That is, we 
          looked at the Canadian Nature Museum as an information ecology, and 
          even further, actively sought out keystone species for localized knowledge. 
          One assumption of ours was that we were intervening at the level of 
          the individual museum visitor at a scale and form that was appropriate. 
          Nardi and O&#39;Day argue that information ecologies are scaled to individuals, 
          and through considering the issue at this scale we can find individual 
          points of leverage, ways into the system, and avenues of intervention.</p>
        <p>What follows is a summative reflection, through the lens of information 
          ecologies, of our collaboration in the design of our prototype with 
          the Canadian Nature Museum and its staff.</p>
        <h2>Analysis Of Our Case Utilizing An Information Ecology Framework</h2>
        <p>Our observations within the museum and the formal and informal sessions 
          with museum staff were guided by our understanding of information ecologies. 
          Our design goals lead us to this process and in many respects the experience 
          validated for us the applicability of the framework to an organization 
          like a museum. In table 2 (see below), we have provided a matrix analysis 
          of our observations. In order to provide more detail to our findings 
          we&#39;ve summarized a few key dimensions of the ecology including <em>diversity, 
          co-evolution</em>, and <em>locality</em>.</p>

        as an information ecology</p>
        <h3>Diversity</h3>
        <p>Visits with the museum staff, as well as observations of the exhibition 
          spaces, indicated a high level of diversity of people involved with 
          the museum. The visitor population was clearly diverse. We observed 
          a range across groupings, ages, ethnicity and gender, including young 
          students with teachers, college students, middle-aged tourists, large 
          and small families, and young couples. Among the staff, the range of 
          roles and functions at the museum is broad, including scientists, security 
          personnel, office administrators, cafeteria workers, finance and administration 
          personnel, archivists, media producers, 3D modelers, designers, and 
          facilities personnel.</p>
        <p>An outgrowth of the museum&#39;s staffing needs is that the institution 
          demonstrated an equally diverse set of practices. This is exemplified 
          in the list of service departments found within the museum: corporate 
          services, collection services, communication services, community services, 
          exhibition services, finance, human resources, information services, 
          library services, and research services. </p>
        <p>Further support of our use of an information ecology framework was 
          the different values that emerged from interviews with museum staff. 
          These differences appeared across and within departments. For example, 
          among the values we found were <em>scientific credibility, safety, security, 
          entertainment, education, accessibility, affordability, preservation, 
          longevity, bilingualism, community involvement, collaborative learning, 
          </em>and<em> distance learning</em>.</p>
        <p>Finally, it was clear from our observations, interviews and tour of 
          the collections and exhibition facilities that a wide range of technologies 
          was employed. The types of technology varied from highly specialized 
          to general solutions, and from technically sophisticated to simple. 
          Observed technologies ranged from advanced 3D scanning equipment used 
          to digitize artifacts for Web exhibitions, to acid free collection boxes 
          used to preserve beetle specimens, to motion detectors for artifact 
          security within the exhibits, to a jar of water employed to maintain 
          humidity in an elephant skull exhibit case. </p>

        <p class="BlockQuote">information ecologies evolve as new ideas, tools, 
          activities, and forms of expertise arrive in them...parts of the 
          system adapt to each other or co-evolve as newer, faster, and different 
          tools, are integrated repeatedly . . . ( p. 52).</p>
        <p> In our work with the museum we observed numerous instances of co-evolution. 
        </p>
        <p>During one of our visits we were given a tour and demonstration of 
          the museum&#39;s recently purchased 3D scanning technology. It was explained 
          that this technology with an entirely new department was meant to support 
          the museum&#39;s mandate to provide Internet access to the collection for 
          the general public and research community. Such an investment in technology, 
          as well as the staff to support it, exemplified the sort of co-evolution 
          described by Nardi and O&#39;Day. Clearly the Internet and changing imaging 
          technologies impinged upon the museum, resulting in the decision to 
          adopt new tools in order to respond to these changes. </p>
        <p>During our formal and informal sessions with staff, we encountered 
          great excitement over major renovations planned for the museum&#39;s exhibition 
          facility. The museum&#39;s exhibition design team discussed upgrades to 
          exhibits and possible new technologies to support the upgrades. Such 
          future possibilities and a new mandate for interactive technology use 
          seemed to genuinely increase the excitement and interest around the 
          museum in new interactive technologies and, in particular, our project. 
          The significant focus on future spaces and interactive exhibits resulted 
          in lessening interest or attention to existing displays and exhibits. 
        </p>
        <p>While parts of the system change and create new momentum, other parts 
          find themselves in stasis. For example, we observed significant disparities 
          in the adoption of new technologies across the ecology. Use and adoption 
          of new technologies and supporting practices appeared to flourish behind 
          the public face of the museum in areas such as the administration offices, 
          research facilities, and collections/storage facilities. Conversely, 
          there was a noticeable lack of new technology adoption in the public 
          exhibition spaces. Similarly, the archives department of the museum 
          had yet to respond through new practices or technologies to issues of 
          access and media format. For example, it was very difficult to access 
          in any indexical form the vast collection of field recordings the archive 
          held. The outmoded and heterogeneous types of analog media of the archival 
          objects further complicated things.</p>
        <h3>Locality</h3>
        <p>Nardi and O&#39;Day argue that we all have special knowledge about our 
          own local ecologies and that this knowledge tends to be inaccessible 
          to anyone who exists outside of that ecology. In addition, the habitation 
          of a technology will always be an outgrowth of its location within a 
          network of relationships. For example, understanding to whom an artifact 
          is connected or belongs sheds light on other relationships and aspects 
          of local participation, local engagement, or local conditions unique 
          to specific settings.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
        <p>During a formal interview session with one of the collection managers, 
          we found that that an absorbent flooring and sheet plastic we had observed 
          under a collection of invertebrate jars was in fact a low budget conservation 
          technique. The action guarded against potential spills caused by temporary 
          construction in an adjacent exhibit. In the same interview we discovered 
          that a jar of water in an elephant skull case was a highly successful 
          yet inexpensive solution for managing the humidity needs of that specimen. 
        </p>
        <p>We recorded numerous instances where a staff member&#39;s localized knowledge 
          transformed a collection of artifacts from opaque and dull to interesting. 
          For example, one of the scientists we interviewed was a paleo-anthropologist. 
          Her knowledge was highly specialized; the information and insights she 
          passed on during the interview were valuable in that they gave life 
          to what was a static display of bones. She provided engaging stories 
          that connected the archaeological artifacts (animal bones) to the history 
          and living practices of an ancient Inuit people. In addition, she provided 
          details and explanation of the forensic process of sorting and analyzing 
          the artifacts that she herself had performed.</p>
        <h1>Discussion</h1>
        <p>The cultural ecologies framework validated many of our design goals. 
          The fact that our observations fit nearly completely with Bell&#39;s description 
          of science museum ecologies strongly validated our own assumptions. 
          In addition, one of our key assumptions mapped directly to Bell&#39;s design 
          implications, which are formally linked to the ecologies, e.g.;</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">technologies need to support existing interactions 
          and create the possibilities for others conditioned by the visitor expectation 
          that this interaction will be engaging and dynamic&#34; (Bell 2002 
          p.12).</p>
        <p>We therefore aimed to integrate our solution within the wide range 
          of low-technology interactive solutions, and to keep our prototype playful, 
          and above all, accessible to the museum visitor. Our observations that 
          fall within Bell&#39;s categorization of <em>interaction and ritual</em> 
          emphasized that our system should be open to multiple forms of input, 
          such as movement and physical interaction with the displays, and responsive 
          to different learning styles. In many respects, our prototype became 
          a virtual extension of the exhibition space and acted as an augmentation 
          to the didactics and other learning materials.</p>
        <p>Information ecologies informed early conceptualizing of the project 
          and specifically guided design decisions at later points. For example, 
          our understanding of the <em>co-evolution</em> dynamics of the ecology 
          led us to consider our prototype as a complementary influence. Co-evolutionary 
          trends that we identified included a strong investment in visual technologies 
          to support access to the collection and new approaches to exhibition 
          design. We saw the opportunity to contribute an alternative approach 
          to interactive display based on audio. We also saw the chance to give 
          form to the intellectual knowledge of the museum staff in addition to 
          the embodied knowledge of the artifacts. </p>
        <p>Another example of how the information ecology understanding guided 
          a design decision arose out the issues of <em>locality</em> and <em>keystone 
          species</em>. This<em> </em>led to a novel approach to content design 
          and development. In our earlier discussion on <em>locality, </em>we 
          commented on our numerous observations of informal yet engaging delivery 
          of specialized knowledge on behalf of the museum researchers. The majority 
          of these types of exchanges happened as we toured the collections and 
          storage facility. Stories connected to artifacts ranged from anecdotes 
          about where the artifact was found and how cold it was at the time or 
          how difficult the terrain was, to stories of the difficulties of mold-making 
          on site or humorous tales of transportation and objects temporarily 
          getting lost, to what the objects tell us, or how their meaning has 
          changed. Often these were first hand accounts and discussed in the most 
          informal and wide-ranging manner. Factual or thesis driven accounts 
          of artifacts were mixed with anecdotal and humorous tales related to 
          the discovery, processing or research of the actual artifact. This experience 
          deeply struck us since our shared perception of the public exhibition 
          display space was quite the opposite. Not unlike many exhibitions, the 
          artifacts and contextualizing information appeared static and lifeless. 
          In locality terms, it was evident to us that once the artifacts were 
          connected to people, the understanding of these artifacts became deeply 
          connected to all aspects of the ecology and came out in the form of 
          storytelling that covered activities related to the artifact, conservation, 
          storage, research and display technologies, meaning and values associated 
          with the artifacts – all situated in specific contexts of time 
          and place. </p>
        <p>The exhibition facility and the collections/storage facilities were 
          geographically quite far apart. The collections/storage facilities also 
          housed the research facilities. It was evident that on a large level, 
          two distinct ecologies were forming. The ecologies of the research and 
          collections facilities were more dynamic, involving present day practices 
          and perhaps greater informational exchange around the artifacts and 
          specimens. One goal in the design was to bridge the gap between the 
          ecologies with the goal of bringing more life to the artifacts on display. 
          We aimed to model our information delivery and audio experience on the 
          informal storytelling manner we had experienced. We aimed to create 
          a virtual cocktail party of natural history scientists to accompany 
          the visitor through the museum.</p>
        <p>We identified the scientist collectors as our <em>keystone species</em>. 
          Our content development process centered on formal interview sessions 
          with staff, a majority of whom were scientist collectors, followed by 
          a walkthrough of the exhibition space captured on video (Wakkary, Newby 
          et al. 2004). In the first session, we asked that they speak generally 
          about what they do and how it relates to artifacts at the museum. We 
          aimed to elicit the range of storytelling we had encountered earlier. 
          In the walkthrough sessions we asked them to speak to the artifacts 
          as well as the exhibition display in the exhibition. These sessions 
          became the basis for discrete audio objects that were categorized by 
          topics and relationship to artifacts on display. In our prototype our 
          system reasoned on possible objects the visitors might want to hear 
          based on their previous interests, movement and interactions in the 
          exhibition. In the end, it was very much like a virtual cocktail party, 
          especially since we strove to maintain a diversity of delivery in language 
          styles and voices. </p>
        <p>We come to ecologies as designers who use ethnographic techniques and 
          concepts to better our designs. Our aim is twofold: first, to best understand 
          the complexity of the people and context that make up our design situation; 
          second, to leverage the role of participant observer into a collaborative 
          design relationship through direct collaboration or our informed representation 
          of the stakeholders for whom we design. For our purposes, both ecological 
          frameworks served our goals despite their strong differences. Bell&#39;s 
          descriptive framework the <em>cultural ecologies</em> formally linked 
          different actions and attributes of the museum visitor into a coherent 
          system. As a descriptive tool it validated our assumptions and provided 
          a clearer link between what we observed and the design implications. 
          We could see it being useful at the early stages of the design process 
          as an ethnographic schema and initial framing of the design situation. 
          Nardi and O&#39;Day&#39;s <em>information ecologies</em> framework was generative 
          as well as descriptive. The framework helped generate design decisions 
          such as the goal to make accessible the local knowledge within the organization, 
          as well as supporting our design aim of developing a complementary approach 
          to the organization&#39;s current use of technology.</p>
        <p>More generally, our findings are that ecologies effectively capture 
          in a formal and systematic manner the museum experience and the organization 
          itself. The evidence for the information ecologies is tied to our design 
          outcome and process as we&#39;ve detailed extensively in this paper. Bell&#39;s 
          cultural ecologies supported almost all of our observations and insights. 
        </p>
        <p>It is important to note, however, that although Bell&#39;s science museum 
          ecologies mapped directly to our observations, some important characteristics 
          did not. Despite Bell&#39;s observations of a high adoption rate of interactive 
          technology, we found with the exception of video kiosks and push button 
          audio stations, very few technology driven interactive elements were 
          found in our analysis of the museum. Interactivity not mediated through 
          computer technology was common and took the form of puzzles, games, 
          microscopes, and touch-me artifacts. The distinction between a science 
          museum and natural history museum may be a result of differing disciplines 
          and therefore different levels of receptivity to technology; yet one 
          might expect differences in other attributes of the ecology to occur 
          as well.</p>
        <p>Our analysis of the ecologies is only evidenced in a single sample 
          of one institution. Our visitations and interviews occurred over three 
          separate trips, each lasting between one to three days. We would like 
          to pursue future research in other museums over slightly longer periods 
          of time. In addition, we would eventually like to return to the Canadian 
          Nature Museum after the renovations to the new space and perform another 
          formal study to look for shifts in the ecologies.</p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>At a time when museums are undergoing change and adopting new interactive 
          technologies, the ecological frameworks we&#39;ve discussed in this paper 
          are deserving of greater evaluation. Both <em>cultural ecologies</em> 
          and <em>information ecologies</em> focus on technology use within the 
          ecologies and therefore have specialized functions in understanding 
          museums today. As designers, we found these two approaches supported 
          design goals and contributed to the making of key design decisions. 
          The ecologies provided us an in-depth understanding of the museum visit 
          experience and the organization.</p>
        <p>The cultural ecologies framework validated many of our design goals. 
          Our observations fit nearly completely with Bell&#39;s description of science 
          museum ecologies with the exception of the museum&#39;s use of computer 
          technology for interactive displays. We could see using the framework 
          as an ethnographic schema in future museum projects.</p>
        <p>As designers, the information ecology provided us with deep and multiple 
          views of the organization and the people connected to it. Like ethnography 
          in design, ecologies have a role in the design process, one that can 
          guide design decisions in addition to systematically providing a descriptive 
          understanding of the design situation. In our particular case, our design 
          was guided by our findings of <em>locality</em>, <em>keystone species</em>, 
          and <em>co-evolution</em>.</p>
        <p>Our case-study analysis suggests that ecological frameworks can be 
          effective descriptive tools, and in certain instances generative tools 
          as well. Future research includes additional formal studies of museums 
          as well as a study in the shift of ecologies over time.</p>
