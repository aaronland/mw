      <h1>Taxonomies Of New Media Art – Real World Namings </h1>
      <h2>Beryl Graham, University of Sunderland, United Kingdom</h2>
      <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">This paper provides an outline of 
            current taxonomies, categories and critical vocabularies for new media 
            art or digital art. The examples are drawn from real-world art contexts, 
            including the new-media curating discussion list.  The relationships 
            between namings and the practical considerations of funding and institutional 
            roles of arts institutions are examined. Particular institutions include 
            San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and artworks include <em>University</em><em> 
            of </em><em>Openess</em><em> [sic]</em>. Conclusions on useful taxonomies 
            include the<em> characteristics </em>of<em> </em>Interactivity, Connectivity, 
            and Computability (Dietz), and &#34;Medium-Independent Behaviours&#34; 
        (Variable Media).</p>

      <h1>Taxonomies Of New Media Art – Real World Namings</h1>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> &#34;...I often groan when the issue 
        comes up ...&#34; (Dietz, 30 Sep 2004) </p>
      <p>Taxonomies of new media art are a notoriously dry and gnarly issue 
            for curators and others working in the field where simple definitions 
            are in short supply. However, when these namings and categories are 
            reflected upon in the context of real-world effects on funding, exhibition 
            and institutional structures, the subject becomes a living issue, rather 
        than &#34;a dusty and boring place&#34; (Midboe, 2004).</p>
      <p>Surely, the particularly &#39;fluid&#39; and &#39;new&#39; characteristics of new media 
            are the whole point – won&#39;t any new medium be necessarily disruptive 
            of safe categories, and perhaps even more inherently worrying to the 
            departmental territories of arts institutions?  With this in mind, the 
            examples used here attempt to be led by the art itself. This paper presents 
            some current working categories, and looks at how the definitions are 
            affecting the way  the art is shown.  Starting with some basic namings, 
            some more complex categories from the real world of art are explored. 
            The paper draws from a chapter on taxonomies written for a book <em>Theorizing 
            Digital Cultural Heritage</em> (Graham, 2005-), and adds new material 
            from a discussion list theme of September 2004 concerning taxonomies 
        (CRUMB, 2004).  </p>
      <h1>Basic definitions  </h1>
      <p class="BlockQuote">But, in all cases, I would never limit &#34;new 
            media&#34; to &#34;digital technology&#34; for two reasons. One is, 
            that analog electrical technology did change the paradigm of time-based 
            art already a long time ago - and the introduction of formal and technical 
            parameters implemented with electricity into the arts (gates, on-off, 
            chaotic behavior, feedback, projection of images, loudspeakers etc.) 
            is the basis for all digital technology and has had similar revolutionary 
            consequences for the arts as digital technology during the past 50 years. 
            And the second reason is that all digital signals have to be converted 
            to analog signals before our senses/we can perceive them - we cannot 
        create sense without this conversion. (Goebel, 2004)</p>
      <p>The history of the field has included the namings of &#34;computer 
            art&#34;, &#34;cybernetic art&#34;, &#34;unstable media&#34;, &#34;emergent 
            media&#34;, or art &#34;that you can plug in&#34; (Gere, 2002; V2, 
            2002; Graham, 2002a). Each has a variable meaning in itself, and very 
            much depends on its historical period and the background of the author, 
            be that art, science or cultural studies (Gere, 2002; Packer and Jordan, 
            2001; Cook, 2004). Lev Manovich (2001) has even argued that we are now 
        &#34;post-media&#34; and that the categories that best describe the 
            characteristics of post-digital art concern user behaviour and data 
        organisation rather than medium <em>per se</em>. </p>
      <p>To very briefly summarise, namings in common current use tend to settle 
            around &#34;digital art&#34; or &#34;new media art&#34;. The former 
            tends to have a very broad definition of any art using digital technology, 
            and tends to be more inclusive of art/science or art/technology approaches. 
        &#34;New media art&#34; tends to have its roots in the art traditions 
            of video or lens media, but is prone to confusion with the commercial 
            new media (interactive quiz shows and the like). This name, of course, 
            may itself date relatively quickly, but is used here as the accepted 
        art-world term.</p>
      <p>To start with a definition of &#39;new media art&#39;, my own working definition 
            is art made with, and for, digital media, including the Internet or 
            computer-controlled installations. These definitions of digital art 
            will therefore be considered through the wider lens of categories from 
        the word of art. <strong> </strong> </p>
      <h2>Should We Taxonomize? </h2>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Classification is always a form of power! (Berry 
        Slater, 2004)</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Perhaps it would be constructive to look at the 
            general reasons why artists choose to work with the systems they do 
            rather than seek to refine language distinct from practice. (Biggs, 
        2004)</p>
      <p>Shulgin and Goruniova explain it like this: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Art naturally resists classification, but is nevertheless 
            always classified and labeled when presented at, for example, exhibitions 
            and festivals. By using the familiar interface of an online software 
            database, Runme.org could play with the idea of storing, classifying, 
            labeling, collecting, while at the same time taking advantage of the 
            democratic possibilities of open databases. [from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.runme.org/about.tt2">http://www.runme.org/about.tt2</a>] 
        (Dietz, 30 Sep 2004)</p>
      <p>On the CRUMB discussion list, debate raged on the dangers and usefulness 
            of taxonomies, namings and mappings. The hierarchical power structures 
            of conventional taxonomies are very obvious, and were compared thoughtfully 
            to the working clarity of common meanings and to the possibilities for 
        alternative mappings, or the question of</p>
      <p>&#34;… how we can create counter cartographies of the relations between 
            and among them that aren&#39;t controlled only by those with certain kinds 
            of power.” (Dietz, 7 Sep 2004). The primacy of the art practice was 
            a primary conclusion from the debate, both as a starting point for conventional 
            taxonomies, and as a playful tool in the hands of artists who deal with 
            data themselves. As mentioned by Dietz above, artists such as Alexei 
            Shulgin have used the inherently participative potential of on-line 
            mapping and definition tools to challenge static taxonomies. Furtherfield 
            (2004) has also made collective naming tools, and the artist Saul Albert 
            collaborated on setting up a “Faculty of Taxonomy” within the <em>University</em><em> 
            of </em><em>Openess</em> [sic], which uses Wiki Web sites to gather 
            tools and collections concerning taxonomy both academic and imaginative. 
            Alternatively, less participative tools can map and make visible: David 
            Rokeby&#39;s <em>Giver of Names</em> involves a computer connected to a 
            camera, which, when shown an object, assigns a name which is sometimes 
            illuminating, but often simply illustrative of the fascinating absurdity 
            of machine logic; Josh On&#39;s <em>They Rule</em>, alternatively, maps 
            the existing hierarchies of corporate animals.  As Spencer Roberts points 
        out, these playful approaches can have serious taxonomic applications.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">It is interesting to look at Duchampian strategies 
            (signing/annotating objects - or playing with the formal context of 
        exhibition) as a kind of subversive taxonomical practice. [...]</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">I think that the key point with respect to a taxonomy 
            is whether we choose to view it as a means of capturing a concept (the 
            essentialist/reductive approach) or whether we choose to view it as 
            a kind of reading‚ (a more playful, pluralistic approach). (Roberts, 
        2004)</p>
      <p>One of the key characteristics peculiar to new media is the &#39;immateriality&#39; 
            or otherwise of digital media (Cook, 2005), which is shared to a certain 
            extent by the history of conceptual art. This does present particular 
            challenges to conventional object-based taxonomies, but also perhaps 
        makes the namings more important philosophically.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Charlie defends taxonomies because of the threat 
            of disappearance (the ultimate &#34;invisibility&#34;) of the art 
            object, of an art (or not art) which, living in electrons, is both here 
        and not here. (Turner, 2004)</p>
      <p>In very practical terms, the argument as to whether to taxonomise comes 
            to rest on the question of how &#39;the future audience&#39; comes to understand 
            the field, which is a fate common to all art forms, whether they are 
        material or not: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">The point of course is that the Tate or any other 
            institution cannot act otherwise. There is no privileged access to the 
            history of art or any other form of cultural activity, except through 
            material traces, and that making any sense of this, such as in a museum, 
            gallery or archive, requires making decisions, choices, about which 
            traces to preserve, which in turn necessarily involves exclusion as 
        well as inclusion. (Gere, 2004)</p>
      <h1>Where Are You Coming From?</h1>
      <p class="BlockQuote">I think that &#34;media art&#34; as &#34;time 
            based&#34; art can benefit from looking at the performing arts (which 
            have always been time-based) and specifically at music since music and 
        technology have been wed for around 130 years ... (Goebel, 4 Sep 2004)</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">As long as processing in real time was not available, 
            data always had to be stored intermediately somewhere on skin, wax, 
            clay, stone, papyrus, linen, paper, wood, or on the cerebral cortex 
        - in order to be transmitted or otherwise processed. (Gere, 6 Sep 2004)</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">… The orthodoxy appears to be to establish historical 
            analogies with emergent practices. This seems useful but often too loosely 
            applied - like Manovich&#39;s &#39;language of new media&#39; reduced to cinema. 
        (Cox, 2004)</p>
      <p>Because digital technologies reach across multi-media boundaries, how 
            new media is understood of course depends upon the history through which 
            it is viewed. Hence music, computer history, or cinema may be a way 
            of making sense of it, or, in the case of Michael Rush&#39;s book <em>New 
            media in late 20th-century art </em>(1999<em>)</em>, performance and 
            performance art form the starting chapter of the book. As well as theorists, 
            curators tend to arrive with pre-existing experience of existing art 
            forms, and curators who have developed an interest in new media often 
            come from a background in lens media, like  Steve Dietz (photography) 
            or Barbara London (film and video). With the question of where the understanding 
            is coming from is the obvious question of whether any one old definition 
            can adequately cover the essential characteristics of the range of new 
        media and whether historical understandings can cover future developments:</p>
      <p>In the context of the latest iteration of transmediale and the removal 
            of categories, my concern at the time was that the removal of the &#39;software&#39; 
            category would lose the critical impetus that had been established over 
            the years. The point was really whether this was the right time to remove 
            it. The category (like festivals and awards too) is, and was useful, 
            only for strategic purposes but the time will come, or has come, when 
        it loses its usefulness, or is recuperated. (Cox, 2004)</p>
      <h1>Some Working Categories </h1>
      <p class="BlockQuote">… new media art is characterised first and foremost 
            by four technical qualities: interactivity and generativity, connectivity 
            and multimediality[;] these qualities actually mark off common contemporary 
            visual art (and other forms of media art like video art) from new media 
        art. (Jaschko, 2004) </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">I have been trying to do my own list using the three 
        moments of production, distribution and consumption ...
      </p><ul>
          <ul>
            <li> Production: - performance - icons - text - browsers 
                - spam-art - e-mail - software - code - algorithms - video - audio.</li>
            <li> Distribution: - Web sites - cell phones – discourse 
              - CD/DVD - performance - chat - SMS - PDA&#39;s - e-mail – proprietary 
              software.</li>
            <li> Consumption - home - school - galleries -  Web-zines 
                  - festivals - competitions - media centres - conferences - discussions 
            lists. (Hazan, 2004)\</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>As outlined in Graham (2005), in order for the critical and journalistic 
                coverage of digital art to move beyond the &#34;can computers be art?&#34; 
          phase, it is necessary for some kind of shared critical vocabulary to 
          emerge. A range of work is identified here, ending with works which 
          have proved most workable in the context of curating.  The categories 
                referred to below are just five from those tabulated on-line (Graham, 
                2004) as a starting point for the CRUMB discussion list theme of September 
            2004. </p>

      <p class="caption">Table 1: Five sets of categories of digital art.  </p>
      <p>To start with some competitions of digital art, the <em>transmediale 
            Award Competition</em> had until 2004 the three categories of Image; 
            Interaction; Software. However, the committee  then made the deliberate 
            decision that these categories should be abolished, and that artists 
            should define their own areas of work. As can be seen from both <em>transmediale 
            </em>and <em>Prix Ars Electronica</em>, artwork categories include both 
            specific media (Computer animation or Image) and characteristics which 
            might range across various media (Interaction may be a characteristic 
            of sound, image, new or old media). The interesting category of &#39;Digital 
            Communities&#39; acknowledges the wider interpretative role of digital media.  
      </p>
      <p>When it comes to databases of digital art, the keywords used for searching 
            reflect other ways of categorizing: <em>The New Media Encyclopaedia 
            </em>simply lists the artists by name, whereas Rhizome&#39;s <em>Artbase</em> 
        uses a long list of keywords ranging from &#34;artificial life&#34; 
        to &#34;death&#34; (i.e. the keywords concern both media and content).  
        The Frieling/Daniels CD-ROM database of artworks separates the keyword 
        searches into three options. The date field is an obvious art-historical 
        tool, and the other keywords concern either  media/context or content/theme.  
        This division may seem a simple one, but it helps to clarify whether 
        the artwork simply has technology as subject matter (as some art-science 
        projects do) or whether the works use digital media and hence can be 
        classified as digital art.   </p>
      <p>Curators and writers including Christiane Paul and Steve Dietz have 
            developed categories that reflect the needs of curating, where it is 
            very important to be aware of both the artistic process as well as the 
            end product. In the world of art organizations, it is also very important 
            to be able to differentiate media (which may effect which museum department 
            or funding body one deals with) from themes which may form the intellectual 
            basic for a theme show, and also from the particular <em>characteristics 
            </em>of digital art which may work across several media, but which present 
            particular challenges for curator and audience.  Christiane Paul has 
            usefully separated Themes from Media, and divided the digital technologies 
            into those that are Media and those which function as Tools: &#34;...paint 
            is a medium and the brush is a tool ...&#34; (Paul, 2001). This distinction 
            also helps illuminate the difference between art and interpretation 
        mentioned later in this paper.  </p>
      <p>In 1999 Steve Dietz concentrated on the particular characteristics 
            of digital art that present most new challenges to curators: Interactivity, 
            Connectivity, and Computability. These three headings have been explored 
            in the context of examples from current exhibition practice, including 
            issues of control, immateriality, and authorship respectively (Cook 
            and Graham, 2004).  Sarah Cook (2004) has gone on to identify three 
            further art historical equivalents of Dietz&#39;s categories, and has named 
            them Collaborative, Distributable, and Variable. She has also re-ordered 
            the categories and placed them in relation to key issues for curators, 
            thus usefully reintroducing factors of production and distribution. 
      </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a><img src="graham.fig1.jpg" width="400" height="131" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: taxonomic diagram"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Figure 1: Sarah Cook&#39;s taxonomic diagram (Cook, 2004, 
        p.45)</p>
      <p>These categories usefully highlight the key characteristic that certain 
            technologies (such as computers networked to the Internet) are both 
            a means of production and a means of distribution.  That is, artists 
            may make their artwork using exactly the same reasonably accessible 
            equipment that they use to make their art available to their audience. 
            Indeed &#34;New Media as Computer Technology Used as a Distribution 
            Platform&#34; is one of the eight answers that Lev Manovich has to 
            the Question &#34;What is New Media?&#34; (Manovich, 2003, p.13-25). 
            Thus the border of Production/Distribution is another land where digital 
            art sits in provocative way, one which is picked up by Susan Hazan (2004).  
        Much has been made of the potential for net art to distribute itself 
        outside of the traditional cultural gatekeepers or curators, and whilst 
        net artists certainly can and do do that, they are also maintaining 
        a dialogue with museums, who are still very much in charge of the publicity, 
        promotion and collecting that bring digital art into the canons of art 
        history. </p>
      <h1>Interpretation Or Art? Science Or Art?</h1>
      <p class="BlockQuote">“Museums consider having web presence as obligatory 
        – as membership, information, e.commerce, etc. and then eventually an 
            art space. The art space is not quite an afterthought, but it is not 
        the prime focus.” Benjamin Weil (Sins of Change conference, 2000)</p>
      <p>As pointed out in a paper for Museums and the Web in 2001, a member 
            of the public, on seeing a piece of new media technology in a gallery 
            or museum, is justifiably likely to assume that it is some kind of interpretative 
            aid rather than an artwork in itself (Graham and Cook, 2001). The use 
            of digital media as tools for interpretation, education, promotion or 
            archiving is relatively common, whereas new media art is still rarely 
            shown in mainstream art venues. This may sound like a very obvious difference, 
            but there are still surprising confusions for the audience, and even 
            for arts organisations.  The Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, for example, 
            had for many years a particularly well-developed series of digital art 
            exhibitions and events, including some of the first exhibitions of net 
            art: <em>The Shock of the View</em> in 1998, and <em>Art Entertainment 
            Network</em> in 2000. The Walker also had a particularly integrated 
            approach to interpretation on the Web, including <em>ArtsConnectEd</em>. 
            In 2003 it emerged that the Walker&#39;s plans for a new building no longer 
            included a curator of digital art, and the argument for this was partially 
            based on the factor that the use of digital media as tools for interpretation 
            or archiving was to be retained (Halbreich, 2003).  This elision of 
            digital interpretation and digital art is by no means confined to the 
            Walker, and has had dramatic repercussions for budgets and departmental 
            relationships at several arts venues. A certain amount of &#39;productive 
            confusion&#39; between interpretation and art, however, does not always 
            work to the disadvantage of art, as long as the art is allowed to lead. 
            Harwood@Mongrel&#39;s <em>Uncomfortable Proximity </em>for Tate Britain 
            in London, for example, was the institution&#39;s first net art commission, 
            and the artist very deliberately used the work to question the role 
            of digital media in promotion and collection.  His Web site copied the 
            Tate publicity site, with his own content inserted, causing substantial 
            institutional disruption around the marketing department because the 
            Tate&#39;s Web site, in common with those of many art museums, was seen 
            primarily as a marketing tool, then perhaps as interpretation, but never 
        before then as a venue for digital art (Cook, 2001).</p>
      <p>The Science Museum in London is another venue that may be familiar 
            to Museums and the Web delegates because of interpretational interactive 
            computer-based installations and Web sites, including a finger-print 
            operated device which tracks users through the exhibits and generates 
            a personal Web page of data. This is also, ironically, the only museum 
            in London (including art museums) with a permanently installed collection 
            of digital artworks (including physical works by Gary Hill, Christian 
            Moller, and David Rokeby). Some of the history of new media art or digital 
            art is undeniably informed by the history of science and technology 
            as well as by the history of art, and therefore some authors have explicitly 
            excluded art/science projects from consideration as digital art, whilst 
            Stephen Wilson in his book <em>Information Art</em> has used a series 
            of chapter headings including: Biology, Physics, Kinetics, Telecommunications, 
        and Digital Information Systems.  </p>
      <p>Thus, not only are audiences still confused in their categories of 
            art or not art, but institutions are also somewhat unclear in their 
            presentation of the wide range of such work, as the following examples 
            may show. The research of CRUMB has also looked particularly at the 
            ways in which this confusion might even affect the ways that museums 
        work.  </p>
      <h1>Changing The Working Categories Of The Museum? </h1>
      <p class="BlockQuote">I often hear Danish museum directors ask for a list 
            of categories because it would make them feel more comfortable with 
            digital art; it frames digital art in accordance with the principles 
            of non-digital art. However, I think they misunderstand the challenges 
            and do themselves an unintentional disservice. Digital art demands new 
            ways of for institutional thinking about art works both in terms of 
            curating and preservation; it&#39;s difficult, sure, but also a chance for 
        the institution to develop.  (Lillemose, 2004)</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">What is interesting, however, is to see whether 
            it is necessary to (re)define the boundaries of what constitutes media 
            arts, whether segmentations within the relevant practices make sense, 
            and how to negotiate between the natural bastardisation of practices, 
        and curatorial and PR constrictions. (Broeckmann, 2004)</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">The whole show had this sense of blur to it, that 
            was really nice in terms of curatorial blur, in terms of chronological 
            blur, in terms of media blur, and in terms of the way pieces were either 
            newly commissioned or loaned. I think that, to me, was the strength 
            of the show; that it developed. Kathleen Forde, SFMOMA (Graham, 2002b, 
        p.13)</p>
      <p>As explored in Graham (2005), the most obvious question for art museums 
            is often &#39;Whose department should this be in?&#39;  At SFMOMA, director 
            David Ross took the radical step of getting curators from the departments 
            of Media Arts, Painting and Sculpture, Architecture and Design, and 
            Education and Public Programs to work together on <em>010101: Art in 
            Technological Times</em>.  Research on this show (Graham, 2002b) illustrated 
            that as well as the obvious cross-fertilization between knowledge areas, 
            the work demanded a critical crossroads where the Web sites were used 
            as both interpretation tools and venues for the net artworks.  Like 
            the Walker Art Center, SFMOMA is a museum with a good reputation for 
            digital interpretational work, including extensive Web sites on Bill 
            Viola and on the sculptor Eva Hesse.  This crossroads caused a certain 
            amount of anxiety over roles; for example, the question of how the net 
            art commissions could be found amidst the interpretation in their only 
            &#39;venue&#39; (the net art was shown only on the Web site, not in the galleries). 
            Were conventional concerns over &#39;usability&#39; affecting the intent of 
            the artwork?  Were the interpretation screens in the galleries being 
            confused with the art?  The categories of Art/Interpretation and Production/Distribution 
        were therefore recurring themes in the show.   </p>
      <p>The <em>010101 exhibition</em> also illustrated the potential and challenges 
            of communication among all departments of the museum.  The need for 
            excellent relationships with installation, technical and archiving staff 
            is an obvious factor for digital media, and one that SFMOMA successfully 
            developed collaboratively over a number of years.  This approach, which 
            necessarily crosses the boundaries between departments in museums, can 
            be an anxious one for institutions, but the collaboration of archivists, 
            technicians and curators can help to achieve more long-term stability 
            than the shifting grounds of curating alone.  The history of curating 
            digital media at art institutions has been a rather unstable one, often 
            driven by visiting curators or the strong enthusiasm of individual curators 
            such as Jean Gagnon at the National Gallery of Canada.  What tends to 
            remain after institutional change is the departmental structures, the 
            heritage of critical coverage, and the archives of the institutions 
        themselves. </p>
      <p>What is unusual about digital art is the involvement of artist/curators 
            in work that is usually strictly in the department of conservation specialists: 
            this again reflects the pattern of more collaboration and communication 
            across museum departments.  Benjamin Weil, for example, came to San 
            Francisco Museum of Modern Art with the experience of the <em>äda&#39;web</em> 
        collection of net art.  The Conservators also actively developed knowledge 
            alongside the installation staff, with seminars such as <em>TechArcheology</em> 
        in 2000.  Consequently, SFMOMA&#39;s <em>espace </em>on-line gallery of 
            net art and design remains one of the longest-running institutional 
            collections of such work despite the departure of the curators who were 
        originally involved.  </p>
      <p>Other archiving projects have also been significant in naming characteristics 
            which are highly useful not only for archives but for general working 
            taxonomies (Cook and Graham, 2001; Graham, 2005). Rhizome&#39;s <em>Artbase,</em> 
        for example, is a specialist database of digital art, and uses tactics 
        of preservation as useful categories. The artworks are either <strong>Linked</strong> 
        (linked to a URL) or <strong>Cloned</strong> (an archival copy of the 
            artwork is stored on the Rhizome server).  The naming of their tactics 
            for preservation in the wider field are: &#34;...  <strong>migration</strong> 
        (updating code), <strong>emulation</strong> (running outdated software 
            on new platforms), or <strong>reinterpretation</strong> (re-creating 
            the work in new technological environments).&#34; (Depocas, 2003, p.41) 
      </p>
      <p>The <em>Variable Media</em> project has brought together some key examples 
            of the problems of showing work from collections, covering a range of 
            challenges that cross physical media. In drawing up a questionnaire 
            which aimed to preserve the intent of the artist for future showing 
            of the work, the project made a list of &#34;Medium-Independent Behaviours&#34; 
        (Depocas, 2003, p.48) including  <em>Networked, Encoded, Duplicated, 
            Reproduced, Interactive, Performed, Installed, Contained. </em> These 
        &#34;behaviours&#34; are important namings because like the &#34;characteristics&#34; 
        of Steve Dietz, they work across media and yet summarise the major new 
        differences for arts workers.  &#39;Interactivity,&#39; for example, is something 
            that is seldom adequately documented in the traditional gallery installation 
            shot, and is an intent which must be discussed with the artist.  As 
            Jon Ippolito says: &#34;Among the important questions for interactive 
            behavior is whether traces of previous visitors should be erased or 
            retained in future exhibitions of the work&#34; (Depocas, 2003, p.50).  
        As well as being independent of medium, notes Caitlin Jones, a 
        Daniel Langlois Fellow in Variable Media Preservation, the skills needed 
        may also be &#34;occupationally independent&#34; (Depocas, 2003, 
            p.61), echoing the cross-departmental experience of SFMOMA and others. 
      </p>
      <h1>Taxonomies In Practice </h1>
      <p class="BlockQuote">The move from media to &#34;behaviors,&#34; as 
            it&#39;s been labeled here, seems to be more a move toward contemporary 
            art discourse. This seems tactical if we&#39;re talking about longevity 
            and continued funding for artists (or cultural producer, or whatever) 
        working with &#34;New Media.&#34; (Griffis, 2004)</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">The taxonomies that new media art curators, academics, 
            artists and critics are dealing with go much deeper than the structuring 
            logic of a museum&#39;s collection or exhibition programming schedule, they 
            permeate the entire culture industry such as funding institutions like 
            the Rockefeller Foundation and other grant awarding bodies, and more 
            visibly they shape or determine the structures of art schools and graduate 
            programs within research universities so that the definitions of new 
            media art are made or shaped before the art is even produced. [...] 
            So unlike earlier moments when definitions were usually connected to 
            individual artists&#39; practices, new media art has sort of, in my estimation, 
        been reversed engineered so to speak. (Sutton, 2004)</p>
      <p>As well as affecting the working categories of museums, the naming 
            of new media has obvious repercussions for competitions, commissions, 
            the production and educational structures of new media art. As Grant 
            Kester (2004) points out, there has been an &#34;enrollment driven&#34; 
        boom in the development and fashionable naming of courses in higher 
        education. The sexiness of the naming of new media also has obvious 
        relationships to arts policy and funding, leading, as Sutton points 
        out, to a danger that artworks could be &#34;reverse engineered&#34; 
        to fit a category, rather than being led by the artwork itself: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">I have to use &#34;new media&#34; and &#34;media 
            art&#34; in a non-scientific environment, when dealing with people 
            who have power and money to support &#34;new&#34; and who are for 
            whatever reason highly motivated to do so with their power and their 
        money. (Goebel, 5 Sep 2004)</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">I have spent years insisting that this area must 
            be more about art than about technology, and naming something for its 
            technology (and isn&#39;t &#39;new media&#39; just a euphemism for &#39;touched by computers 
            and stuff&#39;) has got to be a bad move, though it&#39;s a start. I note now 
            that the Arts Council in the UK removed all the categories of funding 
            that they used to have, and now you have to define your own funding 
        requirements. (Pope, 2004)</p>
      <p>When taxonomies are practically applied to real-world art, particularly 
            to an open submission database such as Rhizome&#39;s ArtBase, then the true 
        rigour needed for art is illuminated.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">One of my roles at Rhizome was to determine if the 
            categories/metadata that we used for cataloging the works in the archive 
            appeared sound, and if they didn&#39;t, make the proper adjustment for works 
            newly added to the ArtBase. I quickly found that there was very little 
            room to maneuver [sic] when the terms that were first laid down for 
            organizing the work (a process that pre-dated my tenure at Rhizome) 
            became over-used, unspecific, more arbitrary as time progressed -- like 
        interact, interface, Internet, machine, net.art. (Williams, 2004)</p>
      <p>Therefore, pre-existing metadata standards are challenged in their 
            turn. Some have criticized the Dublin Core standard for being primarily 
            object-based, whilst others in new media art find the minimalism useful, 
        in the struggle between specificity and fluidity. </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Moreover, unlike MARC records, which more or less 
            require items that fit into traditional library contexts, the Dublin 
            Core is totally non-prescriptive and open-ended.  The most directly 
            applicable Dublin Core fields, for our discussion, are <strong>Creator, 
            Format, and Type</strong>.  Format is defined simply as &#34;The physical 
            or digital manifestation of the resource&#34; and Type can be one or 
            more of the following: Collection, Dataset, Event, Image, Interactive 
            Resource, Moving Image, Physical Object, Service, Software, Sound, Still 
        Image, Text. (Turner, 24 Sep 2004)</p>
      <p>In looking at real-world taxonomies, this paper has illustrated some 
            of the ways in which digital media are reworking taxonomies whilst being 
            characteristically in a state of flux.  There is, however, at least 
            the start of a structure. The particular namings of &#34;Medium-Independent 
            Behaviours&#34; and &#34;occupationally independent&#34; skills can 
            be usefully applied to the widest range of contemporary artwork, and 
            form useful tools for a wide scope of institutions. The creative cross-disciplinary 
            approaches adopted by some organizations mean that collecting and archiving 
            can be the beginning rather than the end for the critical life of an 
            artwork. The cross-media nature of some of the most useable categories 
            for digital art also reflects the ways in which some disruption of borders 
            can lead to workable and creative categories which can be led by the 
        art itself. </p>
      <p>For a field which typically &#34;flows around and avoids institutions&#34; 
        (Schleiner, 2003), digital art has to some extent already moulded some 
        aspects of the way that even conservative art institutions and taxonomies 
        work.  The blurring of departmental boundaries is just one of the ways 
            in which this happens. To end on a quote which looks forward to a positive 
            future for naming, categorizing or taxonomising the fluid field of new 
            media art, Bosma suggests asking some simple but revealing questions 
        ... </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">What do your students think net art is?</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote"> What is the difference between your definition and that of your students 
          (if there is one) and how do you work with it in the classroom? (Bosma, 
          2004)</p>
