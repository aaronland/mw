      <h1>Cross Media: When the Web Doesn&#39;t Go Alone</h1>
      <h2>Giuliano Gaia, Stefania Boiano and Francesca Pasquali, Italy</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p id="abstract">The Web is such a powerful and comprehensive medium that 
          we usually consider it as a world apart. But the Web fully develops 
          its potential when combined with other media. For example, when integrated 
          with broadcast media such as radio and TV, it can provide the interactivity 
          and in-depth content that broadcast media cannot offer. On the other 
          hand, broadcast media can provide the massive audience Web sites usually 
          lack. Moreover, digital formats are making media boundaries less and 
          less significant, and increasingly media products (such as TV formats) 
        are thought of as structurally multi-media.</p>
      <p id="abstract">The concept of medium is now crossing the borders of 
          traditional media like radio or newspapers. Pervasive and mediated environments 
          such as conventions, theme parks, and museums are nowadays considered 
        media. </p>
      <p id="abstract">The paper will present case histories of successful and 
          interesting integration of the Web and other media, with a specific 
          focus on cultural usages. For example, a very successful TV program 
          by Channel 4, TimeTeam Big Dig, used the Web to involve its watchers 
          in a vast collective archaeological experiment in the UK, with unexpected 
          results. Also, integration between Web and radio was the key for the 
          success of Lifegate, a small local Italian radio station that combined 
          in a very effective way the different characteristics of the two media. 
          Now one of the most important radio stations in the area, Lifegate simply 
          would not exist without the Web. Another successful case of integration 
          was MuVi, a cultural program from another Italian radio station. MuVi 
          asked people to send old photos to the Web, rapidly creating a vast 
          and valuable on-line visual database of recent Milan history; in this 
          case the radio was key to reach audiences (older people) not reachable 
          via the Web, and to create a sense of community necessary for the collecting 
        operation. </p>
      <p id="abstract">Finally, by examining the main characteristics of the 
          Web as they emerge in comparison to other media, we will have a look 
          at how far the Web has been integrated with the Museum as a medium, 
          trying to get from this analysis some suggestions for future steps in 
        this direction. </p>
      <p id="keywords">Keywords: media, TV, radio, press, blog, broadcast </p>
      <h1>Introduction: Web And Other Media Today </h1>
      <p>Looking back on the period between 1995-2000 - when the media industry&#39;s 
          interest in the Internet was at its height and the Internet itself was 
          quickly spreading - we can recognize two conflicting ideas about the 
        relation between media and the Internet.</p>
      <p>Roughly, we can summarize them thus:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <div class="listwithbullets">the idea that the Internet was going to 
            cause the end of mass media. For example, the <strong>techno-utopian</strong> 
            thesis stated that mass media were going to disappear under the pressure 
            of the Web and its features like personalization. Others thought that 
            users were going to re-orient their budget-time to Web surfing, to 
            the detriment of media consumption. </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <div class="listwithbullets">the idea that the Internet itself was going 
            to lose most of its features under the <strong>colonization of media 
            industries</strong>, becoming a mass medium with all the negative 
            connotations that come along with the idea of &#34;mass&#34; media: big, profit-oriented 
            conglomerates speaking to indistinct and basically passive audiences. 
            (Of course, this description of media is very naïve and has been criticized 
            by media theorists and sociologists, but we don&#39;t have time to go 
            trough this now. Among others, see Thompson, 1995).</div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Both scenarios were based on the idea that the relationship between 
          new (i.e. the Internet) and old (i.e. broadcast and published) media 
          could be described in terms of one impacting on the other and producing 
        dramatic changes.</p>
      <p>Ten years later, nothing like this has happened. Mass media are still 
          very much alive, and the Internet fully conserves its distinguishing 
          features: it is still a dialogic, horizontal and plural space of content 
        production and consumption. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, more technological change is occurring: broadband 
          and wireless connections promise to open up new spaces for media industries 
          on-line. A new revolution is announced, and again the questions arise. 
          What&#39;s next? What will the relationship between media and the Internet 
          be in the era of broadband and wireless connections? How will the press, 
          radio and television be affected by the Internet, and how will the Internet 
        be affected by old media?</p>
      <p>These questions are still open and not easy to answer. Probably they 
          will never be answered if we keep on thinking in terms of two different 
          realms impacting on one another, and if we keep on forgetting that mere 
          technological innovation doesn&#39;t imply automatic social innovation, 
          i.e. new media content or new styles of media production and consumption. 
          (On the mutual shaping of social and technological dimension in digitalization, 
          see, among others, Dutton (1996); Flichy (1999); Haddon and Silverstone 
        (2000)).</p>
      <p>What we see now is indeed a process affecting the whole media system. 
          Referring to David Oltee and Richard Grusin (1999), we could say that 
          nowadays, under the pressure of digitalization, the media system is 
          undergoing a process of remediation in which new and old media, broadcast 
        and telecommunications are involved. As Bolter and Grusin suggest: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">[Cyberspace] is very much a part of our contemporary 
          world and . . . it is constituted through a series of remediations. 
          As a digital network, cyberspace remediates the electric communications 
          networks of the past 150 years, the telegraph and the telephone; as 
          virtual reality, it remediates the visual space of painting, film, and 
          television; and as social space, it remediates such historical places 
          as cities and parks and such &#39;nonplaces&#39; as theme parks and shopping 
          malls. Like other contemporary telemediated spaces, cyberspace refashions 
          and extends earlier media, which are themselves embedded in material 
        and social environments. <span class="blockquoteauthor">(Bolter and Grusin 1999, p. 183).</span></p>
      <p>Before continuing, we need be explicit about what we mean by <strong>media 
          system</strong> and by <strong>media</strong> and explain how these 
        concepts are relevant to the Internet and to museums.</p>
      <p>In first place, by <strong>media system</strong> we mean the network 
          of relations of complementarity, exclusion, or dependence involving 
          the different media existing at a certain place in a certain society 
          (Ortoleva, 2002). In second place, by <strong>media</strong> we mean 
          all socio-technical apparatuses which intermediate communication and 
        their associated social context, incorporating:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">the artifacts or devices that enable and extend 
          our abilities to communicate; the communication activities and practices 
          we engage in to develop and use these devices; and the social arrangements 
        or organizations that form around the devices and practices <em class="blockquoteauthor">(Livingstone and Lievrouw, 2002, p. 7). </em></p>
      <p>Of course it is an extremely broad definition, but it is of some merit: 
          it lets us include a variety of apparatuses devoted to mediations between 
          people, cultures etc. (and from this point of view, museums certainly 
          are media), and it focuses our attention on the network of innovation 
          involving technologies and social practices (institutional strategies, 
        audience tactics, etc).</p>
      <p>In this perspective, our proposal is to present the tendencies (or 
          at least some of them) that seem to affect contemporary media systems, 
          and to tentatively trace some of the opportunities opening up to museums 
          facing what we like to call a new <strong>media paradigm</strong> rather 
          than a <strong>new media</strong> paradigm. The first big trend we can 
        see is toward <strong>integration</strong>, under different aspects:</p>
      <p>On the <strong>production </strong>side, we see more integration of 
          media and telecommunication industries. This convergence is important 
          because it brings about a redefinition of the production processes, 
          opening spaces to new actors. For example, the transition to digital 
          TV favors the separation of content provider and network provider. In 
          the analog TV era, whoever owned the TV network was usually also the 
          content provider. Digital TV is more akin to the Web, where connection 
          providers are not the only or even the main content providers. In the 
          near future, museums themselves could be effective TV content providers 
        in the same way they are Web content providers today.</p>
      <p>On the <strong>product</strong> side we see how digital formats are 
          making media boundaries less and less significant, and increasingly 
          media products (such as TV formats) are thought of as structurally multi-media. 
          Big Brother, for example, was projected as a traditional TV program 
          and pay-per view TV, Web, press and radio product. This has at least 
          two relevant consequences. First, products live longer and become more 
          complex. The product must be flexible in order to be easily used in 
          different media. Second, content providers need to protect not only 
          finished products but also format ideas, thus making the whole copyright 
        subject even more difficult to define.</p>
      <p>On the <strong>consumption</strong> side, we see how people tend to 
          use different media on-line and off-line, creating their own media-mix. 
      </p>
      <p>A new, active audience is emerging, and this brings us to the second 
          big trend: <strong>participation</strong>. Participation is expressed 
        in different ways, such as: </p>
      <p><strong>Bricolage</strong>: on-line music selling, for example, allows 
          the user to buy single songs instead of complete albums and easily to 
          create a personal compilation. Now in a few moments it is possible to 
          record a CD suitable for a particular occasion or state of mind. On-demand 
          products are easily mixed; for example, Windows Media Center in the 
          latest version of Microsoft Windows, is focused on empowering non-expert 
          users to create their own picture slideshows and movies, add soundtracks, 
          and quickly burn Video DVDs and Audio CDs, all with a remote control. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Community</strong>: identity-building and participative dimensions 
          of media products are becoming increasingly important for users. This 
          is evident for the Web, but traditional media are also creating more 
          and more formats, such as Reality-TV shows, to fulfill this desire and 
          exploit it on their Web sites where, for example, broadcasters maintain 
        and encourage official and unofficial fan sites.</p>
      <p><strong>Self-Production of Content</strong>: users are increasingly 
          publishing their own content, text or images (and, increasingly, videos 
          and MMS - see for example <a href="http://www.theworldssmallestfilmfestival.com/" target="_blank">www.theworldssmallestfilmfestival.com</a>) 
          on the Web. The success of blogs, so easy to use and link to each other, 
          is symptomatic of a social desire to provide and share content, personal 
        thoughts, and impressions.</p>
      <p>All these three levels are put into action when it comes to cooperative 
          production of content. For instance, in the Wikipedia project <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">www.wikipedia.org</a> 
        users publish specific subject contributions that can be modified and 
        integrated by other users; this advanced form of cross-control is producing 
        good-quality results and an interesting knowledge-producing model that 
        is both innovative and functional.</p>
      <p>In this sense the Web is a powerful tool to collect knowledge from 
          the audience to create a knowledge base that can be promoted and developed 
          by cultural institutions; this dimension of audience activity is the 
        <strong>fil</strong><strong>-rouge</strong> connecting all the case 
        histories we are going to present.</p>
      <h1>Web and TV: Time Team Big Dig</h1>
      <p>Since 1982, Channel 4, an English public TV channel, has been placing 
          a premium on innovation, originality and diversity. It has probably 
          been Britain&#39;s most cutting edge, controversial and creative broadcaster 
          of the last two decades. Time Team is one of its most successful and 
          interesting programs: challenged with a deadline of three days, a team 
          of archaeologists excavates sites found in the backyards of common people 
          all over the UK, as well as sites under parking lots or National Heritage 
        sites. As one fan wrote: &#34;This show pushes the boundaries of archaeology outward and invites public participation in the science while at the same time insisting on adherence to formal methodologies!&#34;</p>
      <p>In June, 2003, the Time Team sponsored a special event called The Big 
          Dig. Nearly 8000 people volunteered for a week to dig a pit in their 
          backyards and participated in a vast cataloguing of archaeological resources 
        in the UK. </p>
      <p>We will focus on this event, the Big Dig, because it was a huge television 
          success (20% audience share in Britain), certainly an historic hit for 
        an archaeology program and a very interesting mix of Web and TV. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a><a href="gaia.fig1.html"><img src="gaia.fig1.thumb.gif" width="400" height="300" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Big Dig"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig.1: Big Dig Website <a href="http://www.channel4.com/bigdig" target="_blank">http://www.channel4.com/bigdig</a></p>
      <p>The Web site was divided into two areas; a private site (with login 
          and password) for registered participants and a public site for viewers. 
          Archaeological enthusiasts had access to interesting multimedia features, 
        including:</p>
      <p><strong>An interactive Flash MX map</strong> used to navigate the UK, 
          sorted into 14 regions, fully searchable by keyword. The Big Dig map 
          showed the location of the 30 participating digs in each county, local 
        participating museums, and larger Time Team digs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exclusive footage </strong> - from digs around the country, 
          not broadcast on TV</li>
        <li><strong>News page</strong> - constantly updated news of finds from 
            across the country</li>
        <li><strong>Finds Gallery</strong> - highlighting the hundred most likely 
            finds to be uncovered in the test pits.</li>
        <li><strong>Pit reports</strong> - public viewing pages filed on-line by 
            the participants.</li>
        <li><strong>My Site Report</strong> - reporting application for participants 
            to record the progress of their digs.</li>
        <li><strong>Slide Show</strong> - each pit report had a Big Dig slide show, 
            containing images of finds from participants.</li>
        <li><strong>The Time Team Big Dig Forum-</strong>open to both participants 
            and viewers.</li>
        <li><strong>SMS text messaging service</strong>-subscribers got daily 
            updates on finds as they happened, before the programmes were broadcast.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the password-protected part of the site volunteers could find a 
          massive amount of training material, such as archaeological guides, 
          safety tips, disclaimer forms, laws ruling archaeology and treasure 
          findings. The section was also the place where volunteers could upload 
        photos and news about their findings.</p>
      <p>As Katie Streten, Channel 4 Web site manager, said to the authors: 
        &#34;The event could not exist without the Web&#34;. This is true for two reasons: 
      </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <div class="listwithbullets">the original idea for the Big Dig came not from TV-program makers 
            but from viewers of Time Team and the Web site team</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="listwithbullets">organizing about 8000 volunteers for a week of digging in 1300 different 
            places throughout all Britain would have been simply impossible without 
            a free, ubiquitous and flexible medium like the Web.</div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In particular, the Web helped the organization of the event in three 
        key aspects:</p>
      <p><strong>Participation</strong>: the possibility of participation in 
          TV programs is structurally limited to a few moments and few people. 
          Thanks to the interactivity of the Web, people could be engaged in the 
          mass digging. On the Web, site volunteers could enlist, get training, 
          upload their findings, receive feedback and establish networks with 
          other volunteers and institutions; for example, get help in identifying 
        objects. </p>
      <p><strong>Deepening</strong>: the value of time during TV broadcasting 
          severely limits the quantity of information that can be transmitted. 
          This forces TV programmes to summarize and cover only the highlights, 
          without going too deeply into a subject. The Web, with its virtually 
          limitless storage ability, offered Time Team viewers the possibility 
          to go <strong>below the surface</strong> all the way to the desired 
        level. </p>
      <p><strong>Conservation</strong>: TV program are structurally ephemeral: 
          retrieving broadcasted materials once they are gone is usually difficult, 
          if not impossible. Big Dig Web site offered not only a total record 
          of the whole event, available worldwide for free, but also the same 
          opportunity of conservation to big findings as to small ones, thus increasing 
          the likelihood of participation, because even unlucky diggers will be 
        remembered.</p>
      <p>This was not a one-way street. The Web offered precious enhancement 
          to the TV program, but also got valuable things back: visibility, in 
          the first place, as TV is still the most powerful promoting medium. 
          But TV also proved itself a tool for emotional involvement, making archaeology 
          spectacular for a non-expert audience, and it offered a much needed 
        <strong>synthesis</strong> and <strong>highlighting</strong> moment 
        for the massive operation going on. </p>
      <h1>Web and Radio: MUVI</h1>
      <p>MUVI (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.url.it/muvi">www.url.it/muvi</a>) is a database of more than 
          6000 images, collected from people living in Lombardy, about the recent 
          everyday life in this Italian region. It is probably the biggest grass-roots 
          effort in Italy to create a collective memory, and it is the result 
        of an effective mixing of radio and the Web. </p>
      <p>The project was originated by Radio Popolare, a radio program aired 
          every Sunday on local Milanese radio. Listeners were invited to digitize 
          and send in their own photos for publication on the Web site, and at 
          the same time to call the radio program to narrate their stories. In 
          this way two important dimensions of storytelling, the spoken word and 
        images, could be effectively integrated - even without television. </p>
      <p>As Giaccardi (2004) says, &#34;integrating the communicative features of 
          a mass medium (the radio) with a digital continuum (the Web), the MUVI 
          project can trigger emotional and motivational mechanisms within the 
        community&#34;.</p>
      <p>Let&#39;s go deeper into this relationship. The Web creates actual <strong>participation</strong>, 
          because users can provide their own materials with minimal effort. The 
          aspect of <strong>conservation</strong> of the material is central to 
          users&#39; involvement: people want their memory not to die, and the Web 
          offers them the possibility of lasting storage and publication. As seen 
          in the previous case, the Web provides also the possibility of <strong>deepening</strong> 
        stories and concepts presented in the radio program, this time adding 
        not only quantity but also quality (images) that structurally cannot 
        be shown on radio. &#34;The use of a warm medium like radio, combined with 
          the affective value of pictures, is the key to getting people actively 
          involved&#34; (Giaccardi 2004). Radio allows authors to reach audiences 
          not reachable with the Web (especially older people) but who are strategic 
        for the database construction. </p>
      <p>Born in 1999, the project is now entering a second phase: the authors 
          want to emphasize its multi-media format while keeping the on-line database 
          as the core of the whole structure. For example, some of the stories 
          collected will be transformed for representation in theatre, while a 
          TV documentary is being produced and will be broadcast on local TV stations. 
          At the same time, the format will be replicated in other regions of 
          Italy with different actors and stories but with the same Web-media 
        mixture and collective memory creation idea at its base.</p>
      <h1>Web and Radio: Lifegate</h1>
      <p>Lifegate, a local radio station based in Milan and founded in 2001, 
          has been among the most innovative radio stations in Italy in the last 
          ten years. Lifegate was a radio station without direct advertising, 
          and almost without words: just quality music. The idea of &#34;music-only&#34; 
        radio is not new; but till then no radio could sustain itself without 
        advertisements. And advertising means spoken messages, cutting the flow 
        of music. But Lifegate radio was just half of the Lifegate project: 
        the other half was a massive Web portal with a large amount of content 
        and a precise aim: to create an eco-enthusiast community of supporters 
        for the radio and to generate advertising revenue. The only spoken message 
        that could be heard on the radio was the Web address of the portal; 
        since it was just a URL, it did not disturb the music broadcast, and 
        added a particular &#34;touch&#34; to it.</p>
      <p>Lifegate was an instant hit. Its success was due to the fact that the 
          best features of both Web and radio were used effectively: the radio 
          launched the brand Lifegate, and the portal translated it into ideas, 
          advertisements, discussion forums, solidarity appeals, non-profit associations, 
        Lifegate-branded shops and initiatives...</p>
      <p>The radio programs, based only on high-quality and not mainstream music, 
          were able to create a sense of community among the listeners and made 
          the radio program a suitable soundtrack for creative offices or trendy, 
          alternative shops; on the other hand, the Web site was necessary to 
          go deeper into the concept which the radio was going to convey only 
          at an emotional level: the idea of &#34;different&#34;, &#34;organic&#34;, &#34;Nature-friendly&#34;, 
        &#34;cool&#34;, etc.</p>
      <p>Once again, we can see the Web acting as a participation and deepening 
          tool, while the radio offers warmth, emotional impact, synthesis, and 
          the possibility of reaching different audiences in different contexts 
          (car, shop, etc.) that the Web does not yet touch. One of the interesting 
          aspects in the Lifegate case is that by being conceived together from 
          the first moment, both media (Web and radio) can express their features 
          at a higher level. If the radio had to convey the rational meaning of 
          the Web material, or the Web site had to try to create the emotional 
          participation of the radio, both the radio and the Web site would probably 
        have been much less successful. </p>
      <h1>Web and the Press</h1>
      <p>Newspapers and magazines soon had the problem of trying to integrate 
          the Web within their communication formula; the Web, because of its 
          textual nature, immediately appeared contiguous to <strong>paper</strong> 
        media. This contiguity has been felt as competition, also at an economic 
        level: free on-line newspapers against expensive printed newspaper. 
        So far, this confrontation/competition has not produced a really positive 
        integration, except for digital archiving and indexing of past issues 
        and on-line consultancy services by specialized magazines. </p>
      <p>The recent proliferation of blogs has created a new interesting model 
          of integration between press and the Web. Some traditional newspapers 
          decided to integrate blogs of their journalists into their on-line edition. 
          This way journalists have an area where they are free of space and subject 
          constraints typical of the printed paper, since they can write as much 
          and about what they want. This can help focus and extend the subject 
          of their printed articles; for example, showing personal impressions 
          or publishing on-line all the materials with the sources they cannot 
          publish in the traditional newspaper. Moreover, readers&#39; participation 
          is greatly enhanced, because most blogs allow comments on their postings, 
          again without the space limits and the selection process typical of 
          the traditional &#34;Letters from the readers&#34; of the press. The news production 
          itself is changing, since journalists link to other journalists&#39; blogs 
          or quote their readers&#39; comments. This <strong>hypertextualization</strong> 
        of the news is an intriguing process, and makes the social processes 
        underlying news and journalism more explicit and traceable. The word 
        <strong>conservation</strong> here acquires new meaning, because not 
          only are news and contributions digitally available well after their 
          paper support is gone, but also sources and comments remain readable 
        on the Web.</p>
      <p>This process is not without shadows or problems, for example, regarding 
          credibility and authoritativeness of journalists&#39; blog. How much control 
          should a newspaper exercise on its journalists&#39; blogs? A simple disclaimer 
          that the blogger&#39;s opinions are personal cannot be sufficient, because 
          the journalist still has an &#34;aura&#34; coming from the newspaper for which 
          he works. An interesting debate on how blogosphere and press are influencing 
          each other can be found in the on-line proceedings of the Harvard conference 
        <em>Blogging</em><em>, Journalism and Credibility</em> <a target="_blank" href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/webcred/">http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/Webcred/</a>.</p>
      <p>Even if bloggers offer themselves as alternatives to mainstream journalism, 
          newspapers are still fundamental as a widespread, easy-to-use medium, 
          and both Web and press can benefit from integration of the two media 
          and from the creation of many exchange areas where boundaries between 
        content creators and content users become subtler.</p>
      <h1>Web and Books</h1>
      <p>The relationship between the Web and books is also quite old (in Internet 
          terms). Amazon.com is one of the most famous Web sites, not only because 
          it set the paradigm for e-commerce, but also because it stressed integration 
          between books and the Web. Its readers&#39; reviews, its rating system, 
          its advanced searching tools and its innovative structure linking related 
          books are all meaningful tools not only for book buyers, but also for 
          users who have already read the book and want to share their opinions, 
          or for bibliographic researchers. The single physical object, the book, 
          in Amazon.com becomes part of a more complex hypertext made up of related 
          books, readers&#39; and editorial reviews, used books, flexible prices, 
          etc. Users can go more deeply into the book, the author and the subject, 
          participate in on-line discussions, and find books which are no longer 
        sold or published.</p>
      <p>Another interesting experiment in integrating Web and books is the 
          BookCrossing Web site, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/">www.bookcrossing.com</a>. On this Web site 
          registered readers get a unique ID for a book they like; they write 
          the ID on the physical book and leave the book somewhere in their city. 
          Whoever gets the free book is required to post his review on the Web 
          site and leave the book, after reading it, for someone else to read 
        and comment. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a><a href="gaia.fig2.html"><img src="gaia.fig2.thumb.gif" width="400" height="300" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: BookCrossing"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig.2: BookCrossing Web site <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/">www.bookcrossing.com</a> </p>
      <p>This way books are tracked during their random circulation. The community 
          is huge (more than 300,000 registered members so far), and the percentage 
          of books which were commented on by another reader after their <em>release</em> 
        is around 20-25%. BookCrossing is interesting because it integrates 
        the physical aspects of the book as a durable object (it can be left 
        and picked up by someone else, it &#34;travels&#34;, sometimes from city to 
          city, even from state to state) with its intellectual content, which 
        is recorded and discussed on the Web site. </p>
      <p>Finally, we have to note that particularly in the technical publishing 
          sector the book is more and more sold in conjunction with CDs and with 
        <em>book sites</em>, Web sites containing extra materials, links, updates 
          and discussion forums between the readers and the author. The book as 
          a finished product is slowly becoming an on-line integrated service 
          with paper and digital parts open to updates and contributions by readers; 
        another step towards cooperative production.</p>
      <h1>The Web and Museums</h1>
      <p>Finally, we have arrived at the most interesting medium for all of 
          us: museums. We have seen in the introduction how communication researchers 
          tend to use a broader definition of media that goes beyond traditional 
          media and includes every mediation system, including museums. If this 
          is true, we should ask ourselves whether the Web and museums have come 
          anywhere near to real integration during these years. Certainly Web 
          sites have become more and more important for museum promotion, and 
          there are many valuable on-line educational sections. But it is not 
          easy to find whole museums or even temporary exhibitions structurally 
          designed to be integrated with the Web. Usually it is the Web that adapts 
          itself to the museum. For example the Italian Web site <a href="http://www.lemostreeterne.it/" target="_blank">www.lemostreeterne.it</a> (<em>The Eternal 
          Exhibitions</em>) is an interesting conservation project which stores 
          360° panoramic views of past exhibitions, thus &#34;preserving&#34; not only 
          their content but also their environmental design and their physical 
        organization.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig3" id="Fig3"></a><a href="gaia.fig3.html"><img src="gaia.fig3.thumb.jpg" width="400" height="274" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: exhibitions stored in www.lemostreeterne.it"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig.3 One of the exhibitions stored in <a href="http://www.lemostreeterne.it/" target="_blank">www.lemostreeterne.it</a> 
      </p>
      <p>Clearly we are still in the situation where the Web describes and supports 
          the real event, but the real event could live without the Web. To find 
          real cases of integration, where real events are conceived from the 
          beginning as integrated with the Web, we have to look mainly at science 
          museums and science centres&#39; projects such as Webcasts (the transmission 
          on the Web of an event inside the museum). The Exploratorium of San 
          Francisco was a pioneer in this field, and its events were conceived 
          and organized in order to be Webcast. An interesting point in the evolution 
          of Webcasting was the <em>Origins</em> project <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/origins" target="_blank">www.exploratorium.edu/origins</a>: 
      </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">a pilot project that mixes live, Internet broadcasts 
          (Webcasts), a Web site with streaming media, Webcams, text and graphics 
          with interactive presentations at the Exploratorium. The project is 
          designed to take Internet and museum visitors on remote field trips 
        to science research stations throughout the world.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Semper 2002). </p>
      <p>This way the Web is not only a mean of broadening the audience for 
        a real event, but also a way of creating the event in the real museum.</p>
      <p>Another interesting project is the Dana Centre, a collaboration between 
          the BA (British Association for the Advancement of Science), the European 
          Dana Alliance for the Brain, and the Science Museum of London. The Dana 
          Centre is a centre devoted to discussions about Science. As stated on 
        the Web site <a href="http://www.danacentre.org.uk/" target="_blank">www.danacentre.org.uk</a>:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">It&#39;s the place for <strong>experimental</strong> 
        dialogue events, blending the best from science, art, performance and 
        multimedia to <strong>provoke</strong> discussion and real engagement 
        with the key issues of the day.</p>
      <p>What makes it interesting for us is the fact that the Web is a structural 
          part of its events. Real discussions ignite on-line discussions; on-line 
          forums are seen as important parts of the Dana Centre, so important 
          that they are given the main focus inside the innovative Dana Centre 
        Homepage. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig4" id="Fig4"></a><a href="gaia.fig4.html"><img src="gaia.fig4.thumb.gif" width="400" height="300" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Dana Centre"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig.4: Dana Centre Home Page <a href="http://www.danacentre.org.uk/" target="_blank">www.danacentre.org.uk</a> </p>
      <p>Real discussions are Web cast live and stored on the Web. The Web then 
          is a powerful tool for participation of users and also for conservation 
        of a structurally ephemeral event like a discussion. </p>
      <p>In art museums, the on-line/off-line discussion formula is applied 
          also by Tate Britain, <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/onlineevents" target="_blank">http://www.tate.org.uk/onlineevents</a>. 
          On-line discussions are blended with live events such as art performances 
          or Artist Talk conversations. The Web site is also a point of access 
          to on-line archives and references which help the focusing and deepening 
        of on-line discussions. </p>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>Integration and participation identify a media context where <strong>complexity 
          </strong>is the rule. Multi-media formats make product life longer and 
          more complex; the product&#39;s unity and simplicity tend to vanish. The 
          old media context was characterized by rituals imposed by broadcasting 
          time scarcity; TV movies were broadcast once, at the same hour for all 
          viewers. Today, the same movie can be seen on demand or seen at different 
          hours on thematic TV channels. Also, sport events had to change their 
          rituals: Satellite TV programs, for example, forced the Italian Soccer 
          league to spread matches around two or three days per week instead of 
        the previous one-time playing on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The whole media system is changing in ways vital for museums. Copyright 
          issues are more and more complex in a context where digital exchange 
          and self-production of content are becoming the rule. Should a museum 
          try to stop or encourage the publication on personal Web sites and blogs 
          of photographs and MMS shot in its galleries? What is the limit to users&#39; 
          participation in museum knowledge creation? Should museums take advantage 
          of the opening of new spaces as partners and content providers on TV 
          digital networks? Our opinion is that the large and always growing intersection 
          area between media, and in particular between media and the Web, offers 
          important opportunities to museums and cultural institutions, as the 
        case histories presented suggest.</p>
      <p>The aim of this paper is not to suggest practical ways of integrating 
          the Web and other media, including museums. Of course the case histories 
          presented could be inspiring for practical projects (for example, a 
          museum could encourage curators&#39; blogs, or create a visual or textual 
          Wikipedia-like knowledge base about their specific subject, with contributions 
          from users. Our focus here is to help museum communicators to identify 
          larger trends and take advantage of new opportunities arising from the 
        intersection of media and Web.</p>
      <p>After all, this conference itself, Museums and the Web, is a successful 
          intersection of media, not only in the name, but also in the formula; 
          the MW Web site with its massive on-line archive of papers (which grants 
          conservation, deepening and participation of users) is a fundamental 
        extension of the live meetings we are conducting here.</p>
