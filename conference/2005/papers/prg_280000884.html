      <h1>Whither the Web: Professionalism and Practices for the Changing Museum</h1>
      <h2>Michael Haley Goldman, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and 
        Kathryn Haley Goldman, Institute for Learning Innovation, USA</h2>
      <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="AbstractText0" id="abstract">The building excitement of the 
            information age: new solutions; faster, better, cheaper; possibilities 
            of new audiences; interactive, hands-on, minds-on learning; visions 
            of paradigm shifts: the optimist view. Each new solution as if it were 
            the messiah, but simply repackaged old ideas; a sense of hectic-ness; 
            funded projects but difficulty in sustaining successes; lots of beauty 
            but little learning; frustration: the pessimist view. Whether you are 
            an optimist or pessimist or somewhere along the continuum, there is 
            no debating that the quality and professionalism of museum Web sites 
            has increased dramatically since the foundations of Museums and the 
            Web. We are far from the days where Web site creation was a secondary 
            add-on to a museum staff member&#39;s busy schedule; sites are now designed 
            by creative professionals who specialize in marrying content and design 
            to education and entertainment. What will happen from here? What will 
            be the look and feel of Web sites of the future? How do we look down 
            the road to see what&#39;s coming? With the distinct lack of summative evaluation 
            there is no way to differentiate sites except by what is judged worthy 
            by the field itself. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi writes that it is not just 
            the individual excelling in a chosen domain of expertise but also the 
            response of the field that marks creativity and innovation. Using this 
            framework, this paper will address the nature of successful museum Web 
            sites by revisiting the Best of the Best. The authors compile award-winning 
            museum Web sites of past years and conduct in-depth interviews with 
            the designers and developers behind those sites. Their thoughts and 
            reflections will be integrated with past and current trends in the cyclical 
            development of educational technology to provide a road map of what 
        we might see next.</p>

        Web sites, theory, user studies</p>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Our purpose is to examine the professional discipline of museum Web 
            creation – what it is currently and where it is going. This task 
        is divided into three major pieces: </p>
          <ul>
          <li> 
             To articulate what makes up the profession 
              of museum Web development by exploring the ties between professionals 
              (field) and their practice (domain);</li>
          <li> 
             To discuss problems that result from these 
              distinctions including the difference between expert and user ideas 
              of success; and </li>
          <li>To provide additional tools for measuring success criteria that do 
            not rely solely on subject individual criteria</li>
        </ul>
      <p>To do this, we draw from informal data and interviews collected in 
            the last few months to explore whether this emerging area is indeed 
            a field, how success is measured and quality is recognized within this 
            field, and how both the field of practitioners and the domains they 
            practice in might evolve over the next few years. This is a paper written 
        about the field for the field.</p>
      <p>We have chosen to approach this question through psychologist Mihaly 
            Csikszentmihalyi&#39;s systems model of creativity which we will discuss 
            in more detail below. The reason we&#39;ve chosen this particular model 
            is because we find Csikszentmihalyi&#39;s way of breaking out the elements 
            of domain and field from the actions of the individual practitioner 
            useful in understanding the complex interrelation of actions that underlie 
            the activity of developing Web sites for Museums. We can then clarify 
            the comments of influential members of the profession by organizing 
            them into trends and observations about the domain (practice) vs. trends 
        and observations about the field (profession).</p>
      <h1>Adapting Csikszentmihalyi&#39;s Creativity Model</h1>
      <p>The model we use grew out of the need to create a scientific understanding 
            of creativity. To study creativity, Csikszentmihalyi had to define it 
            in a way that does not depend solely on an individual&#39;s internal criteria. 
            Instead, he created a system model that places creativity in a framework 
            of interaction between three factors: the individual, the field, and 
            the domain. The domain consists of a set of symbolic rules and procedures 
            nested within society and culture and forming the area of expertise 
            within which an individual acts. In other words, the <em>domain</em> 
        includes the practices and expertise required for a particular activity 
        (music, architecture, boxing, etc.). The <em>field</em> includes all 
            of the members of a profession – the practitioners of a domain, 
            the gatekeepers of a domain, and others who pass judgment in some way 
            about the quality and creativity of an individual&#39;s actions within the 
        field. </p>
      <p>For example, in the domain of art, the field &#34;selects what new works 
            of art deserve to be recognized, preserved and remembered&#34; (Csikszentmihalyi, 
            1997) . Though Csikszentmihalyi distinguishes several forms of creativity, 
            he focuses his model on individuals who create or contribute something 
            of permanent significance to a particular domain. This establishes a 
            more concrete, objective definition of creativity as recognized by the 
            judgment of others. He explains further, &#34;Creativity does not happen 
            inside people&#39;s heads, but in interaction between a person&#39;s thoughts 
        and a sociocultural context.&#34; (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997) </p>
      <p>The Csikszentmihalyi model might be represented as shown in Figure 
        1.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1"></a><img src="haleygoldman.fig1.gif" width="317" height="287" border="0" alt="Representation of Csikszentmihalyi&#39;s model of creativity"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: Representation of Csikszentmihalyi&#39;s model of 
        creativity.</p>
      <p>To illustrate this model, consider an individual who is thought of 
            as a creative musician. To be so, she must become skilled in the domain 
            of music and her work must be judged as creative by the field of fellow 
            musicians and critics. Clearly there is much interaction between the 
            three areas of this model as the individual is part of the field, and 
            the field to some degree defines what is and is not part of the domain. 
            However, the complexity of the relations does not reduce this model&#39;s 
            ability to provide a more complex and useful model of where creativity 
            occurs. Although creativity is an important part of the development 
            of museum Web sites, we have adapted this model to look beyond creativity 
            to the overall success of the site. Howard Gardner makes a similar adaptation 
            in his investigation of the extraordinary mind (Gardner, 1997). The 
            model provides several advantages for this investigation. First, the 
            model helps a framework for looking at the profession – the domain 
            (or area of practice), the field (or profession), and the individual. 
            Second it provides a method for defining success that does not lie in 
        the subjective internal criteria of the individual. </p>
      <p>As a result of this shift in application of the model, there are some 
            areas of Csikszentmihalyi&#39;s model that do not work for this discussion. 
            For instance, Csikszentmihalyi suggests that creativity cannot be separated 
            from recognition. Thus, during the centuries where Bach&#39;s work was unpopular 
            and un-acclaimed, the work itself was not creative. In another example 
            he gives, &#34;According to the systems model, it makes perfect sense to 
            say that Raphael was creative in the sixteenth and in the nineteenth 
            centuries, but not in between or afterwards&#34; (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997). 
            We find this problematic on a number of levels. For our purposes, we 
            would argue that similar changes in measuring success have less to do 
            with the concept of success itself than with important changes to the 
            make-up and values of the field. It is expected that a field will grow 
            and that its values will similarly mature in the process. If a Web site 
            was considered creative and successful in its day, later changes in 
            the field do not reduce or change that, though it might be difficult 
        to understand that judgment later on.</p>
      <p>Still, the insight that creativity/success is connected to recognition 
            by the field led us to part of the development of this paper. If one 
            wants to find who is influencing the profession, can one turn to the 
            venues for recognition within museum Web development and by interviewing 
            those who have been recognized, begin to define the nature of creativity/success 
            in museum Web site design? And perhaps from that have a better understanding 
            of the development of both the domain and the field as it stands now 
        and as it evolves in the future? This was our hope.</p>
      <h1>Methods</h1>
      <p>To start improving our understanding of the profession, we wanted to 
            speak to people who are clearly influencing the work of others. By interviewing 
            these influencing experts we hoped to see trends in how the profession 
        of museum Web development is growing and changing.</p>
      <p>One way to look for who is influencing a domain is to look for who 
            has created exemplars that are used by other practitioners. The idea 
            of exemplars comes from Thomas Kuhn&#39;s well-known discussion of the development 
            of science. For Kuhn, exemplars are &#34;…the concrete problem-solutions 
            that students encounter from the start of their scientific education…&#34; 
        which serve as models for their own problem solving in the future (Kuhn, 
        1962). In other words, the exemplars learned by science students eventually 
        serve as models for their own experimentation when they become scientists. 
        Exemplars teach us a method for handling new problems. </p>
      <p>Do exemplars exist for the museum Web site and if so where could they 
            be found? Having no clear answer to this question, we went to the best 
            available source – award winning Web sites. By analyzing existing 
            data from Museums and the Web&#39;s &#34;Best of the Web&#34; awards and the AAM 
            Committee for Media and Technology&#39;s &#34;Muse&#34; awards, we were easily able 
            to identify several museums and museum development companies that consistently 
            win awards for their Web sites. These awards helped us find Web sites 
            that might set an example for best practices and thus identify influential 
        creators in the field.</p>
      <p>We completed interviews with 10 individuals associated with award winning 
            Web sites, including developers, designers, award judges and individuals 
            involved with the development of relevant conference. . Developers included 
            both those at external companies and individuals working in-house at 
            a museum (although it was significantly harder to reach and schedule 
            interviews with the in-house practitioners). While this was a very small 
            sample, the conversations were long– over an hour apiece, and 
            very rich. One of the pleasures of this work for us was to hear how 
            deeply thoughtful and reflective our colleagues are. We&#39;ve synthesized 
            these discussions with some pertinent readings and framed it here by 
        the concepts of domain and field as developed by the creativity model.</p>
      <h1>The Domain: The Practice of Museum Web Development</h1>
      <h2>Awards: an indicator of quality?</h2>
      <p>As discussed above, awards are one of the few clear indicators of success 
            within the domain of museum Web sites. Although within any competition, 
            judging what is merit-worthy is made up of a number of different diverse 
            criteria, including creativity, it also includes other factors like 
            production values. Setting those issues aside and viewing awards from 
            an external view, they still play multiple roles such as helping to 
            define the domain (what to aspire to in the practice of museum Web development), 
            defining the field (who is considered to be a part of the profession), 
            and, as we are focused on here, as examples of best practices. By identifying 
            exemplars and their creators, a field demonstrates its shared values 
        and points to a model for future practice. </p>
      <p>We asked all of the interviewees about museum Web site awards in terms 
            of function and impact on their work specifically. Most of those interviewed 
            had mixed reactions to the awards given to museum Web sites. Some felt 
            that the awards served as a method of encouraging innovation. As one 
            external developer said, &#34;Awards were there to push boundaries.&#34; Others 
            suggested that awards were meant to acknowledge excellence or to demonstrate 
            that things could be good in different ways. While almost all viewed 
            the awards as important, even those involved with developing the awards 
            did not feel that the awards currently had the impact that might be 
            expected or desired. Nonetheless, development firms and in-house developers 
            alike appreciated winning awards for the recognition of their efforts. 
            They agreed that the awards were useful as a sort of accreditation – 
        that winning gave credibility to their work both externally, with clients, 
        and, for in-house developers, internally. </p>
      <p>Some issues with the awards included the question as to whether or 
            not the award winners truly represented the best work for the field 
            in any given year. This problem could be related to the impression from 
            many respondents that the criteria for selecting winners were not clearly 
            enough defined by or for judges. One external developer commented, &#34;Excellence 
            and innovation are not always the same thing.&#34; Another said that they 
      &#34;tended to have large-scale winners even without top educational values.&#34;</p>
      <p>For the Best of the Web awards, some interviewees raised a question 
            about the influence of size and budget on making excellent Web sites 
            and the problem of (by some points of view) trying to look beyond their 
            influence or (by other views) ignoring the resulting excellence that 
            additional resources can provide. The Muse awards already have segmented 
        categories for different budgets.</p>
      <p>We also queried individuals on the impact the awards had on the domain 
            of museum Web sites. It wasn&#39;t clear here either what influence the 
            award winners themselves had on the field, although several possibilities 
            were suggested. One conference producer commented that often nominees 
            would refer to previous award winners in their applications, suggesting 
            an influence on later design. Clearly, awards also drove up attendance 
            figures for winning sites, but the further influence on future design 
            or even future visits to that Web site have not been measured. The awards 
            do, however, stand as important records of development of the field 
        – perhaps the most concrete recorded history available. This in 
            itself is a non-trivial issue. As a young domain, museum Web sites have 
            little written history, making it difficult to document changes to the 
        domain, best practices, and other developments over time. </p>
      <p>One significant finding within these interviews is that by and large 
            practitioners did not actively seek out or reflect on each other&#39;s work. 
            Mostly they admitted this grudgingly, almost with embarrassment, as 
            if they felt they should spend more time viewing other sites. Nor were 
            representatives from design companies particularly influenced by reflections 
            on other company&#39;s works – though they often would reference work 
            from their competitors. There could be multiple reasons for this: it 
            could be partially a product of the sample of those interviewed. Since 
            all of those interviewed come from institutions or companies that have 
            won multiple awards, they might be more confident in their own methodologies 
            and practices and not look as much to outside exemplars as would smaller, 
        non-award winning developers.</p>
      <h2>Inspirations And Influences: Where Does The Domain Come From?</h2>
      <p>If practitioners do not refer to each other, where do these developers 
            go for their inspiration and influences? Acknowledging that this field 
            is small, but quite porous, we had hoped to identify common sources 
            of inspiration and influences. It may be due to our sample, but we found 
            no such common sources. One could argue that this is a positive finding 
            which allows for a uniqueness of inspiration and a diversity of approaches. 
            Others could argue that the lack of any common influences demonstrates 
            that this is a medium which has not yet reached its own coming of age. 
      </p>
      <p>Practitioners shared several commonalities in their discussion of their 
            work. They felt a desire to be innovative – and felt that in some 
            sense museum Web sites were doing things long before the commercial 
        world. Said one award judge, </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">In my opinion, I&#39;ve noticed in terms of theory 
            that we&#39;re ahead of the commercial world and what you can do – 
        like building contextual relations and taxonomies. They&#39;re talked about 
        here before they are talked about in the commercial world. Like the 
        relationships in ThinkMap was the type of thing Google eventually got 
        into. </p>
      <p>Several interviewees spoke of having a difficult time finding anything 
        innovative anymore; as one in-house developer said, </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I don&#39;t surf around too much anymore because 
            I don&#39;t see much that is new. It&#39;s usually some kind of new animation 
        technique for some car or fashion company. Eye candy. </p>
      <p>As stated above, most of practitioners spoke of not having or not taking 
            the time to look extensively at other museum Web sites. Frequently, 
            all of the developers mentioned sources outside the field of museum 
            Web sites as sources for inspiration, from areas ranging over corporate 
            Web sites, film, exhibit design, architecture, graphic design, and technology 
            conferences. We&#39;ll explore the tension in the relationship with television 
        later in this paper.</p>
      <h2>Trends: Where Is The Domain Going?</h2>
      <p>We hoped these conversations would allow us to gaze down the road and 
            predict the new directions museum Web sites might take. In looking at 
            important future trends, our respondents tended to cite existing features 
            of museum Web sites that they believe will become more important and 
            influential. In our conservations with members of the field, the following 
        future themes consistently emerged:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Museum Web sites as tools for developing community;</li>
          <li> 
             Convergence of data; and</li>
          <li> 
             Dynamic information.</li>
        </ol>
         
          <h3>1. Museum Web sites as a tools for developing community </h3>
          <p>The idea that community building will be important for museums was 
            raised during many of our discussions. Interviewees meant different 
            things in their use of the word community. Some meant building bridges 
            between typically separated socio-cultural groups: as an award judge 
            commented: </p>
          <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">There is some really interesting stuff being 
            done in Europe at DigiCult– using the Web to build and strengthen 
            communities– to educate and inspire communities, because on the 
            Web different communities can become very close to each other. For instance, 
            immigrant communities and their fit into the society as a whole. There&#39;s 
            an art component, a history component, the stories and the people. </p>
          <p>Others meant the construction of on-line communities around certain 
            subject matter, from bloggers with distinct political perspectives to 
            eBay which can create communities of specialized collectors. Though 
            museums have worked with the Web to try to establish communities of 
            their visitors, this role does not seem to be fully developed. As one 
            external developer stated: </p>
          <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Fostering [community] is something it is supposed 
            to be pretty good for – but doesn&#39;t always suit – the things 
            the museum wants. Museums are not always interested in creating a community 
            about what interests the public.</p>
          <p>Another form of community mentioned during our discussions was the 
            museum community itself. The possibility of using the Web as a tool 
            to support museum Web professionals was also mentioned – particularly 
            in relation to the ability of institutions to work collaboratively, 
            sharing information about their holdings as discussed below.</p>
          <h3>2. Convergence of data </h3>
          <p>Efforts to bring together data sources for museum collections are not 
            new, and the discussion of information systems and meta-data have occurred 
            for many years. Nonetheless, this trend continues to be an important 
            direction for many of those with whom we spoke. Though more and more 
            institutions have made collections (in part or in total) available via 
            the Web, there is still no confidence that this movement has met critical 
            mass. </p>
          <p>Even with so many more materials on-line, there is also a sense of 
            frustration regarding the inability to meaningfully look across collections 
            often within the same institution, let alone across multiple institutions 
            in the field. As one respondent put it: &#34;…people on the Web don&#39;t 
            know about all of the separations within an institution, they just want 
            to find a train, let&#39;s get it digitized, let&#39;s make is so people can 
            find it.&#34; Though many institutions seem to recognize the need for such 
            inter-relations and many projects successfully combine data from a limited 
            number of sources, no solution to the larger problem has yet emerged. 
            A conference producer noted this as well:</p>
          <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Connectivity across institutions is a real 
            weakness and opportunity but there is a lack of reward structure for 
            sending people to other sites. We haven&#39;t really figured out how to 
            collectively meet the needs of users … [beyond] making certain 
            types of information available. Now the question is, what do we do next?&#34;</p>
          <p>With what could possibly be a giant increase in available collections, 
            the next problem comes from supporting meaningful interaction with these 
            materials. During discussions of this issue, one individual mentioned 
            the Digital Voyages project, a project that Kate Haley Goldman played 
            a small collaborative role on with the late, great Jim Blackaby and 
            his team at <em>Mystic Seaport</em>. Like a few other projects, this 
            was an attempt to go beyond the digitization of collections material, 
            to develop and implement a Web-based tool that allowed users to control 
            the narrative focus of their journey. Users were able to see the contextualization 
            of the collections materials (similar to ThinkMap in that way), search 
            and gather materials based on their own concepts of object categorization, 
            and then annotate and share their journeys. This idea leads to our next 
            emergent theme– dynamic information.</p>
          <h3>3. Dynamic information/user ownership</h3>
          <p>Many of those interviewed also felt that there was great potential 
            for growth based on dynamically created content that broke away from 
            the more curated aspect of many museum Web sites. Influences ranged 
            from the control scientists exercise over visualizing their own data 
            to the iPod revolution that allows each listener to become a DJ, shuffling 
            and organizing all of the music personally. As with all these trends, 
            dynamic content creation already exists on the Web and on museum Web 
            sites but was not seen as being fully articulated, developed, or diffused.</p>
          <p>Ideas about allowing the users to control the content dynamically, 
            to place it into their own context, also spill over into user-created 
            content as well. Over the last several decades, museums have been increasingly 
            interested in allowing visitors to participate, at times even contributing 
            to an exhibition. This &#34;visitor-as-participant&#34; or even &#34;visitor-as-curator&#34; 
            and &#34;visitor-as-creator&#34; aspect can take on an entirely different meaning 
            on-line. The potential for sharing user-created content was discussed 
            by several developers. Two comments from external developers follow:</p>
          <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">[I am] excited about publishing them [user 
            created collections] back – the audience is participatory but 
            most museums don&#39;t have staff to screen [the content] and post it. </p>
          <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> I see in the future more collaborative experiences, 
            more real-time collaboration, but also [an] untapped market for curators 
            to use the power of the Web to collect stories. – to solicit content 
            from the users, of wanting to get broader range of experiences, to build 
            collaborative virtual collections.</p>
          <p>At this point, the issue of dynamically controlled content begins to 
            look very similar to some of the ideas of community building already 
            discussed. The visitor and the museum become a community of people creating 
            content and meaning together in an on-line environment. This trend seems 
            to run parallel with the contradictory movement to create more set experiential 
            pieces for Web sites – Flash™ movies that more closely approximate 
            the experience of television. Some studies have suggested that the activity 
            of watching is what many visitors expect from the Web (Vergo, 1997). 
            One in-house developer stated this tension: </p>
          <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">We] need to become much less invested in the 
            broadcast model – be able to add and tell stories themselves [the 
            visitors]… They [particular Website designers] are coming close 
            to television…This is important because TV is what people do in 
            their leisure time, it is the standard being used for Web sites.</p>
          <h1>The Field: The Profession of Museum Web Development</h1>
          <h2>Who Decides? Measuring Success</h2>
          <p>Our respondents said a successful site was one that sparked curiosity, 
            that encouraged exploration within a bounded area, that was immersive. 
            In our conversations, we discussed how one would know a site was successful. 
            Although individuals did mention the awards, this was not the primary 
            criteria of success. One external developer stated:</p>
          <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">You&#39;ve got three groups of people. The clients: 
            are they really pleased in the meeting of their educational goals? Second, 
            peers are important. And third, our audiences, our visitors – 
            here is where it&#39;s harder to pin down. That&#39;s where the feedback is 
            more valuable. Are people really using the site?…I&#39;m interested 
          … if students are sharing with their friends. Taking a topic…. 
            that&#39;s daunting and having teenagers that are willing to share that 
            site – that&#39;s meaningful. </p>
          <p>This introduces a critical point with the model we are using. Csikszentmihalyi 
            seems to define <em>others</em> in terms of the field, rather than in 
            terms of the users. It is a given that in some fields it may be difficult 
            to discern any users; such as in particle physics. But in other fields, 
            such as sculpture, certainly critics and other sculptors make up the 
            field, but there are others – the viewers, the &#34;public&#34;, that 
            not only view/use the product of the creativity, but also render judgment. 
            Thus the complaints of modern art – that it is a dialogue within 
            the field, whereas in some other art-based domains the dialogue is both 
            within the field and with the viewers, who often are not considered 
            part of the field. We felt we must depart from Csikszentmihalyi&#39;s model, 
            as the practitioners clearly agreed that the user is a central figure 
            in successful museum Web sites. </p>
          <h3>If a tree falls in the forest…</h3>
          <p>A critical issue with our use of the Csikszentmihalyi model lies in 
            the model&#39;s lack of a role for the public. This issue is not simply 
            just in museums; it can also be seen as an issue in fields such as journalism, 
            entertainment, and even art. The domain of journalism, for instance 
          – would a story be seen as incomplete if it is recognized as good 
            by other journalists but fails to actually inform the public? As museums 
            have evolved from being collection-centered entities towards education-focused 
            institutions, users have gained in importance. Not to include the users 
            in a discussion here would be seriously remiss.</p>
          <p>Incorporating the key role of the public (or visitors or users), we 
            would adapt the above model to look like this, and exchange the term 
            &#39;creator&#39; for the term &#39;individual.&#39; </p>
          <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a><img src="haleygoldman.fig2.gif" width="372" height="355"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 2: Modification of creativity model to account 
            for the visitor.</p>
          <p>By acknowledging two types of judges for success– experts and 
            visitors, we face one of the most critical issues in museum Web site 
            design today – the lack of rigorous evidence from the visitors 
            about their opinions. Developers have begun to  get public feedback 
            in limited ways. In both virtual and physical museums, visitors vote 
            with their feet, and therefore many museums look carefully at the quantitative 
            information available to them from Web site logs. This information can 
            provide ideas of popularity and time on task – though there are 
            limitations of these data in truly understanding visitor behavior. </p>
          <p>Web site logs can be compared to a similar model within the field of 
            museum evaluation, where several individuals have attempted to develop 
            a user-based set of evaluation criteria that allow easier comparisons 
            across physical exhibitions that very widely in size, complexity and 
            subject matter. One of the most cited efforts (and the most controversial) 
            was the <strong>Paying Attention</strong> model developed by Beverly 
            Serrell (1997), which looked at quality comparison via a ratio of time 
            spent per square foot (sweep rate index and percentage of diligent visitors). 
            Both of these efforts, Web logs and Paying Attention, are admirable 
            in their attempt to get direct quantifiable information that can be 
            compared across sites, yet they each neglect some of the complexity 
            and subtlety of an individual having a meaningful museum experience.</p>
          <p>Towards that richer data, many interviewees also spoke of the more 
            informal feedback they have received from visitors. Such qualitative 
            techniques as talking with relatives, reading Web visitor comments, 
            and other anecdotal feedback on the success or failure of the site are 
            important in giving the developers some outside commentary. </p>
          <p>There seems to be some consensus that there is a growing interest in 
            more formal evaluation of Web sites though it is less clear how to do 
            it or how to build in the money to do so. Only one of the institutions 
            we spoke to incorporates regular user evaluation into its site development. 
            Many of those interviewed saw this aspect of the user or visitor as 
            one of the larger challenges for museum Web sites at this time. Since 
            so little is known about the visitor – especially the casual visitor 
            to a Web site – it is difficult to know if the Web site is fully 
            successful, particularly if success is measured by learning outcomes. 
            As one respondent put it &#34;[we need an] understanding of the audience…to 
            design experiences that really engage the audience.&#34; And another, &#34;We 
            have been living on an old measure based on quantitative measures, [now 
            we are] trying to pull qualitative measures as well as the quantitative.&#34;</p>
          <h2>What Is The Nature And The Makeup Of Our Field?</h2>
          <p>And finally, what does this information and the other interview data 
            have to do with our field. Perhaps it is debatable if museum Web site 
            development truly constitutes a field now or will do so in the future. 
            While some indicators of a mature field are present (Museums and the 
            Web is now in its 9th year, and we have an awards system), others exist 
            as part of the larger area of museum media field (including the Muse 
            Awards of the AAM Committee on Media and Technology, and the Museum 
            Computer Network). Some expected elements that distinguish other professional 
            fields are completely absent; such as membership organizations, established 
            educational programs, and peer-reviewed journals. While we are uncertain 
            that these elements are necessary, or even the right direction, for 
            this particular field, nonetheless, the evidence suggests that museum 
            Web development is simply a field in its very early stages, as it exhibits 
            some of the features of a field: recognition through awards, conferences, 
            recognized skill sets, and professional positions.</p>
          <h3>Supporting indicators of a mature field: practical</h3>
          <p>Those who look at the Web as simply a technology – a tool for 
            use in different purposes – might consider it difficult to call 
            the area of museum Web development a field. They should consider the 
            idea that many fields develop around the appropriate use of tools, including 
            other communication technologies like television and radio, and even 
            around other software technologies like GIS. These areas all have well 
            developed fields that include practical supporting constructs: membership 
            organizations, long-standing awards, publications, and recognized educational 
            tracks. Fields that are more rooted in academe also have peer-reviewed 
            journals and degrees.</p>
          <p>These constructs give us a range of features that museum Web development 
            currently lacks. We have a member-organization within AAM of the Media 
            and Technology Committee, although that focus is much broader than just 
            Web sites. We have no regular peer-reviewed journals, (or even non-peer 
            reviewed), as one award judge mentioned. He went on to further discuss 
            that there was a need there, perhaps not for peer-reviewed journals 
            as such a niche would probably not be supportable, but for some other 
            mechanism as a structure to support the dissemination of different ideas.</p>
          <p>As for graduate degrees, there is an inevitable tension created as 
            domains become more formalized within our educational structure. By 
            creating degree-granting programs, we codify the critical skills needed, 
            the process of creation, the theoretical approaches that might be taken. 
            Graduate programs allow us to trace lineage through schools of thought 
            or influential professors and advisors. Even when an individual&#39;s work 
            runs against the &#39;establishment&#39; of the domain, the fact that there 
            is an establishment allows for a framing of this work. Without the established 
            lineages or degree-articulated links between individuals, we wondered 
            if we would instead find evidence of other influential individuals – 
            people who serve at the epicenter of the field, individual like the 
            mavens and connectors that Malcolm Gladwell describes in <em>The Tipping 
            Point</em> (2002). The conference producers we interviewed acknowledged 
            and discussed their roles as gatekeepers and custodians of the field, 
            while at the same time echoing other interviewees in the need for new 
            directions and additional leadership.</p>
          <p>The codification of a field into a degree-granting graduate program 
            can also be harmful. For museum Web site development, it is clear that 
            a synthesis of skills is required, rather than one particular set of 
            skills. It was interesting that just as many of our interviewees had 
            their original background in philosophy as had a background in graphic 
            design. These individuals had a love of the content – and of the 
            possibilities of the content. As the technical skills become more standardized, 
            most practitioners felt that their approach to the content, their understanding 
            of the need for narrative, set them apart from those who design non-educational 
            sites. As one external developer said, &#34;When we hire someone new, we 
            have to make it clear that this [is] very different from marketing or 
            [working at] an advertising firm. The skill of interpretation needed 
            [in an employee] is hard to find.&#34; One practitioner mentioned the existence 
            of several groups that do both museum Web site design and other types 
            of more commercial design. He felt that as time went by, this would 
            occur less often; that development companies would need to devote themselves 
            to one specialty or the other.</p>
          <h3>Supporting indicators of a mature field: abstract</h3>
          <p>Other shared traits can also be considered while looking at the field. 
            According to Kuhn, scientific communities share a cohesiveness that 
            can be seen in the fullness of their communications and the relative 
            unanimity of their judgments. This is because the community shares a 
            &#39;disciplinary matrix&#39; –-ordered elements shared by practitioners 
            that include (but are not limited to) shared symbolic generalizations, 
            shared values, shared metaphors, as well as the shared exemplars discussed 
            earlier. Clearly this high level of cohesion does not exist for this 
            field, but during our conversations individuals often alluded to these 
            issues even though we did not address these topics directly.</p>
          <h3>Values</h3>
          <p>Clearly, common values on how to measure success in the development 
            of a Web site should be important in the development of a field. As 
            seen in the discussion of the user above, practitioners strongly value 
            user reactions and judgments, but find difficulty with the logistical 
            issues of collecting appropriate user evaluation. One designer spoke 
            of having to &#34;train&#34; the museum client each time regarding paying careful 
            attention to who the user for the site would be, what learning goals 
            were involved, how to engage and interest the audience. Our analysis 
            resulted in five factors that stood out as defining success according 
            to those interviewed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
             Creativity/ Innovation;</li>
          <li>Appropriateness;</li>
          <li>Learning value;</li>
          <li>
             Open /experiential learning; and</li>
          <li>Production values. </li>
        </ul>
        
          <h3>Symbolic language and vocabulary</h3>
          <p>The vocabulary that is defined within this domain tends to be language 
            borrowed from the museum or design domains, with occasional contributions 
            from other fields. One external developer mentioned inspiration for 
            their work in terms of what is currently happening in the field of architecture: 
          </p>
          <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">There&#39;s lots of carry-over between experiences 
            you have telling a story interactively, and learning the principles 
            psychologically. Like for instance why is it important to have orientation 
            experiences.</p>
          <p>Clearly, however, what this person means by &#39;orientation experiences&#39; 
            comes from a very specific source– one that other practitioners 
            are unlikely to share. </p>
          <p>For museum Web site design specifically, a codified set of terms is 
            still lacking for both the practical and the more theoretical. As one 
            external developer commented, </p>
          <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">It would be great to even be speaking on the 
            same page. We don&#39;t have standard language so we can understand each 
            other– even for RFPs [Request for Proposals].</p>
          <h3>Shared metaphors</h3>
          <p>As alluded to in our discussion of television before, museum Web sites, 
            and quite probably informal educational sites in general, are still 
            struggling with what they are &#34;supposed&#34; to look like. The television 
            metaphor reemerges frequently in this topic, but as our discussions 
            of dynamic information show, television is not the only or even the 
            dominant metaphor for the future. At the 2002 IMLS WebWise conference, 
            Jim Blackaby gave a talk on how new technologies develop over time, 
            using an apple peeler as an example. His point was that as new technologies 
            evolve, they take the shape of something more familiar, something we 
            already understand. But that shape, that metaphor, is a poor fit for 
            the new technology, so we continue to revise and continue to revise 
            until the technology takes a shape of its own. Jim said then, and we 
            think it is still true, the museum Web has not yet attained its own 
            unique form. The question is, are we even getting close?</p>
          <h1>Conclusions</h1>
          <p>In conclusion, we&#39;d like to bring together some of the disparate ideas 
            we&#39;ve been exploring in this paper. First, in this complex picture, 
            we see both an emerging field and an evolving domain, each growing but 
            in a fairly tentative fashion. There are trends we see as impacting 
            the domain, but no strong momentum to push the domain towards its next 
            iteration. </p>
          <p>The field itself is &#34;under construction&#34;– showing signs (such 
            as conferences and shared values) of coming into its own, but still 
            without other possible supports that would push the field forward. Our 
            conversations emphasized that the lack of true connection with the virtual 
            user has handicapped the evolution of both the domain and the field. 
          </p>
          <p>We are strong believers in the evolution of the field through discussion. 
            And as we were only able to interview a small number of individuals, 
            we very much welcome hearing from you, as a member of field, so that 
            we can continue to press this conversation forward.</p>
