 <h1>Media Stories:  An Integrative Storytelling In 
  Physical And Virtual Spaces</h1>
  <h2>Otmar Moritsch, Technisches Museum Wien, Austria</h2>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.tmw.at/">http://www.tmw.at</a></p>
        <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">The development of multidimensional storytelling 
   embedded in physical exhibitions is investigated by the example of the 
   new permanent exhibition <em>medien.welten</em><em>,</em> at the Technisches 
   Museum Wien (Vienna), which deals with history of media.</p>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">Starting from traditional exhibitions 
   with physical objects and artefacts displayed with printed text and 
   pictures, the extension and integration of a virtual exhibition layer 
   with digital objects and multimedia will be investigated systematically. 
   Within the virtual layer, a two-dimensional ordering structure related 
   to topic and time allows following stories in vertical and horizontal 
   lines. The two dimensions make it possible to organize the stories not 
   only according to one specific topic in chronological order, but also 
   according to a specific time period with a topic order. Each element 
   in this two-dimensional matrix also has inner dimensions, i.e. spaces 
   with digital objects, for deeper levels of detailed stories and further 
   digital exhibition spaces. The system allows access via the Web with 
   individual user profiles. </p>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">The embedding of a scientific publication 
   platform, which is directly connected to the matrix structure, allows 
   an interactive forum for topic-related contributions. The multi-user 
   system also allows external experts to produce and edit content in the 
   publication area. The whole system has recursive cycles where the content 
    generated by the contributions in the publication platform can be used 
     by curators to extend any of the physical or virtual parts of the exhibition 
     system. </p>

  <h1>Physical and Virtual <em>medien.welten</em></h1>
  <p>The new <em>medien.welten</em> permanent exhibition 
  at the Technical Museum of Vienna presents a unified history of the modern 
  media system. It deals specifically with transfer and storage media – with 
  post and telecommunications on the one hand, and with graphic, print and data 
  processing media on the other. </p>
  <p>The juxtaposition of the individual genealogical media histories shows how 
  they are converging and also highlights the convergence that took place long 
  before the computer era – such as the merging of photographic representation 
  and lithographic reproduction techniques. Directly exposed printing permits 
  the mass printing of photographs, the combination with telegraphic media and 
  their remote transmission. </p>      
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a><a href="moritsch.fig1.html"><img src="moritsch.fig1.thumb.jpg" width="400" height="111" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Panoramic view of medien.welten from the entrance"/></a></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 1: Panoramic view of medien.welten from the entrance.</p>
  <p>Media history is thus the story of an increasing convergence and interlinking 
  of individual media to form the complex media system of today, characterized 
  by the merging of transfer and data media on the computer and through the 
  Internet. </p>
  <p>The new media platform is beginning to incorporate all classical media forms. 
  Technical convergence also brings with it a cultural convergence that gives 
  rise to new utilizations – such as interactive Internet radio and television, 
  for example.</p>
  <p>The medien.welten exhibition shows how today&#39;s 
  media society has evolved and is designed to help visitors to better understand 
  and deal with the media world in which they live.  The exhibition functions 
  on more than one level: at the physical level, through the historical exhibits, 
  as in a classical museum; and at a virtual level, through the computer terminals 
  that also fulfill orientation and information functions. </p>
  <h1>Orientation</h1>
  <p>Computer terminals are set up at the entrances to the exhibition areas and 
  provide an animated layout plan of the exhibition. The visitor can call up 
  the different thematic areas on a touch screen to obtain an overview of the 
  geographical layout of the exhibition and the subjects dealt with. </p>
  <p>This orientation system is available only in two-dimensional form at present, 
  but a three-dimensional animated version is planned to enable visitors literally 
  to take a virtual tour. The three-dimensionality will give visitors an intuitive 
  experience of the physical layout as a whole in a way that a physical exhibition 
  extending over several building areas cannot do. Users can then simulate a 
  tour of the exhibition with brief graphic portraits of all the thematic areas, 
  including introductory texts to explain them. The virtual orientation system 
  thus offers an overview of the themes dealt with before a visit – possibly 
  a selective one – to the exhibits themselves. </p>
  <h1>Information</h1>
  <p>The Terminals in the historical exhibition areas offer subject-specific information 
  and provide visitors with a comprehensive, systematically structured multimedia 
  history of the media as an incitement to further in-depth consideration and 
  reading. </p>
  <p>The <em>medien.matrix</em>, as it is called, contains 
  texts on ten media topics, such as writing, images, or sound, in thirteen 
  epochs from Antiquity to the present day. The chessboard-like structure allows 
  the texts to be read both vertically, from the beginnings to the present status 
  of a media theme (such as writing), and horizontally, to provide connections 
  between different media in the same epoch (such as the turn of the century). 
 </p>
  <p>The texts reflect the interaction between cultural phenomena, technical developments, 
  economic interests and the political situation. They create an interdisciplinary 
  picture of the relationship at a particular time between society and its media 
  system, placing the physical exhibits in a socio-historical context. </p>
  <p>To enable readers to immerse themselves completely 
  in the historical worlds, the texts are backed by sounds representing the 
  epoch and are embedded in theme-related collages of contemporary images. Behind 
  these images is a further information level in the form of digital objects 
  illustrating the topic in question – historical images, film sequences, audio 
  documents or computer animations. </p>
  <h1>Virtual Museum</h1>
  <p>This multimedia medien.matrix forms the basis for 
  the future virtual exhibition level of <em>medien.welten</em>. 
  The time-theme matrix will be supplemented by a third dimension – virtual 
  exhibition rooms in all time-theme fields. These virtual rooms will contain 
  digital (including three-dimensional) exhibition material that will permit  
  the demonstration of the functioning of a machine as a virtual reality 
  application and will expose the often mysterious inner workings of appliances. 
 </p>
  <p>One example of this technique is the Enigma decoding machine. The exhibit 
  offers visitors an insight into the functioning of the machine and also enables 
  them to experiment with it themselves, something that is not, of course, possible 
  with original exhibits. The Enigma animation also offers a socio-historical 
  context, particularly its use in wartime, and puts the technical ingenuity 
  into a critical perspective. </p>
  <p>The exhibition rooms in this virtual museum also contain arrangements of 
  specific historical objects. Collections that could not be physically exhibited 
  because of their volume can be shown here selectively: historical media machines 
  and appliances or historical media products such as printed matter, lithographs, 
  photographs, radio, television or film sequences, etc. As well as the inventory 
  of the Museum itself, it is also planned to present objects from partner institutions. 
  By its very nature, the virtual exhibition is flexible and can therefore be 
  supplemented at any time by topical applications.</p>
  <h1>Virtual Library And Publication Series</h1>
  <p>A further dimension of the future virtual museum is provided by the thematically 
  integrated publication forum. This is also based on the time-theme structure 
  of the medien.matrix and offers essays and illustrated 
  texts on the various topics. </p>
  <p>The virtual museum is thus supplemented by a digital publication series, 
  as it were, offering the necessary background to both the virtual and the 
  physical exhibition themes. Together these illustrated histories will ultimately 
  combine to provide a comprehensive history of the media in Central Europe, 
  material which will naturally be useful to the scientific community as well. 
 </p>
  <p>In this context, there are also plans for the creation of a complete digitized 
  library consisting of publications, theses and dissertations from all relevant 
  disciplines in cooperation with the various specialist institutions – university 
  institutes, libraries, archives or museums. This virtual library will offer 
  researchers not only a collection of literature but also a series of research 
  tools. </p>
  <p>A further element of the virtual museum is a complete object inventory,  
  intended for specialist users. It will offer researchers and other 
  interested parties the entire range of subject-specific collection objects 
  in a database structure with the necessary research tools. </p>
  <p>The involvement of scientific institutions is prompted by the idea of active 
  participation in the research process with a view to in return receiving the 
  latest findings and productions for exhibition purposes. An editor system 
  will also therefore be located at this scientific level to permit colleagues 
  from the various disciplines to publish their research findings in the virtual 
  library. </p>
  <p>The increasing flow of information received in this way will in turn be channeled 
  into the digital publication series or the virtual exhibition rooms and medien.matrix 
  texts, making them immediately accessible to visitors. </p>
  <h1>smart.card</h1>
  <p>A personal key to the virtual exhibition room will be provided in the form 
  of a smart.card. With this card, visitors will be 
  able to log on personally to the system and also make use of a number of additional 
  functions. In the first place, the smart.card can 
  be utilized as an orientation aid to show the way through the exhibition, 
  indicating the terminals that have already been visited and those that have 
  not yet been consulted. </p>
  <p>The smart.card also provides an individual address 
  for communication with other card holders. Above all, however, it offers an 
  individual depot for digital exhibition items from the virtual <em>medien.welten</em><em>:  </em>texts, images, audio documents, 
  etc. After the visit, the data collected in this way can be called up on the 
  Internet and downloaded from home. </p>
  <p>Finally, the smart.card also carries various special 
  features – for school groups, for example, who can use their cards for joint 
  research in the exhibition: the pupils can exchange information through the 
  communications function on the smart.card. </p>
  <p>For teachers, researchers or others with a particular interest in using the 
  extended areas of the virtual <em>medien.welten</em> 
  for study purposes, a gold smart.card with special 
  rights can also be issued. This smart.card gives 
  access to all texts in the library and digital publication series, to inventory 
  objects, and to specific research tools. It can be used in the Museum and 
  also externally via the Internet.</p>
  <p>The structure of the virtual <em>medien.welten</em> 
  will be Web-enabled for future placement on the Internet, although this feature 
  is not planned at present. For us, the virtual museum is initially an extension 
  of the Museum&#39;s own exhibition space into virtual rooms. This will offer more 
  space in general and also give greater scope for enhanced educational quality.</p>
