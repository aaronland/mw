  <h1>Science Bulletins: Cross-media Publishing of Current Science 
    Stories</h1>

      <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
        <p id="abstract"><em>Science Bulletins</em> is a unique cross-media publishing 
          program of the American Museum of Natural History that brings current 
          science to permanent exhibition halls in the Museum, informal learning 
          centers throughout the country, and, through the Science Bulletins Web 
          site, to everyone in the world. The three Science Bulletins – 
          <em>Astro, Earth, and Bio</em> – present ongoing research and recent 
          discoveries in astrophysics, Earth sciences, and biodiversity. Each 
          bulletin has three types of stories: features, data visualizations, 
          and news snapshots. The stories are updated on a weekly basis on high-definition 
          video displays and interactive kiosks in the halls, and on the Science 
          Bulletins’ Web site. The Science Bulletins’ Web site is assembled using 
          a new publishing system developed in-house using open source software. 
          The new publishing system replaces a third-party custom solution, and 
          incorporates the lessons learned from that first venture. In particular, 
          a clean separation of content and presentation provides flexibility 
          for the interface and feature set to evolve. The flexibility has allowed 
          the team to add new features, such as learning activities for each story, 
          published on the same schedule as the content.</p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Science Bulletins is a multi-media, cross-platform science program developed 
    to keep permanent exhibitions at the American Museum of Natural History and 
    other informal learning centers up to date with current science via high-resolution, 
    large screen media projections accompanied by interactive kiosk programs; 
    and via the Web, to communicate current science to the general public and 
    school settings. </p>
  <p>Created and produced by the Museum in partnership with NASA, The Science 
    Bulletins program explores recent discoveries and portrays ongoing research 
    in the fields of Astrophysics and Space Science (<em>Astro Bulletin</em>), Earth 
    Science (<em>Earth Bulletin</em>) and Biodiversity (<em>Bio Bulletin</em>). These 
    disciplines were selected because the Museum opened three major permanent 
    exhibitions in these areas in the late 1990s: The Hall of Biodiversity, the 
    Gottesman Hall of Planet Earth, and the Cullman Hall of the Universe. The 
    last two are part of the new Rose Center for Earth and Space, which opened 
    to the public in January 2000. In addition, these topics make sense because 
    scientists at the Museum have substantial research activities in these areas, 
    and because they span the range of research sponsored by NASA. </p>
  <p>Two key resources enable the Museum to produce and distribute Science Bulletins: 
    an in-house production crew and research scientists. Museum scientists play 
    an integral role in the creation of content for the Science Bulletins. An 
    Editorial Board, comprised of lead curators and chaired by the Museum&#39;s Provost 
    for Science, oversees the selection of current research projects for the Bulletins 
    to feature. These current research efforts are selected from across the scientific 
    disciplines pursued by Museum scientists. While Museum science work is occasionally 
    featured, it is not an exclusive focus. Bulletins&#39; audience learns about what 
    scientists at the Museum, at NASA centers, and at universities across the 
    country and around the world are doing. PhD scientists work on a day-to-day 
    basis to collaborate with the production group to create the content, and 
    lead curators review the content prior to distribution. </p>
  <p>A significant challenge early in the development of this current science 
    program was to define the word &#34;current&#34; in a meaningful way with respect 
    to both the process of scientific discovery and the production resources of 
    a museum. Our Museum is not a news bureau, nor would it become one in order 
    to create the Science Bulletins. In addition, while large scale events in 
    the natural world and breakthrough scientific discoveries are best served 
    by the rapid response capabilities of a news bureau, the typical progress 
    of scientific research and the rates of change of the natural world can be 
    captured at less frequent intervals. The solution was to evolve types of content 
    that update at different intervals using various levels of templated production 
    strategies. </p>
  <p>The three types of content developed currently are features, data visualizations, 
    and weekly updates. Feature stories are in-depth explorations of current science 
    topics, such as the evidence for water on Mars, and the newly discovered diversity 
    of jellyfish in the deep sea. New feature stories are produced every other 
    month. Data visualizations are animations that let people directly experience 
    large-scale natural phenomena, such as the structure of the universe in <em>AstroViz</em>, 
    the dynamism of the Earth in <em>EarthViz</em>, and the impact of human behavior 
    on the biosphere in <em>BioViz</em>. New data visualizations are produced every 
    month. Weekly updates, called <em>Snapshots</em>, are annotated images captured 
    by satellites, space probes, and observatories around the world and illustrate 
    breaking news about the universe, the Earth, and the biosphere. Each update 
    is published in the high-definition video programs on display at the Museum, 
    which are also distributed to over 20 subscribers around the country, and 
    on the Science Bulletins Web site. </p>
  <h2>Related Current Science Publishing Programs</h2>
  <p>It is worth noting that our development of three distinct story-types, or 
    templates, effectively sets Science Bulletins apart from other science centers&#39; 
    approach to current science programming. NASA&#39;s ViewSpace (HubbleSOURCE 2005), 
    for example, supplies daily updates of high definition astronomical images 
    to over 100 subscribing science centers. The concise format of ViewSpace emphasizes 
    currency and visually appealing data without revealing the scientific method 
    or the men and women engaged in the science behind the images. Similarly, 
    Earth in Near Real Time at Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum (Smithsonian 
    2003) presents current data that effectively illustrates our dynamic planet 
    without developing stories that explore the dynamic nature of science itself.</p>
  <p>The Boston Museum of Science&#39;s Current Science and Technology Center (Museum 
    of Science 2005) is different model for communicating current science, which 
    offers live museum events, digital exhibits and Web content. Diverse in format, 
    Boston&#39;s focus is science in the news, and their story formats reflect those 
    of traditional news media—text, image, video, and moderated discussion. In 
    contrast, Science Bulletins receives editorial guidance from the Museum&#39;s 
    own scientists to develop stories not covered in the mainstream media, and 
    to develop presentation formats, such as our data visualization story shells, 
    which require the interpretation and processing of raw scientific data.</p>
  <h2>Relation to Other Museum Publishing Efforts</h2>
  <p>The Science Bulletins Web site is the main entrance to our current science 
    content on the web, and is designed for the target audience of people of all 
    ages and backgrounds who are interested in current science topics. Another 
    Museum publishing effort, Resources for Learning (Gano et al, 2004), provides 
    a distinct entrance for another of our key audiences, educators. The two publishing 
    efforts intersect: each new Science Bulletins feature story 
    and data visualization becomes a new resource in the Resources for 
    Learning content repository soon after it is published. Metadata is created 
    for each story, including topic and subtopics that situate the story in our 
    catalog taxonomy, keywords that enable educators to search for specific subject 
    matter, and grade level and teaching time indicators that help educators know 
    if the story is appropriate for their students. Educators can quickly find 
    Science Bulletins stories, and other materials, about a particular science 
    topic by using the search or browse features. They can also browse the entire 
    collection of Science Bulletins stories in its Resources for Learning 
    index (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/bulletins/">http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/bulletins/</a>), which allows them 
    to sort the stories by topic, title, resource type, and grade level. Having 
    Science Bulletins cataloged in Resources for Learning also makes those stories 
    available for special collections tied to other topics, such as the special 
    collection produced to supplement PBS&#39;s four-part NOVA series, <em>Origins</em>. 
    (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/programs/origins/">http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/programs/origins/</a>) Through the Resources 
    for Learning framework, Science Bulletins stories 
    find new purposes and new audiences.</p>
  <h1>Science Bulletin&#39;s Content Production</h1>
  <p>The production team utilizes a range of tools to meet the different update 
    intervals of the program. Weekly <em>Snapshots </em>are created with Viz RT, 
    a real time high-definition graphics rendering software package. The software 
    enables the team to produce the weekly Snapshots on a timely basis without 
    the added hours of render time usually associated with high-resolution media. 
    These high-definition Snapshots are also encoded as interactive Flash movies 
    to post on the Web along with resource links that enable users to learn more 
    about each story.</p>
  <p>By contrast, the Data Viz segments, which are produced on a monthly basis, 
    are created largely in Maya, a 3-D animation software package. These segments 
    incorporate large amounts of high-resolution data presented in three dimensions, 
    such as on a globe, or flying through space. Low-resolution drafts of each 
    segment are produced and reviewed before the high-definition piece is finally 
    rendered on a &#34;render farm&#34;. The render farm is a bank of computers configured 
    by the Museum to produce high-resolution animations for several projects, 
    including the Space Shows presented in the Hayden Planetarium&#39;s digital dome. 
    The Data Viz segments are also encoded as Flash movies for the Web and published 
    alongside supporting text and resource links.</p>
  <p>Six high-definition Feature videos are shot on location each year. The high-definition 
    media is transferred to lower resolution DV Cam tapes, which are loaded onto 
    an Avid non-linear edit system for of editing. Once picture and audio are 
    locked, an edit decision list is generated in the Avid and transferred to 
    Piranha, a real time high-definition video editing 
    software. The final, high-resolution video is conformed on Piranha, while 
    the audio is mixed and sweetened using a Pro Tools system. Concurrently, companion 
    essays are developed and written, and interactive graphics are created in 
    Flash, to be posted on the Web and kiosk along with the feature video for 
    added depth and interactive exploration. The feature video is compressed significantly 
    for streaming on the Web, and is offered in high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth 
    versions.</p>
  <p>Each week, a new high-definition video program is compiled for each of the 
    <em>Astro, Bio, and Earth</em> Bulletins, with the weekly Snapshot updates, 
    and any new Feature or DataViz story. The program is encoded in MPEG-2 format, 
    which supports studio-quality high-definition video playback, and is transferred 
    to a high-definition video server for playback at the Museum. The program 
    is also transmitted to a caching server at the National Center for Supercomputing 
    Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana. From 
    there the Science Bulletins video program is sent to 20-plus <em>Science Bulletins</em> 
    subscribers at science museums and science centers around the country.</p>
  <p>The technical challenges of publishing and distributing high-definition video 
    are significant, but not subtle. The huge video files are transmitted to NCSA 
    over high-bandwidth Internet-2 lines. The high-definition video servers at 
    subscriber sites automatically download new content overnight when it becomes 
    available. From there, the video program plays in a continuous loop through 
    whatever high-definition video playback devices the subscriber chooses.</p>
  <p>Publishing interactive multimedia content to the Web and kiosk is also a 
    significant challenge, primarily because of the challenge of designing effective 
    user interfaces for an audience with a wide range of abilities to use interactive 
    technology, and on delivery platforms that constantly offer new and better 
    interface technologies. The rest of this paper will describe the evolution 
    of Science Bulletin&#39;s Web and kiosk publishing over its seven-year life span. 
  </p>
  <h1>Publishing Science Bulletins On The Web And Kiosk</h1>
  <p>The Science Bulletins Web and kiosk publishing program is in its third incarnation. 
    The Museum&#39;s Hall of Biodiversity opened in 1997, and introduced Science Bulletins 
    with the Bio Bulletin high-definition video wall and kiosks in the exhibit 
    hall, and the Bio Bulletins Web site. A second version of the Web and kiosk 
    were developed for the opening of the Hall of Planet Earth in 1999 and the 
    Hall of the Universe in 2000. The third version of the Science Bulletins Web 
    site was launched in July 2004, and a new kiosk will be introduced in the 
    summer of 2005.</p>
  <h2>Version One: Single solution for Web and kiosk</h2>
  <p>In this first version, the kiosk and Web content were identical. The kiosks 
    presented the Bio Bulletin Web site in a Web browser, with a track ball and 
    button interface. The Web site design by Media Farm, a New York design firm, 
    was simple, clear, and appealing. Feature stories included short video clips, 
    images, and several written essays on topics ranging from horseshoe crabs 
    to wooly mammoths. Page templates and a simple custom publishing tool made 
    it easy for Science Bulletins staff to produce and publish new stories. And 
    because the same Web pages were used for both the Web and kiosk, one publication 
    served audiences on the Web and in the museum.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="gano1.jpg" width="400" height="319" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: The first BioBulletin"/></p><p class="caption">Fig. 1: The first BioBulletin, a single solution for Web 
          and kiosk. <a target="_blank" href="http://sciencebulletins.amnh.org/biobulletin/biobulletin/story662.html">http://sciencebulletins.amnh.org/biobulletin/biobulletin/story662.html</a>] 
        </p>
  <p>But Web browsers do not make for robust and easy-to-use kiosks. Web browsers 
    in the 1990s could not run for long periods of time, as kiosks must, without 
    crashing. Unless they are severely constrained by custom configuration, Web 
    browsers offer open invitations for visitors to surf the Web. And Web browsers 
    are not ideal user interfaces in settings where users are standing at arm&#39;s 
    length from the screen, in a public space where many other sights and sounds 
    compete for their attention.</p>
  <p>Page designs and user interfaces that work for the Web do not work as well 
    in a kiosk setting. Kiosk users need larger graphics, fewer and larger buttons, 
    and much less text in a much larger font. Using a typical kiosk in a museum 
    exhibit hall has more in common with watching television at home – viewing 
    and acting at a distance, wavering attention, and the need for simple choices 
    that can be made without concentrated focus. However, Web browsers can be 
    useful in a museum setting if the visitors are permitted to sit close to the 
    monitor and focus intently, as they would with their home or office computer, 
    or with a book. This was, in fact, the setting for the first Bio Bulletin 
    kiosks.</p>
  <h2>Version Two: A Custom System, Built To Order</h2>
  <p>For the next two Science Bulletins, the kiosks would be integrated into the 
    exhibit environment, to be used while standing. In the Hall of Planet Earth, 
    which opened in June 1999, the kiosks were placed directly below the high-definition 
    video wall that played Science Bulletins content. This setting demanded a 
    different kiosk interface design. Also, our experience with the first kiosk 
    prompted a desire to have more interactive visual content, and to have that 
    content more closely correlated with what visitors saw on the video wall. 
    The Earth Bulletin Web site would still offer in-depth essays, along with 
    video and interactive content shared with the kiosk. This new approach meant 
    that, at some point in the production process, the methods of publishing to 
    the Web and to the kiosk would diverge.</p>
  <p>An Australian firm, Magian Design Studio, was contracted to design a new 
    kiosk interface, Web site, and an integrated publishing system to produce 
    them both. They also contributed to the technical and creative design of the 
    media content for the video wall, kiosk, and Web. The kiosk and Web would 
    present feature stories in four themes that were central to the big ideas 
    of the hall. For Hall of the Universe, the themes were Universe, Galaxies, 
    Stars, and Planets. For the Hall of Planet Earth, they were Volcanoes, Storms, 
    Earthquakes, and Earth Works (for stories on space-based Earth observation). 
    As new stories were published, prior stories remained available through the 
    Archive section of the kiosk and Web.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="gano2.jpg" width="400" height="320" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: EarthBulletin kiosk"/></p>      <p class="caption">Fig 2: A screen shot of the EarthBulletin kiosk, version 
          two </p>      
        <p class="caption"><img src="gano3.jpg" width="400" height="410" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: An Earth Bulletin feature story"/></p>
        <p class="caption"> Fig 3: An Earth Bulletin feature story on the Web 
          site, version two. <a target="_blank" href="http://earthbulletin.amnh.org/D/2/index.html">http://earthbulletin.amnh.org/D/2/index.html</a></p>
  <p>This system operated splendidly during the first few years of use. However, 
    as we gained more experience producing Science Bulletins stories, and evaluating 
    kiosk and Web visitor responses to the stories, the concept of what Science 
    Bulletins stories should be, and how they should be presented, was changing. 
    Many good story opportunities did not fit neatly into a single exhibit hall 
    theme. Also, the Bulletins&#39; editorial board encouraged us to include more 
    frequent news stories about current science topics, and to present more stories 
    based on visualization of real data. </p>
  <p>The new kiosk and Web interface would present three types of stories: features, 
    news, and data visualizations. Feature stories would continue to be in-depth 
    treatments of topics, led by a five- to seven-minute video documentary, and 
    augmented by interactives on the kiosk and Web, and by essays on the Web. 
    News stories would be concise reports on current events. Data visualizations 
    would be animated visualizations of data from Earth and space-based observing 
    and monitoring instruments that showed large-scale phenomena, such as changes 
    in the Earth&#39;s ozone layer or the structure of the universe.</p>
  <p>The development work to implement these revisions proceeded incrementally, 
    and was done by local contractors. Web and kiosk interface changes were made 
    successfully, and the publishing system was updated to publish the new format. 
    The original publishing system was not very supple or easy to change, largely 
    because the capability to update the user interface or change the story model 
    was not made a requirement of the original system. After these modifications, 
    and a change in the Museum&#39;s internal network configuration, the publishing 
    system no longer reliably published to the kiosks. The Science Bulletins&#39; 
    staff had to work with Museum engineering teams to manually publish new kiosk 
    stories, and to fix kiosk problems when the process failed, as it often did.</p>
  <p>While there were increasing difficulties publishing the interactive content, 
    the high-definition video content was produced on a regular schedule, and 
    was winning awards. In partnership with NASA, we began to distribute the high-definition 
    content by subscription to other science centers and museums throughout the 
    country. Currently, the program has over 20 subscribers, and is growing. More 
    information about the Science Bulletins subscription program can be found 
    on the Science Bulletins Web site, at <a target="_blank" href="http://sciencebulletins.amnh.org/distribution/">http://sciencebulletins.amnh.org/distribution/</a>.</p>
  <p>From the start of this distribution program, it was our intention to distribute 
    the kiosk content along with the high-definition video program. However, we 
    had to first solve the problems introduced by the publishing system modifications 
    before the kiosk could be reliably published. Moreover, the original program 
    design did not lend itself to efficient distribution. Publishing a new story 
    necessitated a full rebuild of the kiosk program, and made it more vulnerable 
    to breakdowns, which would require more customer support than our group is 
    able to provide. To provide kiosk content to subscribers who have requested 
    it, we produce and mail DVD-ROMs with the latest content. This is clearly 
    not a long-term solution.</p>
  <p>The need to efficiently distribute and update Science Bulletins kiosk content, 
    plus the desire to update the Web site to include all of the content developed 
    for the wall and the kiosk, prompted the National Center to undertake a third 
    major redesign of the Web site and kiosk, and to develop a new publishing 
    system for both.</p>
  <h2>Version Three: More Flexibility Through In-House 
    Development</h2>
  <p>With our accumulated experience in producing Science Bulletins and in repairing 
    and maintaining its publishing infrastructure, we could easily define some 
    important goals for a new system. </p>
  <p>It was important to unify the story structure across all three Bulletins 
    to make Science Bulletins a more coherent product and a more distinct Museum 
    brand. Wherever people would encounter Science Bulletins – on the Web or in 
    an exhibit hall, at our museum or at any of our subscribers&#39; installations 
    – they would see a feature story, a current science news Snapshot, and a 
    data visualization. We also contracted a local design firm, Flat Inc., 
    to create a simple but elegant new logo that would work in high-definition 
    video as well as on the Web and kiosk screens, and in print.</p>
  <p>Our experience showed that, no matter how happy we might be with today&#39;s 
    user interface, we will want to change it in the future, whether to incorporate 
    some new interface technology, or just to update its look and feel. We wanted 
    to minimize the impact such changes would have on the publishing system and 
    the production process.</p>
  <p>And it was important to create a kiosk distribution system that would let 
    subscribers easily install the software and receive the weekly updates efficiently. 
    A simple, Web-based kiosk administration application would let subscribers 
    manage their kiosks, select which stories to present on the kiosk, and, hopefully, 
    overcome most problems they might encounter with content updates over the 
    Internet, and so help minimize the need for customer support.</p>
  <p>The key strategy for meeting these goals is to make as clean a separation 
    between content and presentation as possible. Each story type will have a 
    clear definition of its intent and scope, and a set of content components 
    that can represent it well in a range of presentations – title, a brief description, 
    key images in a range of sizes, a set of media files, and so on, and these 
    elements will be stored in a database and linked media files. For a story&#39;s 
    Web presentation, a small number of page templates are created: these draw 
    from those basic story components, and minimize the need for any Web-specific 
    media. For the kiosk, a navigational shell is created, a &#34;skin&#34;, which is 
    lightweight and fast, and, most important, easy to replace with new or better 
    kiosk navigation ideas. As much as possible, the Web and kiosk will use the 
    same media files and text content.</p>
  <p>The Web site redesign was begun first because it was to be the most comprehensive 
    of the three publication formats, and would potentially have the largest audience. 
    We contracted with a local Web designer, Anna Arbuckle, who quickly produced 
    a clean, crisp look and feel for the Web site and a comprehensive style manual 
    to guide our further work.</p>
  <p>In parallel, we began designing a new Web publishing system for the Web, 
    and in doing so, began to look more closely at the story types, specifically 
    what the distinct nature of each story was and how best to present it on the 
    Web. We looked at good examples of regular publications on the Web, such as 
    <em>Time Magazine</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>, to learn how they presented 
    stories with multiple media elements. Working from Anna&#39;s first Web design, 
    we changed the emphasis of certain story elements, gathered media elements 
    together in a single navigation scheme, and included new features that we 
    hadn&#39;t considered before the first Web design, such as a map showing the location 
    of a given story. This was a lively, iterative process of meetings, e-mails, 
    and cobbled-together Photoshop files to illustrate our ideas, with input from 
    all groups: the editorial, production, and development teams.</p>
  <p>Once we established a consensus on the Web site architecture, we had strayed 
    somewhat from Anna&#39;s original page grid system, and so we contracted with 
    her for a second round of work. Though she did not agree with all of our choices, 
    Anna worked closely with the development team to reestablish a crisp, clean 
    design discipline on the new architecture, to produce the page designs that 
    we use today.</p>
  <p>It is easy in retrospect to see that the Web architecture specification that 
    we gave Anna for her first design was incomplete. But it can be difficult 
    to make definitive design decisions until you see them fully rendered on the 
    screen, especially when making significant changes in the product concept 
    as we were with Science Bulletins. One must plan for several iterations of 
    design and review, and include evaluation with target users, however informally.</p>

  <p>Once the page designs were nailed down, work on the publishing system proceeded 
    rapidly. The in-house development team, technical producer Matt Tarr and technical 
    developer Drew Koning, used our open-source Web application 
    platform of MySQL and PHP to create simple Web forms for uploading and editing 
    Bulletins content. They adapted some of the functions and user interface elements 
    developed for administering another Web site, <em>Resources for Learning</em>. 
    With the publishing tools, Science Bulletins producers can quickly upload 
    media files, lay out multiple page essays with embedded images or interactives, 
    produce a feature story glossary, and immediately preview their edits.</p>
  <p>The Science Bulletins production staff is small and works in the same office, 
    and already had well-established practices about ownership of production tasks 
    and communicating status and needs. Some common features of publishing systems, 
    such as version control and communications functions, were not prescribed, 
    which helped reduce complexity and development time. For our simple, custom 
    publishing tools, the emphasis was on simplicity and flexibility, and the 
    ability to extend features to meet new, unanticipated editorial and production 
    needs. </p>
  <p>For example, a few months after the new Science Bulletins Web site was launched 
    in July 2004, the National Center began a new pilot project to evaluate the 
    use of the Science Bulletins Web site in middle and high schools. For the 
    pilot, each story would have two or more learning activities that suggested 
    ways to use the story in the classroom. A new page was added to each story 
    and listed the learning activities and provided related links to NASA and 
    Museum content related to the story. The publishing system was extended to 
    publish these new pages, and to enable a new user role, the learning activities 
    producer, which had limited editing options. This update was accomplished 
    in-house over a few weeks, more quickly and less expensively than it might 
    have been with a commercial system or outside developers.</p>
  <p>Between the system launch in April 2004 and January 2005, five feature stories, 
    eight Data Viz stories, and over 100 Snapshot stories have been published 
    with the publishing system. But additional work remains before the entire 
    means of production is in the hands of the editorial and production staff. 
    Some of the media production tasks, such as producing closed captions for 
    the on-line video, are still done by the technical staff. </p>
  <p>The next major development project for Science Bulletins has already begun: 
    the creation of production templates for interactive versions of the Data 
    Viz and Snapshot stories. Currently, these stories appear on the Web as streaming 
    video animations, just as they appear on the video wall. Our goal is to enable 
    Web visitors to interact directly with the data to gain deeper insights into 
    the topic, and to experience to some degree the same analyses that scientists 
    use on the data. The challenge will be to create interactive templates that 
    enable such interaction, but which can also be produced by the small Bulletins 
    staff at the same frequency and quality as they are now.</p>
  <p>As of January 2005, the new Science Bulletins kiosk and kiosk distribution 
    system is still in development. Several functional prototypes have been built, 
    each with the goal of making the interface simpler and more engaging than 
    the last one. In a formal user interface evaluation in May 2004, we learned 
    a number of surprising things, such as the visitor&#39;s desire to use the kiosk 
    to control the high-definition video wall, as if the kiosk were a remote control. 
    This finding suggests that we&#39;ve met our design goal of making the correspondence 
    between video wall and kiosk clearer, but still have some work to do. The 
    current prototype retains that clear correspondence while offering distinct 
    ways to explore the material presented on the video wall. </p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>The recurring theme in <em>Science Bulletins&#39;</em> development over its lifespan 
    has been, like the Earth, the biosphere, and the universe itself, one of constant 
    evolution. The story format concept has, over several years, converged on 
    the current configuration of in-depth feature story, visualizations of real 
    data that represent large-scale phenomena, and concise snapshots of recent 
    events and discoveries, and that configuration seems solid and likely to last 
    for a while. But the technology for presenting those stories continues to 
    advance steadily, and so must the publishing tools and templates. By keeping 
    the publishing system simple, flexible, and homegrown, we hope to be able 
    to assimilate new and better ideas of how to bring current science content 
    to a wider audience.</p>
  <p>The real product of these efforts is not a new Web site or a publishing system, 
    which we know to be ephemeral, but rather an improved institutional capacity 
    for media publishing. If digital media production and publishing are to be 
    core competencies of an organization, the organization must develop institutional 
    practices that it can depend on for the long term. The first step toward that 
    development is to build a skilled team that can discover and define the best 
    practices in support of the institution&#39;s goals. The practices become institutionalized, 
    and the competency becomes core, when new team members flow through the process, 
    learn from it, add to it, and keep it evolving.</p>
