  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Despite the continuing attachment of galleries and museums to the single 
    author, several factors create apertures for the exhibition of collaboratively 
    created and participant-driven new media in the gallery world. New media art 
    is no longer a specialization but instead a wide range of practices. As new 
    media becomes ubiquitous, many media and visual artists are engaging with 
    this art form, and the curators working with them are responding to this reality. 
    For example, Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller&#39;s <em>The Paradise Institute</em>, 
    commissioned by Wayne Baerwaldt, and then presented together with the Plug 
    In ICA, Canada, at the Venice Biennale, won <strong>La Biennale di Venezia Special 
    Award</strong> in 2001. The prize was bestowed for &#34;involving the audience 
    in a new cinematic experience where fiction and reality, technology and the 
    body converge into multiple and shifting journeys through space and time.&#34; 
    <em>Paradise Institute</em> &#34;borrows from installation, video projection,&#34; 
    as well as digital audio and video and by fusing &#34;sculpture and performance, 
    the artists effectively function as movie directors, screenwriters, composers, 
    and radio play producers.&#34;  (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.banffcentre.ca/wpg/exhibits/past.htm">http://www.banffcentre.ca/wpg/exhibits/past.htm</a>, 
    2001, 2005)  One can also argue that curators working with living artists 
    are engaged in an inherently collaborative practice - effective exhibition 
    expects an engaged relationship with the artists, their method of working, 
    as well as their final works. </p>
  <p>This essay will discuss issues surrounding collaborative exchange - as they 
    relate to artistic and cultural production, shifts in the understanding of 
    authorship, as well as the cultural contexts of communities - and the consequences 
    of these issues for curatorial practice. Some new media works emerge from 
    highly collaborative practices, where isolating one individual artist-leader 
    is not desirable and works against the grain of the work and its processes. 
    More and more curators, as well as outreach departments at institutions, acknowledge 
    the importance of direct engagement with the development process of art for 
    sustaining audience interest and raising awareness of the discursive and contributory 
    qualities of new media creation and distribution. Access to and active use 
    of the Web is moving from marketing departments, to education departments 
    and now, finally, to curators (Cook and Diamond, 2004).</p>
  <h1>Collaboration</h1>
  <p>Collaboration makes all roles in the creative and presentation process more 
    discursive, demanding more openness, consciousness of process, and acceptance 
    of less predictable results. These conclusions stem from numerous presentations 
    and discussions at the Participate! Collaborate! Participatory Design Summit 
    at The Banff Centre, Banff New Media Institute (BNMI), September 30th 
    to October 3rd, 2004.  They are also reinforced by discussions 
    on the Web site of the New Media Collaboration Studies Network, the Banff 
    Centre administration research Web site.  Hence, the role of curators is constantly 
    questioned - they are commissioner or producer, and arguably contributor; 
    they shape the artwork during its production process, rather than creating 
    context for completed works (Cook, 2005). Net artists directly challenged 
    the role of the curator by arguing that the Net, combined with self-organization 
    by artists, was a replacement for an obsolete intermediary role of the curator. 
    Early net artists and their groups, such as Amex, Backstreet, Technologies 
    to the People and irrational.org , held listserve text debates, intervened 
    into on-line environments where they disrupted commercial hierarchies and 
    redirected search engines, or undertook software hacks. The environment that 
    provided them with the material for their artistic practice also was the space 
    in which this work was &#39;exhibited.&#39; </p>
  <p>In 1998, at the <em>Curating and Conserving New Media</em> conference held 
    at the Banff New Media Institute, Vuk Cosic, Heath Bunting and others declared 
    that net art was dead, in part because of curators&#39; newly focused interest 
    in this practice. On the other end of the spectrum, the fact that Barbara 
    London, media arts curator at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, had herself 
    begun to use the Web as a diary in planning her exhibitions, may have been 
    equally provocative (Ditta, 1998). London documented her travels through China 
    and her curatorial musings on these well before blogging became an acceptable 
    practice for professionals. Over half a decade later, curator Sarah Cook routinely 
    used blogs, instant messaging, and mobile communication to plan with a group 
    of artists a highly collaborative show about re-enactment. Their dialogues 
    are culled and published as part of the &#34;re-enactment&#34; of the exhibition itself, 
    revealing the emergence of a coherent exhibition strategy that relies on debates 
    and dialogues. The show will open at The Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, 
    UK, in 2005 (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.balticmill.com/">http://www.balticmill.com/</a>).  Artists&#39; works and 
    interventions into the Internet remain consistent. Curatorial new media practice 
    has continued the trend of the last two decades, during which curators have 
    increasingly worked as non-hierarchical teams in the contemporary art world.</p>
  <p>Collaboration also manifests itself in the numerous artist/engineer or artist/scientist 
    dyads that produce work together, among them Jocelyn Robert and Émile Morin 
    or Ben Rubin and Mark Hansen. In 2001, I commissioned Morin and Robert to 
    create <em>La Salle des Noeuds III</em><em>,</em> a video relay and early Global 
    Positioning System (GPS) art work that was coupled with a second commission,<em> 
    <em>n-Cha(n)t</em> </em>by David Rokeby (which eventually won the Golden Nica 
    at Ars Electronica), for a show entitled <em>Computer Voices/Speaking Machines</em>. 
     This show is elaborated in the catalogue for Computer Voices/Speaking 
    Machines, Walter Phillips Gallery and Banff Centre Press, 2001 and documentation 
    remains on the site at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.banffcentre.ca/wpg/exhibits/2001/0519_computer_voices/">http://www.banffcentre.ca/wpg/exhibits/2001/0519_computer_voices/</a> 
    (Diamond). The exhibition suggested that the voice is our fundamental means 
    of communication. It proposed that voice is one of the most enduring human 
    technologies, expressed through speech and music. The artists involved made 
    use of video surveillance and relay technologies, GPS data and tracking, voice 
    recognition and artificial intelligence. They transformed voice, speech, and 
    song. <em>La Salle des Noeuds III</em> used electrical relays to transmit sounds 
    and images from the Internet within an elegant sculpture of strings that play 
    and move with these signals. In <em>La Salle</em><em> des Noeuds III</em>, GPS 
    weather patterns drive a player piano, and a real-time video relay is improvised 
    between artists in Quebec and Banff.</p>
  <p>In <em>n-Cha(n)t</em>, <strong>David Rokeby</strong><strong> </strong>created a networked 
    community of language-capable artificial agents that make their own associations 
    as punsters, poets, and experts. The chorus of computers chants from the database 
    and adapts to the input given by audience members speaking into the computers&#39; 
    microphones, gradually reconciling their multiple voices. In both works, the 
    audience&#39;s voices drove the actions of the machines, which performed in a 
    semi-autonomous way, suggesting the limits of human agency and the eerie and 
    eloquent voices of computers. These works reconstituted concepts of voice, 
    identity, and free speech at the same time as they addressed the threat of 
    the loss of voice at the turn of the Millennium. The show worked well in a 
    gallery context because it beckoned, intrigued without interaction, and then 
    was raised to yet another level of meaning when audiences &#34;completed&#34; 
    the works. </p>
  <p>Creating with technology demands both deeper levels of specialization and 
    greater levels of collaboration between people with creative and technical 
    expertise. For example, the Bridges Consortium, a joint project of the USC 
    Annenberg Center for Communication and the Banff New Media Institute, worked 
    based on the belief that the great challenge of convergence is not technology, 
    but communication between people (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.annenberg.edu/bridges/">http://www.annenberg.edu/bridges/</a>, 
    2001). Just as technology further enables global multi-cultures and economies, 
    the challenges of communication become even more urgent. Differences in work 
    and communication styles, priorities, educational principles, institutional 
    frameworks, temperaments, and fundamental beliefs and values have the potential 
    to become either obstacles or stimulants to effective collaboration. Bridges 
    pinpointed collaboration itself as a skill to be identified, studied, and 
    learned, and proposed practical strategies for including it as a vital component 
    in education, creation, and research. Collaboration identifies best practices, 
    amplifies networks and provides a means of communication for those engaged 
    in the reality of research across disciplines, borders, and cultural contexts. 
    While increased philosophical support for interdisciplinary practice is part 
    of the rhetoric of businesses and universities, cross-disciplinary collaborators 
    across the arts, social sciences, and sciences still struggle to achieve recognition 
    for and understanding of their research and creative work together. Moving 
    away from rhetoric into realization still requires much work on the part of 
    the gallery and museum. </p>
  <h1>Blurring the Lines</h1>
  <p>What happens when project teams extend beyond the dyad? The contribution 
    of scientists and engineers deeply influence the final artwork. Some works 
    double as scientific research and artistic research. Attribution can defy 
    grasp; roles stretch, and romanticism can enter the picture. What then, is 
    the role of the technologist, engineer, or computer scientist within the collaborative 
    team? New terminology is needed to acknowledge, when appropriate, the fundamental 
    role that technologists play in their collaboration with artists. Scientists 
    claim artistic identities and artists scientific ones. This is not necessarily 
    a wise strategy at all times. Instead, acknowledging the role that each field 
    of knowledge plays in creation may be wiser, more accurate, and ultimately 
    more useful as a map of the creative process. These collaborations at times 
    do shake hierarchies that consistently place science on top. At other times, 
    they decorate science. The organization ASCI (Arts &amp; Science Collaborations, 
    Inc.) tries to provide a forum to talk about art and science (not just new 
    media) collaborations and extract systems that work from positive examples 
    (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.asci.org/">http://www.asci.org/</a>, 2005). The key 
    point is that leadership shifts between the artist and the technologist. Artists 
    are often afraid of admitting to this shift because they come from behind 
    in their relatively low position of authority compared to the technologist. 
    They fear invisibility.</p>
  <p>In many of the collaboratively produced projects, the pieces are ultimately 
    completed in collaboration<em> </em>with the audience<em>. Medulla Intimata</em>, 
    video jewelry created by Tom Donaldson and Tina Gonsalves as part of their 
    recent <em>Clutch</em> project, was shown at ISEA 2004 (Inter-Society for the 
    Electronic Arts) and then at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in London. 
    Clutch is a co-production with The Banff Centre that emerged through matchmaking 
    - joining the artist and the engineer in a creative team and even suggesting 
    the object of research. Since that time, with ongoing financial and critical 
    support from Banff and other funding agencies, they have created different 
    iterations of the project and tested its presentation in public contexts. 
    This piece relies on audience interaction with the wearer. The ICA placed 
    the team in three different contexts in their club. The first was a casual 
    bar night, the second a music night, and the third a film and video night 
    during which the wearers (Donaldson and Gonsalves) worked the room. The jewelry 
    switches layers of poignant and personal video images embedded in it based 
    on the voice tone of the interacting audience and the wearer. This artwork 
    is simultaneously performative and responsive, and the wearers are as vulnerable 
    as their inter-actors (once they realize that they are affecting the video 
    image of the jewelry). Their sense of presence or boredom, their alienation 
    or attraction to their interlocutor, as well as the rhythm of the conversation, 
    become visible – engagements with others intensify or fade quickly. </p>
  <p>Within engineering practice, scientists often test the technologies that 
    they create, either in their research team or in more formal usability tests. 
    It is of interest that Donaldson, an engineer, uses the term <em>engineer / 
    artist</em> in his credit, in part, because he is featured in the video imagery 
    and becomes a performer of the work. How does the vulnerability of engineers 
    or scientists in an experiment, rather than their assumed objectivity, shift 
    the outcomes of scientific practice and the technologies that they are part 
    of designing? How does the usability testing of wearing the necklace in a 
    performance influence engineering design? How does it differ from usability 
    tests conducted in an engineering context? Where can the concept of usability 
    testing float in curatorial concepts? How does this dialogue fit into the 
    discourse that the curator constructs around the artwork? What negotiations 
    would an artist need to undertake to receive an engineering credit on such 
    a project, were it submitted for scientific review?</p>
  <h1>Authorized Authors</h1>
  <p>Historically and traditionally, curators authorize objects, guaranteeing 
    their authenticity, and placing them within a trajectory of cultural value. 
    According to the US Department of 
    Labor (2003),<strong><em></em></strong></p>
        <p>Curators oversee collections in museums, zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens, 
          nature centres, and historic sites. They acquire items through purchases, 
          gifts, field exploration, inter-museum exchanges, or, in the case of 
          some plants and animals, reproduction. Curators also plan and prepare 
          exhibits… Their work involves describing and classifying… 
          Increasingly, curators are expected to participate in grant writing 
          and fundraising to support their projects… Some curators maintain 
          the collection, others do research, and others perform administrative 
          tasks… In small institutions, with only one or a few curators, 
          one curator may be responsible for multiple tasks, from maintaining 
          collections to directing the affairs of museums… Most curators 
          use the Internet to make information available to other curators and 
          the public. </p>
  <p>Museums collect, and hence, contain both the aura of objects and individual 
    humans&#39; creative lives. Curators have the onerous task of providing back-up 
    for the historical significance of their choices through the designation of 
    historical movements and tendencies. Despite the incredibly fragmenting force 
    of post-modernism, museums primarily continue to frame the artist as a unique 
    and creative individual, somehow able to channel the future as well as the 
    moment. Art history and exhibitions rely on descriptions and categories; the 
    curator&#39;s job is also to analyze and create genre. While audiences are of 
    vast importance to museums, the idea of their participation in actually making 
    the artwork is antithetical to the traditional division of labor between producing 
    artist and reading / receiving audience.</p>
  <p>Yet curators inside the gallery and museum systems continue to work with 
    new media artists who favour collaborative forms as well as audience participation 
    in their own practice. The transient nature of the <em>object</em>, its tendencies 
    to emphasize process over product, its dependencies - more than other art 
    works - on the lateral, shared quality of authoring offer challenges to the 
    role of museums to establish values. This brings instability to new media 
    programs in museums, as seen by the unfortunate dissolution of the Walker&#39;s 
    excellent new media program and the loss of other media arts exhibition venues 
    (the National Gallery of Canada no longer has a dedicated media arts curator, 
    for example.) However, significant museums such as the Guggenheim, the Museum 
    of the Moving Image, the Whitney, the Barbican, ICA London, the Tate, all 
    continue to experiment with the challenges of exhibition and collection posed 
    by participatory new media.</p>
  <p>Exhibitions also take place in numerous venues devoted to new media arts 
    worldwide. In 2004, ITAU Cultural in Sao Paulo, Brazil, organized the third 
    &#39;Emoção Art.ficial 0.3,&#39; the Brazilian Media Art Biennial - a production, 
    exhibition, and conference presentation of The Itau Lab (part of Itau Cultural), 
    led by Marcos Cuzziol, Guilherme Kujawski and André Lemos. Unlike previous 
    versions of the exhibition, the 2004 show layered new media and participatory 
    design with socially engaged art and coding practice from Brazil 
    and other contexts. Eight of the exhibition projects were commissioned new 
    works from Brazil. The show was popular 
    with a wide range of audiences and demanded and received hours of engagement. 
  </p>
  <h1>Productive Exclusions</h1>
  <p>The idea that creativity, prescience, vision, and aura could reside with 
    a group is still challenging to visual art. Design by committee, or central 
    committee, seems to be feared by an art world that bases market value on individual 
    achievement. Yet notions of the collective are fundamental to the post-war 
    American understanding of the artist and avant-garde. The movements of the 
    1930s, such as surrealism, may have had leaders - André Breton to be specific, 
    John Heartfield before him - but operated as cohesive collectives with shared 
    aesthetics, methodologies, and projects. Artistic ventures into emerging technologies 
    have had a collaborative immanence, from the Futurists to General Idea and 
    the video collectives of the last century.</p>
  <p>The 1990s saw a wave of change that shifted the role of the curator in the 
    contemporary art context. Jobs in institutions were sewn up, and new graduates 
    from art history and contemporary criticism programs had to survive on the 
    periphery. An educated new breed of curators perhaps even preferred to work 
    outside of the traditional institution, opening an alternate world of presentation 
    in artists&#39; centers, new galleries, and inventive public locations. When they 
    at last went to work for the museum, they brought a critically engaged practice 
    to the inside of the institution, investigating its assumptions. They also 
    brought an interest in the periphery to the centre (Lunenfeld, 2000)<em>. </em>This 
    periphery would begin to include new media art by the second half of the 1990s.</p>
  <p>In a sense, shifts in curatorial understanding set the stage for collaborative 
    new media projects to enter the more traditional art world. Curators built 
    themed exhibitions, drawing from and building on critical theory; the curator&#39;s 
    text at times became as important as the artworks themselves, or the artists. 
    Many curators saw and still see their interventions in exhibition space as 
    a practice as creative and central as the artwork. This fits well with a collaborative 
    approach to exhibition commissioning, design, and dialogue. Exhibitions were 
    and are a discursive space. The boundaries of the artwork were blurring, softened 
    by the dialogue that swirled around them. The artist, the critic, the curator, 
    sat on each other&#39;s laps. Authorship had become a negotiated space. Reception 
    theory in particular underscored the experience of the audience; but it was 
    not the audience alone who was engaged in the active space of making meanings 
    (or remaking them). </p>
  <p>Not all museums were open to the invigorating demands that media art exerted 
    on audiences and resources in the 1990s - particularly when it came to engaged 
    and activist media art. It would 
    be curators that would pull net art into the museum and Biennial context, 
    into Documenta, the Venice and Sao Paulo Biennale, and the Whitney Biennial. 
    In <em>Naming a Practice: Two</em> Steve Dietz, Victoria Vesna and I discuss 
    the problem of authorization. Some saw the inclusion of net artists Vuk Cosic 
    and Heath Bunting in Documenta X  as gratuitous (Diamond, Dietz, Vesna, Townsend, 
    2003; Thomas, 2002). The Internet and then the <em>visual Internet</em> - the 
    Web -  had attracted artists from the get go, and projects / groups such as 
    the Electronic Café International set the stage for exchanges between locations 
    and groups of performers, writers, and visual artists.</p>
  <p>The obstacle still represented by the museum itself provided an opportunity 
    for artists to flow around the institution, constructing a practice independent 
    of the traditional art world - one that relied on social and technological 
    networks. See the Creative Commons at <a target="_blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/">http://creativecommons.org/</a> for a sense of how this 
    plays out with copyright.  Not surprisingly, <em>artists centers</em> such 
    as SAT (Society for Art and Technology) in Montreal, Back Street in London, 
    Eyebeam Atelier in New York City, C3 in Budapest and InterAccess in Toronto, 
    continue to serve as central reference points for event-based new media practice 
    that demands ongoing participation (Pringuet, 2004). Increasingly critical 
    is the necessity that informal and artists&#39; contexts be links in a network 
    of presentation that binds together the gallery, museum and alternate space.</p>
  <h1>Network - Metaphor of Flows</h1>
  <p>Artists&#39; networks have existed since long before the Internet, but the Internet 
    has amplified them both in terms of deployment and metaphor. Artists created 
    alternative networks comparable to artist-run centres for both visual and 
    media art in Canada (such as the Independent Film and Video Alliance) and 
    in the UK (through the media workshops of the 1970s and 1980s, many of which 
    then formed the backbone of Channel Four).  Networks play a crucial role in collaborative 
    art works, either in the expression of the actual artwork or in its facilitation. 
    Networks vacillate between the local and the a-geographic, and the latter 
    cannot be contained by traditional boundaries of nation state, or even medium 
    and hierarchy. Some network formations are stable although the cast of characters 
    may shift. This has been the case with Rhizome and the nettime mailing list. 
    On the part of curators and galleries, this fluctuation requires a collaborative 
    approach to networks, which are collective crucibles for artistic production 
    as well as databases of work and discourse; this is also outside the purview 
    of many galleries. Finding a means of expression and description for network-based 
    artwork remains an elusive task.</p>
  <p>Networks infer flow, whether of information, goods, or knowledge. These flows 
    can be disruptive as well as rational. Flows move around obstacles, creating 
    new, unexpected representations and relationships. Networks are a fantastic 
    and frustrating space where the signifier and signified illustrate their ability 
    to float away from each other. Scale and proximity structure networked collaborations 
    - with tiny sets of relationships affixing to others, like a coral reef made 
    up of many crustaceans. Any kind of flow implies power and its movement through 
    a system. Csikszentmihalyi proposes that there are sources of reception and 
    of transmission (Csikszentmihalyi, 1993). In the case of peer-to-peer technologies, 
    of course, the same points (i.e., servers) double as both sender and receiver. 
    Peer-to-peer technologies make every computer a server, or source of original 
    information over the network. This potentially eliminates centralized servers 
    and allows for file sharing between individual computer owners, sharing that 
    is difficult to trace. On principle, peer-to-peer is a model that brings back 
    the original nimble capacities of the Internet. Peer-to-peer returns to the 
    distributed nature of the original Internet and leans its structures contra 
    hierarchical organization (centralized servers, with thin clients, relying 
    on the center) (Oram, 2001). Mobile technologies and their increasingly ubiquitous 
    use give texture to a layer of constant communicative exchange between individuals 
    and groups.</p>
  <p>Csikszentmihaly also describes flow as a state of deep creative expression. 
    Flow infers smoothness, a never-ending well of pleasure, of pure source. In 
    similar ways, artists&#39; collectives have flowed around obstacles of funding 
    and territoriality. Deep collaboration amongst individuals located at distinct 
    points on a network can have an ecstatic feeling of collective and individual 
    empowerment. The New Media Collaboration Studies Network site, is designed 
    to enable discussants to describe the power of play, the sense of suspension 
    of individual agenda within equitable collaborations (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.collaborativenet.banffcentre.ca/public/">http://www.collaborativenet.banffcentre.ca/public/</a>).</p>
  <p>Time is a key component in how relationships emerge within the network, with 
    synchronous and asynchronous experiences providing very different feels, intimacies, 
    forms of consciousness, yet piling up on top of each other in ways that allow 
    social relationships and expressions to become a thick texture of condensed 
    time. These different time zones have varying relationships to presence. Participatory 
    works by artists are a means of pinning down this endless movement, of building 
    identifications and communities. Victoria Vesna&#39;s <em>NoTime</em> screensaver 
    project is an example of a participatory work that builds an aesthetic for 
    investment of time and the search for information on the Internet – a work 
    where the layers of parallel identities emerge only with multiple participants 
    contributing a profile that then maps their ongoing interests and participation 
    on the Web. The endless real-time redrawing of patterns and the relative autonomy 
    of each agent is compulsively fascinating (Vesna, 2003).</p>
  <p>Despite utopian thinking, networks 
    are also exclusionary, with hierarchies of access. Networks do not distribute 
    their contents evenly; nodes and sub-networks reference each other. There 
    are many sub-networks buried inside the Internet that are password-protected, 
    walled gardens or simply buried. Even in these, there may be the appearance 
    of flow; but filters and levels may be oblique (Malina, 2002). The technologies 
    and systems that artists invent for networks are often disruptive, resulting 
    in different kinds of experiences and even inventions, far distanced from 
    their original purpose and sometimes hacking through security barriers. Nortel 
    Networks disrupted itself by its inability to predict the development of the 
    technologies it developed, despite having a group called Disruptive Networks 
    whose job was to think strategically into future uses.  Nokia has a similar 
    group. Distribution, finding content and providing some sense of original 
    context, as well its transformation over time, could be deemed the curatorial 
    prerogative.</p>
  <h1>Participatory Artworks in a Participatory Context</h1>
  <p>Participants consistently transform media objects – contributing to projects 
    in exhibition venues or on peer-to-peer sites or to <em>Wikis</em>. </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote"><em>Wiki</em> is a piece of server software that allows users 
    to freely create and edit Web page content using any Web browser. Wiki supports 
    hyperlinks and has a simple text syntax for creating new pages and crosslinks 
    between internal pages on the fly. Wiki is unusual among group communication 
    mechanisms in that it allows the organization of contributions to be edited 
    in addition to the content itself. Like many simple concepts, <strong>open editing</strong> 
    has some profound and subtle effects on Wiki usage. Allowing everyday users 
    to create and edit any page in a Web site is exciting in that it encourages 
    democratic use of the Web and promotes content composition by nontechnical 
    users.&#34; (<a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki">http://wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki</a>, 
    2005) </p>
  <p>The role of the artist as originator is as subject to challenge as the role 
    of curator is. Common wisdom holds that there is an explicit rejection of 
    all middle positions on the part of the public. The conditions of exchange 
    of file sharing create the perception that more value is being created and 
    not that a theft of artists&#39; intellectual property is occurring (Shirky, 2001). 
    Open source and free software are now permanent features of computational 
    life. The mobile revolution reinforces these trends, with its chatty context 
    and rejection of push media, at least in North America and Europe. (<em>Push 
    media</em> is a term used to describe content that is sent to technology users 
    without their asking for it (<em>pull </em>is when you request content).  Most 
    phone users are hostile towards the idea of content being pushed at them. 
    For one thing, they would have to pay for it! </p>
  <p>The notion that every computer on the network can give each participant the 
    capacity to create and distribute content may fundamentally change ideas of 
    a restricted, single creative source and authorship, even if users do not 
    take advantage of this opportunity. The new media art world continues its 
    romance with peer-to-peer technologies, blogging and game mods, seeing these 
    shifts as embodying democracy, and seeing open source as both heroic and emblematic 
    of an anti-authoritarian stance. Early works such as <em>Open Source</em> by 
    Vivian Selbo prefaced this trend. The CODE Conference, at Queens College, 
    Cambridge, UK, April 5-6, 2001, organized 
    by the Arts Council of England, was a means of exploring the prevalence of 
    open source in artists&#39; practice. See also Jamie King&#39;s extensive writings 
    for MUTE magazine and for <em>Kingdom</em><em> of </em><em>Pira</em>cy (2002) (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.jamie.com/">http://www.jamie.com/</a> 
    ) for articulate debates about software knowledge as fundamental literacy.  
  </p>
        <p>The open source movement was built on the history of the free software movement. 
          See (<a target="_blank" href="http://gnu.sunsite.utk.edu/">http://gnu.sunsite.utk.edu/</a>, 
          2005), for a discussion of the philosophy and methodologies of the Free 
          Software Foundation. The latter believed that software was a fundamental 
          resource and should be freely available, not owned. The open source 
          movement is a less radical version of this. It believes that collective 
          minds are necessary in the development of tools and complex systems. 
          Programmer / collaborators co-own the software they develop. Versions 
          must be credited and, if commercialized, paid out down the line. Arts 
          organizations such as the V2_Organisation Institute for the Unstable 
          Media, Netherlands or the C3 Center for Culture &amp; Communication, 
          Budapest, Hungary, all hold to the open source credo, and most artists 
          who develop software choose to open-source it. Simon Pope is among the 
          very few who have pointed out that open source is a very masculine culture, 
          where competition for the best code drives production and where collaboration 
          is less present than might be imagined. Simon Pope gave a paper at the 
          Bridges Two Summit at The Banff Centre where he pointed out the masculinist 
          biases of open source. This position was hotly debated. Still, the culture 
          of programming increasingly demands collaboration.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3">In the last fifteen years, new media artists have invented 
    tools that facilitate collaboration – on-line, on a personal computer or a 
    the gallery space. Artists  invent in order to critique existing technologies, 
    to make a gadget to run their show, or to genuinely create at the source. 
    Examples include Mary Flanagan with her games and self-analysis software, 
    Technologies to the People, and many others. Artist tool-developers such as 
    Sher Doruff&#39;s team at the Society for Old and New Media create software like 
    <strong>Keystroke </strong>to enable artistic exchange; at times the software and its 
    applications merge as reciprocal art works. In <em>Pagan Poetry</em>, by InsertSilence 
    and Björk, the player redraws the already luscious animations of strange machines 
    and bodies by stroking the screen while reveling in the music. InsertSilence 
    are as proud of their code as they are of its visible content; this artistic 
    practice has resonance in the world of software design. Some software architects 
    have always considered themselves artists or writers.</p>
  <p>Collaborative exchange also occurs within the curatorial context, as in the 
    case of CRUMB (Curatorial Resource for Upstart Media Bliss), the curatorial 
    forum created by Beryl Graham, together with Sarah Cook, which attracts over 
    500 curators on a regular basis (Graham, CRUMB, 2005). CRUMB supports and 
    analyzes collaborative curatorial ventures, with an emphasis on the new media 
    context. Both Graham and Cook note that one of the challenges for curators 
    is the fact that the opening of a show is intended to be the point of revelation, 
    the theatrical narrative pinnacle of their practice. Yet the very nature of 
    collaborations often requires that concepts and plans be divulged throughout 
    the process of making the work. This obviously is antithetical to the theatrics 
    of opening night. Sarah Cook spoke about this at <em>Participate! Collaborate! 
    Participatory Design Summit at</em> The Banff Centre, Banff New Media Institute 
    (BNMI), this September. (Cook, 2004)</p>
  <p>Opening night is now seldom the end of the artwork, nor is it the beginning. 
    New media art works that are based on audience participation change throughout 
    both the duration of their exhibition and the collaborative endeavours to 
    create them - getting communities in place and thinking through presentation 
    strategies starts well before the opening. Transformation can include form, 
    content, scale, and even focus; for example, in the cases of George Legrady&#39;s 
    <em>Pockets Full of Memories</em>, Sher Doruff&#39;s <em>Wiretap 7.04</em>, or Lynn 
    Hershman&#39;s <em>Synthia</em>, all shown at the Dutch Electronic Arts Festival 
    (DEAF) in 2003. On the most banal level, participatory works demand resources. 
    At DEAF, intensive participation brought down the network when the multitude 
    of external on-line participants continually crashed the streams that were 
    so essential to many of the projects. This tenuousness of technology is a 
    typical characteristic of many collaborative systems:   even market-ready 
    software is often in a beta-test state. It can be difficult to judge the success 
    of an artwork when the contingency of the technology and its characteristics 
    are so liminal to the nature of the art experience.</p>
  <p>Participation in collective production opens a different space for the audience, 
    enabled by peer-to-peer technologies. Some artists invite the audience to 
    remix originals and are eager to see their work mutate. Reception theory suggests 
    that audiences perform their relationships both to technology in general and 
    to the specific artwork. In installation work, some viewers assume the role 
    of performer / actor themselves, while others are spectators, similar to the 
    audience / player roles played in gaming arcades. Players anthropomorphize 
    technologies - a quality that is exaggerated in public spaces. See an excellent 
    discussion by Richard Lachman, Software Project Lead, on how we make technologies 
    human in<em> CodeZebra: The Making of Software Video</em>, 2002. Excerpts of 
    the discussion are at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codezebra.net/">www.codezebra.net</a> in the software section(CodeZebra 
    2004).</p>
        <p>Cumulative or generative works engage not only individuals, but also entire 
          communities, who can write themselves into a media existence through 
          artworks on the Internet. In<em> Subtract the Sky</em> by Sharon Daniels, 
          Mark Bartlett, and Raja Guhatkakurta, audiences create personal maps 
          that function as diaries with scientific data from the Keck Observatory 
          as well as other mapping materials, such as genome data or GIS (Global 
          Information Systems) tracks. Each self-portrait is filed with many others, 
          developing a collective portrait of the visitors to the piece. Different 
          mapping tools reflect varying cultural contexts, such as Native Hawaiian 
          traditions, and provide different views of space / time / history / 
          community (<a target="_blank" href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/sdaniel/new/text_prop.html">http://arts.ucsc.edu/sdaniel/new/text_prop.html</a>, 
          2004). Another example of the engagement of local communities is Patrick 
          Clancy&#39;s <em>The Weather Machine</em>, which uses weather patterns from 
          various locales as a means of writing semi-automatic poetry based on 
          local stories for visitors to his Web site. Visitors submit their own 
          stories that are rewritten through the weather program.</p>
  <h1>Probing Performances</h1>
  <p>The ephemeral qualities of some participatory new media works bear similarities 
    to video art or performance work, and make them difficult to collect and preserve. 
    From its beginning, the Internet was characterized by performance activity. 
    Participants could have alternate identities: they engaged in role-playing, 
    first in MUDs and MOOS, then in IRC, avatar chat worlds and games, where first-person 
    players build and control worlds. They interacted with computer agents or 
    each other. Preoccupations in performance art resonate in Internet works. 
    What is the body in space? What is the process of discovery? How can technologies 
    be inverted? MUDs are Multiple User Dungeons (or Domains); text-based, on-line 
    multi-user environments modeled after early Dungeons and Dragons computer 
    games such as Zork Zero. MUDs are Multiple User Dungeons or Domains; MOOs 
    are Object-Oriented - that is, a more sophisticated version of the text-based, 
    on-line multi-user environment of the MUD, based on object-oriented programming. 
    IRC is Internet Relay Chat. Avatar chat worlds are chat worlds in which participants 
    can choose or create an avatar - a graphic representation and <em>alter ego</em>; the term originates 
    from Hinduism and means &#39;<em>descent</em>’. Computer games distinguish 
    between a first-person point of view, where players control and experience 
    the game from their own perspective, and a third-person point of view, where 
    players control a graphic representation of themselves within the environment. 
  </p>
  <p>Bruce Barber proposes performance as an engaged and committed task of acting 
    on culture: &#34;The task becomes restorative and critical.&#34; (Richards, Robertson, 
    1991) For a long time, telematic performances faced the challenge of getting 
    the technology to work, raising the stakes for gallery hosts. If, miraculously, 
    it did work, the simple recognition of human presence was all that could be 
    mustered. In the mid-1960s, Allen Kaprow, the father of <strong>The Happenings</strong>, 
    linked five sites in a television event appropriately entitled, <em>Hello, 
    Hello</em>. In 1980, Roy Ascott, in <em>Terminal Art</em>, mailed portable terminals 
    to artists in California, New York, and Wales in order to allow them to collectively 
    generate ideas from their own studios or public spaces. Shanken states that 
    this was Ascott&#39;s contribution to Robert Adrian&#39;<strong>s 
    <em>The World in 24 Hours</em></strong>, an electronic networking event 
    at Ars Electronica in 1982. (Shanken, 2003, Ascott, 1984, Adrian, 1984, Grundmann, 
    1984). <em>Hole in Space</em> - created and produced by Kit Galloway and Sherrie 
    Rabinowitz in 1980 - engaged larger publics and was a step forward for these 
    practices. It connected malls in New York and Los Angeles over three evenings. 
    Head-to-toe, life-sized television images of the people on opposite coasts 
    appeared. They could see, hear, and speak with each other as if on the same 
    sidewalk. The first event was followed by an evening of intentional word-of-mouth 
    rendezvous, and then by a mass presence of families across the continent.</p>
  <p>Content 
    followed. In Canada, the <strong>Western Front</strong> organized fax 
    events. Artists all over the world contributed a part of a drawing, or a bit 
    of a story, creating an exquisite corpse. Pirate Radio forums began at the 
    <strong>Western Front</strong> in the mid 1980s, led by Hank Bull and Eric Metcalfe, 
    later dovetailing into Internet Radio. In 1988, <strong>The Nowhere Men</strong> with 
    Sylvia Scott et al. created <em>Speaking Pieces</em> by using videophone technology 
    and telephony to accumulate contributions from international artists. <strong>The 
    World Tea Party</strong> celebrated the rituals of tea with tea ceremonies and 
    tea drinking, linking Tea Parties in remote locations. Collective forms of 
    performance flourished in relation to technology, despite the tendency towards 
    individual creative acts in live events. Canadian poet laureate b.p. nichol 
    was part of the Toronto Research Group that created events exploring <em>The 
    Language of the Performance of Language</em>. <strong>General Idea</strong> held the 
    <em>Miss General Idea Pageant t</em>o explore the impossible future.</p>
  <p>Another stage of on-line activity could be described as &#34;Mirror, Mirror&#34; 
    -- matching a signal from one place with the bit rate of another, thus enabling 
    dancers to contact improvise together, and musicians to play in synch. Artists 
    hoped they could defy both the speed of light and packet rates. In 1977, NASA 
    developed the <em>Satellite Arts Project: A Space with No Geographical Boundaries.</em> 
    Mitsuko Mitsueda danced at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, and 
    Keija Kimura and Soto Hoffman responded in Menlo Park, California. Their electronically 
    composited, satellite image appeared on monitors at each location.</p>
  <p>Initiated by Galloway and Rabinovitz, <strong>Electronic Café International</strong> 
    (ECI) began as an artists&#39; network during the 1984 L.A Olympics. It continues 
    to this day, with thirty affiliated international franchises. ECI uses the 
    performing arts, creating &#39;contexts&#39; to support the emergence of new forms 
    and content. Technologies such as analog telephone lines, digital ISDN lines, 
    video and Internet networking are combined to link performers who act simultaneously 
    in various locations around the world. ECI is an example of collaborative 
    curatorial practice and an alternate venue that stepped in when there were 
    no institutions able to facilitate new media performance. </p>
  <p>ECI networked diverse cultural groups who were otherwise unwilling to communicate.</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">In designing such spaces, we look not only at their qualities 
          and aesthetics, but how people communicate when they are disembodied 
          and their image is their &#39;ambassador&#39;... The absence of the threat of 
          physical harm makes people braver. Virtual space diminishes our fears 
          of interaction (<em>Galloway and Rabinovitch</em>, 1993). </p>
  <p>Ulysses Jenkins, an African-American musician and performance artist, created 
    poetry and music conversations between communities in Oakland and Los Angeles. 
    White women poets from Beverly Hills and black, male spoken-word artists became 
    on-line artistic collaborators and then, finally face-to-face colleagues. 
    Jenkins came to The Banff Centre as part of the <em>Nomad </em>project (1993-4), 
    which included a series of early Internet exchanges and on-line events using 
    text and video phones.</p>
  <p>Internet performances can provide culturally challenging contexts because 
    of their short-term nature. Since 1990, Orlan, a French artist, has undertaken 
    a series of cosmetic operations to become a hybrid of Venus, Diana, Europa, 
    Psyche and Mona Lisa. In a 1993 on-line co-production, the Centre George Pompidou 
    in Paris, the McLuhan Program in Toronto, and The Banff Centre featured the 
    operating theatre in New York, tied to other locations. Audiences debated 
    the nature of femininity, narcissism and masochism, considered identity alteration, 
    argued literary theory and feminism, and viewed the performance. This process 
    of gathering artists, theorists and audiences in diverse locations, with activity 
    occurring on-line and in situ, is a consistent form of Internet art, located 
    somewhere between a forum, a curated art work and a publication. Another example 
    of this type of event  is <em>LiveForm</em> by Michelle Teran and Jeff Mann, 
    who created a telekinetic dinner table. The piece included live video streams, 
    a tele-robotic talking fish, mass gourmet cooking, media mixing on the spot 
    with <em>Keystroke</em> software, wine-pouring machines, a magic show and telematic 
    toasts across the ocean.</p>
  <p>The demanding relationship between audience and mediating technology has 
    carried over into Internet performances. Coco Fusco and Ricardo Dominguez 
    have collaborated on several performances, among them <em>Life Under Surveillance</em> 
    / <em>Dolores from 10am to 22h</em> -- based on the story of a woman worker 
    in the free trade zones accused of troublemaking at her job. The project was 
    developed with Kiasma, Helsinki&#39;s Museum of Contemporary Art. It was also 
    simultaneously broadcast at the Art in Motion Festival in Los Angeles, the 
    Galerie Kapelika in Ljubjlana and iNIVA in London. It was re-played at Artspace 
    in Sydney during the Sydney Festival in Feburary, 2002.. Dolores&#39; boss locked 
    her in an office without food or water or a phone and tried to force her to 
    sign a letter of resignation. When she refused and sued the company, her boss 
    and fellow workers insisted in front of the judge that the events had not 
    occurred. The intention of the performance was to use surveillance technology 
    over a twelve-hour period in order to show a re-enactment of this coercive 
    situation, recreated as a docudrama, and to allow Internet audiences to determine 
    Dolores&#39; fate:</p>
  <p>There will be three surveillance cameras recording me and the performance 
    can be seen as a direct Internet broadcast. None of my bodily needs will be 
    attended to, in other words, I will not be able to leave to use the bathroom, 
    wash, eat or drink. None of my emotional or social needs will be met either 
    - my calls to the guard will be unanswered and I will be unable to use a telephone 
    to notify anyone of my situation… We are trying to develop a critique of Survivor 
    and people&#39;s obsession with it. Half the world thinks invading people&#39;s privacy 
    on-line is great and erotic, while the other half is trying to get cameras 
    away from them, out of their lives, their neighbourhoods, schools and prison 
    cells. I don&#39;t think most privileged hypermedia-oriented people have any idea 
    of the social and political implications of the normalisation of surveillance, 
    of accepting the right of others to stalk you, to invade your space, to keep 
    track of your habits, note your faults, etc. (<em>Vanhatalo, 2003</em>) </p>
  <p>Fusco notes that audience members, mostly male, were not empathetic to the 
    victim, but rather escalated her abuse. They instructed the male performer 
    to hurt and humiliate the victim in explicit detail. This project underscores 
    the power of Internet performance and the capacities for museums such as Kiasma 
    to play a role both in the presentation of controversial issues and the mediation 
    of the results through publications, symposia, and dialogue. Kiasma created 
    a public forum to discuss the performances as well as the publication of the 
    debates; Juha-Pekka Vanhatalo interviewed the artists. Galleries and museums 
    are often better equipped to fulfill this function than festivals with their 
    smaller resources and episodic nature. Perhaps Kiasma was comfortable with 
    leading this project because Finland has a strong history of intensive and 
    rigorous critical debate about controversial issues, as well as a leading 
    role in the creation of on-line virtual worlds, Internet drama, mobile experience 
    design and controversial and rich cultural content on its public television.  
    They had the resources to create a multi-point broadcast. The performance 
    was documented and then recreated as a video work. An example of artists whose 
    work reinforces these tendencies is <strong>Blast Theory</strong> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.blasttheory.co.uk/">http://www.blasttheory.co.uk/</a>); also see Matt Locke&#39;s 
    interactive dramaturgy work that is discussed on Horizonzero.ca, Issue 4, 
    Touch.</p>
  <h1>Collaborative Community Practice and Cultural Contexts</h1>
  <p>Reliance on collaboration is often particularly pronounced in communities 
    that are marginalized and/or have a long tradition of cultural heritage. Collaborative 
    artistic work emerging from these communities raises valid questions regarding 
    both the role of technology and the understanding of specific cultural contexts. 
    Ahasiw Maskegon-Iskwew is a Cree Metis - his ancestry represents the racial 
    mixing of French and Cree peoples.  With Lynn Acosse, he took early aesthetic 
    strides forward in creating Aboriginal new media works that made use of the 
    capacities of the technology of the time (1996-97) - graphics, text and audio 
    - as an envelope for a form of story cycle. The piece <em>Speaking the Language 
    of Spiders</em> engaged fourteen Aboriginal artists, writers, and composers 
    in the development of a time cycle that stretches from the beginning of time 
    to infinity and then back to the beginning. <em>Isi-pîkiskwêwin-ayapihkêsîsak</em> 
    concentrated on the experiences of people who have been consigned to the fringes 
    of urban street life and their sources of joy, grief and intense humanity. 
    It is a story cycle that occurs in the round, with artists contributing elements 
    such as song, image, poetry in the circle of creation, destruction and regeneration; 
    as they leave the streets and become survivors, so goes the larger history 
    of Aboriginal cultures. The work took the efforts of The Banff Centre, Dunlop 
    Gallery Canadian Native Arts Foundation and the University of Regina, Film 
    and Video Department, Canada Council, with presentation by curator Anthony 
    Kiendl at the Dunlop Art Gallery. This project was developed through the collaborative 
    influence and the creative participation of the following artists: Lynn Acoose, 
    Cheryl L Hirondelle, Joseph Naytowhow, Greg Daniels, Elvina Piapot, Sheila 
    Urbanoski, Sylvain Carette, Mark Schmidt, Russell Wallace and Ahasiw Maskegon-Iskwew. 
    Richard Agecoutay and Anthony Deiter also made important contributions.</p>
  <p>The powerful work speaks of the life cycle and different ways of living through 
    experiences - immersed, contemplative, suffering, and filled with hope. It 
    is a beautiful, multi-layered yet simple interactive experience that sustains 
    its power many years later as the viewer navigates through layers of images, 
    stories, poems and song. </p>
  <p>&#34;Aboriginal Collaborations&#34; by Christine Morris an Adjunct Research 
    Fellow for the Australian Key Centre for Culture and Media Policy explores 
    these questions.  She is a member of the Kombumerri and Munaljahlai clans 
    of South East Queensland, Australia. She has also participated as an expert 
    panelist on issues relating to indigenous media and genetic engineering for 
    the Convention on Biodiversity. Christine Morris stresses the relationship 
    of new media experience, respect for elders and the land or, as she calls 
    it, <strong>The Law</strong>. She suggests that we must</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">fully comprehend that technology is subordinate to the culture 
    and especially the Law. If you do not see the power of the culture you will 
    never understand the place of technology  <em>(Morris, 2002</em>).</p>
  <p> On the one hand, access to information deriving from a traditional culture 
    requires that participants earn the right to the information through their 
    behaviours within a larger physical community. On the other hand, it is imperative 
    that Aboriginal people represent themselves with the new tools, as Morris 
    puts it, </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">In one of the most remote regions of the Australian continent 
    and the world, Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara [PY]. Media faces the day-to-day 
    challenge of using the latest tools and techniques of communication to preserve 
    and enhance the culture of the people of the Pitjantjatjara Lands so that 
    that culture may endure and continue to grow as a vital part of the global 
    community (<em>Morris, 2002</em>). </p>
  <p>David Vadiveloo, a convergent media artist, works in Alice Springs, Australia, 
    with Aboriginal youth who design tangible objects such as bicycles as well 
    as interactive graphics and video environments that afford dialogue and play-acting. 
    The emerging works consist of powerful hybrid images that hover between the 
    spaces and historical time zones of Australia.</p>
  <p>Collective cultural identity is built on the basis of a shared archive which 
    requires the development of databases that incorporate our histories as well 
    as tools that allow for navigation. Databases are deep repositories or encyclopaedias 
    of knowledge written on silicon. How do navigators evaluate the quality of 
    content and make decisions? In response to this problem and to their own observations, 
    numerous artists have created local data navigation tools and search engines 
    dedicated to picking out cultural references. The UK-based artist collective 
    <strong>Mongrel,</strong> for example, created a search engine tool titled <em>Natural 
    Selection</em> that was aimed at eliminating all documents on the Internet 
    promoting racism, nationalism, and eugenics (by creating &#39;mongrelized&#39; pages 
    of these documents that would make the information look unreliable and obliterate 
    the credibility of the originals). Search engines are hierarchical, structured 
    through an economy of use and positioning, with contingent meanings and identities 
    drawn through associations. The database is leveled, without an inherent hierarchy 
    of story; yet it is, in actuality, never neutral. Users engage in a process 
    of authoring by selecting from given sources; the story is re-authored again 
    through each searching and threading of the database; the narrative is collective 
    by its very nature (Manovitch, 2001). <strong>Mongrel</strong>&#39;s authoring solution 
    for creating a collectively assembled database is the &#39;social software&#39; <em>Nine(9) 
    - </em>a continuation of their project <em>Linker.</em> <em>Nine(9) </em>is an open-source software structure 
    that allows individuals and communities to &#39;map&#39; their experiences and &#39;social 
    geographies&#39; in collective knowledge maps. The system allows for the easy 
    structuring and assembly of a database by communities of interest through 
    the linking of images, text, and sound. </p>
  <p>An extension of this type of work was the ambitious <em>Container Project</em>, 
    now in its fourth year, led by <strong>Mongrel</strong> member Mervin Jarman and Camille 
    Turner. Mervin and his team ship a basic computer learning/creation facility 
    into a community, train a local group and community, and either leave the 
    technology there or find a local source of supplying it. The learning, creation, 
    and presentation situations are structured as community experiences; groups 
    gather to work and experience the results. They finance their ongoing work 
    by training future users in the technology, the design systems, and basic 
    programming. These services are paid for by government agencies and local 
    councils. <strong>Mongrel</strong> has developed a method for community engagement that 
    shares models of pedagogy, infrastructure creation, intervention and curatorial 
    practice. While they construct the larger context, the local community develops 
    micro practices as a result, hopefully with enough skills to continue once 
    <strong>Mongrel</strong> leaves. </p>
  <p>This combined modality is visible in other projects in the &#39;majority&#39; world 
    or within marginalized cultures in the West. The use of digital networking 
    technologies for community development has become a major force in art activism. 
    Hermani Diamanti - a Brazilian artist, activist, academic and forceful blogger 
    - sees the blogging world as a recombinatory space where knowledge is exchanged 
    and where the fundamental hybridity of Brazilian culture melds with techno 
    theory from all over the world. He describes the current cultural moment as 
    a &#39;linkania&#39;, a good name for a new state, but this one a globalized, lateral 
    state of constant discursive transition and emerging relationships capable 
    of moving from the virtual to the physical and local. He and colleagues have 
    created collaborations with groups in the favellas, finding discarded digital 
    technology, redesigning and painting it, and building collaborative centers. 
    The communities involved are abandoned by all authorities and use technology 
    for educational, cultural, and economic purposes as well as self-organization. 
    (See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.intelligent.com.br/metacomunidade/index.php">http://www.intelligent.com.br/metacomunidade/index.php</a> 
    for Linkania discussions and blogs.)</p>
  <p>Another successful model for the integration of new media and collaborative 
    community practice is the work of Carlota Brito, an architect and artist of 
    Aboriginal descent from Belém (Pará), Brazil. Brito also has a background 
    in anthropology and works at the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi. She created 
    a remarkable CD-ROM about the Ticuna Indians (Magüta Arü Inü). It was made 
    with the indigenous group, while carefully guarding access to their sacred 
    information, and clearly communicated the process and duration of ritual. 
    A beautiful, accessible and ornate design work, the CD will be used in the 
    museum and within the community as a learning tool. Brito is also the technical 
    coordinator of a CD-ROM about the scientific research of the Goeldi Museum, 
    <em>Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi: An Amazonian Museum,</em> and is involved 
    in an artistic project that uses Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) 
    and investigates indigenous codices and symbols based on the collection of 
    indigenous art at the museum. There are several differences between this project 
    and many museum products:- Brito&#39;s intensive self-integration into the communities 
    that are part of the CD-Rom, the community&#39;s sense of control over the final 
    representation of their culture, and the subsequent aesthetic eloquence that 
    results. </p>
  <p>The following examples suggest a framework of distributed curatorial practice 
    in which the artist is also the curator and, to some extent, the technology 
    developer. In the last decade, the Banff Centre developed <em>Radio 90</em><strong> 
    </strong>- led by artist /activists Heath Bunting, Yvonne Faught, Susan Kennard 
    and Cindy Schatkoski. At first, <em>Radio 90</em> concentrated on issues of 
    workplace organization as well as the development of an alternate music culture. 
    For the streaming media festival <em>Net Congestion</em> in Amsterdam, <em>Radio 
    90</em> commissioned pieces from all over the world, including Croatia, Latvia, 
    and other sources in the former Eastern Europe. The <em>Radio 90</em> team also 
    provided training in Internet radio, helping to create a station in Morley, 
    a reserve between Banff and Calgary; they collaborated with Shane Breaker 
    from Siksika First Nations to create a Blackfoot channel; they worked with 
    the Aboriginal Arts Programs at the Banff Centre to create <em>Sleeping Buffalo</em>, 
    a Banff indigenous station. <em>Radio 90</em> provides community news and entertainment 
    and, thanks to the Internet, can program for more hours each day, allowing 
    a connection with Aboriginal stations around the world. In order to better 
    share programs, the team created a piece of technology that is a scheduling 
    program entitled the World Service Scheduler. This technology allows stations 
    in any location to place their two hour program on-line in a given time slot 
    and/or to fill their calendar with the programs of other international Internet 
    radio stations who are a part of the service. </p>
  <p><em>Radio 90</em> also concentrates on work in areas where there is little 
    or no radio access. In 2001, the group, with its Aboriginal companions, attended 
    an event organized by eLab (rixc) in the forest of Latvia at a former Soviet 
    Space station. (See <a target="_blank" href="http://rixc.lv/">http://rixc.lv/</a>  
    for project details.) For the space transmitter they created audio pieces 
    that addressed issues of globalization on earth, and they trained former Soviet 
    army personnel, abandoned in these remote forests of Latvia, in basic computer 
    communications and net radio so that they could renew their link to their 
    families and the world. </p>
  <p>For Aboriginal groups in Canada, wireless, and Internet technologies have 
    been the key way to communicate their issues in confrontational contexts. 
    Internet Radio has helped to create a virtual sense of community. The movements 
    enabled by these technologies are part of a fabric of local interventions 
    and at times, technology development becomes a necessary companion to content 
    and context creation. While radio stations have programmers, not curators, 
    their role again often spans pedagogy, outreach, creating their own programs 
    and organizing others to create their own work.  These structures are very 
    similar to the artist/curatorial formations of the 1980s and 1990s that provided 
    an  exhibition and production forum for media art. As well, many artists double 
    as curators, initiating projects and then expanding these to include other 
    artists. As is evidenced in the radio examples and in the work described below, 
    a key aspect of Aboriginal curatorial and programming work has been the decision 
    to redefine the site of curatorial practice either outside of the gallery 
    and within the community or poised between gallery and community.  Cheryl 
    l&#39;Hirondelle describes interactive works as an extended form of story telling, 
    as a transactional process for Aboriginal people, </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">As Aboriginal people, we need to remember that our stories 
    convey vital cultural and ceremonial information; they remind us about the 
    laws of nature, how communities must work together, and that we are keepers 
    of the land, songs, dances, narratives, and everything they inspire. It is 
    our role and responsibility as artists to use, develop, and share this information 
    appropriately, for the survival of all.  (<em>L&#39;Hirondelle,</em> 2004)</p>
  <p>In a performance entitled <a href="http://ndnnrkey.net/cistemaw/makwa.html">cistêmaw iyîniw ohci</a>, Savage , bringing the wild 
    back to the west, at Makwa Sahgaiehcan Indian Reserve in Saskatchewan Cheryl 
    L&#39;Hirondelle re-enacted the history of Cistemaw inyiniw, a runner who brought 
    stories and news across the reserve, running from home to home. (See <a target="_blank" href="http://askiy.banff.org/tipitotamowin01.html">http://askiy.banff.org/tipitotamowin01.html</a> 
    for project documentation and <a target="_blank" href="http://ndnnrkey.net/lhirondelle/">http://ndnnrkey.net/lhirondelle/</a> 
    for links to other projects.) Women on the reserve created a moccasin telegraph 
    where they signaled that L&#39;Hirondelle was about to arrive; elders retold the 
    story; and artists Louise Halfe, Cheli Nighttraveller and Joseph Noytowhow, 
    who l&#39;Hirondelle curated into the project, interacted with the community. 
    Through soliciting the community, these artists arranged for the water syllabic 
    to be placed on homes, indicating to L&#39;Hironelle, who was running around the 
    twenty-five km reserve, that these homes would welcome her for water and food. 
    The other artists provided a means of community engagement through photo essays, 
    story circles, and radio streaming. In a more recent collaboration with Candice 
    Hopkins, L&#39;Hirondelle worked with Morley reserve youth to create videotapes 
    and radio documentaries as well as hip hop performances about their lives. 
    This work is part of the ongoing legacy of Internet Radio at Morley. L&#39;Hirondelle 
    was extending an analogy between rez radio (reservation radio) and piracy.  
    New technologies always pose the threat of cultural leakage and loss at the 
    same time as they signal potential empowerment. She says:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">For Indigenous people around the world, this task is not 
    as simple as it sounds, especially when it comes to embracing new media forms 
    as a means of outreach. One limiting factor relates to concerns about intellectual 
    property and cultural appropriation. Many Aboriginal communities are extremely 
    sensitive and cautious about sharing cultural information too widely, thanks 
    to a long history of intellectual and government infiltrations and abuses. 
    Yet it is my belief that, as Aboriginal people, we should be investigating 
    contemporary open source philosophies and methodologies as an alternative 
    to both time-honoured cultural protocols and binding corporate and governmental 
    laws around intellectual property and copyright. I say this because I think 
    that our abilities to share and adapt are essential to our continued survival. 
    (<em>L&#39;Hirondelle,</em> 2004)</p>
  <p>A related direct challenge for Aboriginal artists and writers who wish to 
    work with digital tools to express participatory culture - as well as for 
    the curators working with them - is the issue of native languages, which need 
    to be kept alive in order to keep the culture alive. Aboriginal practitioners 
    such as Cheryl L&#39;Hirondelle, Candice Hopkins, and Luanne Neal underscore the 
    ways in which language shapes the telling of the story, its mode of expression, 
    as well as its content (Graham, L&#39;Hirondelle, Hopkins, 2004). These pieces 
    elucidate the role of community engagement and debate in creating new media 
    works, as well as the function of traditions of collaborative storytelling 
    (Hopkins, 2004). In order to tell Aboriginal stories in contemporary cultural 
    forms, a project needs to remain embedded in its language of origin with all 
    its richness, nuance and modality (Hopkins, 2004). It is language that structures 
    an overarching notion of group identity and ego, rather than the notion of 
    the individual. Cree, for example, is an Aboriginal language spoken across 
    the West of Canada and has sixty words for love and sixty words for suffering. 
    Cree, Inuktitut, and other languages use visual syllabic forms of expression  
    which offer an exciting connection to visual graphic languages. </p>
  <p>The <em>CREE ++</em> project -- conceived at the &#39;Skinning Our Tools: Designing 
    for Culture and Context&#39; summit at the Banff New Media Institute (BNMI) - 
    links Aboriginal artists and linguists, as well as computer scientists and 
    designers from various cultures who are interested in rebuilding tools from 
    the linguistic concepts of extant Aboriginal and other minority languages. 
    After L&#39;Hirondelle, Hopkins, and I worked in Dakar during the summer of 2004, 
    the project expanded to include non-Canadian Aboriginal languages, such as 
    Wolof from French Africa. Wolof is the trading language that bridges across 
    French Africa and is rooted in the original languages of Senegal, Cote d&#39;Ivoire, 
    and other West African nations. The BNMI, Dak&#39;Art Lab, Aboriginal Arts at 
    the Banff Centre and the University of California at Irvine are currently 
    developing strategies and alliances to launch this research program. Rather 
    than individuating consumer culture, these artistic practices and collective 
    societies are pressing to have technology  redesigned for collaboration. Important 
    questions will emerge with this work. Can these culturally specific new media 
    linguistic pieces find a mode of communication to a broader community?  What 
    is their appropriate mode of presentation? These are issues that interest 
    the artists and curators from within these communities as well as those on 
    the outside looking in. </p>
  <h1>In Summary: Collaboration and Agency</h1>
  <p>Agency is the fundamental construct of collaboration, of building a sense 
    of participation. Collaboration and collective action - whether they entail 
    writing, speaking, remixing, moving, or interacting - are inherently performative. 
    We construct our identities through roles and transactions, and new technologies 
    implicate us into a network of pre-existing structures while allowing us to 
    invent new cultures and  identities, and remap the network itself. How can 
    the nuances of these transactions cross cultural space and barriers? This 
    particular moment in time offers a challenging terrain for collective creation 
    - a creation that recognizes complexity, self-organization, and unpredictability.</p>
  <p>At the very basis of this collective creativity lies the ability to freely 
    access and share and thus build upon software and technological tools. In 
    June of 2004, The Banff New Media Institute co-created a new media laboratory 
    (running on the Linux platform) with the Dak&#39;Art Biennale. At a meeting about 
    creating ongoing new media research, young computer programmers spoke about 
    their skills as hackers and open source programmers. The lack of resources 
    - cars are belted together with old parts, engines re-fabricated, music is 
    melded from the old and the new - combined with the need for cultural commitment 
    to improvisation had already created a positive attitude about engineering 
    from machine language up if necessary. All software was pirated, downloaded 
    thanks to Hotwire, and shared amongst colleagues. Skipping continents, a different 
    kind of open source friendliness has been formalized in Brazil by Lula, its 
    president, who has made Linux the new official language of Brazil, requiring 
    that all government departments run on open source software. This was a conscious 
    move to undermine American multinational control over information in Brazil,  
    to encourage the use of computer technology and media into all classes of 
    Brazilian society, and to make Brazil economically competitive. </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">According to presidential Chief of Staff Minister José Dirceu, 
    it is the fruit of a collective effort that began in the Electronic Government 
    Executive Committee to disseminate the culture of free software, the universalization 
    of information, and digital inclusion in the country. Software is one of the 
    priority areas of the industrial policy announced by President Lula. According 
    to information from the Secretariat of Logistics and Information Technology, 
    in the Ministry of Planning, Brazil as a whole, between the government and 
    the private sector, spends around US$ 1.1 billion annually on licenses for 
    the use of proprietary software (<em>Cardosa, 2004).</em></p>
  <p> Linux is still based on traditional computer science, but the support of 
    collaborative, open-source technological invention is a first step in trying 
    to build technologies and cultural expression from the ground up. Alliances 
    of programmers, curators and their institutions, and cultural producers can 
    lay the groundwork for creating technologies and the related collaborative 
    artistic experiences across continental divides.</p>
  <p>While the historically privileged position of the curator may have become 
    unsettled, it still continues to remain relevant. This relevance is clearly 
    apparent in two contexts - the role of the curator as context creator and 
    as broker within the gallery and museum system. There remain many barriers 
    to the exhibition of collaboratively authored or participatory new media works 
    within the gallery context. Artists and curators continue to reach towards 
    festivals, the Web itself, mobile consortia, and alternative venues in order 
    to circumvent these obstacles. The gallery space in its traditional form may 
    not be the best location for some kinds of new media work, but galleries and 
    museums can and should have roles to play in the context of participatory 
    culture. This applies to both physical installations that deploy new media 
    and Internet art. Museums remain very anxious about their capacity to support 
    new media works:  coping requires brokerage and  trained staff, as well as 
    ongoing resources. Curators need to be familiar with the technology and network 
    needs of the pieces they want to exhibit. They are crucial links in the network, 
    creating circuits and enabling flow. When galleries and museums embrace the 
    Web as a meaningful space, they can support deeply creative works and large-scale 
    participation. The Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN, with Steve Dietz at 
    the helm, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, NY, with Christiane Paul, 
    have both led in the development of discourse about art and the Web. Both 
    have found effective ways to show new media, including Web-based pieces, in 
    the gallery context. New media offers a multiplicity of roles for curators 
    as well as artists. The creation of a space that enables people to move with 
    agility between these roles and to work in collaborative ways is one of the 
    big achievements of new media.</p>
