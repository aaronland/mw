      <h1>Democratize And Distribute: Achieving A Many-To-Many Content Model</h1>
      <h2>Rachel Coldicutt, Victoria and Albert Museum, and Katie Streten, Channel 
        4, UK</h2>
      <p><a target="blank" href="http://www.everyobject.net/">http://www.everyobject.net</a></p>
      <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
      <p id="abstract">In this Information Age, the Field of Dreams paradigm 
            makes less sense than ever: &#34;If we build it, they will come&#34; 
        presumes a didactic, one-to-many model of distribution that relies on 
        the will for self-improvement. But now, when the answer to any question 
        is a Google search away, and peer-review and social networking have 
        superseded advertising as the most effective means of on-line promotion, 
        how can museums attract and maintain large on-line audiences? </p>
      <p id="abstract">This paper explores the opportunity 
            of mass distribution and mass participation as a future means of delivering 
            meaningful content to the on-line and non-traditional user. The Victoria 
            and Albert Museum has partnered with Channel 4 Television, the UK&#39;s 
            third largest broadcaster, to promote Every Object Tells a Story, a 
            mass-participative digital storytelling project launching in March 2005. 
            Building on the current museological emphasis in the value of objects 
            inherent not only in themselves, but in the stories that are told about 
            and around them, Every Object Tells a Story gives users a chance not 
            only to comment on iconic and important objects held in national collections 
            but also to explore significance through submitting their own stories 
        and objects, which can in tern be commented on by their peers. </p>
      <p id="abstract">This paper asks: Is mass democratisation 
            of museum content the way to open our collections? What are the opportunities 
            and dangers of allowing non-specialists to publish their ideas and theories 
            in a many-to-many environment? How can partnering with the right media 
            partner contribute to the development of mass distribution projects?

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>New technology has changed how we seek and exchange information. In 
            2002, the Pew Internet &amp; American Life project discovered that 84% 
            of all Americans have the expectation of finding satisfactory information 
            on-line, making the Internet &#34;the primary means by which many people 
            get key information&#34; (Horrigan and Rainie, 2002). This study also 
            documented the appearance of the verb <em>to Google</em> -a term that 
            has filtered from the<em> Internet cognoscenti</em> to idiomatic speech 
            in just two years; in fact, the word &#34;google&#34;, meaning &#34;to 
            search for [something on the Internet] using a search engine&#34;, 
            is now defined in the <em>Collins English Dictionary</em>. Basic literacy 
            and an Internet connection offer Alexandrian riches to anyone with an 
            urge to ask questions, and the process of publication is reduced to 
            a click of a <strong>submit</strong> button. Indeed, ownership of a 
            wireless laptop gives the opportunity to hold the world quite comfortably 
        in the palm of your hand.</p>
      <p>This Information Age has made the role of the educator-as-gatekeeper 
            unsustainable; as Dan Gillmor&#39;s study of grassroots journalism shows, 
        &#34;there has been a shift from a top-down hierarchy to something 
            vastly more democratic&#34; (Gillmor, 2004). This means that the traditional 
            one-to-many paradigm, common to both broadcasting and education, is 
            not available on-line; instead, the Internet is a many-to-many medium, 
            a &#34;network of networks&#34; in which smaller circles of influence are connected: 
        &#34;[w]hen a computer network connects people or organizations, it is a 
            social network&#34;, capable of &#34;creating a Web of group affiliations&#34; (Garton, 
            Haythornthwaite, and Wellman, 1997). This proliferation of information, 
            and of groups to recommend it, undermines the status of the traditional 
            knowledge powerhouse: a singular didactic approach is less credible 
            in a network regulated by peer review and exchange – this is not 
            about a single voice intoning from the front of an auditorium: it&#39;s 
        about a conversation between equals. </p>
      <h1>About the Project</h1>
      <p><em>Every Object Tells a Story</em> is an interactive project that 
            tries to put these conversations at the centre of object interpretation. 
            Besides digitising photographs of 1600 objects from four museum collections, 
            the project is also inviting members of the public to submit their own 
            stories and objects, creating a unique on-line collection at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.everyobject.net/">www.everyobject.net</a>, 
            bringing together everyday objects with national treasures, and expert 
            opinion with personal anecdote. The on-line presentation of these objects 
            will be the same regardless of provenance, ensuring <em>parity of esteem</em> 
        between stories and objects, and enabling all who visit the site to 
        make their own contributions on their own terms – and creating 
            a many-part conversation about the value of objects and the meanings 
        that form around them. </p>

      <p>As befits an Internet project, the scale and ambition of <em>Every 
        Object</em> is considerable. </p>
      <p>Led by the Learning and Interpretation Department of the Victoria and 
            Albert Museum, the UK&#39;s National Museum of Art and Design, the project 
            was commissioned by the government agency <em>Culture Online</em>, and 
            the project team includes Ultralab, the educational technology house 
            at Anglia Polytechnic University; Channel 4 Television; and the museums 
            and galleries of Tyne &amp; Wear, Brighton &amp; Hove, and Birmingham. 
            Given the combined weight of these organisations, our targets are considerable, 
            and the Web site is tasked with attracting 1 million visitors and 50,000 
        public contributions by the end of 2005. </p>
      <p>The significance of these targets should be considered for a moment; 
            indeed, one million unique users might be thought a small audience share 
            for a Web site involving so many national partners. However, consideration 
            of these targets in context reveals much about the unusual nature of 
            this project: given that, in 2003/4, there were 2.7m visits to the V&amp;A&#39;s 
            three London sites, it becomes apparent that a different approach is 
            required for a single project that must generate 1m unique users and 
            an active participation margin of 1-in-20. To enable us to reach these 
            targets, the project is relying upon the reach and influence of Channel 
        4.</p>
      <p>Channel 4 is an independent public service broadcaster set up by Act 
            of Parliament in 1982. It is not funded by the licence fee (the mandatory 
            payment required of all television owners in the UK); instead, all money 
            to create programmes and run the business has to be found from our business 
            ventures, primarily advertising revenue and the exploitation of programme 
            rights. All revenue is returned to the Channel to pay running costs 
            and programme development. The licence to broadcast is paid for by the 
            Government in return for which the Channel has a public service remit 
            that specifically includes the requirement for programming to be innovative, 
            creative and distinctive, for it to take account of cultural diversity 
            (ethnic, religious, sexual and locational) and to make a significant 
        contribution to meeting the need for educational programmes. </p>
      <p>A key area of the channel, channel4.learning, is devoted to delivering 
            our public service remit through adult lifelong learning and formal 
            education. As such, it was natural for the department to be involved 
            in <em>Every Object Tells a Story</em>, a project which combines both 
            formal and informal learning. The key roles of the Channel in the project 
        are marketing, design, PR and some editorial input. </p>
      <p>The technology partner for the project is Ultralab, the internationally 
            renowned learning technology research centre at Anglia Polytechnic University. 
            The centre was founded by Stephen Heppell and has a reputation for pushing 
        the boundaries of on-line education and content delivery.</p>
      <h1>Storytelling And The Value Of Objects</h1>
      <p>Contemporary museology is interested in the way the value of objects 
            is influenced by the value of the stories associated with them. There 
            is a realisation that objects possess value not only because of their 
            aesthetic, technical or monetary value, but also, and in many cases 
            primarily, because of the associations they carry with them or, to simplify, 
        the stories they tell. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig3" id="Fig3"></a><img src="coldicutt.fig3.thumb.jpg" width="230" height="400" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Astarte Syriaca"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 3: Dante Gabriel Rossetti, &#34;Astarte Syriaca&#34;<strong><em>.</em></strong>

      <p class="caption">Fig 4: Unknown, Belt and hanger, 17th C.. Victoria 
        &amp; Albert Museum, London, UK. Bequeathed by May Morris.</p>
      <p>An object with limited inherent value can find a place in a national 
            collection because of the stories associated with it. For example, the 
            belt worn by Jane Burden, wife of William Morris, in Rossetti&#39;s 
            1877 painting <em>Astarte</em><em> Syriaca</em> is given added value 
            because of the story of Jane&#39;s love affair with Rossetti. The 
            belt&#39;s association with her as the model and with two great artists 
            adds to the value of the object, giving it a meaning outside of its 
            aesthetic value or its worth as a piece of craftsmanship: this could 
        be described as Attributed Value.</p>
      <p>However, the Attributed Value of an object depends upon our own associations: 
            as the &#34;reader&#34; of an object, we can bring many diverse meanings to 
            it, resisting the &#34;final signified&#34; of a closed interpretation (Barthes, 
            1977). As such, objects can have multiple values, and their meaning(s) 
            should not be closed by a single academic or factual interpretation. 
      </p>
      <p>In her paper <em>The Power of Museums</em>, for the 2004 Association 
            of Canadian Studies in the Netherlands (ACSN) seminar, Sloof explains 
        it clearly.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">...institutions like museums do present the object 
            with a certain meaning. They choose one or more of the object&#39;s 
        meanings and display the object accordingly.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Museums are divided into different groups. Among 
            others, there are art museums, anthropological museums, historical museums 
            and natural history museums. Each of these types of museums has their 
            own ideas on collecting and their own ways of presentation. When an 
            object enters a museum, the museum chooses those meanings of the object 
            that suit the museum&#39;s own context. So the same painting might 
            be displayed as a piece of a famous artist in an art museum, an illustration 
            of costumes in a certain age in a historical museum or a piece of ethnic 
            art, showing the style of painting of a certain cultural group. (Sloof, 
        2004) </p>
      <p>So objects are subject to the process of subjectivity even as they 
            are set in the context of the museum which happens to own them. They 
            will even be given a higher value or lower value according to the focus 
        of the location in which they are housed.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but whereas the access to objects and art is being democratised, 
            access to the knowledge with which to interpret key aspects of the attributed 
            value of objects remains restricted and is even diminishing: for instance, 
            changes to the education system and modern society mean that former 
            pieces of &#34;common knowledge&#34;, such as Biblical stories and knowledge 
        of Classical Civilisation, now have limited currency.</p>
      <p>One example of this is the small, and declining, numbers of UK students 
        taking Latin at GCSE level over the last 5 years shown in Table 1. </p>

      <p class="caption">Table 1: UK Students enrolled in Latin at GCSE Level. (source: Joint Council for Education, 2003)</p>
      <p>The UK is a country of 69 million; the total population of 16-year-olds 
            in 2003 was 760,000, and only 1.3% took Latin at the lowest national 
            qualification levels GCSE and GNVQ (ONS, 2004; JCQ, 2004). While this 
            1.3% gained a certain level of cultural knowledge from this, what of 
            the other 750,000? What do they know of ancient civilisation and the 
            roots of modern language? More specifically, what value can they attribute 
            to Canova&#39;s &#34;The Three Graces&#34;, held in the Victoria 
        and Albert Museum, London? </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig5" id="Fig5"></a><img src="coldicutt.fig5.thumb.jpg" width="246" height="400" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: The Three Graces"/></p>

      <p>It would not be inaccurate to suggest that they may well find inherent 
            value in its beauty and understand its monetary value through a knowledge 
            of the cost of marble and the time such a piece might take to sculpt; 
            they may equally interpret it solely as Roman porn. (The fact that this 
            might be one of the accurate values attributable to it is simply a happy 
        accident.)</p>
      <p>Where then is the role of museums and the Web in all this multi-valence? 
        And does story telling add to, or lessen, our understanding of objects?</p>
      <h2>The Dangers Of Personal Interpretation </h2>
      <p>It should be acknowledged at this point that there are dangers in encouraging 
            a personal interpretation of objects. The first and most obvious is 
            the danger of distortion, and the use of objects for erroneous personal 
            justification. An excellent case of this can be seen in Dan Brown&#39;s 
            fictional work, <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>. The central premise of the 
            book is that the true location of the Holy Grail can be uncovered through 
            the paintings of Leonardo Da Vinci and the architecture of select locations 
            in the United Kingdom and France. <em>The Da Vinci Code </em>is inspired 
            by the book <em>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</em> by Michael Baigent, Richard 
            Leigh and Henry Lincoln, the hypothesis of which is that Jesus survived 
            the Crucifixion and together with Mary Magdalene founded a bloodline 
            that later became the Merovingians in France (protected by the Knights 
            Templar and later by the Freemasons), knowledge of which was allegedly 
            suppressed by the Catholic church but kept alive by a secret organisation 
            of which Leonardo da Vinci was a member. Da Vinci is then supposed to 
            have alluded to these secrets in his works of art, particularly the 
            famous <em>The Last Supper </em>on the refectory wall of the Convent 
            of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan. In this painting, as both Brown 
            and the authors of <em>Holy Blood Holy Grail</em> point out, the figure 
            Leonardo painted to the right of Jesus is pretty and beardless, with 
            long flowing hair, and that this figure&#39;s left arm, with Jesus&#39; right 
            arm, forms a V shape. These two facts are taken to mean that the feminine 
            figure is wrongly identified as John, the disciple Jesus loved, when 
            it is in fact Mary Magdalene, the V shape a symbol of &#34;the sacred 
        feminine&#34;.</p>
      <p>However, knowledge of Leonardo&#39;s other works such as <em>St John 
            the Baptist</em> show that he often painted androgynous or even beautifully 
            feminine men, something supported by further knowledge of his sexuality. 
      </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig6" id="Fig6"></a><img src="coldicutt.fig6.jpg" width="156" height="200" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: St John the Baptist"/></p>
      <p class="caption"> Fig 6: Leonardo da Vinci, &#34;St John the Baptist&#34;, Musée du Louvre, Paris, 
        France</p>
      <p>There are now <em>Da</em><em> Vinci Code</em> tours around the monuments 
            featured in the book, and the Church of Sainte Sulpice has been forced 
            to prepare a refutation of a variety of &#34;facts&#34; that the book has communicated 
            regarding its location, importance, and the supposed occurrence of murders 
        there.</p>
      <p>So a little knowledge can be dangerous. But that does not mean that 
            factual awareness is essential for an object to have meaning to an individual. 
            Indeed, <em>Every Object</em>&#39;s multi-faceted approach to object interpretation 
            runs almost contrary to much curatorial research. While each museum 
            object is presented with its tombstone catalogue information (showing 
            information about attribution and materials), this is only part of the 
            holistic method we hope to encourage. Unusual items in the <em>Every 
            Object</em> collection include a lock of hair from the head of much-loved 
            Newcastle author Catherine Cookson, a lipstick kiss by supermodel Kate 
            Moss, and a <em>Star Wars</em> At-At Fighter<strong> </strong>- described 
            by the storyteller with painstaking affection, some twenty-odd years 
            after his playing days have passed. The emotions and associations that 
            these objects arouse may not be the traditional stuff of museum labels, 
            and the stories they attract will be concerned with the dramas and passions 
            aroused in everyday life by everyday things – and not, at a guess, 
            tales of epochal moments in recent history. But while the tale of one 
            little boy&#39;s (thwarted) ambition to become Luke Skywalker may 
            be seen as banal submission to the demands of mass-media, it is nonetheless 
            instructive with regard to childhood and memory, those lodestones of 
        human experience that are common to us all. </p>
      <p>In his report <em>A Common Wealth: Museums in the Learning Age</em>, 
        David Anderson says that:</p>
      <p class="blockquote">Museums at their finest ... communicate with us across boundaries of 
            language, culture, and time, and suggest comparisons which illuminate 
            our experience of the present .... Through museums, we have direct contact 
            with peoples of all ages and cultures, experience the unimaginable variety 
            of the natural world and expand our understanding of what it means to 
        be human.</p>
      <p>Interpreting objects through personal narrative relates directly to 
            our understanding of other people and our selves. Indeed, one aim of 
            this project is to convey a greater and more thorough understanding 
            of objects and their significance by allowing multiple interpretations 
            to co-exist: by combining the historic, cultural, material, personal, 
            and inspirational aspects of an object, we hope to offer the reader 
            a chance to develop a multi-faceted and fully rounded understanding 
        of its importance and place within our society.</p>
      <p>In the 150 years since it was founded, the V&amp;A has amassed one 
            of the world&#39;s greatest collections of art and design, and established 
            an international reputation for excellence and expertise. Will <em>Every 
            Object</em>&#39;s democratic and interactive approach to interpretation 
        be damaging to this reputation?</p>
      <p>Many of the Museum&#39;s curatorial staff have contributed to <em>Every 
            Object</em> stories that convey their passions and enthusiasms, while 
            others have chosen to dwell upon the traditional elements of explanation 
            and interpretation. As a public-access project that seeks to include 
            those alienated by museums and disenfranchised by high culture, the 
            tone and content of these stories is of necessity more relaxed, and 
            in many cases more personal, than would be found on a Museum label or 
            in a scholarly article or monograph. The compound effect of these stories 
            is increased accessibility that presumes no technical or other specialist 
            knowledge, and which reveals unseen aspects of the collections and of 
            Museum life. Many of these stories bristle with vitality and offer new 
            perspectives on the significance of objects, enabling a non-specialist 
            to approach the collected objects with a sense of connection and understanding, 
            and to develop a relationship to the stories&#39; authors, who would 
        otherwise appear as remote figures of expertise.</p>
      <p>It is not only the tone and content of these stories that is so unusual; 
            there is also the matter of display. Objects of international significance 
            are displayed next to personal ephemera, and expert contributions are 
            positioned alongside stories written by the public. This mixture of 
            objects and approaches is especially suited to on-line display, and 
            the structure of the <em>Every Object</em> Web site is that of the Internet 
            in microcosm: a network of networks, connected by themes, experiences, 
            and individuals, which can be traversed via a different path at every 
        visit. </p>
      <p>The navigational core of the site is four-dimensional, with each contribution 
            classified with up to four labels that place the object and story somewhere 
            in history, and associate it with a place, a person, and a theme. As 
            this is a user-generated site, each label is entirely subjective, showing 
            the truth of that object and story as it is seen or understood by its 
            author. Rather than introducing conflicting detail, this weaves the 
            objects into overlapping networks and provides intriguing paths – 
        from Raphael Cartoons through relics to photographs, and from lingerie 
        through to costumes and casts.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it is this model of <em>publication by the public</em> that 
            might be seen to increase the reputational risk of the project. Wikipedia 
            (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">en.wikipedia.org</a>) uses a similar, unverified process of open-editing, 
            which has led it to become &#34;the world&#39;s largest encyclopedia in 
            less than four years of operation, with 450,000 articles and 77 million 
            words in the English edition&#34; (Wikipedia). The rules of submission state 
            that &#34;unverifiable information, or facts newly discovered that have 
            not been published elsewhere ... are not welcome&#34;, but this has not 
            been sufficient to quell criticism of the site by information professionals, 
            who cannot trust the public to publish the truth. Indeed, the Wikipedia 
            article <em>Criticism of Wikipedia</em> cites two examples of such reluctance 
            to accept a move away from the top-down information hierarchy and towards 
        a model of open publication:</p>
      <p class="blockquote">The main problem is lack of authority. With printed publications, the 
            publishers have to ensure that their data is reliable, as their livelihood 
            depends on it. But with something like this, that all goes out the window. 
        (librarian Philip Bradley)</p>
      <p class="blockquote">The user who visits Wikipedia to learn about some subject, to confirm 
            some matter of fact, is rather in the position of a visitor to a public 
            restroom. It may obviously be dirty, so that he knows to exercise great 
            care, or it may seem fairly clean, so that he may be lulled into a false 
            sense of security. What he certainly doesn&#39;t know is who has used 
            the facilities before him. <span class="blockquoteauthor">(Robert McHenry, former editor in chief of 
        <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em>)</span></p>
      <p>Such disdain of public knowledge and contribution reinforces the model 
            in which knowledge is owned by the few, to be distributed to the many. 
        <em>Every Object</em> hopes to counter both this hierarchical approach 
            and the mistrust of this format by presenting conflicting views and 
            interpretations side-by-side, creating a format for conversation and 
            debate that allows readers to engage with multiple narratives, thereby 
            arriving at their own understanding – learning through the interpretation 
            and assimilation of information on their own terms, rather than simply 
        accepting received wisdom. </p>
      <h1>Opportunities Created By This Approach</h1>
      <p>A project of this nature not only raises problems of authority; it 
            also offers an opportunity for those outside the museum world to contribute 
            to the understanding of objects – even correctly reinterpreting 
            them. By allowing the public to see objects and to add their stories 
            to the information collected around them, <em>Every Object Tells a Story</em> 
        may allow members of the public to make positive contributions to the 
        use of objects or their provenance. One only has to look at the reception 
        of the 1987 traveling exhibition <em>Hispanic Art in the United States: 
            Thirty Contemporary Printers and Sculptors</em> which enraged many Latin 
        Americans. </p>
      <p>As Ivan Karp and Steven Lavine write in <em>Exhibiting Cultures: The 
            Poetics and Politics of Museum Display</em>, the collected papers from 
            the 1998 colloquia at the Smithsonian, the show was criticized because 
            it &#34;underestimates the overt political dimension of contemporary 
            Hispanic art .... [stripping] the work of its linkage to the social 
            arena&#34; (Karp and Lavine, 1998). This situation would not have arisen 
            if the curators had consulted the Hispanic community and included their 
            contributions and understanding in the exhibition&#39;s interpretative 
        material. </p>
      <p>A project of this nature also creates opportunities for broader social 
            inclusion. The London School of Economics project UK Children Go On-line 
            has examined the links between the Internet and citizenship in British 
            children aged from 9-19. Former Home Secretary David Blunkett has said 
            that &#34;Digital technology has important implications for the relationship 
            between children and the state&#34;, and Sonia Livingstone&#39;s team 
            explored the impact of engaging in &#34;a civic or social enterprise larger 
            than the individual exchange of information&#34; (Livingstone, Bober, Helsper, 
            2004). Of children surveyed, 94% used the Internet to find information, 
            and 70% had participated in &#34;at least one form of interactive engagement 
            with a website&#34; (Livingstone, Bober, Helsper, 
            2004), meaning that virtual social networks are affording 
            young people the means to forge bonds of social and cultural identity. 
        Livingstone&#39;s survey points out that:</p>
      <p class="blockquote">Many hopes are now pinned on the internet as a means of increasing 
            young people&#39;s participation. The internet is widely hailed as 
            the technology to bring direct participatory democracy to the masses, 
            enabling citizens to become actively engaged in the political process 
            .... The hope is leading many organisations, mainly – but not 
            exclusively – in the public sector, to develop web sites, on-line 
            forums, chat spaces, peer networks, and so forth, which aim to encourage 
            young people to make use of a wide range of on-line opportunities, interacting 
        and participating with each other and with decision makers <span class="blockquoteauthor">(Livingstone, Bober, Helsper, 
        2004).</span></p>
      <p><em>Every Object&#39;</em>s target audiences include the &#34;hard-to-reach&#34;, 
            defined in this instance as those alienated by high culture. In building 
            a democratically curated collection, the project enables cultural participation 
            and identification, facilitating inclusive social networks that forge 
            connections between members of the public and national organisations 
        at a time when civic involvement and investment is declining:</p>
      <p class="blockquote">Over recent years, there has been a decline in the level 
            of participation in elections across the UK. Turnout at the 2001 
            general election was only 59.4%, and is even lower at local elections. 
            This trend is reflected in other western democracies. <span class="blockquoteauthor">(Electoral commission, 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.electoralcommission.gov.uk/elections/publicparticipation.cfm">http://www.electoralcommission.gov.uk/elections/publicparticipation.cfm</a>)</span></p>
      <p>In a society that feels disenfranchised and powerless, the opportunity 
            to contribute in a concrete way to something that may not make a difference 
            but allows your voice to be heard is something which is valued highly. 
            The fact that <em>Big Brother</em> (a channel 4 reality TV show, see 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://bigbrother.channel4.com/bigbrother/">http://bigbrother.channel4.com/bigbrother/</a>) 
            is a worldwide success is due in part of the emotional involvement of 
            the audiences in the unfolding of the human drama – manipulated 
        by them.</p>
      <p><em>Every Object Tells a Story</em> is a project that acknowledges 
            and welcomes the contribution of the individual. In recognising this 
            contribution and publishing it, projects such as this create an emotional 
            connection of validation with their users. This in turn creates their 
            desire for the community to function effectively and to learn and enjoy 
            the stories provided by curators and their peers. In fact it turns creators 
        into peers, involved in active communication with one another. </p>
      <p>The emergence of virtual social networks has had an important impact 
            on how people use the Internet. In privileging and prioritising information, 
            many Internet users now seek a &#34;trusted guide&#34; who can help them to 
            fathom the multitude of choices and search results they are offered. 
      </p>
      <p>The <em>Imagining the Internet</em> project is based upon a survey 
            of 1,286 Internet experts, who annually offer their predictions regarding 
            the Web&#39;s short-term future. One respondent, a consultant for 
            the MIT Program on Internet Telecoms and Convergence, predicts that 
        in the next ten years, </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">[p]eople will have a wider range of sources – 
        but most will settle on a small number that they will use repeatedly 
      – much as they use a small subset of the large number of TV networks 
        already available (Fox, Anderson, Rainie, 2005). </p>
      <p>This is congruent with the model apparent on Amazon and Friendster, 
            where the behaviour of other users offers pre-beaten navigational paths 
        – testimonials and recommendations (whether they are book buyers 
            or sellers, friends or lovers) guiding a way through the mass of choice. 
      </p>
      <p>In other words, the Internet user of the future may develop trust-based 
            relationships with their information sources as they look for ways to 
            understand the vast number of resources available to them. There are 
            a some Web presences for which this is already the case – Google, 
            eBay, and news.bbc.co.uk each cornering the market in their field – 
        and this trend is further supported by the growth of Web logs that aggregate 
        and recommend points of interest across the Web; trusted, named individuals 
        providing a gateway to on-line content. As of January 2005, 5% of American 
        Web users were already &#34;using RSS aggregators or XML readers to get 
            the news and other information delivered from blogs and content-rich 
            Web sites as it is posted on-line ... an indicator that this application 
        is gaining an impressive foothold&#34; (Raine, 2005). </p>
      <p>Every author of an <em>Every Object</em> story is named – whether 
            they are contributing from a museum or as general user. This offers 
            the chance for the reader to engage with real people, resulting in a 
            sense of community that breaks down the monolithic impression of an 
            institutional effort, as seen in the traditional educational format 
            of one-to-many, and introduces a less intimidating, peer-to-peer model, 
            creating a nexus of connections that enables the site to achieve a many-to-many 
            sense of social networking. Readers are able to follow the contributions 
            of an author that interests them, reading their various comments, stories, 
            and following their tours of selected information, thereby engaging 
            more actively in a smaller circle of influence, and developing a series 
        of more active and meaningful relationships. </p>
      <h1>Choosing The Right Media Partner</h1>
      <p>The choice of media partner for any museum project is always carefully 
            judged, but more so when a museum is seeking a democratisation of its 
        content and the creation or expansion of community. </p>
      <p>The most obvious contribution that can be made is that of reach. In 
            December, 2004, Channel 4 reached 9.24% of all viewing individuals and 
            11.5% of all viewing 16-34-year olds (BARB, 2004). Given that the total 
            population of the country is 69 million, likely viewing numbers are 
            around 7 million viewers for that month. The total number of visitors 
            to the V&amp;A in 2003 was 2,689,500. Using Channel 4 for marketing 
            is obviously a good strategy, to help the project achieve its required 
            visitor numbers. In addition, Channel 4 has a clear remit to produce 
            programming for multicultural audiences and for minority interests, 
            and can reach types of audiences not easily reached by the Victoria 
        and Albert museum, the project leaders.</p>
      <p>However, the role of a media partner should never be viewed simply 
            as a great marketing tool for content and ideas. The very fact of a 
            media partner means that whatever the size, reach or identity, the partner 
            will be creative and able to contribute ideas and new directions as 
            much as marketing resources. It will be in touch with the audience or 
            the desired audience in a different way, with its own knowledge of what 
            makes effective communication and stimulating content. Therefore, a 
            media partner can significantly contribute to your brand, content and 
        even administrative practices. And biggest isn&#39;t always best!</p>
      <p>Channel 4 is an ideal brand partner for <em>Every Object Tells A Story</em> 
        for the following reasons:</p>
          <ul>
          <li> 
            <div class="listwithbullets">Visual Brand – the channel has won 
              awards for its brand and has a distinctive cutting edge approach to 
              design combined with an appreciation of the needs of different audiences.</div>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <div class="listwithbullets">Brand identity – Channel 4&#39;s brand 
              is associated with the non-judgemental and irreverent and at the same 
              time with an uncompromising drive to break new boundaries in production, 
              research and broadcast. It is the channel of Big Brother and the Time 
              Team, of Equinox and T4. </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="Section1"> 
          <p>These values have been applied to the project site to create a clean, 
            contemporary feel and to the editorial function to develop a distinctive 
            and welcoming tone.</p>
          <p>Finally, Channel 4&#39;s experience of managing on-line communities through 
            very popular forums and <em>Big Brother</em> made us the natural manager 
            of the content. The approach is very <em>laissez faire</em> outside 
            legal requirements, and this is likely to benefit the project, in encouraging 
            interesting and vibrant connections among the users of <em>Every Object 
            Tells A Story</em>.</p>

          <h1>Conclusions</h1>
          <p>Democratisation depends upon distribution; for something to be open 
            to the people, it must be available to them. By partnering with Channel 
            4, the V&amp;A is able to reach a much larger and more challenging audience 
            than it would under its own auspices as a museum. However, availability 
            is not enough: a fully functional on-line presence must be compelling 
            and accessible. In the case of <em>Every Object</em> we have sought 
            to take this further by creating a format that people can contribute 
            to, capitalising upon the &#34;shape of the Internet&#34; by using the social 
            networks model. As such, this is a truly interactive project, and one 
            that sees the coalescence of museums and the Web.</p>
