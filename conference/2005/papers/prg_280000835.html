      <h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
      <p>In the closing plenary for Museums and the Web 2004, <em>Making Sense 
          of Modern Art (MSoMA) Five Years On,</em> one of the authors, Peter 
          Samis, spoke about the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art&#39;s (SFMOMA) 
          on-line interactive programs and the authoring tool the Museum has developed 
          over the years to publish them. This year Peter joins with Larry Johnson 
          of the New Media Consortium (NMC) to tell the story of how this unusual 
          project has fueled an equally unusual collaboration between the museum, 
          library, and university worlds that promises to give all of these communities 
          access to the tools used to create <em>MSoMA</em>. The purpose of this 
          paper is to describe how that collaboration came into being, and in 
          particular, how <em>Pachyderm</em><sup>™</sup><em>,</em> the proprietary 
          Flash authoring and publishing tool that SFMOMA developed with outside 
          partners to create MSoMA, has been successfully translated into an open-source 
          software platform that will be made available for general use in these 
        communities in the coming year. </p>
      <p>Developed by SFMOMA to make the publication of modular and updateable 
          rich media an easy task, the original <em>Pachyderm</em> has allowed 
          non-programmers to create a variety of engaging resources that draw 
          from, and build on, the Museum&#39;s collections. The result has been in-depth 
          Flash-based interactive learning programs such as <em>Ansel</em><em> 
          Adams at 100</em> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfmoma.org/adams">http://www.sfmoma.org/adams</a>) and <em>Eva Hesse</em> 
        (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfmoma.org/hesse">http://www.sfmoma.org/hesse</a>), among many others. 
          To date, literally millions of on-line and in-museum users have used 
          the interactive learning programs authored using <em>Pachyderm</em> 
        at SFMOMA. </p>
      <p>The new tool, not surprisingly called<em> Pachyderm 2.0</em>, will 
          be offered royalty-free thanks to an IMLS-sponsored collaboration between 
          SFMOMA, five leading museums, and the library and university members 
          of the New Media Consortium (NMC), an international association of 200 
          colleges, universities, museums, and other learning-focused organizations. 
          The<em> Pachyderm 2.0 Project</em> has brought software development 
          teams and digital library experts from six NMC universities together 
          with counterparts from five major museums to create a new, open source 
          authoring environment for creators of Web-based and multimedia learning 
          experiences. The new tool, faithfully based on the original<em> Pachyderm</em>, 
          is an interoperable, robust, easily distributable version that will 
          be released as open-source and include a wide range of rich pedagogical 
          templates. <em>Pachyderm 2.0,</em> now in beta testing, produces learning 
          materials optimized for Internet delivery, easily reusable, and conformant 
        with key search, archival, and cataloging standards. </p>
      <p>The collaboration that characterizes the project is unique, and brings 
          together the metadata and other expertise of the NMC&#39;s library community, 
          the technological expertise in infrastructure and programming of key 
          university members, and the user- and learner-focused expertise of a 
          team of experienced interactive producers from five museums and several 
          NMC schools. This latter group is advising on interface design, audience 
          needs, and the technological capacities of future museum visitors, curatorial 
        staff, faculty, and students. </p>
      <p>A remarkable aspect of the project has been the easy and highly efficient 
          collaboration among team members who are geographically dispersed across 
          the length and breadth of North America. The teams use a wide array 
          of technologies to support their work, including VoIP conferencing (video 
          via the Web), blogs, instant messaging, email distribution lists, wikis, 
          Web-accessible databases – and of course telephone conferencing 
        and periodic face-to-face gatherings. </p>
      <p>This paper will give a brief overview of the project, its history and 
          vision, and a description of the collaborative processes that have made<em> 
          Pachyderm 2.0 </em>possible. We&#39;ll begin with a brief background about<em> 
          Pachyderm 1.0,</em> its origins and purposes, and review some of the 
          salient features of <em>Pachyderm</em> that prompted its migration to 
          open source. The core of this paper will focus on the process by which 
          we have been developing<em> Pachyderm 2.0,</em> our plans for beta testing, 
          and how it will soon be made available to the greater museum community. 
          Other papers (Smith 2005, LaMar 2005) detail the user requirements gathering 
          and testing process, and the programming architecture/authoring interface 
          re-design for<em> Pachyderm 2.0</em>. Taken together, we hope these 
          three papers will provide a comprehensive overview of this new multimedia 
          development environment, and instill a desire for institutions to road 
        test it in service of their own on-line content development needs. </p>
      <h1><em>Pachyderm</em>: A History</h1>
      <p>The first <em>Pachyderm</em> (even before it received its elephantine 
          name) was born of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art&#39;s need to provide 
          an ongoing authoring solution to its multimedia educational program 
        <em>Making Sense of Modern Art</em>. The Museum chose Macromedia Flash™ 
        because in 1999 it was the only way we could ensure the design integrity 
        we had come to expect from early CD-ROMs in a Web-compatible format. 
        It offered elegance of font design, page display, and multimedia integration 
        across the bewildering variety of browsers and platforms then in use 
        (although at the time its relations with Apple&#39;s QuickTime™ video 
          standard were far from a match made in heaven!). Furthermore, it provided 
          a one-stop solution for publishing to the Web, fixed disc, or a kiosk. 
      </p>
      <p>That said, we were multimedia educators, not expert Flash programmers. 
          Working with two San Francisco-based firms, Perimetre-Flux Design and 
        Red Eye Digital Media, we proceeded simultaneously on four fronts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <div class="listwithnumbers"> The first chapters of the <em>Making Sense</em> 
            program itself, featuring rich media explorations of works by Robert 
            Rauschenberg, Sol LeWitt, and many other artists of the Sixties and 
            Seventies and the Late Twentieth Century </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="listwithnumbers"> Development of interactive templates representing 
            a variety of approaches to understanding and appreciating modern and 
            contemporary art </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="listwithnumbers"> The Flash programming to realize and populate 
            those templates</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="listwithnumbers"> A content management and authoring tool 
            that ported our Filemaker data into an SQL database, paired with a 
            Web-based authoring interface. This tool, built to populate the templates 
            we had designed, would enable us to add future chapters to the <em>MSOMA 
            </em>program without having to ask Red Eye to do it for us. Technically, 
            Visual Basic, VBScript and ASP connected the Web interface to the 
            database and the data to the Flash. Flash Generator was used to wed 
            object metadata to artwork images, resulting in .swf files that carried 
            their label and copyright information with them wherever they appeared 
            in the program.</div>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>Pachyderm</em> as we now know it was the outcome of Deliverables 
          2, 3, and 4: the templates, the Flash, the browser-based authoring interface, 
          and the under-the-hood logic that enables users to populate the templates 
        with media and text, and publish to various platforms on demand.</p>
      <p>The interactive templates were the authoring tool&#39;s defining feature. 
          Each of them embodied a distinct approach to the examination, contextualization, 
          and modes of understanding objects and images. The <em>Formal Analysis</em> 
        screen allowed close-up examination of salient parts of a graphic file 
        and refreshed the text as a user moused over each one. The <em>Slider 
          Gallery</em> enabled a diachronic reading of a set of images, or the 
          establishment of variations within a typology. The <em>Zoom Screen </em>allowed 
          for extreme close-ups and pans of graphic files accompanied by sound 
          commentary. The <em>Onion Skin </em>enabled multiple interpretations, 
          or levels of approach, to a single work, movement, or idea. (See the 
        <a href="#Appendix">Appendix</a> for a discussion of the Pachyderm templates.)</p>
      <p>In fact, almost all the templates had this in common: they served as 
        <em>multipliers of content</em>. What the viewer saw on first arriving 
          was less than they saw as they explored the screen. The screen types 
          were inherently polyvalent: each held within it a mechanism for revealing 
          a cascading succession of related media content as a result of the viewer&#39;s 
          engagement. Multiple screen states, or facets of the topic, unfolded 
          without having to refresh or reload the content. This was a natural 
          outgrowth of the fact that both <em>MSoMA</em> and its authoring tool 
          had been conceived to facilitate multiple approaches and modes of interpretation, 
          to foster an open-ended, discovery-based understanding of the subjects 
        they treated (Samis and Wise, 2000). </p>
      <p>Another of <em>Pachyderm</em>’s strengths was that it allowed us to 
          produce a large selection of stand-alone screens, each embodying a concept 
          or pedagogical point that could then be used and re-used for various 
          purposes in various presentations: a primitive form of a shared content 
          repository. The flexibility of publishing to Web, kiosk, or CD-ROM was 
          yet another definite plus. But most important of all was that once the 
          initial investment was made, it became possible to use the templates 
          to publish new interactive features for the price of the rights licenses 
          and whatever new video production we hoped to add. The cost of doing 
        quality multimedia dropped dramatically.</p>
      <p>When we demonstrated and discussed these strategies, we found there 
          was considerable interest among our museum peers. When would it be available 
          for licensing, they asked? While in theory we were all for sharing the 
          tool, we were also acutely aware that the tool in its then current state 
          had constraints we weren&#39;t happy about; in particular, the authoring 
          interface had taken a back seat to the templates in the competition 
          for our limited funding, and we couldn&#39;t in good conscience roll it 
          out so full of irregularities. (Granted, our interns showed they could 
          learn to use it in a day, but it was still so far from the product we 
        had envisioned or would have wanted to deliver anyone else…) </p>
      <p>Secondly, the tool was designed to publish all presentations with the 
        <em>MSoMA</em><em> </em>look-and-feel: orange border, SFMOMA logo and 
          arrow upper right, <em>MSoMA</em><em> </em>navigation cube upper left. 
          We had succeeded in replacing those graphics with an alternative look-and-feel 
          for our <em>Ansel</em><em> Adams at 100</em> feature, but it had required 
          hiring programmers to reconfigure the Flash. Even as we got better at 
          it in-house, we saw that swapping out these themed graphics files was 
          not trivial. Without that feature, other museums would not be able to 
        insert their own branding. </p>
      <p>Finally, other questions loomed: who would provide training, documentation 
          and on-call technical support to potential licensees? We had our own 
          ambitious schedule of content deliverables to meet for SFMOMA and couldn&#39;t 
          be traveling or manning the phones to train and answer questions on 
          a regular basis. Even more frightening: given a user community, how 
          could we ensure the upgrade path? Flash 4, the platform of origin, had 
          already given way to Flash 5, with no end in sight! We were, after all, 
          primarily in the content business, not software entrepreneurs, and the 
          maintenance, quality assurance, upgrade, and distribution of a code 
        base for an entire user community went far beyond our mission. </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, one SFMOMA Director, the entrepreneurial art-and-tech 
          visionary David Ross, saw things differently. In late 2000 he ordered 
          a study of how SFMOMA&#39;s investment in <em>Pachyderm (</em>by now the 
          tool had its name, derived from the fusion of a Thai restaurant name 
          in Sausalito with the well-known parable of Hindu blind men describing 
          an elephant ) might translate into dot-com dollars for the Museum&#39;s 
        ambitious programs. </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">And then there&#39;s the director&#39;s latest plan: nothing 
          grand, just the founding of a new software company… &#34;The 
          real way to make money isn&#39;t begging… It&#39;s going out and making 
        it on your own, big time.&#34;</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">–Stephen Henry Madoff, &#34;Is this the Museum 
        of the Future?&#34; Talk Magazine (March 2001): 132-137.</p>
      <p>In a white paper prepared to evaluate potential markets for the tool, 
          David Henshaw wrote words that we hope will be prescient for the current 
        project: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>Pachyderm</em> brings benefits to each key audience: 
        <em>Knowledge Owners </em>get a tool that allows them to enter their 
          content without being a technical wizard; <em>Knowledge Acquirers</em> 
        get a tool that has a rich interface, is interactive and can be explored 
        though &#34;discovery.&#34; <em>Administrators</em> get a tool that takes 
          advantage of an existing standard infrastructure and has low support 
        and maintenance characteristics…</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">No programming skills are required, and a series 
          of templates helps guide the experts through the process. <em>Pachyderm</em> 
        brings the ability to create compelling content straight to those people 
        who have the knowledge and understanding to begin with. (Henshaw, 2001)</p>
      <p>David logically anticipated that one of the fastest growing markets 
        for on-line education would be colleges and universities.</p>
      <p>Sadly, this optimism had dimmed by the fall of 2002, and future development 
          prospects for <em>Pachyderm</em> seemed unlikely. Dot-com euphoria had 
          given way to dot-bomb fallout, and David Ross had left SFMOMA under 
          a cloud; interactive educational technology staffers at the museum had 
          been laid off; and ArtCouncil On-line, an ambitious on-line cultural 
          venue which had briefly hoped to consolidate Intel&#39;s artmuseum.net and 
          artandculture.com while continuing to publish new arts-related content 
          using <em>Pachyderm</em>, was at the end of its funds. While still very 
          useful for the remaining SFMOMA staff, the future of <em>Pachyderm</em>, 
          and especially support for continued refinement and expansion, was very 
        much in doubt.</p>
      <p>At this same time, the New Media Consortium (NMC) was actively talking 
          to museums about how the relationships between colleges and museums 
          that have worked so well in regional contexts might be scaled to a national 
          level. The NMC, a 501(c)3 not-for-profit consortium of nearly 200 leading 
          colleges, universities, museums, corporations, and other learning-focused 
          organizations, has long been dedicated to the exploration and use of 
          new media and new technologies. Its member institutions are found in 
          almost every state in the US, across Canada, and in Europe, Latin America, 
          and Japan, and its primary audience is the people on campuses charged 
          with the design, creation, and support of new media tools and content. 
      </p>
      <p>The consortium&#39;s mission, to serve as a catalyst for the development 
          of new applications of technology to support learning and creative expression, 
          coupled with its active network of skilled designers, programmers, and 
          learning support specialists made the NMC uniquely suited to support 
          a large-scale collaboration that could meet the needs of campus developers, 
          and the organization was actively engaged in looking for the right place 
        to start. </p>
      <p>In the spring of 2002, Ted Kahn, a Bay-area scientist with strong connections 
          in both the museum and education worlds, and the first NMC Fellow, was 
          working on a project to introduce new media leaders in the museum world 
          to the work of the NMC. Among the introductions he made was one between 
          John Weber, now an NMC Board member, and Larry Johnson, CEO of the NMC. 
          As part of their conversations, Susie Wise provided a demo of <em>Pachyderm</em>. 
          The potential of this tool for higher education was immediately apparent 
          to Larry, who was most intrigued by the pedagogical approach embedded 
          in the <em>Pachyderm</em> templates, but the conversations ranged across 
          a wide spectrum of ideas, of which <em>Pachyderm</em> was just one at 
        the time.</p>
      <p>With Ted Kahn serving as facilitator, John and the SFMOMA team continued 
          in conversations with Larry and the NMC over the summer and into the 
          fall. As these conversations unfolded, it gradually became clear that 
          a potential collaboration around <em>Pachyderm</em> presented a kind 
          of &#34;perfect storm&#34; of opportunity – SFMOMA had a working 
          tool that could meet the needs of a tremendous number of institutions 
          wanting to create quality on-line content easily – a group that 
          included colleges, universities, libraries, and museums, just to start. 
      </p>
      <p>The NMC, with the skills its members could bring to bear on projects 
          and its focus on encouraging innovation and collaboration, had the means 
          to build on SFMOMA&#39;s work. Working together, they could effectively 
          deal with the obstacles that had seemed insurmountable or prohibitively 
          expensive to SFMOMA acting alone, or to a for-profit software venture 
          for that matter. The idea took shape in remarkably short order, and 
          several key partners were identified (see table). The group began to 
          consider funding strategies and the Institute for Museum and Library 
          Services&#39; (IMLS) National Leadership Grants seemed the perfect fit. 
          Larry Johnson took on the task of framing a proposal, with considerable 
        assistance from Peter Samis and John Weber. </p>

      <p class="caption">Pachyderm 2.0 Project Partners</p>
      <p>In October 2003, the IMLS notified the NMC that the proposal had been 
          funded. One of the reviewers wrote in his comments that the partners 
          constituted &#34;the League of Extraordinary Institutions,&#34; and indeed, 
          as work began in earnest, the partners pitched in with extraordinary 
          enthusiasm. A Partnership Kickoff Meeting was held in San Francisco 
          Oct 28-30, 2003, and attended by 32 representatives of the 12 partner 
          institutions. At this meeting, the partners discussed the project and 
          its goals, agreed on major milestones and related deadlines for years 
          two and three, and began building the connections between people that 
          sustain the project between face-to-face meetings. The meeting, which 
          was structured as an intensive working session, resulted in the development 
          of more than 75 personae and over 100 scenarios for using <em>Pachyderm</em>. 
          (This work and all other documents and tools referred to in this document 
      can be viewed on the <em>Pachyderm</em> Web site, at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nmc.org/pachyderm">http://www.nmc.org/Pachyderm</a>.)</p>
      <p>At this meeting, a number of functional teams were formed, each charged 
          with completion of a component of the effort: the Requirements Team; 
          the Pedagogy &amp; Usability Team; the Programming Team; and the Metadata 
        &amp; Standards Team (see Acknowledgements for Team Members). Biweekly 
        <em>Breeze Live</em> meetings between the team leaders, the project 
          manager, and the project directors ensured that each of the distributed 
          teams was working in concert with the other project teams and allowed 
        easy &#34;mid-course corrections&#34; whenever needed. </p>
      <p>From the earliest conversations, two goals were formulated related 
          to the development of the<em> Pachyderm 2.0</em> authoring environment. 
          The first was to make the software &#34;platform-independent&#34; so the 
          tool could be installed on any server, with Linux, Windows, and Mac 
          servers to be tested. The second was to redesign the authoring interface&#39;s 
          look and feel, moving it to a completely open-source approach, and putting 
          the code into place that will enable a future shift to a component-based 
        rather than a template-based system.</p>
      <p>Activities related to the first goal primarily involved rewriting the 
          original <em>Pachyderm</em> code to incorporate open-source components 
          such as MySQL rather than the original FileMaker Pro and Microsoft SQL 
          databases, and rewriting scripts and other components originally in 
          Visual Basic in the more open PHP and XML. To accomplish the second 
          goal, <em>Pachyderm</em> was conceptualized as having two major parts. 
          The first was the &#34;Authoring Interface,&#34; which included the Web 
          pages into which authors enter the content for their modules and the 
          logic required to make those pages functional. With that interface, 
          users can use a Web browser on any machine to access the authoring interface. 
          This aspect of <em>Pachyderm</em> has been moved completely to a fully 
          open-source code base. The &#34;Publishing Component&#34; resides on a 
          server and runs commands issued by the Authoring Interface to turn data 
          from the database into a finished <em>Pachyderm</em> module (Flash &amp; 
        media files ready to run on a Web server or CD-ROM). This component 
        has been incorporated into the APOLLO platform, running on Apple&#39;s WebObjects, 
        a University of Calgary tool that provides significant new functionality 
        and will make the creation of <em>Pachyderm</em> extensions much simpler. 
          The move to WebObjects is a slight compromise given our complete openware 
          goal, but it promises to save us countless programmer hours in achieving 
        the desired set of features.</p>
      <p>The Pachyderm 2.0 Project is not just about rewriting the software, 
          however. Central to the project is the development of at least 20 richly 
          interactive learning experiences by the project&#39;s museum and university 
          partners using the new environment. The development of these materials 
          will constitute a comprehensive test of the software in at least 10 
          different settings, and prove its worth as an authoring environment 
        – as well as provide exemplars for the range of ways in which 
        the tool might be used. </p>
      <h1>The Process</h1>
      <p>The existing <em>Pachyderm</em> code was extensively reviewed in Fall 
          2003 to identify opportunities for improvements, streamlining, greater 
          flexibility and correction of lingering bugs. Similarly, the existing 
        <em>Pachyderm</em> interface was also reviewed by the usability team 
          to identify opportunities for improvement, such as the standardization 
          of screen elements, tools, icons, etc., but just as importantly, to 
          identify missing and needed pedagogical templates. User studies were 
          conducted with key stakeholder groups, including museum staff and visitors, 
          university faculty and students, and potential authors to extend and 
          validate the work done in these reviews. Reports of these studies are 
        available on the Pachyweb (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nmc.org/pachyderm/docarchive.shtml">http://www.nmc.org/pachyderm/docarchive.shtml</a>).</p>
      <p>As they worked through the fall of 2003 and into the spring of 2004, 
          the Programming Team targeted two key tasks: reverse engineering the<em> 
          Pachyderm 1.0</em> code, and making the <em>Pachyderm 1.0 </em>codebase, 
          usable only at SFMOMA, into an alpha version of<em> Pachyderm 2.0</em>, 
          installable and usable on servers outside of the SFMOMA environment. 
          The reverse engineering on the existing installation package from the 
          SFMOMA <em>Pachyderm</em> installation was completed December 11, 2003, 
        and a report delivered on installation issues. </p>
      <p>The second full <em>Pachyderm Project</em> meeting was held in San 
          Francisco January 20-22, 2004, with a focus on formally capturing the 
          programming requirements for<em> Pachyderm 2.0</em>. More than 300 requirements 
          were identified and prioritized by the 32 attendees. This was the first 
        <em>Pachyderm</em> meeting to set up a wireless network in the meeting 
          space to allow participants, working in teams, to enter their contributions 
          and ideas directly into a Web database from their laptops. The approach 
          was so productive that it has been used at all subsequent <em>Pachyderm</em> 
        meetings. The data import script from FileMaker to SQLServer was identified 
        as the largest problem and it was decided that it should be rewritten 
        from scratch, a task completed February 24, 2004. </p>
      <p>Essential library data specifications and standards were identified 
          by the Metadata &amp; Standards Team, as well as the key metadata standards 
          (e.g., Dublin Core, SCORM, IMS) that will be packaged with the visitor 
          and learning experiences created with the tool. These standards include 
          compliance with major efforts in digital rights management; sophisticated 
          cataloging, search and retrieval; interoperability; and reusability. 
          A detailed report of this work is available on the Pachyweb. Working 
          with librarians and key library groups across the continent over the 
          winter and spring of 2004, the Metadata and Standards Team considered 
          a wide range of specifications and standards, and distilled this work 
          into a set of recommendations for Pachyderm 2.0. The Metadata Issues 
          document outlines the scope of these recommendations and possible crosswalks 
          for the most commonly used standards in the Museum, Library and Post-secondary 
          environments. It was determined that Dublin Core should be the native 
        <em>Pachyderm</em> description format as it is the common denominator 
          of most of the metadata sets that have been identified. The document 
          also provides mappings or crosswalks; from Dublin Core to<em> Pachyderm 
          1.0</em>, VRA Core 3.0, CDWA, MARC21, MODS, EAD item level, and IEEE 
        L.O.M. </p>
      <p>Due to the expansive nature of metadata and programming in general, 
          there were some items that were deemed out of scope for the current 
          project but that may yet be addressed in future projects. Thesauri, 
          federated or broadcast search, metadata harvesting, direct import of 
          metadata stored in databases or in some relational or other non-flat 
          format such as IMS Content Packaging or METS were deemed out of scope. 
          To facilitate data transfer from these systems it was decided to accept 
          tab delimited files that would be an export from the host repository. 
        The full report is available on the <em>Pachyderm</em> Web site.</p>
      <p><em>Pachyderm</em> was installed locally at the California State University 
          Center for Distributed Learning (CDL), updating the installation instructions 
          extensively and fixing bugs in the code and data as they were found. 
          During this time the architectural planning for a large-scale restructuring 
          of <em>Pachyderm</em> to transform the tool from a template-based system 
          to a component based system was completed. This transformation will 
        enable the addition of new templates to the system without code change.</p>
      <p>Three focus groups were conducted at Case Western Reserve University 
          in spring 2004. The first targeted staff from the campus libraries; 
          the second a group of faculty from the Schools of Business, Medicine, 
          and Social Work; and the third had faculty representatives from each 
          of the eight Case Western schools. Input was gathered from those who 
          attended on the look and feel, ways in which they would use <em>Pachyderm</em> 
        in their work, what they would like to see changed, and what they would 
        like to see added. The information was condensed into a document that 
        was shared with the <em>Pachyderm</em> team and used in the requirements 
          document. In addition, Rachel Smith conducted focus groups with faculty 
          across the California State University and Deborah Howes conducted individual 
        focus sessions with visitors at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. </p>
      <p>As the culmination of an extensive consensus-based process that was 
          the main activity of the project&#39;s first six months, a formal 105-page 
          requirements document was approved by the partners at the third face-to-face 
          team meeting, held April 21-23 in San Francisco. This document and its 
          supporting tools and resources (the Requirements Tracker, Personae, 
          and User Scenarios) are available in the Document Archive on the <em>Pachyderm</em> 
        Web site. The <em>Pachyderm</em> development process also launched, 
          and a full day was spent on hands-on author training for the 36 participants 
          using the Web-accessible <em>Pachyderm</em> installation at the University 
          of Calgary. As the closing activity of this meeting, the Alpha version 
          of<em> Pachyderm 2.0</em>, codenamed <em>Rhino</em>, was released to 
          partners on April 23, 2004. (The tagline for the Alpha version was &#34;If 
        it don&#39;t crash, it ain&#39;t a Rhino!&#34;)</p>
      <p>In the months between that meeting and January 2005, the User Interface 
          Team completely redesigned the authoring and presentation screens based 
          on the Requirements Document and extensive user testing that took place 
          over the summer and fall of 2004. This work has resulted in a completely 
        new look and feel for the authoring interface.</p>
      <h1><em>Pachyderm</em> Web Sites and Other Resources</h1>
      <p>The <em>Pachyderm Project</em> makes extensive use of technology to 
          support the work of its distributed teams, and to ensure that interested 
          parties have access to complete information about the project and its 
          activities. The project makes use of technological resources that are 
          publicly accessible as well as private resources limited to team members 
          only. All relevant reports, documents, and other materials are routinely 
          published to the Web so that they can be accessed by any interested 
          party. The following list describes the most important of these tools 
        and provides links to each of them.</p>
      <h2>Pachyderm Website<br/>
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nmc.org/pachyderm">http://www.nmc.org/Pachyderm</a></h2>
      <p>The official Web site for the project was completely redone in September 
          2004 in preparation for the launch of beta testing in February 2005. 
          In addition to providing a one-stop source of information on the project, 
          including news, updates, and access to key documents, it also provides 
          a clear picture of the project and its current status, as well as links 
        to the IMLS, to the Pachyblog, and much more. </p>

          project participants and is the best source of project news and up-to-the 
          moment detailed information. Every resource available to the Project 
          via the Internet can be accessed from Pachyblog. Every member of the 
          project team can make posts or add comments, which gives Pachyblog a 
        &#34;feel&#34; that is very much reflective of the people participating 
        in the project.</p>

      <h1><strong>What&#39;s Next? The <em>Pachyderm</em> Beta Testing Process</strong></h1>
      <p>The invitation to apply to be beta testers went out to the NMC membership 
          in early February 2005. These relatively technical participants were 
          split into groups; the first group started with the first release, and 
          additional groups were added to successive beta releases as the spring 
        unfolded to ensure fresh feedback with each release.</p>
      <p>An essential part of the beta testing process is the inclusion of participants 
          who may be, but who are not necessarily technically adept or knowledgeable. 
          This aspect kicks off with the publication of this paper, and accompanies 
          an invitation at the April meeting of Museums and the Web to interested 
          participants from the museum world to also join the testing effort. 
      </p>
      <p>These first tests will be tests of the authoring system only, so beta 
          testers will be able to access <em>Pachyderm</em> via the Internet and 
          a special login. As with the early rounds, groups will be formed that 
          will be invited to participate sequentially as <em>Pachyderm</em> becomes 
          more and more refined. Testers will assume some responsibility for reporting, 
          and an application process will help inform potential testers as to 
        the scope of the role. </p>
      <p>The final stage of the beta testing process will be to test the system 
          installation and downloading features, which will occur over three testing 
          cycles in summer 2005. Institutions wishing to have their own <em>Pachyderm</em> 
        server for in-house production are encouraged to participate in this 
        round of tests, which will again start within the NMC community, and 
        expand outward into the museum space. The iterative process of successive 
        rounds of refinement and testing will continue into the summer, with 
        public release of<em> Pachyderm 2.0</em> scheduled for fall of 2005.</p>
      <h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
      <p>At the time this paper is being written, the <em>Pachyderm Project</em> 
        is almost exactly at the halfway point. It has been a year of excitement 
        and anticipation, but the real payoff lies ahead, when curators, digital 
        librarians, and faculty with little or no background in design or technology 
        will be able to create rich custom on-line content from their own materials. 
        The remaining time of the project will be spent in an exploration of 
        how <em>Pachyderm</em> will serve these new audiences, and in building 
        a community of <em>Pachyderm</em> users that we hope will be ongoing.</p>
      <p>The foundations for that community are being built today, and will 
          be fleshed out during the<em> Pachyderm 2.0</em> beta testing over the 
          spring and summer of 2005. We plan to launch this unique on-line community 
          at the same time that <em>Pachyderm</em> is released, and are modeling 
          it on work taking place within the NMC as part of its Dynamic Knowledge 
          Initiative. What we envision is a rich, interactive space where authors 
          and potential authors can exchange ideas, find collaborators, and discover 
          new ways of approaching their work – a knowledge Web of insights 
          not only about <em>Pachyderm</em> and its uses, but also about visual 
          communication and new forms of literacy and expression. We invite you 
          to join us on this journey and to help us by expanding <em>Pachyderm</em>’s 
          capabilities, by using it to create new and engaging explorations of 
          culture, science, and humanity, and by participating in the discussions 
        we hope it will stimulate.</p>
      <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
      <p class="acknowledgements">None of this would have happened without 
          the fierce dedication and commitment of Susie Wise, who was then Senior 
          Producer, Interactive Educational Technologies, and Tim Svenonius, our 
          ever savvy Production Manager and Technical Specialist, aided by a small 
          but loyal group of staff and interns. Stephen Jaycox and Steve Barretto 
          were the lead designers at Perimetre-Flux, affording <em>MSoMA</em>        its look and feel. At Red Eye, Alon Salant was the Chief Software 
          Architect, Chad Kassirer was Production Manager, and Thomas Cheung was 
          database guru. Eric Tam, Red Eye co-founder and CEO, was an ally and 
        strong supporter of the project.</p>
      <p class="acknowledgements">The Requirements Team was led by Rachel Smith 
          of CalState&#39;s Center for Distributed Learning (CDL); Michelle LaMar, 
          also of the CDL, led the Programming Team. Mike Mattson, University 
          of Calgary and M. Claire Stewart, Northwestern University, co-chaired 
          the Metadata &amp; Standards team. The Pedagogy and Usability Team was 
          co-chaired by Wendy Shapiro of Case Western Reserve University and Tom 
          Hapgood of the University of Arizona. These functional teams were reorganized 
        near the end of the project&#39;s first year.</p>
      <p class="acknowledgements">At the third face-to-face project meeting. The 
          Metadata &amp; Standards Team, its work largely completed, merged with 
          the Programming Team to become the Development Team, with Michelle LaMar 
          and Mike Mattson serving as co-chairs. The Requirements Team, its work 
          also done, ceded its place to the Documentation Team, a new team under 
          the leadership of Rachel Smith, who moved to the NMC in June 2004. Rachel 
          also assumed leadership of the new Usability &amp; Testing Team. Tom 
          Hapgood, whose interface designs had energized the project, assumed 
        the chair of the new User Interface team.</p>
