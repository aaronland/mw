        <h1>Introduction<strong><u></u></strong></h1>
        <p>Although virtual exhibits consisting entirely of pictures and text 
          are still common, educational Web developers increasingly employ techniques 
          borrowed from interactive exhibit developers, video game producers, 
          and museum educators to create compelling activities that fully exploit 
          the strengths of the Web medium. However, such transfers from other 
          learning environments to the Web pose unique challenges. For example, 
          the effective teacher in a face-to-face learning environment responds 
          to various cues about the learner&#39;s knowledge, interest, and ability. 
          We do not have that ability on-line. Instead we must attempt to formalize 
          within the programming of the activity the tacit understanding teachers 
          have of their students. This task becomes even more difficult when we 
          take into consideration the diverse ways that people perceive and process 
          information. An understanding of differences in users&#39; learning styles 
          can provide valuable insights into these differences and guide developers 
          to design more engaging and effective experiences for a wide variety 
          of learners (rather than just developing materials that suit the intuitively-felt 
          learning styles of the developers themselves). The present turn toward 
          outcome-based evaluation of informal learning programs creates a need 
          for best practices in the design and development of informal on-line 
          learning activities. We need a solid framework for guiding development 
          so that we can go beyond a cookie-cutter formula for the replication 
          of successful products. Since engagement and satisfaction are correlated 
          to  with positive learning outcomes, this research project will help 
          identify some of the ingredients for successful informal on-line learning.</p>
        <p>This research project, a collaboration among two educational Web developers 
          (Schaller and Allison-Bunnell) and two museum researchers (Borun and 
          Chambers), is exploring the role of learning style on children’s&#39;preferences 
          of Web-based informal learning experiences.  We hypothesize that when 
          the shape of the learning experience fits an individual&#39;s preferred 
          learning style, the experience will be more engaging and more satisfying, 
          and thus more successful as an informal learning experience. We are 
          pursuing the following research questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
           Do children&#39;s learning styles predict 
            their preferences for on-line activities?</li>
        <li>When children engage in their preferred activity type, do they show 
          greater engagement, satisfaction, and learning?</li>
        <li> 
           How can our research findings inform the 
            development and design of more successful online learning activities?</li>
      </ol>
       
        <p>Since this research is in progress, this paper reports on the theoretical 
          framework, methodology and early phases  of our current study.<strong><u></u></strong></p>
        <h1>Literature Review</h1>
        <h2>Learning Styles </h2>
        <p>Learning styles are commonly applied in public education 
          and corporate settings as an effective framework for recognizing and 
          accommodating individual differences. Serrell (1990) advocates consideration 
          of learning styles in exhibit development: </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Thinking about the visitors&#39; 
            experiences in terms of preferences and styles leads us to very different 
            conclusions about skills, cognitive ability, or prior knowledge. The 
            wide range and diversity of our audiences&#39; styles can be addressed without 
            being too insulting to some or obscure to many. </p>
        <p>For similar reasons, learning style typologies are particularly useful 
          in our proposed research. The field of computer-based informal education 
          is such new territory that typologies and classifications are a necessary 
          early step on the way toward more sophisticated theoretical understanding 
          and coherent best practices.  </p>
        <p>At the moment, however, research into the examination of the role of 
          individual preferences or learning styles in computer-based informal 
          education is rare. The task is confounded by the many different models 
          of learning styles that have been proposed. These models are not all 
          describing the same aspects of this complex and not easily reduced phenomenon. 
          Guild and Garger (1998) suggest that we are in a pre-paradigmatic phase 
          of learning style research: the blind researchers have each described 
          a different part of the elephant, but have not yet synthesized their 
          findings into a unified picture of the multi-dimensional beast. </p>
        <p>Our first task, then, is selecting the learning style theory most relevant 
          to computer-based media. Howard Gardner&#39;s theory of <strong>Multiple 
          Intelligences (MI)</strong> draws on research in cognitive psychology 
          to expand our notion of intelligence beyond the traditional emphasis 
          on verbal, logical, and mathematical aptitudes. By emphasizing multiple 
          modes of thinking, MI theory is useful in the development of Web-based 
          learning experiences. As Gardner himself has noted, it leads beyond 
          static text and imagery to more diverse approaches (Veenema &amp; Gardner 
          1996). Gardner&#39;s seminal work has focused the attention of the entire 
          educational community on the importance of individual differences in 
          learning. However, because Gardner focuses on the <em>types</em> of 
          information people prefer to process, it is less useful to our research 
          than other models that examine differences in the <em>ways</em> that 
          people perceive and process information. That is, while the theory of 
          Multiple Intelligences may remind developers to include a <em>wide range</em> 
          of information types, producers of online activities need greater assistance 
          in <em>structuring and organizing</em> the content.</p>
        <p>David Kolb&#39;s <strong>Experiential Learning Theory (ELT)</strong> (1999) 
          draws on research by Dewey and Piaget, among others, to identify two 
          major dimensions of learning: perception and processing. Each dimension 
          has two extremes: perception ranges from concrete experience to abstract 
          conceptualization, and processing ranges from reflective observation 
          to active experimentation. These two dimensions form a four-quadrant 
          field for mapping an individual&#39;s learning style. (See Appendix 1 for 
          a schematic representation of Kolb&#39;s model). </p>
        <p>Bernice McCarthy combined Kolb&#39;s four-style typology with brain hemisphere 
          research, resulting in her <strong>4MAT System,</strong> an eight-part 
          model, with a left and right brain component within each of Kolb&#39;s quadrants 
          (McCarthy 2000). With this model, McCarthy describes a complex template 
          for curriculum development, strongly emphasizing following a clockwise 
          cyclical path, starting in the upper-right quadrant, through the eight 
          steps, as the key to successful learning. Designed for classroom teaching, 
          McCarthy&#39;s approach is not well suited to online learning since it assumes 
          a highly structured formal learning environment for group discussion 
          and interaction.</p>
        <h2>Research on Computer-based Informal Education</h2>
        <p>Many researchers have examined computer-based learning over the past 
          twenty years, but the vast majority of studies focus on formal education: 
          K-12, post-secondary, and adult training. Research into computer-based 
          informal learning is rare, particularly for studies focusing on Web-based 
          informal education. As a recent review of museum Web sites notes:</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">What we found in relation to museum Web sites and 
          their visitors was fairly sparse. Although the field of distance education 
          is rich in studies, little of it was transferable to museum Web sites. 
          Most of the research and any assessments of learning were directly dependent 
          on traditional classroom dynamics, such as lectures and testing. As 
          physical and virtual museums move away from a transmission-absorption 
          model of learning towards a more constructivist model, distance education 
          research is less pertinent to virtual museum assessments. <em>(Haley 
          Goldman and Waldman, 2002)</em></p>
        <p>A few studies do explore online learning in an informal context, but 
          as Haley Goldman and Waldman note, most of these are based on quantitative 
          analysis of Web site server logs and are unable to provide data on visitors 
          demographics, social context, motivation, or learning (<em>Ibid.</em>).   
          There have been only a few qualitative studies. </p>
        <p>Sumption devised a typology of cognitive strategies that museums have 
          used for Web-based outreach learning and calls for evaluation to better 
          understand real outcomes, against those intended, to guide the development 
          of learning products (Sumption 2001). Squire&#39;s review of literature 
          on learning from computer games such as SimCity and Civilization notes 
          that the &#34;instructional context that envelops gaming is a more important 
          predictor of learning than the game itself&#34; (Squire 2002). And while 
          he believes that computer games hold promise for both formal and informal 
          education, all of his recommendations apply to a school environment. 
          Miller <em>et al.</em>&#39;s (2002) evaluation of a Web-based neuroscience 
          game sees much promise for the use of Internet gaming in informal education, 
          but his own study relies on classroom students to measure the game&#39;s 
          effectiveness. </p>
        <p>There are almost no studies examining the role of individual preferences 
          or learning styles in computer-based informal education. A user-centered 
          design project conducted by IBM found that users preferred a &#34;guided 
          tour&#34; approach to informal Web-based learning (Vergo et al. 2001).  
          But, IBM&#39;s  narrow sample (adult staff and interns at an IBM facility) 
          casts doubt on the broader applicability of their results. </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Among the few studies that have been conducted in 
          formal settings, few researchers have examined learning styles as a 
          tool in computer-based instructional design. Currie (1995) applied Kolb&#39;s 
          learning style typology and found thatrole-playing exercises and other 
          techniques which involve being thrust into the limelight were appropriate 
          for &#39;activists&#39; [Practical and Social]. ‘Reflectors&#39; [Creative 
          and Intellectual] preferred self-assessment exercises and paper-based 
          material that they could take away and chew over. ‘Theorists&#39; 
          [Intellectual] preferred a lecture and discussion within the program. 
          Practicals found specific techniques (such as force-field analysis for 
          problem solving) useful, particularly where given the opportunity to 
          try them out in a situation similar to the workplace.&#34;(Currie 1995, 
          cited in Henke 1997). </p>
        <p>Evaluations of engagement and satisfaction with online learning have 
          been conducted in controlled settings such as museum computer labs, 
          with online surveys, and through Web server statistical analysis (Vergo 
          <em>et al</em>. 2001, Ockuly 2003, Camp <em>et al</em>. 2000).  Although 
          none of these methods captures true <em>in situ</em> behaviours, they 
          can reveal valuable insights into the user&#39;s experience. On the other 
          hand, lab testing in an informal environment such as a museum can apply 
          standard methods of measuring engagement and satisfaction in museum 
          exhibits. These methods can focus on visitor/user behaviors (&#34;asking 
          and answering questions, talking about an exhibit, pointing to sections 
          of an exhibit, reading label text, engaging in hands-on activities,&#34; 
          (per Borun <em>et al</em>. 1996) and post-experience interviews (Falk 
          and Dierking 2000).</p>
        <h1>Current Research Study</h1>
        <p>We are currently engaged in a research study, funded by the National 
          Science Foundation, to explore the relationship between learning styles 
          and preferences for computer-based interactives. We have chosen Kolb&#39;s 
          Experiential Learning Theory as the model on which to base our research 
          on Web-based learning activities. Kolb&#39;s clear delineation of learning 
          styles highlights major differences in the way people perceive and process 
          information, yet it is simple enough to allow us to test for correlations 
          between learning styles and computer-based activity types. Also, as 
          we discussed in a recent paper (Schaller and Allison-Bunnell 2003), 
          Kolb&#39;s styles appear to be a good match for the variety of computer-based 
          learning experiences, which vary from analytical models (e.g. simulations) 
          to open-ended tools (e.g. story-telling or drawing). Researchers have 
          applied various labels to each of Kolb&#39;s styles; we have devised our 
          own which we believe are more meaningful to our target audience: Our 
          labels are in parentheses alongside Kolb&#39;s labels as follows: Accommodating 
          (<em>Social</em>), Diverging (<em>Creative</em>), Assimilating (<em>Intellectual</em>), 
          Converging (<em>Practical</em>).</p>
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a><img src="schaller.fig1.gif" width="380" height="295" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Experiential Learning Theory"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 1. Experiential Learning Theory, from Kolb et 
          al. 1999</p>
        <p>Using a typology of computer-based activities developed for an earlier 
          study (Schaller et al. 2002), we hypothesize that a computer-based learning 
          activity that engages an individual&#39;s dominant learning style will result 
          in a more engaging and satisfying experience than one that does not 
          match the preferred learning style. Though we do not anticipate a one-to-one 
          match between any style and computer activity type, we hypothesize some 
          degree of correlation between certain activity types and Kolb&#39;s four 
          learning styles as follows: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Role-Play </em>allows users to adopt 
            a persona and interact with other characters.  We hypothesize that 
            Role-Play may appeal to those with a <em>Social </em>learning style.      
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Simulation</em> employs a model of 
            the real world that users can manipulate to develop an understanding 
            of a complex system. We expect that this activity type will appeal 
            more to those with an <em>Intellectual</em> learning style.</li>
        <li><em>Puzzle/Mystery</em> involves analysis and reasoning to reach a 
          logical solution. The user relies on evidence from people, nature, or 
          reference material.  This activity type may appeal more to those with 
          a <em>Practical</em> learning style.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Creative Play </em><em> </em>emphasizes open-ended inquiry and 
            experimentation, with a personal creation as the product of the experience.  
            We anticipate that this activity type will appeal more often than

        <h2>Determining Learning Style </h2>
        <p>At the time of this writing, we are in the process of developing an 
          instrument for measuring learning style among children so we can then 
          test our hypothesis about the relationship between learning style, engagement, 
          and satisfaction. Kolb&#39;s 12-question <em>Learning Style Inventory</em> 
          has been validated for high school-age youth (ages 14-18) and adults 
          (Kolb <em>et al.</em>, 1999), but not for younger children. Our current 
          task is to simplify the inventory for use by middle school children.  
          To this end, we have developed a series of inventories, testing each 
          one via online surveys. We post the survey on our Web site (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.eduweb.com/">www.eduweb.com</a>) 
          and direct Web users to it from three on-line interactives elsewhere 
          on our site (&#34;A. Pintura,&#34; &#34;Inside Art,&#34; and &#34;Amazon Interactive&#34;). 
          These interactives have high levels of youth traffic, enabling us to 
          collect roughly 50 responses daily from this population. The survey 
          appears automatically as a pop-up window when users arrive at the home 
          page of each interactive. To reduce the impact of pop-up blocking software, 
          we also put a prominent invitation on the page to take the survey. Survey 
          responses are saved to a text file on the Web server, which is downloaded 
          and analyzed using Microsoft Excel.</p>
        <p>With this method, we can post a survey for several days and gather 
          a sufficient number of responses for analysis within and between age 
          groups, then revise the survey instrument and repost it to gather fresh 
          responses. While consisting of convenience samples (i.e. a nonsystematic 
          approach that allows a potential respondent to self-select into the 
          sample) (Schonlau et al. 2001), we believe these surveys are valid tools 
          for our purpose. All respondents belong to our target population: secondary 
          school-age users of educational Web sites.  Once we have a valid inventory 
          for use with middle school-aged children, we will be able to determine 
          the distribution of learning styles within this population, and to look 
          for correlations with preferred educational activities.  While the distribution 
          of learning styles among this population is not known, it does not matter 
          for our current purposes, which is comparing respondents&#39; score on Kolb&#39;s 
          inventory with their score on our inventory. To date, we have tested 
          several versions of our inventory and looked for correspondence between 
          each respondent&#39;s score on Kolb&#39;s and our inventories. Our focus here 
          has been high school students, since Kolb&#39;s inventory has been validated 
          for that age group. </p>
        <p>Our first effort, consisting of one-paragraph descriptions of each 
          style, showed poor correspondence with Kolb&#39;s instrument. Many respondents 
          also found it difficult to place themselves into a single style, noting 
          that they could see themselves reflected in aspects of multiple styles. 
          Our second effort employed a learning style instrument validated for 
          children, developed by researchers in India (Dangwal n.d.). Although 
          based on Kolb, this instrument was validated with other psychological 
          instruments and did not show sufficient correspondence with Kolb&#39;s inventory 
          for our purposes. Currently we are testing simplified versions of Kolb&#39;s 
          own inventory and believe that it will meet our needs. Once we have 
          confidence in our inventory, we will proceed to the next step: looking 
          for correspondence between learning style and preferences for online 
          interactives. We will post results and analysis on our Web site, at 
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eduweb.com/research.html">http://www.eduweb.com/research.html</a></p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Museums and other organizations are investing substantial resources 
          in the Web as an educational medium, yet little research exists to guide 
          sound development of such resources. Our research will help fill this 
          gap by examining the user&#39;s experience through the framework of learning 
          styles. This framework can illuminate key aspects of computer-based 
          learning and help us to understand how different types of activities 
          can engage different types of learners. For example, knowing the frequency 
          of each learning style among children will provide a new and valuable 
          way for developers to think about their audiences. </p>
        <p>While incorporating all activity types in a single online project might 
          be ideal from the standpoint of meeting the needs of a diverse audience, 
          it can be functionally difficult to do, or simply be cost-prohibitive. 
          However, if our research indicates some learning styles to be predominant 
          for particular age ranges or that some activity types are more engaging 
          and satisfying across a broader range of learning styles, museums can 
          use that information to make better use of limited resources. We anticipate 
          that results of this research will offer much-needed insights into the 
          user experience and valuable guidance to developers of Web-based informal 
          education activities. </p>
