  <h1>The Localized Learner: Acknowledging Distance And Situatedness In On-Line Museum Learning</h1>
  <h2>Ross Parry, University of Leicester, and Nadia Arbach, Tate, 
    United Kingdom </h2>
        <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">In the current trajectory of on-line museum 
          learning, an environment has emerged where <em>locality</em> and the specificity 
          of <em>place </em>are now key levers for content creation and user experience. 
          This paper explores the ways in which the on-line museum, mirroring 
          practices in the business world and the education sector, is becoming 
          sensitive to <em>where </em>its users are located. It considers how museums 
          (on-line and off-line) have attempted to understand and make provision 
          for individual <em>visitor circumstance</em>. By looking specifically 
          at examples of localized Web-based museum resources, it highlights how 
          museums are increasingly acknowledging the localized settings of on-line 
          users. The paper suggests a more layered typology of localization, informed 
          by sociological readings of spatial production, in order to differentiate 
          between <em>location</em><em> </em>(the physical, geographical position 
          of the learner), <em>place </em>(the type of space the learner perceives 
          himself/herself to be in), and <em>situation </em>(the learner&#39;s circumstance, 
          activity or intent). It also suggests how this more discerning vocabulary 
          (with the different implications and consequences that follow from each 
          term) might help providers better articulate the concept of localization 
          in order to support more focused provision and clearer objectives. Finally, 
          by calling attention to some of the challenges that remain in developing 
          localized resources for on-line learners, the paper ends by foregrounding 
          some of the questions that further debate, research and the sharing 
          of best practice may help to answer.</p>

        <h1>Where Are You Learning Today?</h1>
  <p>Last year over four million visitors were welcomed to Tate Online (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tate.org.uk/">http://www.tate.org.uk</a>). 
    They accessed the site from home, school, and work while researching, doing 
    homework, and surfing the Web from countries, cities and streets around the 
    world. As the Web opens up new audiences for museums, it also makes possible 
    myriad combinations of potential learners in an array of different distant, 
    localized settings.</p>
  <p>I-Ting, for instance, is in Taiwan, 
    studying part-time in a course in art history, and is accessing the Internet 
    using a dial-up connection with a laptop at her kitchen table. Elizabeth, 
    from the south east of England, is 
    at work sourcing some material on her broadband-connected PC while collaborating 
    with her office colleagues. Marshall, in Toronto, Canada, 
    is relaxing on the weekend and browsing the Web on a PDA while traveling on 
    a crowded bus. Each of these individuals is accessing the same museum Web 
    site and looking at the same content, and all of them are learning, but each 
    is in a different part of the world, has gone to the site for different reasons, 
    and has accessed the material through different media. In other words, these 
    learners are in different social settings, with different materials at their 
    disposal, and with different possibilities for conviviality and interaction 
    with others around them.</p>
  <p>This paper explores the ways in which the on-line museum (in line with wider 
    approaches in the business and education sectors) is becoming sensitive to 
    where its users are located. It considers how museums understand and make 
    provision for individual visitor circumstance on-line. It highlights how techniques 
    are used to acknowledge the localized settings of users, and suggests how 
    a typology for differentiating between these approaches might support more 
    focused provision and clearer objectives. Finally, it calls attention to some 
    of the challenges involved in developing localized resources for on-line learners 
    and brings to light some of the questions that still need to be answered.</p>
        <h1>From &#39;Who?&#39; To &#39;Where?&#39;</h1>
  <p>The museums sector is quite adept at reflecting on who its visitors are; 
    organizations such as the Visitor Studies Group (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.visitors.org.uk/">http://www.visitors.org.uk/</a>) ensure that 
    museums and galleries have a framework for thinking about visitor needs. Museums 
    pay close attention to the types of visitors they receive, the needs of these 
    visitors, and the ways in which this information can be used to improve provision 
    (Hooper-Greenhill, 1997; Dodd and Sandell, 2001). And for some time now, practitioners 
    have drawn upon theories of learning and communication to try to make sense 
    of how visitors learn and behave in exhibitions, taking into account the different 
    learning styles, intelligences or cultural backgrounds that they may bring 
    to the museum (Cassels, 1992; Davis and Gardner, 1993).</p>
  <p>However, as museum educators we have never really had to ask where our learners 
    are. In a pre-Web context we knew that learners were immersed in the museum 
    – and consequently it was the museum that we attempted to understand (O&#39;Doherty, 
    1999). The only instance in which place became an issue, it seems, was when 
    the museum became mobile (Martin, 2001) or reached out and permeated other 
    sites (Dodd, 2002). Even then, the museum could largely predict and affect 
    the setting of the museum experience.</p>
  <p>In the on-site museum, we can calculate with quite a high degree of exactitude 
    where the visitor is. When writing a text panel, designing an interactive 
    or positioning an object, we can have a fairly precise sense of where the 
    visitor will be located. We can even have a sense of (and indeed, can control) 
    the light levels, the sounds and even the smells the visitor experiences. 
    We might not be able to control what knowledge the visitosr bring to the learning 
    experience, how they make sense of information, what reaction they might have, 
    what they may or may not be able to do, or who they are with. However, it 
    is indisputable that in an in-gallery museum learning context, the visitor, 
    at that moment, is standing in front of that text, that interactive or that 
    object.</p>
  <p>With the advent of the Web this has all changed. Now, museums must think 
    about not only who the visitors are and how they learn, but also where they 
    are. Are they on a crowded bus holding a PDA, or are they alone in a bedroom 
    accessing the Web through a games console? Are they in a bustling office using 
    their PC on their lunch break, or are they using a laptop at home with their 
    family, toys and toddlers everywhere? Have they queued to use a public terminal 
    in a hushed library, or are they moving between tasks and resources within 
    a pre-conceived lesson plan in a classroom? If the possibilities 
    of locality are endless, so too are the types of learning experiences that 
    might take place.</p>
  <p>If, as Falk and Dierking (2000) suggest, all learning is influenced by an 
    awareness of place, then knowing the locality of the on-line learner – with 
    all its related cultural and social implications – will allow museums to shape 
    and deliver learning that is targeted to the specific needs of their audiences. 
    Knowing where our learners are has an impact on how we talk to them, what 
    we provide, and what we can expect them to do with the resources available 
    to them. One of the biggest challenges confronting the on-line museum community 
    in the next few years, therefore, is the question of where our on-line learners 
    are.</p>
        <h1>From Global To Local</h1>
  <p>Recent speculations that in the business world localization would become 
    &#39;if not essential, [then] more important&#39; (Cleary, 2000) seems to have been 
    realized. In business today, local knowledge is an asset – something that 
    financial experts continue to stress, especially for small businesses looking 
    to export (Judge, 2003). In industries such as banking, commentators draw 
    attention to the evidential shift towards more localized delivery systems 
    and products as companies increasingly see the importance of valuing local 
    knowledge of their customers. (Economist, 2004). 
    The Localization Industry Standards Association (2002) has offered corporations 
    a clear and evidenced business case for localization: the localization of 
    products and services based on an awareness of and response to linguistic, 
    cultural and technical differences is seen to bring a substantial return on 
    investment.</p>
  <p>In a similar way to commercial corporations adapting their products and services 
    to clients in different areas, the education sector continues to heighten 
    its sensitivity to place and locality. The advent of &#39;distance learning&#39; (or 
    &#39;distance education&#39;) has generated pedagogical models that take into account 
    the physical, social and cultural context of the localized learner (Melton, 
    2002). Likewise, providers of professional training and development theorize 
    and exploit the &#39;situatedness&#39; of work-based learning (Lave and Wenger, 1991). 
    More recently, other &#39;context-sensitive&#39; approaches to learning have been 
    explored in the emergent realm of &#39;m-learning&#39; – learning that brings together 
    &#39;untethered&#39; media and a mobile learner (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mobilearn.org/">http://www.mobilearn.org/</a>). Like business, 
    education is mindful of the significance of locality.</p>
  <p>As, to an extent, are museums. Many museums are used to modifying or developing 
    aspects of their provision to suit the locality of their audiences. Many of 
    these localized learning opportunities have been associated with in-gallery, 
    off-line (non-digital) learning. Some examples from Tate will serve to illustrate 
    how localization is recognized, in off-line resources, as a serious factor 
    in the shaping of the learning process. Tate incorporates four physical galleries 
    – Tate Britain, Tate Modern, Tate 
    Liverpool, and Tate St. Ives – plus an on-line gallery, Tate Online.. 
    The fact that the physical galleries are geographically separated means Tate 
    is always aware that the physical context of the learner will impact on the 
    learning opportunities and that some activities are specifically &#39;situated 
    activities&#39;. Because of the geographical distance, the communication between 
    galleries must remain constant so that some over-arching educational materials 
    are distributed in the same way and reach all of Tate&#39;s audiences. Conversely, 
    the fact that there are four different buildings means that each one can create 
    learning opportunities that are localized to its particular strengths and 
    to its audience base. The Interpretation and Education departments at each 
    Tate site create different programs for their audiences based on the needs 
    and the resources available. Tate St. Ives can draw upon the Barbara Hepworth 
    Sculpture Garden, one of its most notable physical features, while in the 
    same vein Tate Modern can use the Turbine Hall as a showcase for the Unilever 
    Series of commissioned works of art. Each Tate site features different temporary 
    exhibitions, all of which have related lectures, events and learning opportunities 
    that are in-gallery. While working towards the common goal of providing learning 
    opportunities for Tate&#39;s wider audience, Tate&#39;s individual galleries are making 
    the most of their strengths and playing to their local audiences.</p>
  <p>In their endeavors to create learning resources that acknowledge the locality 
    of their users, museums have already made much headway in the realm of distance 
    learning opportunities. Many museums have full and diverse schedules of videoconference-based 
    learning, such as the Philadelphia Museum of Art (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.philamuseum.org/education/distance.shtml">http://www.philamuseum.org/education/distance.shtml</a>), 
    which uses ISDN-based videoconferencing to create virtual tours and allow 
    real-time interactions with the museum&#39;s staff for classes all over the US. 
    While the main content of the learning experience is pre-set, the fact that 
    the interaction is live between the class and the museum expert means that 
    the content can be altered on the fly depending on the needs of that particular 
    class. Not only is the museum catering to its audience&#39;s geographical location, 
    but it is also adapting its content to the specific needs of the individual 
    students in that particular classroom and social setting.</p>
        <h1>Localization, Museums and The Web</h1>
  <p>Localizing content is not, therefore, a new concept for museums. The use 
    of digital media to provide a localized experience, however, is relatively 
    recent. It is only since the turn of the century (in a UK 
    context, at least) that museums have had the content, technology and institutional 
    support and vision to begin to develop significant localized digital learning 
    resources. This period has seen not only a substantial increase in digital 
    content and assets held by museums, funded by a wave of government-funded 
    digitisation and ICT initiatives (&#39;IT Challenge Fund&#39;, &#39;NOF Digitise&#39;, &#39;Designation 
    Challenge Fund&#39;, &#39;Culture Online&#39;, &#39;Creative Partnerships&#39;, &#39;NESTA Illuminate&#39;, 
    etc.), but also a new strategic commitment by a number of institutions to 
    Web provision (Durbin, 2003; Rellie, 2004) as well as continued development 
    of and competency in the use of scripts, coding languages and metadata standards 
    that can be used to engineer more adaptable and adaptive Web environments. 
    Exemplifying this strategic adoption of the Web medium – as well as illustrating 
    the influence of the sectors&#39; new digital collections, the use of metadata 
    standards, and a commitment to more localized agendas – is the UK&#39;s first 
    virtual national museum, the 24 Hour Museum (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/">http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk</a>), and 
    specifically its City Heritage Guides project, which provides reconfigurations 
    of the museum&#39;s content for geographically localized users (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/cityheritage/index.html">http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/cityheritage/index.html</a>).</p>
  <p>For an institution such as Tate, localization has involved channeling the 
    content in its on-site galleries as well. The touch screens at Tate Modern, 
    for instance, contain information about works in the Tate Collection. Sensitive 
    to the specificity of their physical location, the works are limited to those 
    only within Tate Modern galleries, rather than encompassing the whole collection. 
  </p>
  <p>Taking an even more refined approach to localization, Tate has also offered 
    context-determined digital learning through handheld PDA museum tours. Tate 
    Modern has developed a pilot tour containing information that changes as users 
    move through the gallery. This type of technology, where the content mutates 
    depending on the location of the user within a certain space, is one of the 
    most sophisticated uses of localized learning because it relies on adaptive 
    media. Similar initiatives include a Dutch project, Waag 1550 (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.waag.org/freq1550/index.html">http://www.waag.org/freq1550/index.html</a>), 
    which uses mobile phones and GPS technology to teach young people about Dutch 
    history of the 16th Century. The game takes place over a period of days, during 
    which students form groups and travel around the city of Amsterdam completing 
    location-based media assignments about the city&#39;s history. In some ways, this 
    project is like an extension of a museum PDA tour but with a larger geographical 
    base.</p>
  <p>Devices such as touch screens within the museum, PDA tours, or other types 
    of mobile digital learning can only take place within a certain set area. 
    On-line learning via the Internet, by contrast, reaches out to a much larger 
    audience. Confronted with the array of individual visitor circumstances that 
    are possible when the audience is global, the bigger challenge has been adopting 
    localization techniques to Web-based on-line learning.</p>
  <p>In order to acknowledge the localized settings of users who are accessing 
    museum information and learning via on-line means, Tate has devised ways of 
    tailoring its Web-based material towards the different user groups that make 
    its audience. Current trends in localizing digital learning materials include 
    translating content into different languages, providing opportunities for 
    users in different social situations to adapt materials for their own use, 
    and allowing geographically distant users to communicate or collaborate.</p>
        <p>The first method of acknowledging locality is the translation of Web-based 
          resources into different languages. For example, Tate Britain&#39;s new 
          &#39;Explore Tate Britain&#39; on-line gallery (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/explore">http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/explore</a>) 
          has some of its texts translated into seven different languages, for 
          two very different reasons. First, the site uses French, Spanish, Italian, 
          German and Japanese since these are the languages of many of Tate&#39;s 
          visitors from abroad. Second, since Tate has a commitment to provide 
          learning opportunities to its local London cultural communities, the 
          resource also uses Arabic and Bengali, which are widely spoken in the 
          surrounding boroughs. Similarly, the Art Institute of Chicago has catered 
          to its local audience with its on-line learning resource &#39;Cleopatra&#39; 
          (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.artic.edu/cleo/">http://www.artic.edu/cleo/</a>) 
          by translating it into Spanish, a language spoken by many of the residents 
          of that city. </p>
  <p>The second method is to allow on-line users to adapt materials for their 
    own use. One upcoming Tate project, the Zoom Room, is dedicated to showcasing 
    some of the informal events and activities that take place in-gallery at all 
    four Tate buildings. The guidelines for the activities are rewritten so that 
    visitors to the site can take part in the same activities at home. This allows 
    on-line users in different situations and contexts to use the materials as 
    best suits them.</p>
  <p>The third way that museums are acknowledging locality is by providing opportunities 
    to learn through each other at a distance. One of the NetArt publications 
    on Tate Online, the agoraXchange site (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tate.org.uk/netart/agoraxchange/">http://www.tate.org.uk/netart/agoraxchange/</a>), 
    by artists Natalie Bookchin and Jacqueline Stevens, allows users to work together 
    from anywhere in the world in order to collaborate on the rules, design and 
    code for an on-line game. Because the game involves politics, economics and 
    sociology, participants are able not only to explore their own views but also 
    to learn about other ideas from different cultures, geographical regions, 
    governments and places. As another example, Tate has just launched Level 2 
    of an on-line course entitled <em>An Introduction to Modern and Contemporary 
    Art</em> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tate.org.uk/ita">http://www.tate.org.uk/ita</a>). The first level 
    of this on-line course allows users to sign up and complete modules to learn 
    about modern and contemporary art; at the end of each module users are asked 
    to discuss selected works of art with other students on-line. Level 2 features distance learning even more prominently, and includes 
    on-line interaction with eight tutors, curators and invited guests. Students 
    are required to spend time using the on-line discussion board to interact 
    with other students at a distance.</p>
  <p>All of these on-line resources – touch screens, PDA tours, and Web-based 
    learning materials – appear to show an awareness of the individual learner&#39;s 
    localized circumstance. In developing these on-line materials, the museum 
    has responded to needs that take into account language, the learner&#39;s environment, 
    and distance learning, allowing the learners to use the resource in the way 
    that best suits them. What seems to be emerging, then, is sensitivity on the 
    part of museums to the locations, places and situations within which their 
    on-line users find themselves. There are, however, important (if subtle) differences 
    in the way learners individually conceive their own circumstance, and, indeed, 
    in the vocabulary or typology that museums use when thinking about localization.</p>
        <h1>Towards A Typology Of Localization: Location, Place And Situation</h1>
  <p>Giving space a sociological reading helps us to distinguish its physical, 
    representational and conceptual fields (Lefebvre, 1991). These in turn can 
    direct us towards a refinement of broader notions of locality and allow us 
    to separate the concept of localization into three distinct fields: location, 
    place and situation.</p>
        <p>&#39;Location&#39; refers to the physical context of the user – it is reliant 
          on geography and defines where a person is in the world, including the 
          resultant cultural issues that can arise from the geographic location. 
          Notwithstanding the added complication of migrant populations (and the 
          fact than an individual from one culture may be located inside another), 
          a location may be subject to local laws on what content can be received 
          and sent; it may have a bearing on the type or reliability of the connection 
          being used (or, indeed, on the likelihood of the user having access 
          to a networked machine); it may give clues as to the likely IT literacy 
          of that user; it may determine what language the user would prefer the 
          content to be in; and it may suggest a host of other cultural cues, 
          sensitivities and idioms that might need to be examined (Cleary, 2000).</p>
  <p>By &#39;place&#39; we mean a venue or type of space. This is the representational 
    context, and encompasses individually or collectively designated types of 
    space such as classrooms, community centres, offices, airports, open spaces, 
    shopping malls or (indeed) museums. These &#39;places&#39; may be individualized – 
    two people may not view a &#39;place&#39; in the same way – but frequently the definitions 
    are shared and people will have an agreed idea of what is acceptable or reasonable 
    behaviour in these places. &#39;Place&#39; can also determine the resources that the 
    localized user may have at their disposal, including access to other networking 
    technologies (Rennie and Mason, 2003). </p>
  <p>Finally, &#39;situation&#39; is the conceptual context – it relates to the activity, 
    intention or objective of the user/learner: &#39;working&#39;, &#39;relaxing&#39;, &#39;studying&#39;, 
    etc. Situation, therefore, affects visitor expectation and aspiration. It 
    can have a bearing on how &#39;sticky&#39; they may find the museum site and how fickle 
    they may be in their visit. The learner&#39;s &#39;situation&#39; may have a bearing on 
    the tone, information architecture, and graphical identity of the on-line 
    content.</p>
  <p>Our three users of Tate Online, introduced at the start of this paper, illustrate 
    how location, place and situation can influence their respective use of the 
    Web. I-Ting is accessing the site from Taiwan 
    (her location), at her kitchen table laptop (her place), using the site to 
    study for her art history course (her situation). Elizabeth is in south-east 
    England (location), in her office 
    (place), using the Web to source material (situation). Finally, Marshall is 
    in Toronto (location), on a bus (place), relaxing (situation). We cannot tell 
    how much of an impact each of these three elements will have on the user&#39;s 
    experience. What we can do, however, is keep the three elements of location, 
    place and situation in mind when developing on-line learning opportunities.</p>
  <p>Layering localization into three fields encompassing the physical, representational 
    and conceptual elements (location, place and situation) allows us to examine 
    the ways in which museums are acknowledging localization through the educational 
    content they provide. From minor language shifts and cultural references or 
    cues through to a complete transfiguration of a site&#39;s content, a museum&#39;s 
    response and reaction to location, place and situation can vary the impact 
    that locality has upon the content being produced. The response may be subtle 
    (or implied) in some situations, whereas in others it may be conspicuous and 
    transforming.</p>
  <h2>The Challenges Of Localization</h2>
  <p>As we have seen, museums can acknowledge the locality of learners in several 
    ways, and the degree to which physical, representational and conceptual locality 
    is treated can have an impact on the final product. In addition to this, as 
    with any attempt to refine content in order to better reach audiences, there 
    is considerable effort involved and many challenges to overcome when creating 
    on-line museum content that recognizes locality.</p>
  <p>Building localized content incorporates several unique challenges. First, 
    the museum must decide about the scale, boundaries, and identity of a locality 
    or several localities that will be the focus audience(s) – a task comparable 
    to selecting an audience (as a museum would do for any learning resource), 
    but on a larger scale and possibly requiring more research about the cultural, 
    social or geographical differences involved. Second, working with communities 
    at a distance requires communication methods that result in the needs of the 
    end users being met. Third, there is a challenge in understanding the user 
    expectation of localized content, so working closely with the groups in question 
    requires some research into how they already use the Web for learning opportunities 
    and how their expectations can be managed with respect to the project. Fourth, 
    even within a set geographical location, there are several different communities 
    within which may be found varying social and cultural differences, all of 
    which might need investigation.</p>
  <p>Localized content also brings with it several uncertainties. First, how do 
    we know (and how does the system know) the user&#39;s place and situation? It 
    may be possible to identify location through an Internet Service Provider 
    (ISP), but this may not necessarily give the correct information about location 
    and can tell us nothing about place and situation. It is possible to enable 
    cookies to recognize the user, but even if we have a user profile that includes 
    more information than simple geography, it cannot always be accurate because 
    information about place and situation is always changing. How, then, can we 
    harness the consequences of a user&#39;s environment? Even more important, how 
    can we gauge audience reaction when sites that cater to locality are made 
    available? What are the next steps in honing the way we provide for our users 
    in the locations, places, and situations where they happen to be?</p>
  <p>It is clear that museums are already finding ways to overcome these challenges, 
    as we can see from the examples of on-line provision presented here. However, 
    the suggestion here is that the use of a more discerning vocabulary (with 
    different implications and consequences following from each term) might help 
    providers further to avoid conflation over the concept and role of localization, 
    and might support more focused provision and the formulation of clearer objectives. 
    This typology – or a similar frame of reference – may prove useful in contextualizing 
    and sharing best practice in a more specific and effective way.</p>
        <h1>The Meaning And Profile Of The On-Line <em>Visit</em> </h1>
  <p>Central in these future discussions will be the need to understand with greater 
    sophistication the nature of the on-line &#39;visit&#39; – for it is this that affects 
    our assumptions about the localization of on-line provision and influences 
    where we look for answers.</p>
  <p>It is all too easy, perhaps, to conceive and visualize the Web as a backdrop, 
    an environment, or a putative context. As a result, there has been a tendency 
    to write and think generically about the &#39;space&#39; of the Web, rather than to 
    consider the particular place within which the user experiences the medium. 
    On-line experiences, after all, do not take place in some removed metaphysical 
    <em>virtual</em> world. Rather, they are embedded in the actuality and physicality 
    of the user&#39;s immediate sense of place, in the same way as the telephone (land 
    line or mobile), newspapers, the radio or TV.</p>
  <p>To understand this we might perhaps reflect upon the notion of <em>visiting</em> 
    on-line, and examine who exactly is visiting whom (and when) in our on-line 
    museums. Visiting a museum on-line is not comparable to actively choosing 
    to migrate to another place and cross a physical threshold into a museum building 
    – with all the social and cultural protocols this type of place may carry 
    for the visitor. Moreover, in an on-site visit, the presence of the museum 
    is constant: it envelops the visitor, and for the duration of the visit it 
    is the museum that influences (if not largely determines) the visitor&#39;s sense 
    of reality. By contrast, when users visit an on-line museum they are not immersed 
    in it – the on-line museum is but one element on a computer screen in the 
    user&#39;s personal environment. In fact, in the case of the on-line museum, the 
    whole notion of visitor circumstance is reconfigured to adapt to (and be subject 
    to) the user&#39;s reality. The on-line museum merely contributes to the visitor&#39;s 
    current circumstances. It migrates to their location, it relates to their 
    situation, and it contributes to their current sense of place. And unlike 
    the omnipresence of the on-site museum, the on-line museum&#39;s presence is much 
    more fragile – it is but a click or glance away from being entirely removed 
    from the learner&#39;s current reality. The on-line visit, then, is almost a complete 
    reversal of the physical one, a dynamic that perhaps we in museums need to 
    reflect upon.</p>
  <p>Significantly, in other sectors audience research forms a large part of content 
    creation. Thanks to advance audience research tools, radio broadcasters such 
    as the BBC, for example, have an acute sense of not only who their visitors 
    are but also where these listeners are likely to be, and what they are likely 
    to be doing - and this, in turn, can have significant bearing on output. In 
    contrast, for the museum sector in the UK, 
    we know that about half the UK adult 
    population does not have access to a home Internet connection (Office for 
    National Statistics, 2005). We know that the number of visits to virtual museums 
    in many of our institutions can be comparable to (or can exceed) physical 
    visits. Furthermore, we know that the duration of these visits is significantly 
    less than it is on-site - in the UK no more than 12 minutes, and in many cases 
    less than six minutes (24 Hour Museum, 2003). However, when it comes to museum 
    Web sites, we rarely (if at all) have as clear a picture of usage as do our 
    colleagues in other communication industries.</p>
  <p>Developing our understanding of the meaning and profile 
    of our on-line &#39;visit&#39; still remains, therefore, the key to enjoying the potential 
    benefits of localization.</p>
        <h1>Conclusion: A Sense Of Place, And Sensitivity To Place</h1>
  <p>When museums first started providing content on-line, we were excited about 
    the potential global audiences (the &#39;global village&#39;) and the world stage 
    that had been opened to us (Witcomb, 1997). More recently, however, we have 
    become interested in how this medium can support experiences embedded more 
    in the locality of the user (Bazley et al, 2002). We have realized that we 
    need to understand and question where our learners are, as much as who they 
    are and how they learn. We already appear to be acknowledging that localization 
    is an important factor in on-line museum learning, and some museums are taking 
    steps to develop learning opportunities that take into account locality, place 
    and situation. However, it may be that we are not reflecting upon and differentiating 
    these approaches as much as possible. Such reflection might help make the 
    creation of learning opportunities more focused and more productive.</p>
  <p>By introducing a way of examining how much attention has been placed on locality, 
    place and situation in localized resources, we may be one step closer to a 
    more finely-honed and sophisticated articulation of the types of localization 
    that currently exist. In turn, this may help us to come closer to the outcome 
    we are looking for – the refining of both our sense of place and our sensitivity 
    to place.</p>
