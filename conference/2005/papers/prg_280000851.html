  <h1>The 24 Hour Museum Tunable RSS News Feed</h1>

  </p>
  <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
    <p id="abstract">This paper follows on from an earlier offering, &#39;RSS 
            - the 24 Hour Museum News feed&#39; (Pratty, 2004) presented to Museums 
            and the Web in 2004. That paper outlined some of the background to RSS 
            culture and demonstrated the successful build and deployment of the 
            UK&#39;s first Museum and Gallery news feed service by the 24 Hour Museum 
            (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/">http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk</a>) 
            and System Simulation Ltd of London (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/">http://</a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssl.co.uk/">www.ssl.co.uk</a>). 
            Version 1.0 of the RSS feed (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/">http://</a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/home.rss">www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/home.rss</a>) 
            is working, and in January 2005, technical partners SSL developed the 
            feed into a  multi-region, multi-city, tunable content feed, capable 
            of offering tailored output to meet specific editorial needs of the 
            24 HM Web site, as well as of partners in the museum sector and beyond 
            in the UK. The paper examines the technical challenges such expansion 
            involves. Questions about RSS version choice, scoping, determining the 
            logistics problems and operational decisions are explored. Since this 
            paper proposal was submitted in September 2004, there&#39;s been a gratifying 
            leap in the popularity of RSS as a mass publishing mechanism. The writer 
            feels the growing momentum behind the technology grandly justifies the 
            24 Hour Museum&#39;s initial investment in the technology in 2003 and our 
            continued commitment to the format. A final section of the paper deals 
            with this gathering enthusiasm within the Web world and looks at brief 
        case studies of other museums starting to use RSS.</p>

    <h1>Building The 24 Hour 
      Museum RSS Multi-Region Multi-Subject Feed</h1>
    <h2>A Brief Resume Of Version 1.0</h2>
    <p>In 2003, System Simulation Ltd built an RSS 2.0 output for the main 
            24 Hour Museum Index+ plus Content Management System (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssl.co.uk/content/indexplus.html">http://www.ssl.co.uk/content/indexplus.html</a>). 
            The feed broadcast a small range of content types associated with the 
            whole geographical coverage zone of the Web site via a single RSS address: 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/home.rss">http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/home.rss</a>.</p>
    <p>Version 1.0 was an unqualified success, boosting visitor sessions, improving 
            visibility on search engines and reaching audiences the conventional 
            Web site couldn&#39;t reach. By January 2004, the RSS feed was the third 
        most popular point of entry to the site. </p>
    <h2>Why Build The New Feed?</h2>
    <p>In the light of this experience, it became clear to editorial staff 
            that a subsequent major project, City Heritage Guides (<a href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/cityheritage/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/cityheritage/index.html</a>) 
            funded by the UK Department of Culture Media and Sport&#39;s Culture Online 
            team (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cultureonline.gov.uk/">http://www.cultureonline.gov.uk/</a>) would also benefit from multiple 
        feeds. </p>
    <p>This project saw the successful launch in September 2004 of museum, gallery 
            and heritage guides to 10 popular English cities. The extra Web visibility, 
            plus the possible partnership gains from being able to offer a free 
            city culture news feed, meant that an RSS set-up was a must for the 
        project.</p>
    <p>As 
        an extension to the 10 City Heritage Guide feeds, it was also realized that 
        regional feeds plus outputs for our children&#39;s site www.show.me.uk would be key to 
      site development.     </p>
    <h2>Getting Started With Scoping</h2>
    <p>Scoping 
        the tunable feeds was even more difficult than the first feed. That first 
        feed outputted certain article types from the homepage of the main site. It 
        was difficult to choose content types, geographical feed areas and methods 
        of display for the new feed. Another problem was deciding how much scope there 
        should be for giving outside agencies like partner museum organizations a 
        Web interface where they could choose feed parameters, effectively building 
        their own feeds. There&#39;s still little knowledge of RSS in the museum sector, 
      so surveying the sector&#39;s needs would be hard.</p>
    <p>In 
        the end, pressure of work building, launching and sustaining the City Heritage 
        Guides meant that we opted for a simple version 2.0 tunable feed with no &#39;customer&#39; 
        interface and a rudimentary display box offered as JavaScript that can be 
      used by Webmasters on partner sites. </p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="pratty_fig2.jpg" width="350" height="403" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: RSS display box"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 2:  RSS display box</p>
    <p>Resourcing 
        difficulties also curtailed plans to make the feed tuner capable of offering 
        subject-based feeds, at least in this incarnation of the project. To do so 
        would need the database to be batch sorted with subject fields to allow themed 
      feeds to be created. </p>
    <p>Another 
        resource drain would have been that the likely subject areas would need to 
        be researched. This would need analysis of audience searches on the 24 HM 
        site, an appreciation of popular UK National Curriculum subjects, and some 
        things not covered by the curriculum, like archaeology and art collections 
      on-line.</p>
    <p>Since 
        this phase of the project was being self-financed, it was decided that subject-specific 
        output and themes could wait until 24 HM had further developed the main Web 
        site to accommodate these feeds, when there might be more resources for proper 
        research and development. At this stage, 24 HM will not offer a resource discovery 
        facility, but will publicize the existence of a feed in the normal way. At 
        all times, the technical team from SSL led the build and offered advice about 
      scaling the idea, possible technology problems and so on. </p>
    <h2>RSS Version Choice</h2>
    <p>When the first feed was built, it was clear that version choice was 
            possibly a difficulty. In the UK, the academic community, the further 
            education sector and UKOLN (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk</a>) 
            recommended that RSS 1.0 should become a standard for the sector. But 
        publishers in other sectors disagreed, going for RSS 2.0. </p>
    <p>In version 1.0, RSS stands for RDF Site Summary. It uses the Resource Description 
            Framework based on the W3C recommended framework for metadata. Find 
            out more on the W3C Website at: (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">http://www.w3.org/RDF/</a>) and see the 
        1.0 specification at: (<a target="_blank" href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/">http://Web.resource.org/rss/1.0/</a>)</p>
    <p>Version 2.0 is not a development of version 1.0.  It is simpler and 
            it was developed from versions of RSS from the 0.9 series. It stands 
            for Really Simple Syndication. Details of version histories can be found 
        here: (<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss" target="_blank">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss</a>)</p>
    <p>More about 
        the benefits of version 1.0 can be found on the Web: Paul Miller, now Director 
        of the Common Information Environment project in the UK (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.common-info.org.uk/">http://www.common-info.org.uk/</a>), wrote some 
        excellent guidelines for RSS use in an Ariadne article, published 2003, (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue35/miller/">http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue35/miller/</a>.) He also contributed 
        some concise guidelines for RSS version choice to an EEVL (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.eevl.ac.uk/">http://www.eevl.ac.uk</a>) document about 
        RSS – (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.eevl.ac.uk/rss_primer/#ref4">http://www.eevl.ac.uk/rss_primer/#ref4</a>.) This is a 
      reliable and updated history and primer written by M. Moffat.</p>
    <p>The decision 
        to make the 24 Hour Museum feeds in RSS 
        2.0 was not taken lightly, but was a judgment based on research into the popularity 
        of the various version types in the many sectors of publishing that the site 
      crosses into. </p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="pratty_fig3.JPG" width="400" height="318" border="0" alt="Graph: RSS verions"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 3:  RSS versions as seen on Syndic8.com</p>
    <p>Look at this 
        page (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.syndic8.com/stats.php?Section=rss">http://www.syndic8.com/stats.php?Section=rss</a>) 
        on (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.syndic8.com/">http://www.syndic8.com</a>) and see how many feeds using Really Simple Syndication 
        (V2.0) there are. (Syndic8.com can be slow to access.) Versions of RSS 0.9 
        and 2.0 completely dominate the displayed pie chart. The cliché that ubiquity 
        is all is a powerful signifier here – RSS 1.0 may be superior, but 2.0 is 
      everywhere. </p>
    <p>As of February 2005, the momentum now 
        in most mass publishing outlets is behind RSS 2.0. The 2003 decision by 24 
        HM over version choice is vindicated by the further spread of &#39;Blogging&#39; software 
      completely driven by RSS version 2.0. </p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="pratty_fig4.jpg" width="290" height="339" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: tunable feed configuration record"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 4: Tunable feed configuration record</p>
    <h2>Prototype Working</h2>
    <p>As of January 30, 2005, a prototype of the feed 
        tuner has been working, organized by a configuration database record contained 
      within the Index+ database we normally update the Web site with.</p>
    <p>Regional data fields, city-based data 
        fields and other content zones of the site such as institutional records (there 
        are 3300 of them on 24 HM) and the children&#39;s section were switched through 
        the database so that RSS output was possible in a number of different permutations. 
      </p>
    <p>For example, a Yorkshire museums feed 
        is possible, including cities like Leeds where we have 
        a City Heritage Guide. Institution records describing museums and galleries 
        can be selected on the basis of their city or administrative region. These 
        are both controlled values that identify information of relevance to particular 
        constituents. 24 Hour Museum is currently cleaning up and validating the addresses 
        so that more detailed selections, based on a geo code or postcode, can be 
      made.</p>
    <p> Other content types do not have an obvious address; however, any of them may 
          be associated with one or more institutions. If this is the case, the content 
          item is selected on the basis of the location 
        information from the associated institution record. Where a content item is 
        associated with multiple institution records, values will be inherited from 
        all associated museums. For example, a trail that 
        references a museum in Brighton and one in 
        London would be served 
      in both the Brighton and London feeds.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="pratty_fig5.JPG" width="400" height="300" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: config record initialized"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 5: Config record initialized, ready to input</p>
    <h2>Setting Up A Feed Step-By-Step</h2>
    <p>It&#39;s a reasonably simple process, carried 
        out within the Index+ editing client, which looks like this, above. This is 
        a WIX GUI that interacts with the database of the site directly at Rutherford 
      Appleton Laboratory in Oxford.</p>
    <p>Once logged in to the database, a new 
        configuration record is created for a news feed record. 
        This creates a record initialized with empty news feed parameters. The <strong>Advanced</strong> 
        tab takes us to the <strong>Name </strong>box, and a short 
        descriptive news feed name is entered.  This name forms part of the URL for 
        the new feed and so is made up only of lower-case letters, numbers and underscores. 
        For example: london_events. Then the <strong>Params</strong> tab is clicked and feed 
        parameter values are entered, such as a brief title for the feed; a description; 
      the museum region whose info is being outputted; cities covered.</p>
    <p>At this stage, types of content can 
        be chosen. Content types that can be fed out in this version of the feed are 
        museums (institutional records), events (listings), educational resources, 
        articles (news, reviews or features), trails (long narrative features), Web 
      sites (site of the week stories) and children&#39;s stories. </p>
    <p>Some of these are quite simple in their 
        structure; for instance, a <em>Web site of the week</em>  record is little more 
        than a title, a description and a URL, whereas an <em>Institution</em> record 
        describes a 
        museum, contact details, collections, opening hours, facilities, etc in over 
        30 structured fields. Any content to be supplied in an RSS feed has to be 
        mapped on to the fields supported by RSS 2.0. This 
      mapping is done when the specific feed is configured.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="pratty_fig6.jpg" width="400" height="301" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: setting up content types"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 6:  Setting up content types in the config record</p>
    <p>Content channels can also be set at 
        this stage. This is because the 24 Hour Museum database supports 
        a number of different Web sites. Content can be channeled to specific Websites 
        or pages within a Web site. These channels can also be used to select content 
        for the RSS feeds.  Adding to the list of channel names and then associating 
      the channel with the relevant content items can set up new channels for selection.</p>
    <p>Once all these parameters have been set, the record can be saved and the 
            feed can be examined, either within a browser as source code, or through 
            a feed reader or a test display box. The feed is viewable for authorised users at this stage 
      on the 24 Hour Museum update Web site </p>
    <p>        <span class="code">http://www.24hourmuseum.net/production/redesign/rss/&lt;feed_name&gt;.rss</span></p>
    <p>        [readers of this paper won&#39;t be able to examine that - it&#39;s a password 
        protected site.]      The feed reader URL would be this: </p>
    <p><span class="code">http://www.24hourmuseum.net/production/redesign/rss/&lt;feed_name&gt;.rss </span></p>
    <p>All the feeds when published are public in that there 
        is no formal access control such passwords or IP-based 
        restriction. 24 Hour Museum staff can set 
      up a feed with an obscure name if they want to hide the existence of a feed.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="pratty_fig7.JPG" width="400" height="406" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: looking at the feed in a reader"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 7:  Looking at the feed in a reader</p>
    <h2>Presentation</h2>
    <p>Most feed users will access the feeds using the RSS 
        feed client of their choice. The 24 Hour Museum facility also allows users to create a Web page with an embedded 
      panel displaying a feed by including the following in their Web page:</p>
    <p class="code">    &lt;script language=&#34;JavaScript&#34; type=&#34;text/css&#34;</p>
    <p class="code">       src=&#34;http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/rss/display.js?feed=&lt;name 
        of feed&gt;&#34;&gt;</p>
    <p class="code">    &lt;/script&gt;</p>
    <p>The JavaScript supports version 4 and later browsers. 
        The default CSS classes provided give the 24 Hour Museum branding. This 
      can be overridden to customize it for a particular Web site.</p>
    <h2>Glitches</h2>
    <p>When specifying the feed, 24 HM staff didn&#39;t realize 
        that certain fields in the database needed updating. Fields for the regional 
        museum agencies needed renaming and the physical boundaries, checking. In 
        most cases this is not a problem, but for certain regions, namely the South 
      East, this is urgently being rectified. </p>
    <p>This means there&#39;s currently a problem when trying to 
        output a feed matched to certain regional museum boundaries, but that will 
      be fixed a few weeks. </p>
    <p>There are also some issues about displaying the feed. 
        When scoping the tunable feed, staff requested the development of a natty 
        24 HM-branded display box. This would show whatever record types are being 
        fed out to a region or city. But how do you distinguish graphically between 
      news links in a feed box and some listings? </p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="pratty_fig8.jpg" width="164" height="185" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: display box showing record type signifiers"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 8:  Display box showing record type signifiers</p>
    <p>At the moment we are trying to preface each link with 
        a &#39;<strong>signifier</strong>’ like this - ‘Article: Churchill Museum Opens In London&#39; It&#39;s not perfect, but we need to be able to mix 
        record types in one display box - or we think we do. This is uncharted territory 
        for us, and we need to get the project working in public and user-test the 
        various box design options, including single subject boxes, multi-subject 
      boxes and all the variations in between.</p>
    <p>More issues discovered in February include display box 
        length - on an external site, does the text extend the length of the box? 
        Does it just reach a length limit and then stop dead?  Do the old story links 
        always show? What happens if Web masters cache the site (or &#39;<strong>scrape</strong>&#39; 
        it), and what if Web users &#39;<strong>flush their cache</strong>&#39; regularly, as some do?  
      </p>
    <h2>Logistical 
      Aspects</h2>
    <p>Feeds need content. The content could be listings, virtual objects, calendars, 
            features, institutional information, slow changing content, quick changing 
        content or even multimedia files or pictures. </p>
    <p>In terms of content logistics, the tunable feed is closely 
        linked with a network of 12 student journalist writers in nine UK regions set 
        up by 24 Hour Museum December 2004/January 2005. See this article about the 
      network - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/nwh_gfx_en/ART26114.html">http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/nwh_gfx_en/ART26114.html</a> </p>
    <p>Students on the MLA (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mla.gov.uk/">www.mla.gov.uk</a>)-funded 
            network have competed for bursary awards (£500 UKP) and are &#39;embedded&#39; 
            (Gulf War-style!) within museum or gallery marketing departments, with 
            the idea of covering stories as they pass through the museum. Special 
            emphasis is placed on covering the results of MLA&#39;s Renaissance in the 
            Regions regional funding program, as it was Renaissance funding that 
            actually supported the bursaries and pays for supervision from our Brighton 
            office. More about Renaissance here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mla.gov.uk/action/regional/00renaiss.asp">http://www.mla.gov.uk/action/regional/00renaiss.asp</a>   
      </p>
    <p>As the students 
        get working, more and more of their regional stories will power the new tunable 
        feeds, and their content will be shared with museum, gallery and heritage 
      sector partners in the area, as well as anyone else in the city or region.</p>
    <p>This copyright-free 
        situation places emphasis on the major quality of XML - if you can&#39;t share 
      it for free via XML, don&#39;t bother with RSS! </p>
    <h2>Validation</h2>
    <p>One troubling 
        aspect of RSS feed publication is the constant worry about validation of the 
        feed. The reality of all this super-efficient streaming of content is that 
        an awkward diacritic character can slip through checks into the live feed. 
      </p>
    <p>The way our 
        feed works means that one odd bad character can jam the feed to many syndicators 
        and make the feed look odd to home users, although feed reader programs are 
      generally very tolerant of bad character reference entities. </p>
    <p>Editorial staff 
        had to learn to check and treble check diacritics, especially in abstracts 
        or titles. There&#39;s no current way worked out to preview the validity of our 
        pages as we use an update workshop site, which would not validate anyway via 
        conventional means. The first version of our feed does not publish until the 
        site is sent live, which happens overnight using a chron 
      job on the Unix/Solaris host system.</p>
    <p>The new feeds 
        promise more flexibility of content types, but there is also the danger that 
        feeding out previously unseen parts of our database will mean more diacritics 
      to fix, and the prospect of unexpected glitches arising as a result. </p>
    <p>It&#39;s clear we need to develop a more sophisticated means to instantly validate 
            new feeds and feed fields. Running a validator locally would be the 
            answer to our problems, and there are a number of open source programs 
            available. For more about validation see Syndic8.com or look at a validator 
            that can also be run locally: (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.feedvalidator.org/">http://www.feedvalidator.org</a>.)

    <h2>Try The Feeds!</h2>
    <p>A page on the 24 Hour Museum Web site (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/">http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk</a>) 
            will be live by the end of February with information about the new feeds, 
            including URLs of city and regional feeds that are working and available 
            for free for Webmasters to use and for individuals to access using feed

    <h1>RSS And Museums - Is It The Way Forward?<br/> 
      Publishing Challenges, New Users And What Comes Next</h1>
    <p>The first version of the 24 HM news feed was quietly &#39;switched on&#39; 
            in September 2003. At first the facility was just submitted to one &#39;<strong>syndicator</strong>&#39; 
            (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsnow.com/">www.newsnow.com</a>); in fact, what we now term an &#39;<strong>aggregator</strong>.&#39; 
            This careful unveiling was done so that some degree of evaluative work 
            could be done examining which RSS functions worked best: attracting 
            readers via feed readers, Google, or adoption of the feed by other Websites. 
      </p>
    <p>Analysis of 24 Hour Museum Web statistics in 2003  (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/etc/formuseums/TXT25733_gfx_en.html">http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/etc/formuseums/TXT25733_gfx_en.html</a>) 
            and 2004 (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/etc/formuseums/TXT25735_gfx_en.html">http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/etc/formuseums/TXT25735_gfx_en.html</a>) 
            after the deployment of the first feed shows interesting trends. Take-up 
            of the feed was effective but quite slow - indicating that there&#39;s lots 
            more to syndicating content via RSS than just turning on a feed and 
        expecting the masses to visit. </p>
    <p>When the time 
        came to publicize the feed, interest was generated by press releases e-mailed 
        out to the tech sector, museum press, arts and museum newspapers, and the 
        general UK and world media. 
        The feed carried messages out to the wider Google sphere very successfully. 
        Stories would appear in Web searches very quickly indeed (a matter of hours) 
        after the feed was switched on. Once Google introduced their Google News facility, 
        we submitted our feed as a source and it was just a matter of minutes before 
      newly published 24 HM stories appeared on the news. </p>
    <p>There&#39;s a keen 
        interest in XML and RSS issues worldwide, and the tech community that listens 
        out for such subjects is eclectic and open-minded about new uses for technology. 
        We found lots of Web sites about RSS carrying our press release about the 
      feed. </p>
    <p>As stated, just turning on a new output of content like this does not 
            automatically plug you into a fantastic stream of new and happy site 
            users. Submitting the feed for syndication with organizations such as 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.syndic8.com/">http://www.Syndic8.com</a>, 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.moreover.com/">http://www.Moreover.com</a> or Google News is absolutely 
            vital to making sure potential readers can find the feed in lists of 
        feeds available. </p>
    <p>At the moment 
        (January 2005), there&#39;s still not that many RSS news feeds from the museum 
        and gallery sector worldwide. A quick search on the major syndicator sites 
        will turn up ten or twenty US museums, some 
        in Europe and one or two enterprising institutions 
        in the UK. This subject 
        rarity makes distinctive feeds such as Museums and Galleries stand out even 
      more. </p>
    <h2>User Patterns And 
      Some Surprising Figures</h2>
    <p>As summer ended 
        in 2004 and the winter set in, odd things started happening with visit figures 
        to our site. Not only that, but as December turned into January, site slowdowns 
        began to occur. It could only be bandwidth issues, where too many people - 
        or robots - start to request pages from the site server. 24 Hour Museum was 
        switched on to a faster server earlier in 2004 by our hosts, Rutherford Appleton 
        Laboratory (RAL), so it was decided that the problem wasn&#39;t simply a slowdown 
      server-side. </p>
    <p>Our investigations 
        turned to who might be visiting the Web site. One or two new browsers were 
        logged entering the site through the RSS feed. This coincided with the site 
        slowdowns. The slowdowns happened with clockwork regularity twice a day, particularly 
      around 5.30 pm UK time.  </p>
    <p>On the face 
        of it, stats analysis showed visitors to the site were rocketing –resulting 
        in 24 HM publishing gushing stories about record visitor numbers, nudging 
        the half million mark in December. The truth, arrived at after some frantic 
        enquiries around the Web sector in London, was interesting, 
      though it demolished our record viewing figures story.   </p>
    <p>Around November 2004, Pluck.com (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pluck.com/">www.pluck.com</a>) 
            launched their Plucker feed reader to the world, a free program that 
            blitzed 24 Hour Museum servers with frequent &#39;polling&#39; events, checking 
            for newly published RSS stories. Plucker appeared from nowhere in our 
            stats as being responsible for a massive 44% of visits in December and 
        even more in January 2005.  </p>
    <p>We realized 
        that perhaps only 1 in 10 or less of the new visits were human - the rest 
      were robots. </p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig8a" id="Fig8a"></a><a href="pratty.html" target="_blank"><img src="pratty_fig8a.jpg" width="500" height="88" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: graph of visitor sessions"/></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 8a:  Graph of visitor sessions</p>
    <p>With Pluck in 
        mind, here&#39;s a quick look at visitor sessions recorded recently by the 24 
        Hour Museum&#39;s Summary statistical measuring software. 24 Hour Museum marketing 
        manager Ruth Cobb has been looking into the way Summary records all visitor 
        to the site in total, visits via RSS, without robot visits, and with robot 
      noted.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">First I calculated the percentage of 
        entries to the RSS news feed page - which up until November were around 5%. 
        I then took that percentage off the total number of visitor figures. When 
        we have the huge jump in Dec and Jan - doing this actually puts our visitor 
      sessions on a downward trend.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">However, the second thing I did was 
        to add up the number of both known and unknown robots each month. Then I took 
        this figure away from the overall visitor sessions. Again with these there 
        was a huge jump in Dec and Jan. However the interesting thing about doing 
      this is that this puts our figures on a healthy upward rise. </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">I&#39;m not sure which is a more accurate 
        method yet - but it is important as the difference in overall trends is quite 
      stark.     (<em>Ruth Cobb</em>)</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="pratty_fig9.jpg" width="486" height="298" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: RSS feed stats"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 9:  RSS feed stats measured in different ways</p>
    <p>It&#39;s too early 
        to make precise conclusions about this episode, but <em>what is certainly needed 
        are guidelines from public sector cultural agencies in the </em><em>UK</em><em> 
        and worldwide about how to record Web stats in the XML and RSS era.</em>  When more 
        museum sector collections databases are joined up and collectively searchable 
        by individuals and robots alike, it&#39;ll be really hard to gauge usage, relative 
      success and measures of value for public money.  </p>
    <h1>Measuring RSS Stats:  The UK&#39;s Culture On-line Project </h1>
    <p>To find out 
        a bit more about what a museum sector agency approach to measuring RSS stats 
        could be, I asked Chris Barrett, specialist in Web accessibility and Web standards 
        at the UK&#39;s Culture Online project (www.cultureonline.gov.uk). Barrett&#39;s 
        statement <em>is not an expression of official standards</em> for RSS measurement, 
      but an idea of what future standards might involve. </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">In brief, the 
        traffic generated by delivering an RSS feed itself should not really be considered 
        as a page impression if it does not involve a human visit.        </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote"> Typically, RSS feeds are aggregated on a regular schedule by automated tools
        (either installed on a users desktop, or via a Web service of some kind).
        This may occur very frequently (per user), depending on the tool / or
        schedule set up. It is not until a user follows a link from these aggregated
        lists that a true page impression occurs.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">        This is not to say that a high number of RSS feed hits is not a good thing.
        It&#39;s just hard to claim from this alone that lots of traffic is being generated this way.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">        In this case of a user following a link from a feed, the page impression
        will appear in the server log files as a deep link (either with a referrer
        if the aggregated link were published on a Website, or possibly with no
        referrer if the link were followed from a desktop tool.) To make it easier 
        to
        positively identify links from RSS feeds, you may wish to place an
        identifier in the URLs distributed in the RSS.        </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote"> The difficulty in establishing user reach, of course, is when the syndicated
        content itself stands alone. Here, a single RSS item contains its full
        content - not just an introduction enticing the reader in for more. In this
        case, for each request of the RSS feed, you may potentially be receiving a
        true page impression in terms of human eyeballs.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">        For this reason, it is important to ensure that the http caching pragmas
        such as last-modified are set, and that your Web server responds to a head
        request. This way, a properly configured user agent (supporting these
        features) will not request the whole RSS feed until the content has changed
        (and at such point could more legitimately be counted as a true page
        impression).  </p>
    <p class="blockquoteauthor">(<em>Chris Barrett, access and standards advisor, </em>Culture 
              Online)</p>
    <h2>Weblogs Affect User Figures, Copyright 
      Issues Too</h2>
    <p>One and a half years in from the initial project idea a whole new group of 
            Web users have made RSS a key part of their ways of working. <strong>Webloggers</strong> 
        or <strong>bloggers</strong> use systems like Movable Type (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/">http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/</a>) 
            or Blogger (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.blogger.com/start">http://www.blogger.com/start</a>) 
            to post on-line diaries, automatically updating content using a simple 
            content management system. Most Web logs are available as RSS or Atom 
        feeds.</p>
    <p>Many bloggers 
        make content using quite restrictive technical facilities - some blog programs 
        don&#39;t allow direct uploading and publishing of photos. It&#39;s common practice 
        for bloggers to do Google image searches for pictures to illustrate new stories, 
        then deep link to pictures on the Web sites of others - such as the 24 Hour 
      Museum! </p>
    <p>This is another 
        unpredicted source of traffic to our site. A cursory viewing of the &#39;<em>most 
        popular page element&#39;</em> in our Summary stats package often shows Web visitors 
        are just accessing parts of a page - usually a picture. It perhaps won&#39;t surprise 
        readers to know one of the most popular images served up by the 24 HM is one 
        of Marilyn Monroe. Naturally, of course, we are concerned about the copyright 
        legality of these partial page views. Wholesale adoption of RSS Web casting 
      in my opinion will inevitably lead to complicated IPR situations.</p>
    <p>If Web sites 
        such as the 24 HM are to develop and evolve into widely Web-searched resource 
        banks or portals to on-line collections, solutions to copyright challenges 
        offered by projects such as Creative Commons (<a target="_blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/">http://creativecommons.org/</a>) need to be 
        adopted creatively. CC is already able to offer layers of contextually appropriate 
      licenses embedded within a digitally published RSS object. </p>
    <p>Further developments 
        like MLA&#39;s Knowledge Web project (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mla.gov.uk/documents/iik_kw.pdf">http://www.mla.gov.uk/documents/iik_kw.pdf</a>) could make 
        intelligent use of RSS and XML content sharing mechanisms - and these developments 
        will need to acknowledge the fragmentation of museum content and collection 
        objects on the Web and the need to control copyright, or develop new less 
      stringent attitudes within museums to copyright issues.  </p>

    <h2>Brief Case Study 
    – Good Practice And Initiative At National Museums Liverpool. Why Make The 
      Feed?</h2>
    <p> As you have read in the introduction to this paper, the 24 Hour Museum 
            was the first UK museum to develop an RSS Feed in 2003. Other UK museums 
            have been slow to adopt the technology for their use. National Museums 
            Liverpool stand out as pathfinders for the museum sector, however, having 
            self-developed in-house a range of useful news feeds from their Web 
            site. The feeds, at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/about/developersguide.asp">http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/about/developersguide.asp</a>, 
        went live September 17, 2004.</p>
    <p>Dawn Capper is Britain&#39;s first museum &#39;e-PR officer&#39;, based at National 
            Museums Liverpool. NML also have just appointed a Web Strategy Coordinator, 
            Karen Miller, and there are regular meetings of the Web Communications 
        Group.   </p>
    <p>&#34;We were aware that a lot of people are looking for content for 
            their sites and as a national museum with changing exhibits, events 
            and lots of things going on in general, we felt that a feed of stories 
            about what was going on would be a really good idea,&#34; said Dawn, 
        interviewed for this paper. </p>
    <p>At the moment 
        the feeds syndicate content that falls somewhere between being press info 
        and content aimed squarely at the public, something that Dawn is happy to 
      admit. So there&#39;s still some editorial tuning to get done. </p>
    <p>As yet, the 
      output has not been submitted to any syndicators or aggregators. </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Although the 
        user figures aren&#39;t earth shattering, I think you&#39;ll agree they are a good 
        starting point and that the project is in its infant stage. I would certainly 
        like to publicize the feeds and make sure people know they are there, but 
        haven&#39;t had the opportunity as yet. We do want to be innovators though, not 
      emulators, so this project fits in well with that strategy. (<em>Dawn Capper</em>)</p>
    <p>For NML, seeking 
        inspiration from the cultural sector for innovative new ideas is not that 
        simple. &#34;It&#39;s very difficult when thinking of the Web to find a benchmark 
        for new technologies within the museum world. You always should be looking 
        outside the sector to see what new approaches people are planning,&#34; said Dawn, 
        explaining that mass publishers like The BBC and The Guardian newspaper were 
      good examples of this.  </p>
    <p>One really good 
        Liverpool idea in particular is the &#39;<strong>Picture 
        of the Month&#39;</strong> feed, which broadcasts a .jpg and some text to publicize 
        a collection item. Here&#39;s the feed address – copy and paste it into your feed 
        reader and check it out! <a target="_blank" href="http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/whatsonnet/pom_feed.aspx?venue=7">http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/whatsonnet/pom_feed.aspx?venue=7

    <h3>How Is It Done? </h3>
    <p>Neil Harding 
        is the Web expert at National Museums Liverpool who took the plunge and put 
      the feed together. </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">To be honest 
        it&#39;s just something that I thought we should have. I&#39;d read some tutorials 
        on how to put feeds together and just followed them through! But for a large, 
        regularly updating content provider like us it&#39;s a natural facility to have. 
      The BBC, The Guardian, et al have had them for a while.</p>
    <p>How long did 
        the feeds take to put together? Not long at all, according to 
      Neil:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">approx. half a day for the first feed and maybe 30 minutes for 
        each subsequent feed. An RSS feed is a simple XML document, which is 
        native feature of the .NET framework that we use for all server side 
      programming across the site. So from a coding perspective it is quite straightforward.</p>
    <p>What&#39;s your CMS? </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">We don&#39;t have 
        one! Well, not one to drive the entire site. Most of the data-driven features 
        currently use an MS Access back-end with an ASP .NET front-end. We are 
        currently developing our own CMS, initially for our Intranet but ultimately 
      it&#39;s likely to drive the Website as well. That uses a MS SQL Server 2000 back-end.</p>
    <p>Would you consider 
        making other parts of the db available to the feed, such as on-line collections 
      or listings?</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Yes: we already 
        provide listings feeds but we&#39;d like to 
      more of our content to be aggregated.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">We can&#39;t provide 
        collections feeds just yet as that part of the site isn&#39;t data-driven. When 
        it is, it would also be possible to provide customized feeds so that content 
        aggregators could choose which areas of the collection they were interested 
        in and a feed be generated to suit they&#39;re specific needs. Ultimately I&#39;d 
        like to see all of our content available as feeds but this will only be possible 
      once the site is run via a robust CMS.</p>
    <h3>How popular 
      are the feeds? </h3>
    <p>National Museums 
        Liverpool quite rightly admits that feed figures 
      are hard to gauge. Neil Harding concurs:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">We cannot really 
        give you an exact figure, but doing our best to exclude search spiders and 
        robots, our January 2005 WebTrends (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.webtrends.com/">http://www.Webtrends.com/</a>) reports are 
      telling us this:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote"> 1036 Visits</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">34 Unique visitors</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">7752 Views</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">(Period of time measured, 
      one month.)</p>
    <p>Neil again rightly 
      points out the problems of measuring RSS output and usage. </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">RSS feeds, by their very 
        nature, are there to be used in various ways: the stats are not a definitive 
      impression.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">So if someone consumes our 
        feed as content on their Website, they could, if they want, cache it so it 
        only fetches the latest version once a day. Therefore we&#39;d only see one view 
        per day from them, but that site itself could be generating lots of traffic 
        for us. It&#39;s just that when a user visits that site they are only seeing a 
      local version of the feed.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">It&#39;s the same with desktop 
        news aggregators (feed readers). The one I&#39;ve got on my machine can update 
        at intervals ranging from every minute to every week, so the feed can appear 
      more popular if someone is checking regularly.</p>
    <p>And that&#39;s exactly 
        the situation that users of Plucker from Pluck.com could be creating if they 
        set their popular new feed reader download to check for new content every 
      few minutes by default!  </p>
    <p>Would National 
      Museums Liverpool do it again?   </p>
    <p>&#34;It&#39;s a starting point for us,&#34; said Dawn Capper. NML don&#39;t 
            currently have easy access to their collections on-line, so making more 
            content types available via XML and RSS is something that&#39;s possibly 
            out of reach at the moment. &#34;It&#39;s certainly something we&#39;d be interested 
            in working towards, though. The feeds maximize the chances we have to 
        reach diverse audiences with our collections.&#34;</p>
    <h1>Where Now for Museums and RSS?</h1>
    <p>Mainstream publishers 
        are beginning to harness the technology to their own ends. Spring 2005 is 
        an exciting time for followers of technologies like RSS, XML and SOAP. There&#39;s 
        a sudden momentum behind developments that was absent before the end of 2004. 
        In the US and in Europe, the bigger technology portals and other mass Web 
        publishers like the BBC, MSN and The Guardian newspaper are developing their 
        own bespoke feed readers that will keep readers within Web site hierarchies, 
        rather than &#39;doing their own thing&#39; on their own computers with open source 
      feed readers. </p>
    <p>Doing this gives 
        the big publishers a chance to retain advertising within the feeds - important 
      at the moment, as there&#39;s currently a big rise in revenues from on-line advertising.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="pratty_fig12.jpg" width="350" height="366" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: The Guardian"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 12: The Guardian (uk) bespoke feed reader </p>
    <p>So the chances are we&#39;ll see a rise in the number of built-in feed readers 
            such as that on CNET.com and the new beta version of Newspoint on The 
            Guardian (UK). Simon Waldman is the Director of Digital Publishing of 
            The Guardian, one of the world&#39;s most Web savvy newspapers. Speaking 
            to the Editor&#39;s Weblog (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.editorsweblog.org/2005/02/emthe_guardiane.html">http://www.editorsWeblog.org/2005/02/emthe_guardiane.html</a>) 
            he explained where he thinks the rationale for adding customized RSS 
        access comes from.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Newspoint (The 
        Guardian&#39;s bespoke, browser-dwelling reader) is just one of a number of things 
        we&#39;re testing and examining at the moment in the RSS area. Actually, our thinking 
        is not simply driven by RSS, but about the whole principle of the distributed/ 
        decentralized Internet which we think is going to be one of the main developments 
      and challenges that face publishers over the next three years . . .</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">The online world 
        is changing. We are entering a world where people are increasingly going to 
        access our content through RSS, aggregators, bloggers and search engines. 
        It is the distributed Internet and it is a real challenge for us. The more 
        we learn about it; and the more we engage with it now, the healthier we will 
      be in the medium and long term future.<em>  </em></p>
    <p class="blockquoteauthor">(Simon Waldman, Director of 
        Digital Publishing, The Guardian)</p>
    <p>By the end of 2004, blogs had established themselves as key parts of on-line 
            culture. Two surveys by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project 
            (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/148/report_display.asp">http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/148/report_display.asp</a>) 
            established new contours for the blogosphere: 8 million American adults 
            say they have created blogs; blog readership jumped 58% in 2004 and 
            now stands at 27% of Internet users; 5% of Internet users say they use 
            RSS aggregators or XML readers to get the news and other information 
            delivered from blogs and content-rich Web sites as it is posted on-line; 
            and 12% of Internet users have posted comments or other material on 
        blogs. </p>
    <h2>What Does This 
      Progress Mean For Museums? How MLA May Use RSS</h2>
    <p>If RSS and XML 
        technology become more widely adopted as a means of distributing content and 
        sharing databases in the cultural sector, we can expect to see more initiatives 
        from central coordinating organizations such as MLA (The Museums, Libraries 
      and Archives Council) in the UK. </p>
    <p>MLA (www.mla.gov.uk) could adopt 
        RSS or SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol – see this: (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/">http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/</a>) in a new project, 
        the Case Studies Database, which was the subject of an invitation to tender 
        at the end of 2004. The ITT asked interested developers to provide alternative 
      means of output for the project, via RSS or SOAP. </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Lots of people 
        want THEIR view of case studies.  Just their subject, geographic area, etc. RSS would do news 
      alerts on the latest case study for third party Web sites.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">SOAP etc. will 
        mean if you search the collections advisory site then you will find relevant 
        case studies too. It will be all in the same system but could be integrated 
        into other portals. So the Scottish Museums Council Website could show just 
      Scottish case studies, or those also from England.   </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">(<em>David 
        Dawson. Senior Advisor in ICT at MLA.) </em></p>
    <p>On-line information 
        services consultancy Simulacra (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.simulacra.com/">http://www.simulacra.com/</a>) has won the 
        contract to develop the project for MLA.  &#34;The Case Studies Service will be 
        an online knowledge base - a collection of the experiences that museums, libraries 
        and archives have gone through in their respective fields,&#34; according to Jeremy 
      Tarling of Simulacra.</p>
    <p>A Web front 
        end is being developed to allow any museum, library or archive to be able 
        to log in and upload their case studies. The nine regional MLACs (Museum Library 
        and Archive Councils) will all be able to review and publish these case studies, 
        either with their own regional branding or with central MLA branding. MLA 
        will manage the users, workflows, securities, etc. The project will make use 
        of an on-line publishing solution called Harmonise, the code of which was 
      recently released by Simulacra under an open source license. </p>
    <p>&#34;MLA specifically asked for RSS output in their ITT, but Harmonise 
            is equally able to provide SOAP input/output should that be required,&#34; 
        said Jeremy Tarling.  According to 
        Chris Turner, ICT advisor from MLA, the Case Studies project was conceived 
        as a &#39;service&#39; and as such the system is intended to be able to deliver content 
        through a variety of mechanisms. He qualifies the author&#39;s implication that 
      RSS will be central to the project in this way: </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">The obvious mechanism for 
        delivery is the basic Web search interface, which will be part of the MLA 
        Web site. However the system is also specified to serve data through SOAP, 
        OAI and RSS so that third parties can access the data from their own applications 
        and present that as an integrated part of their own content.  RSS is simply 
        seen as one of the mechanisms to achieve this and I&#39;m not aware of any specific 
      delivery option envisaged.  </p>

    <h2>More Museum Sector Interest</h2>
    <p>Paul Miller, 
        Director of the Common Information Environment project based in Hull, UK, suggested 
        wider uses of XML and RSS to the paper author. The CIE Web site (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.common-info.org.uk/">http://www.common-info.org.uk/</a>) is RSS enabled 
        - it broadcasts two sections of the site as Web logs for other site users 
      to display or for individuals to read through feed reader software. </p>
    <p>Writing to the 
      author about the 24 HM tunable feed, Miller asks: </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">What scope might 
        there be for sucking content in from other sources: so that a regional museum 
        agency (known in UK museum sector-speak 
        as an &#39;MLAC&#39;) could display on its Website, archive and library content for 
      their region alongside the museum content? </p>
    <p>Beyond promoting 
        new ways of accessing material for organizing bodies, there may be problems 
      ahead for smaller organizations wishing to adopt XML output, thinks Miller.</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">I guess one issue for smaller institutions might 
            be bandwidth; especially if they get to be popular. There may be scope 
            for 24 Hour Museum or mda (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mda.org.uk/">http://www.mda.org.uk</a>) 
            or whoever, providing a Bloglines-like (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloglines.com/">http://www.bloglines.com</a>) 
            capability for these institutions, hosted on YOUR server, using YOUR 
        bandwidth, but carrying THEIR branding...</p>
    <h2>Research Shows Museums Are Trusted On-line: 
      We Need To Seize The Moment</h2>
    <p>Recent research (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.common-info.org.uk/docs/mori-report.pdf">http://www.common-info.org.uk/docs/mori-report.pdf</a>) 
            by Mori, commissioned by CIE, hints that there is a need for the museum 
            sector to adopt RSS-based technology more fully than at present. In 
            the CIE report, published February 2, 2005, 85 % of current UK Internet 
            users said their favored method of searching the Internet was by search 
            engine. This means that for many, the first contact with a Web-borne 
            resource will be <em>out of the searched-for digital object&#39;s original 
        published context</em>. </p>
    <p>All the more 
        reason to consider carefully design and navigation issues when feeding out 
        content via RSS. But also good reason to get the content out into the digital 
        world using XML or RSS, where people are searching via Google 
      and other means.</p>
    <p>The CIE report 
        also highlights good news for museums as information providers. Good layout 
        and professional design values are key to many users, 
        but for a massive 92% of users, reliability of content was highly important. 
        Respondents to the survey also cited quality and frequency of updating as 
      being important.</p>
    <p>Trust is key to the way people relate to on-line information sources, 
        according to the report. Some types of organizations are trusted more than 
        others - museums, libraries and archives were regarded as engendering a great 
        deal of trust from many Web users, particularly compared to commercial Web 
      info or retail sites. </p>
    <p>The CIE Report 
        in its conclusions hits the nail on the head with a key recommendation - which 
        has clear implications when museums or galleries are considering using new 
      means to broadcast content such as RSS. Bearing in mind 
        the way most Web users use search engines, museums &#39;need to work to ensure 
        their Websites come up first in searches, have intuitive Website addresses 
      and are generally &#39;top-of-mind&#39;, according to the report. </p>
    <p>Beyond the CIE report - DigiCult&#39;s Thematic Issue 3, from May 2003, (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.digicult.info/downloads/thematic_issue_3_low.pdf">http://www.digicult.info/downloads/thematic_issue_3_low.pdf</a>) 
            makes fascinating conclusions about the likely growth of the <strong>semantic 
            internet</strong> and how it relates to the cultural Web sector. Could 
            the current chain reaction of RSS popularity be the embodiment of Tim 
        Berners Lees&#39; ideas about the semantic Internet? (Berners Lee, 2000)</p>
    <p>The DigiCult report concludes: </p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Ultimately the same factors that constrain the heritage 
            sector&#39;s ability to take full advantage of the Web will constrain the 
            penetration and pervasiveness of the semantic Web in the heritage sector. 
            The success of the semantic Web in the heritage sector depends upon 
            it&#39;s adopting an XML-based approach and a significant experiment that 
            demonstrates it&#39;s benefits to the wider community. Even for all it&#39;s weaknesses 
            the semantic Web offers a tantalizing solution to the problem of information 
            overload created by the Web and the heritage sector needs to address 
        how it can take advantage of the opportunities it offers.  </p>

    <h2>24 Hour Museum - Developing RSS Further</h2>
    <p>Taking cues 
        from the ideas of Simon Waldman and considering the likely moves of major 
        Web broadcasters towards browser integrated feed readers, it seems sensible 
        to consider developing some dedicated feed reading technology, aimed at specific 
        audience strands such as (UK National Curriculum) Key Stage 2 or 3 kids. Imagine 
        a free and funky dedicated reader, popping up on your kid&#39;s screen at home 
        or at school, displaying museum content from a limited number of safety-checked, 
      well-designed advert-free digital sources.</p>
    <p>You&#39;d click on a button on the 24 HM Web site or the kids site <a href="http://www.show.me.uk/" target="_blank">www.show.me.uk</a> 
        to download the free reader which could be based on an open source program 
        such as Feedreader from Sourceforge.com. (http://<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sourceforge.com/">www.sourceforge.com</a>) 
      </p>
    <p>The reader would be colorful and capable of searching for and book 
            marking a number of curriculum or fun-related subject feeds like dinosaurs 
            or archaeology. Taking the idea further, 24 HM could offer a series 
            of facilities for the museum sector, such as the ability to generate 
            and populate your own museum-specific listings and events feed. Using 
            the 24 HM&#39;s existing Direct Data Entry system (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/etc/formuseums/TXT17733_gfx_en.html">http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/etc/formuseums/TXT17733_gfx_en.html</a>) 
            as an entry point, event, exhibition and educational resources could 
            be inputted. Then a JavaScript code could be automatically generated, 
            giving the Web master of the museum site some code to paste into an 
            html page, or into a database-driven page. This would then display the 
            museum&#39;s own news feed of listings or exhibitions, also available to 
            others to add to their sites, or to individuals to  use locally on their 
        machines. </p>
    <p>Since the medium 
        term strategy of the 24 Hour Museum is to develop 
        subject specific areas on the site such as science and technology in museums, 
        archaeology and art collections on-line, it would be natural for each section 
        of the site to be available as a feed. It would be difficult logistically 
        to make enough content to fill say 10 sections of the site, but it would be 
        possible to make partnerships with the major national museums in each subject 
        area to share content development costs, or simply share content to be re-purposed, 
      then fed out using the subject feed. </p>
    <p>These are exciting times for museums to be on-line, and RSS and XML are the 
            most exciting of all the new methods of making content and collections 
            available on-line. I hope my paper has shown that mainstream publishers 
            are jumping ahead of the cultural sector in the use of widely-broadcasting 
            Web methods: the challenge now is for the museum and gallery sector 
            to realize the enormous value of these new technologies to truly develop 
            the educative and communicative potential of the Web for museums.
