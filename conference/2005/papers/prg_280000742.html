      <h1>Cultural Visit Memory: The Visite+ System Personalization and Cultural 
        Visit Tracking Site</h1>
      <h2>Roland Topalian, Cité des Sciences et de l’industrie, Paris, France</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p id="abstract">The Interactivity and Multimedia Department at the Cité 
        des Sciences et de l&#39;Industrie has developed, in close association with 
        the Laboratoire Communication, Culture et Société (C2SO) at the École 
            Normale Supérieure, Lyon, a system of visit personalization called Visite+. 
            We propose the creation of a personal Web site (a cyberlog of the visit) 
            for all visitors, providing them with a record of their paths at the 
            exhibition, their results at activities (photos, quizzes, etc.), and 
            complete exhibition contents and complementary resources (documents, 
            dossiers, links, etc.). Visitors can access all of their visits on a 
        single portal. The aim is to free visitors from some of the spatial 
            and temporal constraints involved in museum visits, and to do so in 
            a way that corresponds to a number of clearly identified expectations 
            and practices (preparing visits; bringing some of the contents home 
            to reduce the ephemeral, accidental dimension of the visit; reliving, 
            verifying, and sharing the visit experience; making full use of visits 
        in classrooms for teachers, etc.). The system enables the museum to considerably strengthen 
            its relationship with its public using an innovative basis that consists 
        of accompanying visitors in their personal practices. </p>
      <p id="abstract">After three years of experimentation, during which time 
            104,000 Web sites have been created for nearly 100,000 visitors, we 
            at the Cité have learned a number of lessons that we would like to share 
        with others. We are interested in broadening the network of cultural 
            institutions proposing a personalized approach like Visite+. Grouping 
            institutions interested in this approach on a single platform would 
            enable us to shift the focus from the individual institution to individual 
            visitors and their cultural practices, which include a variety of institutions. The aim of this platform is to foster exchanges between 
            professionals and create a portal of participating institutions. In 
            this way visitors can access their personalized Visite+ cyberlogs from 
            each institution’s site and find an ongoing record of their path in 
            all participating museums; and institutions can tailor their offer to 
        a public made up exclusively of exhibition visitors. </p>
      <p id="keywords">Keywords: marketing, personalization, visit, innovation, 
        post-visit</p>
      <h1>Project Background</h1>
      <p>The Visite+ project began with a feasibility study commissioned in 
            June 2000 by the General Management at La Cité in the framework of the 
            three-year &#34;Challenges of the Living World&#34; exhibition series. 
        The objectives of the project are:</p>
            <ul>
          <li> 
             <i>Guidance</i>: data collection on visitor 
              profiles and expectations, orientation and follow-up in the museum&#39;s 
              site memorization of the visit, marketing evaluation and development, 
              improving visitor loyalty</li>
          <li> 
             <i>Museology</i>: personalization of exhibition 
              path, novel interactions</li>
          <li> 
             <i>Resource offer</i>: deliver content 
              adapted to each visitor. </li>
        </ul>
      <p>The conception of the project relied on more than ten years of joint 
            work on the status and role of exhibition visitors conducted by the 
            university research team, the Laboratoire Communication, Culture et 
            Society (C2SO) at the University Ecole Normale Supérieure. This 
            collaboration allowed us to integrate knowledge concerning visitor expectations 
        and visit practices from the very beginning. </p>
      <p>After the feasibility study, some of the first elements prefiguring 
            the Visite+ system were implemented for the <i>Man Transformed</i> exhibition 
            in November 2001. Visitors could register at interactive kiosks to receive 
            personalized newsletters featuring updates on subjects of their choice. 
        This monthly newsletter was sent to their personal email address. </p>
      <p>The initial commission had a strong technological thrust. The management 
            departments that had commissioned the project – the Direction Générale 
            and the Direction de la Prospective – imagined the use of a PDA as an 
            exhibition exploration tool able to provide innovative visit experiences, 
            encouraging visitor interaction with the environment and with individual 
            exhibits, data exchange between visitors, registration for services, 
        purchases, etc. </p>
      <p>As with any project that extends over a long period of time, unexpected 
            developments occurred between the initial conception and the final product 
            delivered to the institution. In this case, a lot of hopes were initially 
            pinned on the appearance of powerful PDAs offering very long battery 
            life and unfailing connectivity, associated with industrial robustness 
            and a simple, flexible, and efficient operating system enabling user 
            geolocalization. Clearly our expectations were excessive insofar as 
            these criteria were concerned. Other aspects were underestimated, such 
            as the need for extensive communication (with exhibition project managers, 
            and with the institution and finally with visitors), and the existence 
            and use of brand new services relying on very recent technologies (in 
        2000, the use of Internet in French households was still not very widespread).</p>
      <p>The project was reoriented on a much more practical basis to concentrate 
            on offering new applications made possible by a variety of recent technologies. 
            Instead of centering the system on the PDA, we devised a global information 
            system capable of generating personalized visit tracking together with 
            post-visit services accessible on the Web for home and classroom use. 
            These included a recreation of the visit experience on a personal Web 
            site plus access to a variety of other features in the form of electronic 
        documents sent by mail to visitors who sign up for them. </p>
      <p>This approach seemed more suitable since it allowed us to break the 
            project into parts without running the risk of having nothing workable 
            to propose in the end. In addition, it met expectations expressed by 
            visitors through surveys, notably their desire to access the contents 
        of the exhibition after their actual visit. </p>
      <p>In terms of marketing, our aim was to create an environment that would 
            enable us to know our visitors better so as to enhance the pertinence 
        of the information and services we offer them.</p>
      <p>This method of personalization is very different from traditional methods 
            of segmentation based on target publics. These are personalized only 
            in a very metaphorical sense. Here, the offer itself is personalized, 
            making it possible to position each visitor in two respects: individually, 
            as a function of interests and practices, and categorically as a member 
        of the museum&#39;s public</p>
      <p>For the institution, Visite+ is, of course, a very effective tool in 
            developing visitor loyalty (since it prompts visitors to come back to 
            the museum and thereby promotes our exhibitions). It is also a tool 
            in achieving a wider aim: to facilitate and promote cultural visit practices 
        in general.</p>
      <p>Visite+ offers a truly user-focused, rather than product-focused, approach. 
      </p>
      <h1>Aspects of the Conceptual Approach</h1>
      <p>Visite+ provides an array of services, each feature of which fulfills 
            its own specific function while also contributing to the overall aim 
            of building a long-term relationship between the institution and individual 
            visitors. Visite+ marks a significant change in the field of museum 
            communication. The way the system links the exhibition to the Web to 
            allow users to follow up on their actual visit experience and learn 
            more is not so much a technical innovation as an innovation in use and 
        Museology combined (cf. Dédale, 2004).</p>
      <h1>The roots of the project</h1>
      <h2>Visitor Status</h2>
      <p>Observing a change in the expectations formulated by visitors vis-à-vis 
            our institution (particularly on the occasion of exhibitions of the 
        <i>science and society</i> type when they expressed the desire to air 
            their viewpoints) led us to effect a change in the status we gave to 
            them. We began to develop increasingly empirical methods that encourage 
            visitors to become active participants and ultimately mediators of their 
            own thought rather than passive receivers of messages transmitted by 
            the institution in its role as mediator. (Le Marec and Topalian 2004, 
        Le Marec 2004) </p>
      <p>The extensive experience we have had since 1980 in designing interactives 
            in the museum&#39;s Interactivity and Multimedia Department and the great 
            many visitor surveys conducted since the Cité des Sciences opened in 
            1986 helped us conceive and implement a novel type of visit that could 
            never have come into being without the us of Internet tools. When you 
            start working on developing objects of interactive mediation, communication 
            schemes based on transmitting knowledge to visitors do not work anymore. 
            It is through dialogue, diversion, and play that visitors actively acquire 
        knowledge. </p>
      <h2>Fostering Studious Applications</h2>
      <p>From the start, the Cité des Sciences offered visitors ways to find 
            out more about the content presented in the exhibition (via resource 
            areas where they can consult books, articles, databases, and the like, 
            but also via additional information in the interactive exhibits themselves). 
      </p>
      <p>It is notoriously difficult, however, for visitors to find time during 
            their actual visit for both discovering the exhibition in general and 
            finding out more about specific aspects of it. In addition, trends in 
            exhibition design are changing: they are becoming more and more spectacular 
            and immersive. The spatial, visual, acoustic, and even social (family 
            or group) conditions in the museum do not lend themselves to an assiduous 
        pursuit of learning.</p>
      <p>To maintain the exhibition&#39;s function of furthering knowledge in a 
            studious environment, new tools need to be implemented to free exhibitions 
            to provide visitors with an experience of experimentation and discovery 
            and shift the focus of studious activities to a more suitable environment. 
            This is the aim of linking up the exhibition with a Web site containing 
        the cyberlog of each visitor&#39;s visit. </p>
      <h2>Personal Access For Visitors Who Are Not Internauts</h2>
      <p>What editorial status do we give to the post-visit on the Web? We have 
            always advocated a direct link between the two mediation tools: the 
            exhibition and the Web. For this reason, we did not intend to create 
            a virtual exhibition accessible to all internauts, or a thematic site 
            unrelated to the exhibition. Our aim was to make the entire exhibition 
            available to actual visitors to the museum without revealing it to internauts 
            who had not visited it, so as to maintain the excitement of discovery 
        in the actual visit to the museum. </p>
      <p>The post-visit on the Web takes the form of a private personal Web 
            site reserved for exhibition visitors. This site features almost all 
            of the exhibition contents, along with an array of additional services. 
      </p>
      <h2>The System Of Personalization</h2>
      <h3>Identifiers in the exhibition</h3>
      <p>To generate a computerized record of a visit to an exhibition requires 
            a visitor identification system. Among the experiments that had been 
            conducted at the time were the London Science Museum&#39;s <i>Wellcome Wing</i>, 
            which had used fingerprints to identify visitors, and the Experimentarium 
            in Copenhagen, which had used tags with antenna to read visitor cards. 
      </p>
      <p>A number of criteria factored into the choice of identifiers: non-redundance, 
            legibility after intensive use, low production costs, ease of use and 
            implementation (creation or reading). The identification device must 
            not (or practically not) disturb the visit and must be adaptable to 
        meet changes over time.</p>
      <p>Fingerprints offer the clear advantage of being readily available, 
            and they eliminate the need to make identifiers especially for the purpose. 
            The downside is that automatic recognition of digital fingerprints does 
            not work for a hundred percent of the visitors, and this causes some 
            inconvenience. In addition, the use of biometric identifiers raises 
            privacy concerns (the CNIL, the National Commission on Computers and 
            Civil Liberties in France, would probably not have licensed such a system). 
            For these reasons, we decided against them. Another option was RFID 
            tags, or contactless smart cards, but because of the high cost of the 
            tags, they would have had to be reused, and doing so involved numerous 
        complications</p>
      <p>We ultimately opted for a system of information and visit tracking 
            that is not dependant on a specific type of identifier. We did this 
            by shifting the recognition interface to the exhibition set up, thereby 
            making it possible to use the Visite+ system as soon as a visitor has 
        been provided with a unique identifier.</p>
      <p>For the first exhibition using the Visite+ system, we opted for the 
        bar code as identifier.</p>
      <h1>The Visite+ Experience So Far</h1>
      <p>Visite+ has two parts: the management system for personalized services 
        and the services proposed to visitors.</p>
      <h2>The Management System For Personalized Services</h2>
      <p>Visite+ is an integrated information system enabling personalized service 
            management for visitors to the Cité des Sciences – that is to say, to 
            people who have come to the museum for actual visits to exhibitions. 
            Visite+ is the personalization core, the nexus of an array of services. 
            It is designed with the capacity to adapt to the possibility of all 
        sorts of personalized services that may appear over time.</p>
      <p>The system creates a personal Web site for each visitor and manages 
            personal data. Services can be selected by the visitors on their portals. 
            To date, services supported by Visite+ include, on the one hand, access 
        to the exhibition on the Web, and on the other, documents sent by email.</p>
      <p>All of the features available to a visitor are coordinated using a 
            library of tools that enable visitor tracking in the exhibition, data 
            sharing, storage, and transfer between individual exhibits, exhibitions 
        and the Web.</p>
      <h2>A Web Portal To Access Services </h2>
      <p>The visitor&#39;s Web site is accessible on the Cité des Sciences Web site. 
            There are two types of access: with registration and without (in both 
        cases the service is free).</p>
      <p>Visitors who choose not to register can access the cyberlog of their 
            visit by entering their identifier (the ticket number, for instance). 
            Visitors who register for membership log in (with their email address 
            and name or nickname) to access the personalized services proposed by 
        Visite+.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="topalian.fig3.jpg" width="400" height="441" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Visite + Home Page"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig1: Visite+ Home Page <br/>

      <p>The portal allows visitors to change their settings and choose from 
            a variety of services (see below). They can register or consult their 
            actual visits to La Cité. After a visit is saved, there is no further 
            need to hold onto the visit code; the visits can be consulted by clicking 
        on its icon along with all other saved visits to the Cité des Sciences.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="topalian.fig4.jpg" width="400" height="447" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: The visitor portal"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 2: The visitor portal: the My Visits tab features 
        a list of actual visits to the Cité des Sciences. </p>
      <h2>Individualized Electronic Documents</h2>
      <p>Visite+ provides customized electronic information, including:</p>
            <ul>
          <li> 
             A <b><i>Visitor newsletter </i></b>for anyone 
              who signs up for it. This monthly newsletter features announcements 
              of events at La Cité and personalized updates on subjects chosen from 
              a list of topics. This component of the project is an effective tool 
              for keeping up extended contacts between visitors and the museum.

      <h2>Visit Management: Visit Tracking and the Cyberlog</h2>
      <p>Tracking visits in the exhibition allows us to personalize the experience, 
            record the path followed by the visitor, and create a personal Web site. 
      </p>
      <p>The procedure typically works as follows: First, visitors are invited 
            to insert their ticket into a Visite+ registration point, where they 
            indicate their language preference, any disabilities, and enter their 
            email address if they have one. From that point on, by using their ticket 
            while exploring the exhibition, they will be automatically &#34;recognized&#34; 
        by all interactive devices and addressed in the language that they have 
        chosen. The Visite+ system records each access to an exhibit. Visitors 
        can obtain this information whenever they desire at dedicated Visite+ 
        points in the museum. They can also choose to save their results at 
        quizzes for later consultation. In fact, Visite+ can store all multimedia 
        activities; such as electronic votes in discussion groups, graphic and 
        sound media, etc.</p>
      <p>The cyberlog plays on the link between the exhibition and the Internet. 
            Associated to the visit tracking, it enables visitors to go on-line 
            and gain access through their own private Web portals to a dynamic presentation 
            of their actual visits (their paths results at quizzes and games, multimedia 
            creations). All of the subjects treated at the exhibition are presented, 
            along with additional information that was not available in the framework 
            of the exhibition. Examining this information requires the kind of studious 
            conditions that are available at home, in the office, or in the classroom, 
            but less so in the exhibition space. By moving an important part of 
            the relevant additional information to the Web context, the exhibition 
            can focus on prompting visitors to experiment and discover. This in 
            turn allows for more leeway when it comes to exhibit and scenic design. 
      </p>
      <p>On their portals, visitors gain access to the complete contents of 
            the exhibition, their interactions, and their quiz results compared 
            to the results of other visitors. They also find services and features 
            that are not available on the Cité des Sciences&#39;s public Web site, such 
            as Behind the Scenes, a photographic look into the &#34;making of&#34; 
        the exhibition, and an array of services for which they can sign up. 
        The fact that these private Web sites are accessible only to actual 
        visitors to the exhibition is capital because it allows visitors to 
        follow up on their visit experiences without disclosing exhibition contents 
        to internauts. In addition, private information that other visitors 
        cannot access can be saved on this site. </p>
      <h1>Results, Evaluation And Visit Data</h1>
      <h2>Different Implementation Strategies In The Exhibition</h2>
      <p>The Visite+ system can be used by exhibitions in three different ways: 
      </p>
            <ol>
          <li> as a simple accompaniment during the visit, informing the way content 
            is presented (language, disabilities, exhibits already accessed during 
            the visit, results recorded, etc.) </li>
          <li> 
             as a link between the actual visit and 
              the post-visit experience on the Web (the path is transmitted to the 
              Web site along with data saved during the visit) </li>
          <li> 
             as a private Web site accessible only 
              to visitors who actually come to the exhibition, but without visit 
              tracking during the exhibition. </li>
        </ol>
         
          <p>Four exhibitions using the Visite+ system and offering a visit/post-visit 
            connection on the Web were created. <b>The Innermost Brain</b> in 2002 
            offered registration and visit tracking along with the possibility of 
            following up the visit on a personal Web site. The entry ticket to the 
            exhibition was used as an identifier. The second exhibition, <b>That&#39;s 
            Canada, </b>which opened in December 2003, offered visit monitoring 
            and a Web site, but no visitor registration. Visits to this exhibition 
            required PDAs, distributed at the entrance to the exhibition; these 
            served to identify the visitors and record their paths .The third exhibition, 
            <b>Operation Carbon,</b> has cyberlogs created only for visitors who 
            insert their tickets into a dedicated-Visite+ point. Neither visit tracking 
            nor registration is provided. The most recent exhibition, <b>The population 
            of the world … and what about me ? </b>which opened on April 8, 
            2005, provides for the creation of a Web site associated to the visit. 
            The identifier used is a &#39;pass pop&#39;, a visit passport of sorts 
            dedicated to this exhibition, used to record visitor information that 
            the exhibition requires for use by individual exhibits and the cyberlog.</p>
          <p>The different Visite+ setups correspond to different strategies, and 
            result in different uses. To date, 104,000 personal Web sites tracking 
            visits have been created, and they have generated a total of 70,000 
            hits. </p>
          <p class="caption"><img src="topalian.fig5.jpg" width="362" height="269" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: 104,000 personal Web sites in 3 years"/></p>
          <p class="caption">Fig 3: 104,000 personal Web sites in 3 years</p>
          <p>We can see that many more Web sites were created when visit monitoring 
            was provided (The Innermost Brain in 2002 and That&#39;s Canada in 2003) 
            than when it was not (Operation Carbon in 2004). On the other hand, 
            the ratio between the number of cyberlogs created and the number accessed 
            is constantly increasing. This testifies to the growing interest of 
            visitors in these sites in particular and in Internet services in general.

          <h3>Qualitative Assessment Of <i>The Innermost Brain</i> Exhibition</h3>
          <p>The following evaluation of the Visite+ system at The Innermost Brain 
            exhibition was presented at the ICHIM meeting in 2003 at the Louvre 
          </p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">The Visite+ system used at the Innermost Brain exhibition 
            was the object of two studies, a detailed visitor survey by Emmanuelle 
            Gauzins, from the university research team, the Laboratoire Communication, 
            Culture et Society (C2SO) at the University École Normale Supérieure, 
            and a second more cursory evaluation for the Cité des Sciences&#39;s department 
            of evaluations and future planning. We cannot enter into the details 
            of the results here, but we think that three aspects are particularly 
            worthy of note.</p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">The first concerns identification difficulties in 
            a system that includes a whole set of objects (entry ticket, Visite+ 
            points, individual exhibits, associated website, subscription to the 
            visitor newsletter, email communication to visitor homes, etc.) 
            and extends over different periods in time (ticket purchase, entry to 
            the exhibition, at different moments during the course of the visit, 
            after the visit, etc.). The system is not a technological mechanism; 
            it is a multifold global proposal that is free and therefore invisible 
            for those whose attention will be drawn to offers by their conditions 
            of access. For the system to be identifiable, it needs to be announced 
            to visitors well ahead of their entry to the exhibition where it is 
            being tested They must be notified that, under the cover of the seemingly 
            commonplace bar code on their entry ticket, they are being offered access 
            to an innovative service. This can be done eventually by changing the 
            appearance of the ticket so that its new function becomes immediately 
            legible. </p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">The second concerns the functions that visitors 
            attribute to a system that they cannot totally apprehend since the survey 
            takes place in the exhibition. For this reason, we obtain more information 
            on anticipated functions than on actual use, which will require several 
            months before it can really be observed. </p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">Functions attributed to the system are related to 
            different visit styles that visitors will push along the lines of their 
            own reasoning. Some visitors look forward to renewing the visit experience, 
            in particular the sensations and impressions they had. Others, on the 
            contrary, expect to be able to retrieve the informative &#34;content&#34; 
            of the exhibition. These expectations designate and radicalize two dimensions 
            of the visit. </p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">The system is seen as lending itself to a more personal 
            relationship, in a private space, to the subject of the exhibition: 
            the possibility of sending home results on individual memory and perception 
            tests taken in the exhibition is immediately perceived and commented 
            [on].</p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">Finally, some visitors look forward to sharing what 
            they experienced in the exhibition in other social contexts (family, 
            classrooms, etc.). Such unforeseen expectations are among the type of 
            results that has nurtured for years the collaboration between design 
            and research in its search for new modalities of communication in museums. 
            <i>le Marec, J. &amp; R. Topalian (2003)</i></p>
          <p>The many innovations brought by the system to institutional communication 
            and the many resources provided to exhibition designers contribute to 
            the creation of new applications offered to visitors who sometimes make 
            use of the system in ways that its designers had not imagined. </p>

          <p>The visit to the <i>That&#39;s Canada</i> exhibition required a PDA. The

          <p>Visitors at the exhibition could take their pictures against a Canadian 
            background, access the photos on their personal cyberlogs, and use them 
            to make and send electronic postcards. This is a good example of how 
            the exhibition can be linked to the visitor Web site. We observed a 
            greater number of visits to <i>That&#39;s Canada</i> cyberlogs, no doubt 
            because they fulfilled their role as exhibition relays. </p>
          <p>Beyond questions of exhibition quality and features proposed on the 
            cyberlog, we consider taking photos in the exhibition an excellent means 
            of getting visitors to consult their visit cyberlogs. </p>

          <p>We offered a minimal version of Visite+ at this exhibition, without 
            visit tracking or transfer of actual visit data from the exhibition 
            to the Web. Access to the visit cyberlog was reserved to visitors who 
            manifested their presence at the exhibition by inserting their entry 
            ticket at a Visite+ registration point. The low number of registrations 
            is due to the lack of visit tracking and the low visibility of the two 
            registration points.</p>

          the visit, these settings generate personalized feedback at individual 
          exhibits, with respect to demographic statistics related to the visitor&#39;s

        on the Internet.</p>
      <h1>Visite+ Today</h1>
      <h2>A Permanent System At La Cité</h2>
      <p>Today, we regard the system installed at La Cité as permanent, and 
          available for any exhibition that would like to use it. The information 
          system has experienced no major failure. We have nevertheless implemented 
          a number of changes that enhance its simplicity in terms of both visit 
          tracking and Web site construction, and thus make it extremely cost-effective. 
      </p>
      <h2>Conservation Of Visitor Sites</h2>
      <p>We first thought of the cyberlogs as the part of the project that enabled 
          visitors to follow up on their visit from home and, to avoid having 
          to manage an excessively large database, we were planning to keeping 
          the Web sites for a month. It turned out that the 104,000 or so potential 
          Web sites and about as many visitors did not place significant demands 
          on our information system. We decided to broaden the initial cyberlog 
          concept and make it into a memory site providing an ongoing record of 
        visitors&#39; activities at the Cité des Sciences.</p>
      <p>For this purpose, we expanded the visitor portal to provide access 
        to all of the visitors&#39; cyberlogs.</p>
      <h2>A Flexible, Duplicable, And Marketable System</h2>
      <p>As a result of developments in languages and software derived from 
          open source technologies, we now have an architecture based on a Unix-compatible 
          operating system, which is written in Perl and Php and uses an Apache 
          server and MySQL database programming. It is a package that we can 
          offer to any museum that wishes to acquire it without having to deal 
        with high license costs. </p>
      <p>Because of the system&#39;s great simplicity, it can readily be installed 
          at the institution or at a host. Performance is not significantly different 
        in either case.</p>
      <p>To lower cyberlog production costs, we have developed a generator tool 
          that allows us to produce simple sites that satisfy 80% of functionalities, 
          while leaving the door open to specific extensions such as pursuing 
          a game started at the exhibition. Finding additional content for the 
          cyberlog is not difficult either since only a portion of the content 
          collected and considered during the development phase of the exhibition 
          is actually presented. Very little work is required to organize and 
        present this additional information on a visitor&#39;s cyberlog.</p>
      <h2>Benefits For Visitors</h2>
      <p>The Visite+ system allows visitors to follow up on their visits, share 
          them with others, or find out more at home or in classrooms; they can 
          consult their activities at the exhibition (photos, tests, etc.) and 
          keep an ongoing record of all their activities at different exhibitions 
          for future consultation. Teachers can visit the exhibition and use their 
        cyberlogs in class to prepare a visit with students.</p>
      <h2>Benefits For Institutions</h2>
      <p>The system enables institutions to propose new forms of mediation, 
          get to know their visitors better, enhance visitor loyalty, collect 
          information about visitor paths, and promote their exhibitions. Exhibition 
          attendance is also easy to calculate. For example, Figure 8 shows the 
          Visite+ results (in thousands of visits) for the duration of the <i>That&#39;s 
        Canada</i> exhibition. (This data can be viewed by day, week, or month.)</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="topalian.fig10.jpg" width="400" height="245" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: That&#39;s Canada on Dec. 13"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 8: That&#39;s Canada on Dec. 13</p>
      <p>Visite+ can also draw a diagram of visitor paths and enable us to see 
          the places where most visitors go and the paths or path segments that 
        are more commonly used.</p>
      <h1>Visite+ Tomorrow</h1>
      <p>The future includes pooling and sharing our experiences by creating 
          an exchange network among institutions and between each institution 
        and its cultural activities record</p>
      <h2>Creating A Network Of Institutions For Sharing Experiences</h2>
      <p>The studies we have conducted so far show that the implementation of 
          this system gives visitors the opportunity to invent novel applications 
          for it, notably relational (e.g. sharing their activities with friends 
          and family), and to formulate new expectations. To meet these, we would 
          like to broaden the network of cultural institutions proposing a personalized 
        approach like Visite+.</p>
      <p>Designing exhibitions that use a system of personalization and linking 
          visits with an associated Web site is a slow process that needs to be 
          continually evaluated and adapted. Each new exhibition is a new experience, 
          bringing its share of innovations, knowledge, and expertise. We think 
          that sharing our experiences in this area will be a strong plus in promoting 
          this museological concept based on a close relationship between institution 
          and visitor, and between the visit and post-visit experience. But we 
        do not think that merely disseminating this approach is enough.</p>
      <h2>A Common Platform For Visitors</h2>
      <p>We devised Visite+ to bring the relationship with the visitor into 
          a temporal continuity that encompasses both the personalized visit with 
          activities in the museum and the post-visit experience outside the exhibition 
          context. But we are persuaded that a truly visitor-dedicated approach 
          should provide the public with a record of their visits without being 
          dependent on one particular cultural institution. Such a personalization 
          approach, bringing together services around the visitor, will not really 
          make sense until the institutional logic of visitor appropriation gives 
          way to a truly user-based approach. We think that visitors have much 
          to gain from cultural institutions joining to create a common personalized 
          site dedicated to each visitor&#39;s cultural practices. By getting together 
          on a common platform with other museums interested in this approach, 
          we could effectively shift the focus from the individual institution 
          and what it has to offer to the individual visitor and his or her cultural 
        activities.</p>
      <p>The principle of Visite+ is to propose a post-visit Web portal dedicated 
          to exhibition visitors. This means that all offers will only concern 
          actual cultural institution visitors. We know that people who regularly 
          go to one cultural site will visit others. We also know that cultural 
          visit practices cover a wide range of cultural institutions (there is 
          no &#39;monomania&#39; in the choice of institutions). Finally, visit practices 
          are not confined to a single geographical area: people who visit museums 
          where they live also visit museums when they are on vacation in a different 
        region or country.</p>
      <h2>The Interest For Visitors</h2>
      <p>With a common Visite+ Web portal, users would be able to access records 
          of all of their visits to any of the partner institutions from the site 
          of any partner institution. So instead of going to different sites and 
          having to log in each time with a different identifier and password, 
          visitors would be provided with permanent access to all of their visits 
          from a single site that keeps an ongoing record of their paths in different 
        museums.</p>
      <h2>For Cultural Institutions</h2>
      <p>Cultural institutions could promote their exhibitions on this personal 
          visitor portal with links to their public Web sites. In this way, they 
          could reach a public made up of visitors to cultural institutions. They 
          would also benefit from synergies between museums (thematic links, access 
        to resources, etc.)</p>
      <h1>Next Steps</h1>
      <p>We propose the creation of a personal Web site (a cyberlog of the visit) 
          for all visitors, providing them with a record of their paths at the 
          exhibition, their results at activities (photos, quizzes, etc.), and 
          complete exhibition contents and complementary resources (documents, 
          dossiers, links, etc.). Visitors could access all of their visits on 
        a single portal. </p>
      <p>A common visitors Web portal can be easily and readily implemented 
          by sites using the Visite+ system, but we are interested in making all 
          sites accessible regardless of the system chosen. This requires defining 
          specifications for a common interface for our different systems (each 
          institution can have its own system of visit personalization) with all 
        the Internet links that will enable users to consult their visits.</p>
      <p>The aim is to free visitors from some of the spatial and temporal constraints 
          involved in museum visits, and to do so in a way that corresponds to 
          a number of clearly identified expectations and practices, such as preparing 
          visits; bringing some of the contents home to reduce the ephemeral, 
          accidental dimension of the visit; reliving, verifying, and sharing 
          the visit experience; and making full use of visits in classrooms for 
        teachers.</p>
