  <h1>Curating for Broadband</h1>
  <h2>Tilly Blyth, Science Museum, United Kingdom</h2>
  <p><a href="http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/</a></p>
        <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
        <p id="abstract">With the number of UK households and small businesses 
          adopting broadband now passing the 3 million mark, museums need to consider 
          the approaches they can use to present curator&#39;s expertise to new audiences 
          in engaging ways for broadband. Whilst these impressive statistics represent 
          a strong picture in the technological rollout of broadband, they do 
          not reveal the social innovation occurring through the development of 
          truly broadband sites. Too many Web sites claiming to be &#39;broadband&#39; 
          offer little more than video on the Web, and many fail to construct 
          sites that socially engage users in on-line activities. The paper will 
          argue that in order to create appealing broadband Web sites, producers 
          need to bring together the skills and quality of television production 
          with the active participation of the Web. In this way the creation of 
          broadband Web sites presents new opportunities for museums to deliver 
          public service values.</p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>In 2005 the UK 
    presents an interesting picture in the up-take and use of broadband. Broadband 
    use is proliferating rapidly, with the number of UK broadband connections passing the 5 million mark in September, 2004, 
    and the UK now overtaking Germany in terms of broadband penetration. Over a third of Internet households now have a broadband connection, 
    and according to the UK Telecoms regulator, there are around 50,000 new broadband 
    subscribers each week (Ofcom, 2004). But whilst technological roll-out and 
    diffusion is important, the real question surrounding broadband Internet use, 
    and specifically its role for museums, is how broadband may change the opportunity 
    for relationships with audiences, and whether in turn it requires new skills 
    for curators. </p>
  <h1>What Is Broadband For?</h1>
  <p>Whilst a large amount of industry research has focused on 
    market diffusion, very little has focused on what broadband is actually for 
    and on best-practice examples of how it is being used. Many sites that claim 
    to be &#39;broadband&#39; sites offer little more than the need for increased bandwidth 
    to reduce download times or archive television through the Web. UK Public 
    Service Broadcaster<strong> </strong>Channel Four&#39;s broadband service offers subscribers 
    the right to view on-line a very small selection of previously transmitted 
    television programmes, whilst the BT Yahoo broadband service offers little 
    more than a customisable homepage with streaming news channels, some movie 
    trailers and a few music videos.</p>
  <p>Some services, particularly for schools and universities, 
    have taken things a little further and offer unprecedented access to archives 
    and video based learning materials. The ARKive project (<a href="http://www.arkive.org/" target="_blank">http://www.arkive.org/</a>) 
    from the UK-based conservation charity The Wildscreen Trust presents a unique 
    international on-demand library of film, photographs and audio recordings 
    of the world&#39;s most endangered species. This emotive record brings together 
    a previously scattered collection documenting the world&#39;s wildlife. </p>
  <p>Similarly the Education Media Online (EMOL) service (<a href="http://www.emol.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.emol.ac.uk/</a>) 
    offers users in UK Higher and Further Education access to digitised collections 
    of historical film. The ability to download the films at high resolutions 
    allows film to be contextualised for use in learning resources and enables 
    users to edit video. Thus EMOL begins to blur the line between academics as 
    consumers of the material on the site and as media producers of their own 
    learning material. </p>
  <p>But broadband is capable of being more than just the provision 
    of television or film on the Web. Broadband offers the potential to place 
    some of the materials and techniques of television producers at the service 
    of modes of interactivity that extend well beyond anything offered by television. 
    Only by combining these abilities will broadband content fulfil its potential: 
    to combine the entertaining and sophisticated experiences of television with 
    the deep and immersive experiences of on-line community, participation and 
    choice.</p>
  <p>A recent report from the UK think tank Demos (Craig and Wilson, 2004) suggests that a transformation 
    in Web use is occurring, with the actions of broadband Internet users no longer 
    corresponding to the previously stereotypical ideas of solitary young men 
    each sitting in front of a computer. With the onset of broadband, the asymmetry 
    of content and users, where users passively receive and consume content, has 
    been overturned. The report suggests that 57% of broadband users have created 
    material to post on-line: material that they would not have contributed otherwise, 
    and 40% are more likely to get involved in organising local events through 
    the Internet. Broadband consumers should be viewed as active and social producers 
    who can develop new levels of cultural involvement and, the authors claim, 
    engagement in civic society. Unlike television watchers, broadband users are 
    apparently not prone to &#39;bowling alone&#39; (Putnam, 2002).</p>
  <p>It is not new to argue that the use of media, and in particular 
    the Web, is participative, not passive, and the dialogue surrounding it should 
    be of producers, not consumers (Heppell, 1995; Livingstone and Bober, 2004), 
    but with the rise of peer-to-peer music exchange systems and participative 
    encyclopaedias such as Wikipedia, the era where the Internet is a tool for 
    a nation of media producers has truly come. The growth of social networking 
    sites shows that the creation of personal support and on-line communities 
    is becoming increasingly important for the way we provide some forms of public 
    service. Two examples of such a shift in the UK are the BBC supported iCan 
    (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/ican/" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/ican/</a>), where users can gain information on campaigning 
    and form their own local or national networks to start a campaign on an issue 
    relevant to them, and Ultraversity, a wholly on-line degree course in action 
    research (<a href="http://www.ultraversity.net/" target="_blank">http://www.ultraversity.net/</a>) for people who are normally excluded 
    from education as they work full-time or are permanent caregivers.</p>
  <h1>Opportunities For Museums</h1>
  <p>By spring, 2004, 90% of all UK secondary schools had Internet 
    access of 2Mbps or more, and 28% of secondary schools had 8Mbps or more (DfES, 
    2004). The publicly supported Regional Broadband Consortia and forthcoming 
    National Educational Network will soon offer broadband links between home 
    and place of learning. This rapid take-up of publicly supported broadband 
    provision into schools and colleges, combined with consumer led diffusion 
    into the home, offers new opportunities for museums to provide improved public 
    service in the display and interpretation of history and culture. </p>
  <p>Museums have long been hybrids, playing a variety of significant 
    roles as collectors and preservers of material culture, as educators, and 
    as entertainers. The arguments for funding have been linked to these roles 
    and to the degree to which museums deliver value as educational institutions 
    or places of leisure activity. The distinctive proposition for museums now 
    is to try to build on this hybridity to develop stronger relationships with 
    visitors and increase both real and virtual visitor numbers. This isn&#39;t just 
    the need to bring more visitors through the door; it is also the need to deliver 
    an encounter - with a story, an idea, an object, a person - and provide the 
    opportunity for a broad public to invest in the cultural capital of the country. 
    Museums need to use all the tools available - technology, information, debate 
    - to excite, inspire and motivate the minds of their visitors and justify 
    the expense of public funding. Broadband provides one more way to reach these 
    audiences, but it also offers new opportunities for creating a participative 
    dialogue with an engaging experience. </p>
  <p>The rollout of broadband to support truly creative on-line 
    communities looking at culture is one way that museums can continue to bridge 
    the divide between leisure and learning. Broadband does not just offer a channel 
    through which to tell historical stories – a channel that can bring images, 
    animation, archive video and curator&#39;s knowledge directly into schools and 
    the home. It can also offer museum audiences the chance to participate in 
    active learning communities. Museums may call these broadband projects &#39;learning 
    journeys&#39; or &#39;entertaining experiences&#39; – either way they have the opportunity 
    to increase users&#39; ability to create dialogue and engage with our common cultural 
    heritage. Thus museum curators need to acknowledge and strengthen their skills 
    in creating the environment for debate and discussion. Curators can&#39;t afford 
    to perceive themselves only as academics and scholars; they also need to develop 
    the skills of storytellers, documentary film makers and facilitators of discussion.</p>
  <h1>The Experience Of MMW</h1>
  <p>In June, 2004, the Science 
    Museum launched a Web site <em>Making the Modern World Online</em> (<a href="http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk</a>) 
    aimed at students, teachers and more general audiences interested in the history 
    of science and technology. The site was developed around the museum&#39;s permanent 
    landmark gallery <em>Making the Modern World</em>. </p>
  <p>The gallery itself draws on over 100 of the Science Museum&#39;s 
    most remarkable objects; from Stephenson&#39;s <em>Rocket</em> and Babbage&#39;s <em>Difference 
    Engine No.1 </em>to Crick and Watson&#39;s DNA template and the Apollo 10 command 
    module, to display an amazing collection of &#39;firsts&#39; representing the most 
    important steps in science and invention. As visitors move through the gallery, 
    a timeline takes them through a chronological journey which employs the richness 
    of the museum&#39;s collections. In parallel to this &#39;iconic&#39; museum display, 
    the objects are contextualised. Nine historical themes run on one side, reflecting 
    our changing attitudes to science, technology and medicine. These range from 
    <em>Enlightenment and Measurement</em>, via <em>The Industrial Town</em> in the 
    mid nineteenth century, to <em>Defiant Modernism</em> a century later, and the 
    sequence ends with <em>The Age of Ambivalence</em> which explores our current 
    tentative relationship with science and its products. On the other side, five 
    displays illustrate the impact of technology on our everyday life to show 
    how scientific and technological knowledge has been used in work, play, for 
    health and forms of social control.</p>

        <p class="caption">Figure 1. Making the Modern World gallery at the Science 
          Museum</p>
  <p><em>Making the Modern World Online (MMW) </em>uses the same contextualising themes of the gallery to structure content 
    in the site. An interactive timeline allows the user to access over twenty 
    curatorial stories and nine historical themes from the eighteenth century 
    to today to explain the development and the global spread of the modern industrial 
    society. </p>
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a><img src="blythFig02.jpg" width="400" height="312" alt="Screen Shot: Homepage of Making the Modern World" border="0"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 2. Homepage of Making the Modern World on−line.(<a href="http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk</a>)</p>
        <p>The site was funded by the British Treasury and Cabinet 
    Office&#39;s &#39;Invest to Save&#39; (ISB) initiative which aims to create sustainable 
    improvements in the capacity to deliver public services. ISB initiatives bring 
    together two or more public service bodies in an innovative way to improve 
    services or to reduce costs. Through <em>Making the Modern World</em> it brought 
    us (the Science Museum) together with a specialist school (Peter 
    Symonds College, Winchester) to show how on-line learning materials could be created to increase 
    access to and interest in science and history education. As well as aiming 
    to increase participation in the cultural and heritage sectors, the project 
    tested whether two institutions reliant on public funding from different government 
    departments (Education; Culture) could work together in a specific area to 
    create improvements in service delivery.</p>
  <p>From the outset the Web site was created to increase the 
    understanding of history and artefacts through contextualisation using a range 
    of multimedia techniques. Curators were asked to extrapolate from the iconic 
    objects displayed in the gallery to develop rich and detailed stories for 
    the &#39;Stories Timeline&#39; part of the site. These stories were placed in an interactive 
    timeline corresponding to the same themes as those used in the gallery.</p>
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig3" id="Fig3"></a><img src="blythFig03.jpg" width="400" height="382" alt="Screen Shot: Timeline" border="0"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 3. Stories Timeline on Making the Modern World. (<a href="http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/stories/" target="_blank">http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/stories/</a>)</p>
  <p>Although the main part of the rich media was developed for 
    the &#39;Stories&#39; section of the site, four other areas were developed: Icons 
    of Invention, Technology of Everyday Life, Guided Tours and Learning Modules. 
    The &#39;Icons&#39; section represents 116 most prized treasures in the Science Museum&#39;s 
    collections, from 1750 to the current day. The &#39;Everyday Life&#39; section looks 
    at how the objects of invention and methods of technological production are 
    woven into our daily lives at home, at work or at play. With over 400 objects, 
    the site represents a serious look at how science and technology connect to 
    ordinary people. The &#39;Guided Tours&#39; draw connections across time to bring 
    together the people, scenes, icons and objects relevant to particular themes. 
    These were particularly focused on engaging the socially excluded. For instance, 
    one looks at the part played by women in science and technology, whilst another 
    demonstrates the role of specific technologies as tools for the employment 
    and integration of successive immigrant communities. The &#39;Learning Modules&#39; 
    were developed by teachers at Peter Symonds College. The curators and teachers worked together to identify areas where 
    the gallery content overlaps with the learning objectives of the 16+ &#39;A&#39; and 
    &#39;AS&#39; level curricula for history and the sciences.</p>
  <p>In the creation of the content, curators were asked not 
    to think about the production of text, but to focus their knowledge on the 
    most compelling stories that would allow them to bring in the images, video, 
    trade literature and archives that were available on the topics they were 
    developing. In this way they used their understanding of the museum&#39;s picture 
    and library collections – not just artefacts – and translated them into an 
    explorative learning journey about the object, its invention, its social and 
    cultural significance, and how it worked. </p>
  <p>Each story was developed in modular form comprised of a 
    number of &#39;scenes&#39;. The team developed a variety of distinct scene types defined 
    by their mode of interaction with the user and the assets involved: </p>
        <p class="list"></p>
<ul><li>text and image, </li>
  <li>interactive maps, </li>
  <li>technical deconstructions,</li>
  <li>montage,</li>
  <li>mini-documentary,</li>
  <li>dramatic reconstruction.</li></ul>
  <p>The techniques used in this variety of scene formats brought 
    together information, navigation and narrative devices to represent the historical 
    world. Whilst some techniques, such as the animation or layering of a map 
    or the graphical breakdown of how a technical device works, are not unique 
    to this site, others were intended to be much more innovative. In the case 
    of dramatic reconstructions, curators selected extracts from archive letters 
    or speeches and worked with the production team to develop scripts recorded 
    by actors. These &#39;audio dramas&#39; were illustrated using original images from 
    the archives and multimedia devices to bring history alive. The development 
    of a small number of richly featured &#39;Mini-documentaries&#39;, offering the users 
    either a television style linear narrative or a branching exploratory structure, 
    allows the audience to choose how (and how deeply) to explore events and issues 
    as varied as the development of the German V2 Rocket Weapon, the impact of 
    the Cold War on the space race, the Rainhill trials to examine how to power 
    the first locomotives, the development of personal computing, and the rise 
    of environmentalism from Rachel Carson to Greenpeace.</p>
  <p>By considering the assets and the storytelling devices available 
    to them, curators developed compelling content with a modular structure. They 
    worked closely with a team from the interactive design agency SAS (<a href="http://www.sasdesign.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.sasdesign.co.uk/</a>) to identify the best approach with the narrative and assets available. 
    SAS brought knowledge of the latest technical competencies and high production 
    values to the content, to ensure that the presentation of curators&#39; knowledge 
    was impressive and innovative. </p>
  <p>In this way curators and interactive developers created 
    the content that allows users each to undertake a personal &#39;learning journey&#39; 
    – an individual but contextual story about an object, a period or area of 
    technology, one created through individual navigation of the site. For instance, 
    if you first come to the site to investigate James Watt, you will find many 
    more perspectives than just a biography about the &#39;great engineer&#39;. You get 
    a complete story of his life and inventions, including an audiovisual reconstruction 
    of his &#39;eureka moment&#39; when he thought through the mechanism for creating 
    a separate condenser. This is recreated using an actor reading Watt&#39;s own 
    words together with images from our archive. The user can also find a complete 
    animated reconstruction of the Watt engine and explore how it worked as well 
    as what its impact on society was. The user can then transfer this knowledge 
    to the museum artefact, to look at the object within the museum culture. </p>
        <p>Evaluation conducted during the development and after the launch of 
          the site has shown that users enjoy being able to choose to go deeper 
          into a subject if they find it interesting. Also, the use of images, 
          video and audio to break up the text into manageable chunks encourages 
          them to read on. By combining archive, speech, image sequences and editing 
          techniques with dynamic multimedia, the site offers an audience experience 
          far beyond that possible in the static exhibition. Most of all, users 
          loved the &#39;rich media&#39; parts of the site. They perceived these to be 
          modern, interesting and fun, whilst being <em>&#34;a really good way 
          of packaging information.&#34;</em> About one-quarter of users specifically 
          mentioned liking the videos and rich media and would generally spend 
          more time watching these compared to reading text. Users&#39; session times 
          increase dramatically when they come across the rich media parts of 
          the site, and often users exclaimed that they would like to see far 
          more of the site approached in this way.</p>
  <p><em>Making the Modern World Online</em> creates a dynamic and deep environment by using many of the storytelling 
    techniques of television and film to create an engaging user experience. Although 
    the site did not develop any community tools or contain any participatory 
    elements, its construction did enable the Science 
    Museum to go some of the way in identifying what a good broadband site is, 
    what it isn&#39;t, and what it could be.</p>
  <h1>What Broadband Is (And Isn&#39;t)</h1>
  <p>A truly broadband site is certainly not the Internet with 
    video, even though ISP&#39;s and broadcasters seem currently to think so. Certainly 
    very few sites move beyond this. What we need to do is to learn from television 
    rather than re-playing it. MMW has shown us that broadband museum content 
    will be far more meaningful and accessible to the audience if we can apply 
    some of the tools and techniques of television and documentary film-making 
    to tell stories. A broadband historical and cultural site of this type can 
    be thought of as a &#39;deconstructed documentary&#39;, where instead of being told 
    a single linear narrative, users are encouraged to take their own non-linear 
    paths to understand how an expert may have reached the conclusion presented. 
    Issues where debate resides emerge more naturally.</p>
  <p>Broadband sites such as the National Theatre&#39;s <em>Stagework</em> 
    (<a href="http://www.stagework.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.stagework.org.uk/</a>) provide an interesting step in the right direction. 
    Audiences are invited to go behind the scenes and rehearsals to understand 
    the complex process of making theatre performances for the general theatre-goer, 
    the life-long learner and curricular audiences. Yet even innovative sites 
    like this that offer rich media as a way of deconstructing a production don&#39;t 
    offer the chance for on-line contribution or participation. The learning model 
    is moving closer to one of communication rather than dissemination, yet the 
    on-line tools for participation are still not included.</p>
  <p>But perhaps this is the way forward for broadband museum 
    content: to go beyond the television &#39;broadcast model&#39; and use these interactive 
    stories to develop participative communities with our audiences.</p>
  <p>Future broadband sites should consider how communities have 
    effectively been developed in narrowband sites, and how to apply some of these 
    techniques to sites with the high production values of rich media. For many 
    narrowband sites this has been through the creation of symmetry, where individuals 
    can submit ideas and in some cases media to stimulate discussion. This simple 
    approach to discourse and dialogue could be combined with broadband rich-media 
    entertainment to present a very powerful way of engaging new audiences and 
    connecting them to our national cultures. </p>
  <p>Imagine a part of <em>Making the Modern World Online</em> 
    where audiences can contribute their own story about the day a V2 bomb dropped 
    on their family house in London, or the contribution of real stories by people 
    who travelled to Britain in the 1960s from the Caribbean to work as part of 
    the London Transport workforce. This type of rich narrative – whether video, 
    images or text - would add a level of depth and interest that isn&#39;t possible 
    without contributions from a broad audience. Alternatively, users could develop 
    their own &#39;Guided Tours&#39;, stitching together scenes, media and images from 
    the site using their own narrative links, or creating new meanings and content 
    from the published assets.</p>
  <p>Developing broadband sites in this way would also necessarily 
    involve museums re-stating some core-values – to make collections accessible 
    through a variety of approaches and bring (real and virtual) visitors into 
    contact with some of the most important stories and icons of technology in 
    our culture. I am not advocating that broadband sites become a way of developing 
    yet more edutainment through the use of televisual techniques, but that they 
    present one way of reaffirming that museums are cultural centres of expertise 
    which – in the Science Museum&#39;s case - act to stimulate understanding and 
    engagement in innovation, science and society.</p>
  <h1>Where Does That Leave Museum Skills?</h1>
  <p>To argue that curators should view themselves as storytellers 
    and teachers as well as scholars is not to suggest that the traditional skills 
    of museums are out-moded. Far from it. Curators have always had to develop 
    strong skills in interpretation to a variety of audiences, and museums&#39; collections 
    have always been viewed as resources to be used by students, scholars and 
    amateurs alike. But curators will now need to form new collaborative teams 
    where their skills as story makers and documentary Web creators can be enhanced 
    by interactive producers and community facilitators. Curators need to think 
    structurally and visually about the form of their narrative whilst maintaining 
    a focus on the variety of stories surrounding a museum artefact. They must 
    be prepared to open up debate and offer their tools for discussion to others, 
    so that they not only act as authoritative voices but also act to stimulate 
    understanding and engagement in the context of the &#39;real&#39; object. It is their 
    role to inspire informal learning by encouraging interest in and knowledge 
    of arts, science, technology and history through accessible content.</p>
  <h1>Public Service Through Broadband</h1>
  <p>This paper has argued that broadband presents new opportunities 
    for museums to deliver high quality content with impressive interactive production 
    values directly into schools and the home. In order to be successful, this 
    must not just be the development of rich media content that uses many of the 
    techniques of television, but the creation of broadband channels for discussion 
    of, and participation in, history and culture. In this way museums can play 
    important roles in creating active learning communities and delivering public 
    value to all sections of society.</p>
  <p>Rich media content should provide new experiences and enjoyment 
    for users, and also draw audiences to a site, but the presentation of information 
    and the Web site experience should move beyond linear documentary to the creation 
    of tools for community debate and conversation. Increasingly, users expect 
    to create and post on-line content. This desire for communication and discussion 
    should be harnessed to increase knowledge and participation in cultural content.</p>
  <p>For a country like Britain, where Public Service Broadcasters 
    occupy a central place in cultural life, the erosion of audience figures for 
    previously dominant terrestrial television channels causes some alarm. As 
    digital TV channels proliferate and the viewing shares of each channel nosedive 
    dramatically, digital platforms such as broadband Internet are one way of 
    filling the public service gap. Museums and other cultural institutions should 
    seize the opportunity to prove their public value and ability to fulfil their 
    public service remit. Content developed for a broadband service today may 
    well have a larger audience and more impact than that developed for a digital 
    television channel tomorrow. In the future we can make no assumptions about 
    the &#39;primary&#39; channels to audiences. Only recently the UK regulator Ofcom 
    proposed a new type of institution, a Public Service Publisher, that might 
    commission broadband content from cultural institutions and other social groups 
    to ensure that public service values evolve in the broadband age. This PSP 
    may never be created, but the suggestion shows that at the regulatory and 
    policy level there is acknowledgement of the role museums could play.</p>
  <p>Broadband presents museums with the chance to show that 
    we can be a nation of producers of cultural content, not just consumers, and 
    that museums have important roles to play in exciting, inspiring and motivating 
    a variety of audiences to get informed and involved. Museums must make sure 
    they are channels through which cultural assets are used, distributed and 
    re-produced, so that they disseminate, inform and reflect our diverse cultural 
    heritage.</p>
