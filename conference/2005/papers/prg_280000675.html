        <h1>Using Museum Web Sites to Change Visitors&#39; Real-World Behaviour</h1>
        <h2>Brad Larson, Brad Larson Media, Inc., Paula Sincero, InquiryLearn, 
          USA</h2>
        <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">It is a trend among museums to not 
          only encourage understanding or appreciation of exhibit content but 
          also encourage behavioural change among visitors after their exhibit 
          experience. Exhibits focusing on wildlife and habitat conservation, 
          nutrition and health, advocacy, and family learning/literacy all hinge 
          on making a change in the visitors&#39; behaviour after they leave the museum. 
          Yet there is surprisingly little research about how often museum exhibits, 
          much less museum Web sites, actually lead to changes in visitor behaviour.</p>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">To promote further discussion and 
          research in the field, we review some of the challenges and promising 
          examples in the museum field. We also review some of the considerations 
          that went into the development of Conservation Central, selected <em>Best</em><em> 
          </em><em>Museum</em><em> Web site</em> at Museums and the Web 2004, 
          which we developed for Smithsonian&#39;s National Zoo. We conclude by proposing 
          a set of Web site guidelines that include goals for encouraging behavioural 
          change among visitors.</p>
        <p class="keywords" id="keywords">Keywords: visitor behaviour, post-visit, 
          Conservation Central, visitor learning, zoos, aquariums, action plan, 
          family learning, national learning standards, inquiry-based</p>
        <h1>Focusing on Visitor Behaviour</h1>
        <p>As in exhibit development itself, goals for museum exhibit Web sites 
          often start with idealistic and generalized goals to increase visitor 
          understanding and appreciation of exhibits. <em>But, after the momentary 
          interactive session, do visitors do anything differently in their daily 
          lives?</em></p>
        <p>For decades, this question has been central to visitor-oriented museums 
          such as children&#39;s museums, whose goal is often to advocate for visitor 
          well-being and family learning. The question is also increasingly central 
          to zoos and aquariums, wildlife conservation organizations, and nature 
          centers that focus intently on broadening their message to include habitat 
          conservation and appreciating the global impacts of visitors&#39; local 
          choices. Health museums, advocating for healthful long-term changes 
          in visitor behaviour, are increasingly looking for engaging ways to 
          integrate these changes into visitors&#39; daily routines. To these institutions, 
          visitors&#39; post-visit behaviour is central to the fulfilment of their 
          mission, and yet it has tended to be more of an optimistic wish rather 
          than a designed-for outcome.</p>
        <p>Because the museum Web site is often the primary vehicle by which visitors 
          may follow-up on their visit, we suggest the following simple rule: 
        </p>
        <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">An exhibit Web site should actively support 
          at least three hours of activity done away from the computer in the 
          real world. </p>
        <p>While the number of hours is admittedly an arbitrary figure, it is 
          helpful to have a specific yardstick by which to measure effectiveness, 
          and time spent away from the computer on a specific behaviour is a helpful 
          and widely transferrable guideline. Examples of these kinds of activities 
          may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sketching a remarkable tree in a local park</li>
        <li>Monitoring life at a local vernal pool</li>
        <li>Replacing light bulbs with energy-saving light bulbs</li>
        <li> 
           Reading together as a family every night 
            before bedtime</li>
        <li> 
           Signing up for an ongoing course on healthful 
            eating</li>
        <li> 
           Taking action steps that culminate in 
            a school-wide action plan</li>
        <li> 
           Making an ongoing family conservation 
            action plan </li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>In the museum world, there are a few notable examples of behavioural 
          changes that were designed and mediated through Web and e-mail technology. 
          The Phoenix Family Museum, for example, used its members&#39; e-mail list 
          to encourage members to create handmade yard-signs in support of a local 
          bond issue (Van der Veen, 2001). The Monterey Bay Aquarium provided 
          convenient <em>Seafood Watch</em> pocket cards in its exhibit (and on 
          its Web site) to help visitors decide which varieties of fish are harvested 
          sustainably and are the safest to eat, thus encouraging visitors/consumers 
          to examine and potentially change their post-visit behaviour (Yalowitz, 
          2004, Korn, 2003). </p>
        <h1>The Challenges to Changing Visitor Behaviour</h1>
        <p>We should acknowledge that changing visitor behaviour in the real world 
          away from the computer faces significant challenges. In a busy world, 
          visitors are confronted with thousands of competing messages in the 
          course of a day, many for the purpose of commerce. Corporations and 
          organizations invest significant amounts of time and money developing 
          often elaborate and seductive mechanisms to support behavioural change, 
          from courting and keeping customers, to educational programs on smoking 
          cessation, to convincing you why you absolutely must bleach your teeth 
          to have a winning smile.</p>
        <p>In the museum field, there are some quite specific challenges.</p>
        <h2>Short Time Period For Intervention</h2>
        <p>A museum visit itself may occur in the space of an hour and a half 
          to three hours, and a visit to a museum Web site may often span from 
          less than a minute to ten or fifteen minutes. From the learning perspective, 
          the expectation that long-term learning and behavioural change will 
          occur after a ten-minute visit is unrealistic.</p>
        <h2>Unfocused Design Goals</h2>
        <p>Usually, we in the exhibit and Web design field are not accustomed 
          to designing for behavioural change. Often, our goals are to &#39;increase 
          understanding and appreciation&#39; of the topic, without consideration 
          of tools that visitors can use to take the next steps. In the instructional 
          design field, one of the early design steps is to do a <em>task analysis</em>, 
          breaking a learning goal down into its subset components, and then analyzing 
          any prerequisite skills or conditions needed to achieve the goal (Gagne, 
          1985). For example, before installing an energy-saving light bulb, the 
          user would need to know where to purchase it, the wattage to get, and 
          that the savings over years will more than compensate for the more expensive 
          up-front purchase price. We need to quickly convince visitors that <em>it 
          makes sense to make this change.</em> We also need to make the purchase 
          easy -  with a simple click on a link, or by getting an e-mail reminder 
          &#39;shopping list&#39; for the next time they visit their local hardware 
          store.</p>
        <h2>Lack Of Awareness Of Web Site</h2>
        <p>The visitor who doesn&#39;t know about a Web site will not spend time engaging 
          in it. There are both technical and non-technical approaches to overcoming 
          this challenge, including e-mail reminders and mention of the Web activity 
          in member newsletters, etc., as well as mention of the Web resources 
          within in-house programs and events.</p>
        <h2>Inertia Between Time And Place</h2>
        <p> Transferring a learning goal from one location (an exhibit or Web 
          site on habitat conservation, for example) to a response in another 
          location (an activity in a local woodland) is a significant challenge 
          in a hustle-bustle world. If the message doesn&#39;t appear at the right 
          time and place (at the breakfast table on Saturday morning before plans 
          are made), it will most likely be lost. Fogg (2003) notes the ancient 
          Greek principle of <em>kairos</em> - finding the <em>favorable moment</em> 
          - to suggest a change in behaviour. In addition, other researchers have 
          noted the potential of portable devices such as PDAs (Semper and Spasojevic, 
          2002) and &#39;ubiquitous computing&#39; (Intille, 2002) to reach people 
          at the right time and place.</p>
        <h1><em>Conservation Central</em>: Example Web site</h1>
        <p><em>Conservation Central</em> is a Web site we developed that includes 
          real-world behavioural goals. Initially, our primary goal in developing 
          Conservation Central with colleagues at Friends of the National Zoo/Smithsonian&#39;s 
          National Zoo was to focus visitors&#39; attention beyond the immediate appeal 
          of the enormously popular giant pandas at the Zoo, to the temperate 
          forest habitat on which they depend. The approach is to use the popularity 
          of this &#39;umbrella species&#39; to draw attention to the conservation 
          of this species and its habitat (Lumpkin and Seidensticker, 2002) and 
          the valuable ecosystem services that forests provide. We also knew it 
          was key to make local habitat connections, that temperate forest are 
          also in our own backyards, thus linking North America and Asia. We focused 
          on carrying a message of conserving biodiversity and finding balance 
          between the needs of people and pandas to the Web sites&#39; two major audiences: 
          families (at home), and middle school science and social studies teachers 
          and students.</p>
        <p>As we developed plans, we felt that simply understanding the message 
          wouldn&#39;t be enough to create a successful Web site. A conservation Web 
          site implicitly includes a desire to increase conservation <em>behaviour</em> 
          among Web site users. So we included in design plans specific ways that 
          users at home and in the classroom could follow up, away from the computer, 
          on steps that could foster habitat conservation locally, nationally 
          and globally. We list below some of the key features that encourage 
          these behaviours through Conservation Central.</p>
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a><img src="larson.fig1.jpg" width="400" height="239" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Design a Panda Habitat"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 1: Design a Panda Habitat is lead-in activity designed 
          to motivate exploration. <a target="_blank" href="http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Education/ConservationCentral/design/">http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Education/ConservationCentral/design/</a></p>
        <h2>Structuring the Site for Motivation</h2>
        <p>Our goal was to develop a structure to the overall Web site that would 
          lead users from a path of immediate engagement in the initial activity 
          to more in-depth exploration and, finally, to behavioural change in 
          the real world. Our assumption was that before users would engage in 
          the real-world behavioural activities, we would need to get their attention, 
          and their delight, with an activity that would generate enthusiasm for 
          further exploration of the site.</p>
        <p><em>Design a Panda Habitat </em>thus became the first activity at the 
          top of the page. Users can create a new giant panda habitat at the Zoo 
          by dragging objects such as <em>Climbing Trees</em> and enrichment objects 
          such as <em>Fruitcicles</em> into the habitat. If the user includes 
          a variety of objects from all categories, the two giant pandas walk 
          out into the habitat on &#39;Opening Day&#39; and interact with the objects 
          users placed. This five-to-ten minute activity did indeed turn out to 
          be highly appealing to visitors, and led them down a path of increased 
          exploration time in <em>Habitat Adventure: Panda Challenge,</em> and 
          opportunity for greater depth and hands-on, post-visit behavioural activity 
          in <em>A Walk in the Forest</em> and <em>Family Learning Activities</em>, 
          and <em>Finding Common Ground,</em> the downloadable curriculum.</p>
        <p>This principle of leading with a highly-engaging activity is of course 
          not new. In fact, in the world of theme park design, Walt Disney himself 
          spoke of designing his park using visually appealing structures within 
          a visitor&#39;s sight-range to motivate movement in that direction (McLean, 
          1993). Today, the new field of <em>captology</em> developed by Fogg 
          (2003) describes some of the ways computers may influence people through 
          intentional design strategies, and also speaks of the importance of 
          engaging the user from the start.</p>

        <p class="caption">Fig 2: A Walk in the Forest introduces real-world tools 
          used by Smithsonian scientists. <a target="_blank" href="http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Education/ConservationCentral/walk/">http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Education/ConservationCentral/walk/</a></p>
        <h2>Designing for Teacher and Student Engagement </h2>
        <p><em>Finding Common Ground,</em> the print and downloadable PDF inquiry-based 
          curriculum, provides the instructional framework for teachers who would 
          like to integrate the on-line interactives in their classrooms. It also 
          provides another possible avenue to arrive at the Web site. Hands-on, 
          real-world curriculum activities in each module provide action steps 
          that may be integrated into the culminating activity of a class conservation 
          action plan. The goal here is to have students reflect on what they 
          have already done (action steps in each module), making the final action 
          plan much more manageable by being broken into focused action steps. 
        </p>
        <p>For easy use by busy teachers, we also aligned all activities with 
          both science and social studies national learning standards, helping 
          to create opportunities for team teaching and school-wide learning. 
          To encourage creative and critical thinking, we provided more in-depth 
          content that teachers could use with their students, encouraging them 
          to become &#39;experts&#39; on a subject and to make well-informed choices.</p>
        <p><em>A Walk in the Forest</em>, a series of six Flash interactives, 
          engages visitors with authentic tools and scientific methodologies used 
          by Smithsonian scientists to monitor the biodiversity of a virtual Virginia 
          forest (designed after a real Virginia forest), and then to use these 
          same tools and methodologies in a local woodland.  Multi-age <em>Family 
          Learning Activities</em> provide a thematic link to the curriculum activities, 
          reinforcing the skills and concepts in an outdoor learning environment. 
          One of the family learning activities, <em>Family Conservation Action 
          Plan,</em> builds connections between school and home by providing a 
          simple printout that students can take home, supporting behaviour change 
          at home and school.  </p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="larson.fig3.jpg" width="400" height="294" border="0" alt="Family Learning Activities"/> 
        </p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 3: Family Learning Activities promote behaviour 
          change away from the computer. <a target="_blank" href="http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Education/ConservationCentral/family/">http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Education/ConservationCentral/family/</a></p>
        <h2>Designing for Family Learning </h2>
        <p>In the children&#39;s museum world, <em>family learning theory</em> as 
          described by Borun (1998), Dierking (1989) and others has provided an 
          enormously popular approach to exhibit design. Social interaction between 
          visitors is central to learning, according to family learning theory. 
          And, to be specific, conversations between visitors are the key measure 
          of whether an exhibit is encouraging learning (Borun, 1998).</p>
        <p>One of our central goals was to extend this approach from the museum 
          exhibit environment to the home computer environment. For each activity, 
          we asked ourselves: How would a parent and child interact if they sat 
          down together? Would they talk about what they are doing, or just click 
          through it? Are there opportunities to connect the topic to their own 
          lives? These questions informed the pace of text bubbles and availability 
          of narration used in animated sections of the Web site.</p>
        <p>One of the surprises that became apparent as we developed this relatively 
          high-tech site was the power of a simple and attractive one-page printout, 
          the format we selected for the <em>Family Learning Activities</em>. 
          A one-page PDF printout becomes the bridge from the computer to the 
          real world, making it easy to post the activity up on the refrigerator 
          until the visitor is ready to head outdoors. In addition, a materials 
          list and step-by-step procedures make the activity simpler and more 
          compelling. In the classroom, we designed one-page student action sheets 
          so students could easily add them to their <em>Action Plan Portfolios</em> 
          or <em>Habitat Journals.</em></p>
        <h1>Guidelines for Encouraging Behavioural Change</h1>
        <p>In the course of developing Conservation Central, we focused increasingly 
          on promoting behavioural change among users. While acknowledging the 
          difficulty of reaching into the visitors&#39; lives and promoting a behaviour 
          that occurs away from the computer, we feel that the following guidelines 
          provide a good start to developing Web sites that go beyond promoting 
          simple understanding of the exhibit topic.</p>
        <h2><strong> Guidelines for Behavioural Change</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Include at least three hours of specific 
            real-world behaviours in design plans</li>
        <li>
           Create a moving experience that appeals 
            to both the visitor&#39;s emotions and common sense</li>
        <li>Analyze prerequisite skills and tools needed</li>
        <li>
           Provide simple ways to make immediate 
            changes with observable outcomes</li>
        <li>Lead in with a highly-engaging activity</li>
        <li>
           Provide options for PDF printouts</li>
        <li>Market the Web site activities</li>
        <li>
           Include provisions for measuring feedback</li>
      </ul>
      
        <h2>Include at least three hours of specific real-world behaviours in design 
          plans</h2>
        <p>The most basic starting point is simply to ask, &#39;What does the 
          visitor <em>do</em>, away from the computer, as a result of this program?&#39; 
          It is helpful to visualize the user at home or in school, and imagine 
          the process of going from the computer to the real-world activity. Because 
          long-term learning is something that takes more than a few minutes to 
          encourage, it is important in our view that a Web site encourage at 
          least three hours of real-world activity. Ideally the learning could 
          occur over the course of several weeks, including activities such as 
          keeping a nature journal or joining an ongoing program at the Museum. 
          It is also important that it not be cumbersome for the visitor to change 
          his or her behaviour and that the outcome of the change provide concrete 
          value (dollars saved, pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions saved, etc.) 
          and social/psychological rewards (feeling good, doing your part, making 
          a difference).</p>
        <h2>Create a moving experience that appeals to both visitors&#39; emotions 
          and their common sense </h2>
        <p>Emotional memory is powerful and enduring. Research has shown that 
          providing a variety of sensory experiences increases the chances of 
          memory retention. Experiences such as looking at baby animals that increase 
          oxytocin levels (sometimes called the <em>cuddling</em> or <em>social 
          contact</em> hormone) can elicit care and empathy behaviour. This may 
          be an opportune time to introduce a choice behaviour that may help protect 
          an endangered species that is widely considered &#39;charismatic, adorable 
          and cuddly&#39;.  Zoos understand that, in addition to species conservation, 
          the birth of a baby panda, for example, increases visitors&#39; awareness/caring, 
          and that  may translate into both increased donations and behaviour 
          change. We can reward and reinforce choice behaviour by showing financial 
          and social/emotional rewards.</p>
        <h2>Analyze prerequisite skills and tools needed</h2>
        <p>It is easy to simply suggest activities such as &#39;visit a local 
          farm stand and buy local, organic produce.&#39; But in practice, with the 
          buzz of messages that constantly surround visitors, the suggestion is 
          unlikely to make a lasting impression unless the behavioural steps seem 
          easy and attractive. Where are the local farm stands? (Is there a Web 
          site that lists them by state and town?) How do I get there without 
          much fuss? (A map) What&#39;s so much fun about buying local potatoes?  
          (A local harvest menu to customize and print out) Why should I spend 
          the extra money to buy organic produce? (Health benefits of not eating 
          pesticides, less negative impact on land) The more specific we can be 
          about the users&#39; skills and motivation, the more likely we will be to 
          change their behaviour, especially if this change has positive social 
          rewards.</p>
        <h2>Provide simple ways to make immediate changes with observable outcomes</h2>
        <p>Providing simple changes people can make in daily life, such as replacing 
          one light bulb with an energy-saving light bulb, empowers visitors by 
          making a large-scale, seemingly overwhelming problem manageable. The 
          combined synergy of everyone doing something, large or small, has a 
          measurable financial and energy-saving impact as well as a positive 
          social/psychological impact on consumers who are motivated to make a 
          change. Providing ways for visitors to become involved in a limited 
          time commitment activity is another good way to introduce a choice behaviour. 
          After visitors see the positive results, they are more likely to make 
          the change  a habit.</p>
        <h2>Lead in with a highly-engaging activity</h2>
        <p>Because of the competition for users&#39; attention in daily life, it is 
          essential to capture their interest from the start. The lead activity 
          is a good place to spend more on the animation budget, and to focus 
          on multi-outcome games and activities that will attract repeat visits. 
          In the case of family-oriented exhibits, it is also the place to encourage 
          parent/child collaboration, since it is the parent who can more readily 
          set the course for real-world follow-up, such as visits to the local 
          zoo or a walk in the local park.</p>
        <h2>Provide options for PDF printouts</h2>
        <p>Given the lack of universally available PDAs or cell phones, in our 
          view the best link to the real world from the computer is often a PDF 
          printout. PDF documents have an <em>affordance</em> that naturally suggests 
          &#39;print me.&#39; And documents to print, if cleverly designed like 
          the Monterey Bay Aquarium&#39;s <em>Seafood Watch</em> pocket card, are 
          the best link to being in the right place at the right time to change 
          users&#39; behaviour. The success of the PDF lies in the creative spark 
          it may foster (example: attractive name cards for the dinner table with 
          healthful eating suggestions), and the step-by-step resources that make 
          the behaviour seem doable, compelling, and <em>worth</em> doing.</p>
        <h2>Market the Web site activities</h2>
        <p>Visitors won&#39;t engage in Web site activities if they don&#39;t know about 
          them. In the case of <em>Conservation Central</em>, we&#39;ve been fortunate 
          that it has received recognition from a number of museum groups, including 
          AAM (Silver Muse Award in science), Museums and the Web 2004 (Best Museum 
          Web site), and National Association of Interpreters (1<sup>st</sup> 
          Place, multimedia category). Each award presents new opportunities to 
          generate publicity about the site, both through e-mails to Zoo members 
          and in paper-based newsletters, newspapers, and journals targeted to 
          families and teachers. E-mail reminders and <em>action</em> <em>alerts</em> 
          sent to museum members at times when the content is particularly relevant 
          (such as the birth of an animal) may provide the momentum for visitors 
          to change their plans or behaviour, encouraging activities such as reading 
          with their child about animal births.</p>
        <h2>Include provisions for measuring feedback</h2>
        <p>As developers, it motivates our creative design process to know that 
          the museum will take specific measurements of the success of an activity. 
          Simple measures may include a record of downloads of a particular PDF 
          or visits to a particular Web page – though, of course, these 
          don&#39;t indicate actual follow-up away from the computer. Our colleagues 
          at Friends of the National Zoo included a helpful <em>Protect the Planet 
          Pledge</em> on the <em>Conservation Central </em>Web site: it provides 
          a measure of behavioural engagement. The best measure would be an easy 
          way for a visitor to provide feedback after doing a real-world activity, 
          such as visiting an interactive gallery space or a collaborative action 
          alert section of the exhibit Web site.</p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Given global concerns about habitat conservation and the environment, 
          coupled with the social and cultural challenges of life in a pluralistic 
          society, the shared mission of many museums, zoos and aquariums, and 
          conservation organizations has been to move visitors beyond <em>understanding</em> 
          of topics, to <em>behavioural change and advocacy</em> to make the world 
          better for all living things. More museums are looking for effective 
          tools to support behavioural learning at a distance via the Web. Using 
          the strategies we have outlined, we can move visitor experience beyond 
          appreciation towards action in the real world. We can translate compelling 
          on-line experiences into concrete action that endures long after visitors 
          turn off the computer.</p>
