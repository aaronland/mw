        <h1>Adding Value To On-line Collections For Different Audiences</h1>
        <h2>Stephen Brown, David Gerrard, De Montfort University, and Helen Ward, 
          East Midlands Museums Libraries and Archives Council, United Kingdom</h2>
        <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">This paper is about models for effective 
          on-line museum, library and archive design for diverse audiences. Successful 
          Web site design depends inter alia on understanding and accommodating 
          users&#39; needs, and the more heterogeneous they are, the more difficult 
          this is to achieve. In this paper we examine two models for handling 
          diversity in on-line audiences, one developed specifically for museum 
          Web sites, the other developed for curriculum design and media selection.  
          Both models consider the need to go beyond mere publishing of information. 
          We argue a case for synthesizing the two models and use a hybrid version 
          to deconstruct the design of two different heritage Web sites.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>While early commentators viewed the World Wide Web simply as a dissemination 
          medium; e.g. McAndrew (1995), it is widely accepted today that &#34;Organizations 
          such as museums have a more vital role to play in the online world than 
          just publishing information&#34; (Peacock et al 2004). Although ultimately 
          what visitors come to a Web site for is information of some kind &#34;... 
          there&#39;s more to it than meets the eye. Information needs can vary widely, 
          and each type...causes users to exhibit specific information seeking 
          behaviours.&#34; (Rosenfeld and Morville 2002).</p>
        <p>Designing for diverse audiences is a major challenge for Web designers 
          because of the tension created between the need to provide relevant, 
          important, information quickly and easily for each specific segment 
          of the audience and maintaining wide appeal and overall coherence. The 
          more heterogeneous the audience is, the more difficult it is to achieve 
          a Web site that is usable and relevant for the majority of its users 
          (Krug 2000). &#34;With so many different audiences, online exhibit 
          organizers often struggle with the shape and approach of their online 
          project.&#34; (Marable 2004).</p>
        <h1>Diversity</h1>
        <p>Museums, libraries and archives traditionally serve three core constituencies 
          (Bowen et al 2001): researchers, the general public and schools. &#34;Researchers&#34; 
          need not be accredited scholars and curators. They may simply be enthusiastic 
          amateurs such as collectors or historical enactors (Marable 2004). The 
          key characteristic is that they are experts. According to Preece et 
          al (2002), experts have more knowledge and experience of their domain 
          and can thus select &#34;optimal strategies&#34; for reaching information 
          goals and can better predict the consequences of their actions. Thus 
          researchers tend to <em>search </em>and seek to <em>impose </em>or <em>derive</em> 
          <em>connections</em> between the disparate pieces of information that 
          they find.</p>
        <p>At the other end of the spectrum lies the general public, a large and 
          heterogeneous grouping with widely differing levels of domain knowledge, 
          interest and needs. Marable (2004) suggests &#34;general audiences 
          may not have enough knowledge of the topic to navigate a powerful search 
          tool, and would need help in putting objects into context.&#34; Donovan 
          (1997) similarly commented on the need &#34;to wrap layers of interpretation 
          around the bare fact of an object before the public can begin to grasp 
          its significance.&#34; Thus the members of the general public tend 
          to <em>browse</em> and need to be presented with information that <em>makes 
          the connections for them</em> to help them appreciate the links between 
          and significance of the disparate pieces of information presented to 
          them.</p>
        <p>School students and teachers can be regarded as a hybrid of the other 
          two groups with students closer to the general public and teachers closer 
          to researchers in terms of their knowledge and skills:</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="brown.fig1.gif" width="400" height="215" alt="Screen Shot: Three core constituencies" border="0"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 1. Three core constituencies.</p>
        <p>School students need to be able to develop the characteristics of experts, 
          i.e. to be able to discover, analyze and synthesize information that 
          addresses identified topics, but their domain knowledge and skill levels 
          are such that, like the general public, they still need a degree of 
          scaffolding to engage their interest and provide the conceptual frameworks 
          required to assimilate new knowledge. Teachers are likely to be more 
          domain knowledgeable and have better research skills but may still need 
          help to find specific information and resources to support specific 
          projects quickly, and to address particular curriculum goals.</p>
        <p>The idea of progression from novice to expert is supported by a qualitative 
          study by Cunningham and Connaway (1996), one which focussed on the information 
          seeking strategies of academics and research professionals. Interviews 
          were conducted among 19 staff members from computing departments at 
          two universities in New Zealand. 
          It was discovered that the academics interviewed preferred the use of 
          keyword searches to browsing for information and that they: &#34;...rarely 
          browse to come up with new research ideas, <em>although several had 
          done so in the past, in earlier stages of their careers.</em>&#34; [our 
          italics]. </p>
        <h1>Models</h1>
        <p>In response to the problem of audience diversity, Marable (2004) proposed 
          a user centered &#34;integrated on-line exhibit model&#34; designed 
          to present common content to different user groups in different ways 
          best suited to their particular needs. The model comprises three elements:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          Multiple points of entry</li>
        <li> 
          Connecting storylines </li>
        <li> 
          Layered content (3 layers defined)</li>
      </ol>
       
        <p><em>Multiple points of entry</em> allow different groups to access 
          or select a presentation mode that best meets their needs, e.g. Storylines 
          for visitors who would like some context and inspiration, powerful search 
          engines for those who require access to specific information rapidly.</p>
        <p><em>Connecting storylines</em> provide links between presentation modes, 
          encouraging and assisting users to vary their modes of enquiry and broaden 
          their searches.</p>
        <p><em>Layered content</em> means superimposing on the content different 
          presentation modes to accommodate the requirements of different user 
          groups. Marable specified three distinct modes or layers as &#34;research&#34;, 
          &#34;exhibit&#34; and &#34;experience&#34;. The research level is 
          defined as the historic artifact and secondary sources that comprise 
          the basic archive or collection. This level, he proposes, is most relevant 
          to expert users.  The exhibit level &#34;provides a curatorial context 
          to the primary sources held in the research level. Aimed at a general 
          audience...visitors can choose among topics and themes selected by the 
          exhibition organizers&#34;.  Level three is described as &#34;an emotionally 
          engaging (and entertaining) experience that brings to life the story 
          of the exhibition for novice and general audiences.  This tier …usually 
          takes the form of a story.&#34;  He suggests that &#34;cinema and 
          theatre&#34; are appropriate expressions for this layer.</p>
        <p>Marable (2004) demonstrated how the model can be applied successfully 
          to the design of heritage Web sites, building exciting and informative 
          sites that are based on searchable collections or archives. It is noticeable, 
          however, that although these sites refer to &#34;learning&#34; as 
          an activity, they do not explicitly set out to address the needs of 
          teachers and students in a formal learning context. In other words, 
          they address only the first two of our three core constituencies. Re-examining 
          Marable&#39;s model, we can see that although he proposes three layers, 
          layers 2 and 3 are in fact targeted at the general public, thus giving 
          us only two user groups: experts and generalists. Conceivably another 
          layer is needed to manage the more formal structured learning activities 
          required by teachers and students.</p>
        <p class="paper">One of the most influential scholarly researchers in this field is 
          Diana Laurillard: her seminal book <em>Rethinking University Teaching</em> 
          (Laurillard 2002) contains a useful conceptual framework for describing 
          different kinds of learning activities or aspects of learning and for 
          mapping them on to media forms, methods and technologies, as shown in 
          table 1.</p>

        <p class="caption">Table 1. Laurillard&#39;s taxonomy of educational media 
          (Laurillard 2002, 90).</p>
        <p>Laurillard&#39;s taxonomy has previously been used to guide the conversion 
          of face to face teaching to on-line delivery and support. (Brown and 
          Cruickshank 2003). We suggest that it may be similarly applied to the 
          on-line presentation of museum, library and archive objects by matching 
          the required learning experiences of the main target user groups to 
          appropriate modes of presentation. To understand how, we need to consider 
          Laurillard&#39;s model in more detail.</p>
        <p>Laurillard (2002: 82-90) disaggregates learning into five different 
          kinds of experience,</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <em>Attending or apprehending</em> a lesson 
            as a largely passive recipient of information.</li>
        <li> 
          <em>Investigating or exploring</em> some 
            bounded resource in a more active way where decisions about what to 
            attend to, in what sequence and for how long, are managed by the learner.</li>
        <li> 
          <em>Discussing and debating</em> ideas 
            with others.</li>
        <li> 
          <em>Experimenting</em> with and <em>practising</em> 
            skills.</li>
        <li> 
          <em>Articulating and expressing</em> ideas 
            through the synthesis of some new product.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>She suggests that these five different kinds of learning experiences 
          are best supported by different media types which she characterizes 
          as Narrative, Interactive, Communicative, Adaptive and Productive respectively. 
        </p>
        <p><em>Narrative</em> media are essentially linear, highly structured 
          and non-interactive. They are a vehicle for transmission of information 
          and ideas but not, on their own, appropriate for supporting the iterative 
          dialogue that is central to knowledge construction. Videos, animations, 
          exhibition information panels and storylines are examples of narrative 
          media employed by museums. Notice that, unlike Marable, Laurillard makes 
          no distinction between exhibitions and other linear media such as film 
          and performance.</p>
        <p><em>Interactive</em> media offer resources for learners to explore 
          in a nonlinear way. Users can decide for themselves what to look at 
          and in which order. It is important to understand, however, that in 
          interactive media the given text, in its widest sense, remains unchanged 
          by the user. Catalogues, databases, search engines and physical layouts 
          of galleries, bays and shelves offer opportunities for self-directed 
          exploration, but their contents remain unchanged by the viewer.</p>
        <p><em>Adaptive</em> media are similar to interactive forms but with the 
          crucial addition of &#34;direct intrinsic feedback&#34; on learners&#39; 
          actions (Laurillard 2002, 126). That is to say, actions result in consequences 
          that are inherent to the task/system under consideration. A tennis analogy 
          would be that serving a ball so that it clips the top of the net provides 
          intrinsic direct feedback to the player about the need to raise the 
          serve. Additional, extrinsic, commentary from a coach is unnecessary 
          in such a situation. Simulations and hands-on exhibits that can be used 
          to experiment with phenomena such as light, electricity, mechanics and 
          sound are commonly used by museums.</p>
        <p><em>Communicative </em>media are simply those that support feedback 
          and discussion; e.g. email, discussion groups, video conferencing, etc. 
          Laurillard argues that feedback and discussion are fundamental to knowledge 
          construction, enabling an iterative dialogue between tutor and learner 
          through which theories and ideas are conceived, shared and transformed 
          into knowledge and understanding. (Laurillard 2002, 127).</p>
        <p><em>Productive</em> media are defined as tools that allow learners 
          to express themselves and to demonstrate their understanding. Creative 
          and communication tools are less commonly found in museums, libraries 
          and archives Web sites, no doubt because of the problems of ensuring 
          appropriate quality and network security. A good example is the &#34;Tell 
          Your Story&#34; section of the Moving Here migration Web site (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.movinghere.org.uk/stories/yourstory.asp?c=1">http://www.movinghere.org.uk/stories/yourstory.asp?c=1</a>) 
          which allows visitors to publish their own stories about migration memories, 
          illustrated with their own pictures or pictures taken from the Web site 
          itself.</p>
        <p>Applying Laurillard&#39;s definitions of different kinds of learning experience 
          to the characteristics of the three main audience types, we can create 
          a matrix in which the black dots indicate a mode of interaction likely 
          to be favored particularly by that audience.</p>

              <p class="caption">Table 2. An ideal theoretical model showing required 
          interactions by audience type.</p>
        <p>This analysis suggests three different, but overlapping, approaches 
          would be necessary to accommodate the needs of all three audience types. 
          If we combine this idea with Marable&#39;s suggestion of multiple points 
          of entry, then the three layers suggested by Marable can be redefined 
          as the five activity types described by Laurillard. The synthesised 
          model would then comprise:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          Multiple points of entry</li>
        <li> 
          Connecting storylines </li>
        <li> 
          Layered content (up to 5 layers)</li>
      </ol>
       
        <p>In the examples that follow, we deconstruct the designs to show how 
          this hybrid model can be employed to guide the design of museum Web 
          sites by ensuring that the identified needs of different user groups 
          are mapped to appropriate media forms and learning activities.</p>
        <h1>Examples</h1>
        <p>Recent years have seen major advances in creating and providing access 
          to digital resources in the public sector at both local and national 
          levels. The UK has three major examples of this. The People&#39;s Network 
          project (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk/">http://www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk</a>) 
          has connected all public libraries to the Internet. The NOF-Digitise 
          initiative has funded the generation of an enormous range of material 
          that is being made available, free of charge, to users of the People&#39;s 
          Network and the National Grid for Learning through <a target="_blank" href="http://www.enrichuk.net/">www.enrichUK.net</a>. 
          The DfES Curriculum Online initiative (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/">http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk</a>) 
          is working to make much of this and other publicly funded content available 
          to teachers seeking digital resources to support their teaching programs, 
          thus bringing together the cultural sector with local and national government 
          and education.</p>
        <h2>The Transport Archive </h2>
        <p>The first of two examples described here was funded through the NOF-Digitise 
          initiative.  The transport archive (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.transportarchive.org.uk/">www.transportarchive.org.uk</a>), is 
          an Internet based multi-media learning resource focusing on three key 
          transport achievements in the sphere of railways, waterways and aviation 
          in the UK. It was developed by a consortium of 4 UK local government 
          authorities in partnership with De Montfort University.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the site is to provide integrated access to a number 
          of disparate collections and archives relating to the Great Central 
          Railway, the Bridgewater and Manchester Ship canals, and the development 
          of British aviation at Filton, Bristol. The target audience was initially 
          defined as just about anyone. Through a Delphi style consultation exercise 
          (Weaver 1971), we reduced this at first to 10 categories including transport 
          enthusiasts, transport workers, historians, school students, teachers 
          and undergraduates. This was subsequently refined into 3 core constituencies 
          in the following order of priority:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          General Public (including parents 
            and young children).</li>
        <li>
          Experts (including scholars, 
            curators, amateur enthusiasts, high level students).</li>
        <li>
          Schools (including students in 
            the range 11-18 years and teachers). </li>
      </ol>
      
        <p>From the preceding discussion we can see that this implies a need to 
          incorporate all five different types of learning activities as defined 
          by Laurillard. However a condition of the NOF-Digitise funding explicitly 
          excluded development of formal learning activities, so the site is targeted 
          primarily at audiences 1 and 2, although in a separately funded development 
          some attempt has been made explicitly to address audience 3.</p>
        <p>The transport archive comprises five main sections: an overarching 
          gateway, three different transport sites dealing with canals, railways 
          and aviation, and an integrated, pan-transportation learning zone. The 
          gateway provides brief information on the other components and access 
          to a site-wide search engine. Within each of the three different transport 
          sites there are stories, multimedia, timelines, maps and links to other 
          relevant sites, plus the search engine, which categorizes the results 
          by transport mode and by theme (see below). These three transport sites 
          are the main content providers.</p>
        <p>The Learning Zone is quite different. It is designed for teachers and 
          students to use actively to build upon the resources provided in the 
          rest of the Transport Archive. Registered users can upload lesson plans 
          and completed class work based on the archive&#39;s content. Browsing of 
          uploaded content is unrestricted. To stimulate ideas, the Learning Zone 
          offers four major themes: Feats of Engineering&#34;, &#34;Changing 
          Landscapes&#34;, &#34;Community History&#34;,  and &#34;Socio-economic 
          background&#34; linked to stories, exhibits and keywords related to these 
          themes.</p>
        <p>Experts wishing to investigate the 8,500 plus digital objects in the 
          archive can use the keyword search facility to generate thumbnail images 
          and titles of more detailed records held in a MySQL database, marked 
          up with Dublin Core Metadata. Figure 2 shows one of the full object 
          records.</p>
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a><img src="brown.fig2.gif" width="400" height="407" alt="Screen Shot: Letting in the Water" border="0"/></p>

        <p>Unsuccessful searchers are offered prompts via a set of controlled 
          vocabularies reflecting the most commonly used terms among the first 
          4000 or so records.  Figure 3 shows a list of suggested terms for which 
          there are matching objects in the database.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, visitors may navigate the site via a range of stories 
          designed for general public use. They are intended to provide visitors 
          with some context for and interpretation of the underlying objects and 
          to present the content in an inspirational and interesting way. The 
          stories are introduced by short summaries and illustrated by images 
          drawn from the underlying database. Stories are further subdivided into 
          shorter freestanding sections. These stories can be accessed in any 
          sequence but individually provide a linear narrative. However, visitors 
          are encouraged to broaden their investigation by following links from 
          each story to related stories and within the stories to the images and 
          their underlying metadata. Further opportunities for contextualized 
          investigation are provided by timelines and interactive maps.   Figure 
          4 shows a section of one of the timelines providing an overview of the 
          historical period and situating specific objects within it.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="brown.fig4.GIF" width="400" height="407" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Railway archive timeline"/></p>

        <p>So, in terms of our hybrid model, the site offers:</p>
        <p><em>Multiple modes of entry</em>: The main sections offer free text 
          search engines; prompted searches via controlled vocabularies; and browsing 
          via stories, timelines and maps. In addition, the learning zone offers 
          opportunities for structured learning activities designed to encourage 
          investigation, discussion, experimentation and articulation. </p>
        <p>These different entry modes provide direct access to the <em>different 
          layers of content</em> required by the different target audiences. Thus 
          the search engine provides direct access to the lowest level of archival 
          records, facilitating the process of <em>exploration and investigation</em>.  
          At the next level, stories, timelines and maps within the main transport 
          sections provide access to the contextualizing layer corresponding to 
          tasks of <em>apprehending and comprehending</em> meaning. The separate 
          Learning Zone section provides a framework for <em>experiment and practice</em> 
          and <em>articulation and expression</em> of ideas, although this section 
          is less well developed because of funding restrictions. For the same 
          reason the site does not provide facilities for <em>discussing and debating</em> 
          ideas.</p>

        <h2>emsource</h2>
        <p>Our second example is drawn from a regional archive education initiative, 
          the emsource project, that has been operating in the East Midlands, 
          UK, since January 2003. This is funded by East Midlands Regional Archive 
          Council (EMRAC) and East Midlands Museums, Libraries and Archives Council 
          (EMMLAC) and is coordinated by a project education officer who works 
          across the region. The key focus of the emsource project is the ongoing 
          development of a Web site for teachers (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.emsource.org.uk/">www.emsource.org.uk</a>) that provides 
          archive based teaching and learning packages that support the UK National 
          Curriculum. This work is complemented by advocacy and training events 
          targeted at teachers and education providers, as well as ongoing consultation 
          with the education community.</p>
        <p>The emsource elearning project (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.emsource.org.uk/learning">http://www.emsource.org.uk/learning</a>) 
          was developed in response to teacher demand for on-line pupil activities. 
          Piloting of this project will inform the long-term expansion and development 
          of the emsource Web site. The elearning activities are aimed at secondary 
          pupils studying Key Stage 3 History and aim to promote the use of archive 
          collections for educational use. They are a good example of the kind 
          of content anticipated by the transport archive learning zone. The project 
          was developed jointly by the East Midlands Museums, Library and Archives 
          Council and De Montfort University, with assistance from the University 
          of Nottingham School of Education and the East Midlands Broadband Consortium.</p>
        <p>The elearning activities make use of two distinct Web sites. The Archives 
          for Learning Web site describes the learning activity for students and 
          provides links to historical resources drawn from The Record Office 
          for Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland, Nottinghamshire Archives 
          and Leicester City Museums Service. The site includes support pages 
          that help provide context for the events with which the archive items 
          are concerned. </p>
        <p>Stages 2 and 3 of the activities require the use of a discussion board, 
          a service available to schools through East Midlands Broadband Consortium&#39;s 
          regional learning platform and used by all schools which participated 
          in the Autumn pilot. A Teacher Support Booklet provides an overview 
          and an explanation of the aims of the activities, guidance on how to 
          run them, and hard copies of photocopyable resources.</p>
        <p>Learners role-play different characters on-line to develop their understanding 
          of historical events during the 19th century, based on access to original 
          archival material. The exercise is structured around conditions in the 
          framework knitting industry during the 1840s - a key area of employment 
          in the East Midlands and not then converted to the factory system - 
          and conditions more generally relating to working and living during 
          the mid nineteenth century. In addition to historical knowledge and 
          understanding, the on-line exercises are designed to develop skills 
          in research and interpretation of historical sources, presentation of 
          arguments, and on-line collaborative working.</p>
        <p>The activity is in four sections.  In stage 1, students are assigned 
          an historical identity, based on a real character belonging to one of 
          three groups: framework knitters, the establishment or political activists. 
          Taking on the role of a character is an important aspect of the exercise. 
          The sense of character identity is strengthened by giving each student 
          a character name and password  to log on to the site.</p>
        <p>Their task is to study a range of on-line archival material. Students 
          use an on-line notepad function to collect evidence relating to their 
          characters as they progress through the exercise. Once the students 
          reach the end of the initial evidence collection phase, they are given 
          an opportunity to review and change their notes.  Then the application 
          generates an email message containing the notes: this is sent to the 
          student&#39;s school email address.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="brown.fig5.gif" width="400" height="407" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Political Activist character"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 5. This screen shows the notepad for a Political 
          Activist character.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emsource.org.uk/learning/Activist/charPage.asp">http://www.emsource.org.uk/learning/Activist/charPage.asp</a></p>
        <p>In stage 2, students log on to an on-line discussion board to discuss 
          with other members of their role group three possible courses of action. 
          Based on the evidence they have appraised, they reach a decision regarding 
          the best course of action.</p>
        <p>In stage 3, all three role groups are brought together in an on-line 
          meeting chaired by the Commissioner (teacher). The task is to discuss 
          ways forward that would be acceptable to all three groups; but in practice, 
          a compromise is rarely reached.</p>
        <p>In stage 4, students log back in to the Web site to find out what happened 
          post 1845, involving their own character&#39;s fate. Pupils use the on-line 
          notepad function to write an autobiographical account for the character 
          that they have played.</p>
        <p>A teacher-led debrief explores issues relating to the availability 
          and interpretation of historical evidence, the decision-making process 
          and its outcome, and the practice of studying history.</p>
        <p>In terms of our framework this site offers:</p>
        <p>Single point of entry. Notwithstanding the different role assignments, 
          each student is required to work though the activity in the same sequence, 
          progressing from one stage to the next in tandem.  The universe of archival 
          objects is closed, small and cannot be searched freely.  It can only 
          be browsed in a predetermined sequence, and members of a role group 
          do not have access to the archives assigned to other role groups. (It&#39;s 
          also designed so that the archive items become progressively more dense/problematical, 
          thus supporting different learning speeds).  Table 4 summarizes the 
          emsource content layers and audience.  The hollowed-dots sections indicate 
          that in this example the site is available only to registered school 
          users.</p>

        <p class="caption">Table 4. A summary of the emsource content layers and 
          audience.</p>
        <p><em>Different layers</em> are explicitly embedded in the different 
          stages of the exercise. Students initially have to attend to and understand 
          their individual roles and character briefs from the linear narrative 
          materials presented on-line. Then they are required to investigate the 
          archive to collect evidence. The task is interactive in the sense that 
          they can select which objects to read and in which order, but they cannot 
          search outside or change the contents of their allocated archive. The 
          next two stages entail presenting and discussing their views through 
          the communication medium of on-line discussion. Stage 4 provides the 
          opportunity to articulate and consolidate their learning through the 
          writing of an autobiographical account. The whole role-play activity 
          constitutes an adaptive experiment in Laurillard&#39;s terms. The processes 
          are authentic (reading newsletters and handbills, discussing with neighbours 
          and arguing with rival role groups), and open ended, i.e. there is no 
          predetermined or correct outcome. The fact that there is rarely a broadly 
          acceptable outcome at all is immaterial since the real learning outcomes 
          of the activity relate to understanding historical and historiographical 
          issues rather than resolving a mid-nineteenth century dispute.</p>
        <p><em>Connecting storylines</em> are constructed by the students themselves 
          through the on-line discussions. In the discussions they compare different 
          viewpoints derived from different selections and interpretations of 
          evidence and debate issues from standpoints derived from partial evidence 
          bases.</p>
        <p>At the time of writing, evaluation data from the pilot was still being 
          collated and analyzed. However, early indications are that students 
          have responded enthusiastically to the role-play element of the activities:</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">Because they&#39;re all real (the characters) you learn... 
          These people are real people and they actually went through all this, 
          so you learning about them is fun because you can see how lucky you 
          are that you&#39;re alive at this time and that you&#39;re not alive then, because 
          if you&#39;re a framework knitter you haven&#39;t got a good life. Work and 
          that&#39;s it! (Year 8 pupil, Brunts School)  </p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">Being a political activist, you had to listen to 
          both sides of the story and work out a way to make them (the framework 
          knitters and the establishment) compromise. (Year 9 pupil, Meden School)</p>
        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <p>Museum Web sites can accommodate the different requirements of different 
          target audiences by presenting the same content in different ways. Key 
          to this idea is the concept of layered content proposed by Marable where 
          presentation modes are matched to the known characteristics of specified 
          audiences, but Marable&#39;s model is incomplete because it does not explicitly 
          address the needs of teachers and learners in schools or interaction 
          modes which entail discussion and creative expression. Laurillard&#39;s 
          taxonomy of educational media offers a framework for comprehensively 
          identifying the needs of different user groups. We have shown that it 
          can be applied to the selection of presentation modes to ensure appropriate 
          user-content interaction takes place, but Laurillard&#39;s sequence of activities 
          needs to be reordered to fit with the idea of layers of content, starting 
          with the most fundamental: the object collection or document archive.</p>
