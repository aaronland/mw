  <h1>Leveling the Playing Field: Empowering Learners with Primary 
    Sources</h1>
  <h2>Cynthia R. Copeland, The New-York Historical Society, Ray Shah, 
    Gavin Lee Foster, David Ellis and Petar Bojkov, Think Design, Inc., USA</h2>
        <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">American History is often undervalued, 
          disliked and ignored by both students and teachers in today&#39;s 
          schools. This paper looks at the incarnation of an on-line object-based 
          educational (K-12) Web site which helps enliven teaching and learning 
          history. With content steeped in the topic of the American Revolutionary 
          War era, the site intends to provide the experience of direct engagement 
          with rich and diverse historical resources to educators and learners. 
          This occurs in multiple ways throughout the site; however, it is the 
          site&#39;s main feature – the on-line exhibition tool – 
          that embraces object-based learning methodologies to promote the development 
          of skill sets in information literacy, evaluation and higher-ordered 
          critical thinking for educators and learners alike. As users learn how 
          to <em>curate</em> their own exhibitions, they also begin to understand 
          and practise the historical processes of weighing evidence and developing 
          methods of inquiry, thereby learning to think like historians.</p>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">Active participation in learning through 
          the incorporation of primary material in classroom instruction greatly 
          improves student interest, ability to retain knowledge, and overall 
          satisfaction with the learning and teaching process. The integration 
          of primary sources and new media technologies is reshaping the way education 
          is practised. And access to primary sources, once the sole domain of 
          curators and scholars, in an on-line format levels the playing field 
          and opens the possibilities for greater meaning to the legacy that is 
          history– at any age</p>
        <p class="keywords" id="keywords">Keywords: primary sources, object-based learning, 
          history, inquiry-based learning, educational site (K-12), on-line curatorial 
          tool, interactivity</p>
  <h1>Rationale</h1>
  <p>The demands placed upon history and humanities educators at the primary and 
    secondary levels have never been higher. Teachers are expected to prepare 
    their students not only to perform well on assessments and meet higher learning 
    goals in order to satisfy state and national mandates, but also to produce 
    good citizens.</p>
  <p>Teachers frequently are pressured into surveying vast periods of time and 
    complex events– such as the American Revolution or the Civil War– swiftly 
    and efficiently, but with little depth. In short, American history is often 
    taught by rushed, ill-prepared and unsatisfied teachers, and disliked or ignored 
    by their students. Such findings can be found in the <em>U.S. Department of 
    Education&#39;s National Center for Education Statistics report (2001),</em> which 
    painfully points out that America is producing a vast majority of young people 
    who are historically illiterate. And an earlier study conducted in 1991 by 
    the same agency noted that more than half of all social studies teachers did 
    not major or minor in history. Furthermore, Gorn 
    (n.d.) argues that the lack of training puts enormous 
    pressure on teachers to teach historical processes of researching, analyzing 
    and interpreting primary sources, to meet the requirements of standards and 
    student preparation for standardized tests, when they themselves are anemic 
    in these skill sets.</p>
  <p>Long considered a virtue of American citizenship, a solid understanding of 
    history– of one&#39;s community, state and nation– is ever more critical in evaluating 
    current events in today&#39;s information-saturated society. Yet according to 
    recent well-established research, many students, particularly in middle and 
    high schools, are disengaged from the fundamental institutions of government 
    and basic processes of American civic life. Students too often describe history 
    as &#39;boring and irrelevant.&#39; Students also frequently feel that teaching methods 
    are dull and abstract. According to Loewen (1995), 
    the common reliance on massive textbooks which attempt to summarize and &#39;explain&#39; 
    all there is to know about any given subject strikes many students as remote 
    and uninspiring. </p>
  <p>The New-York Historical Society&#39;s (N-YHS) educational philosophy supports 
    the findings in national research and various sources indicating the importance 
    of integrating <em>primary source</em> teaching methods into the classroom. 
    The Society advocates that students learn history best through direct discovery 
    and use of primary sources. We have a long and successful tradition of leading 
    students on discovery tours of our collections, through temporary and permanent 
    exhibitions, <em>The Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture</em>, 
    hands-on workshops with items from our <em>Touch Collection</em>, and other 
    on-site programs. We also partner with local schools to improve the teaching 
    of history in the classroom.</p>
        <p>Since the early 19th-century, The New-York Historical Society 
          has been collecting a vast array of artifacts and documents pertaining 
          to the American Revolution and Colonial era. As we ushered in the 21st-century, 
          the Historical Society chose to remain relevant by providing to millions 
          of learners, of all ages, access to these and many other collections 
          that shape the story of American culture. Greater access to primary 
          sources is the basis of the New-York Historical Society&#39;s creation, 
          the <em>American Revolution Digital Learning Project (ARDLP</em>), (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amrevonline.org/">http://www.amrevonline.org</a>).</p>
  <p>Taking advantage of changes in educational practices and the incredible recent 
    leaps in information storage, retrieval and manipulation, the Historical Society, 
    with generous funds from the Department of Education (Funds for the Improvement 
    in Education), and CitiGroup Foundation, is preparing 
    to launch the <em>American Revolution Digital Learning and New Media Project</em>. 
    Three years in the making, at its heart this educational resource is a digitized 
    compilation of upwards of ten-thousand theme-related primary materials, accessed 
    via the Web and supported by on-line educational materials and training seminars.</p>
  <h1>AmRevOnline.org– Genesis</h1>
  <p>The Society&#39;s <em>ARDLP</em> is under construction as a historical source repository 
    for educators and students on the Internet. Now, you can not only browse authentic 
    and topical primary source materials, but also interact with them. Presenting 
    resources in an on-line format is naturally beneficial to all learners, as 
    Web sites (and other new media technologies) tend to address learners&#39; various 
    modes of cognitive reception. In other words, in the world of multiple intelligences, 
    the four most widely recognized categories of learning styles include those 
    who are visual (learn through seeing), auditory (learn through listening), 
    tactile (learn through touching) or kinesthetic (learn through moving, doing).</p>
  <p>In anticipation of taking our maiden voyage, the N-YHS team enthusiastically 
    went straight to the source to assess the needs of teachers. Summative data 
    collected from a National Teachers&#39; Summer Institute sponsored by N-YHS in 
    2001 indicated that our Web site development should include a large collection 
    of objects and documents that students could access and analyze closely. One 
    teacher from Texas said, &#34;The West needs your treasures.&#34; Many teachers stressed 
    that we should also provide lessons and activities based on the material. 
    Transcripts of the documents and information about the objects should also 
    be provided. One teacher, though, cautioned that the Web site should not focus 
    only on New York, because teachers from other states might browse right past 
    it. During the Institute, teachers enjoyed hands-on experiences with selected 
    objects from our collection. They particularly loved the object-study sessions, 
    where they handled, examined, and made inferences between seemingly unrelated 
    objects. Several of them wondered if we could have 3-D views of the objects 
    on the Web site, so that students could &#39;handle&#39; them as the teachers did 
    on-site. Almost all of the teachers said that they would need a place to exchange 
    lessons and ideas with their colleagues.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="copeland_fig1.jpg" width="352" height="400" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Current Prototype"/></p>      
        <p class="caption">Fig. 1: Current Prototype of the AmRevOnline.org Web Site</p>
        <p>The site has undergone three iterations. In the first, there were usability 
    issues. The second, based on the exhibition, <em>Independence and its Enemies,</em> 
    served as a prototype. It was created and refined based on feedback from usability 
    tests. This exhibition was a wonderful place for us to begin as it demonstrated 
    the breadth and depth of both the library and the museum collections. That 
    site contained approximately 130 images, to which we added lesson plans, special 
    features such as a lens magnifier, a game, and later, as we began selecting 
    additional items from the museum collection, an item browser. The prototype 
    is now being transformed into the third and final iteration.</p>
  <h1>Site Features</h1>
  <h2>Collections Manager</h2>
  <p>It was realized during the design process for the <em>ARDLP </em>Web site that 
    existing collection management systems in use by the N-YHS neither had the 
    flexibility nor encompassed the fields required by the <em>ARDLP </em>team. 
    Having identified the need for a more specific tool for cataloguing American 
    Revolution-related objects and documents for use with the Web site, the <em>Collections 
    Manager</em> tool was developed.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="copeland_fig2.jpg" width="352" height="400" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Object Record"/></p>      
        <p class="caption">Fig. 2: Object Record in the Collections Manager</p>
        <p>The <em>Collections Manager</em> tool has a Web-based interface that allows 
    data related to objects and documents in the N-YHS collection to be catalogued. 
    It allows Museum data to be imported (currently we use MIMSY &amp; TMS), but 
    also allows new independent records to be created. The <em>Collections Manager</em> 
    also allows digital images of objects and documents to be viewed and associated 
    with those items.</p>
  <p>Future plans for the <em>Collection Manager</em> tool include adding the ability 
    to crosswalk existing data to the Dublin Core Metadata Elements, and allow 
    this data to be exported or accessed via an on-line search API.</p>
  <h2>Object &amp; Document Browsers   </h2>
  <p>The core of the <em>ARDLP </em>Web site is its <em>Object and Document Browsers</em>. 
    Items from the N-YHS collection are seen as belonging to two broad categories, 
    <strong>objects </strong>and <strong>documents</strong>. Through the <em>Object and Document Browsers</em>, 
    visitors to the site can access over 8,000 American Revolution-related objects 
    and documents from the N-YHS collection. High-quality digital images of the 
    item are available to be viewed, in conjunction with the cataloguing information 
    and additional research for each object, which has been added to its record 
    via the <em>Collections Manager.</em></p>      
        <p class="caption"><img src="copeland_fig3.jpg" width="400" height="388" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Object Browser"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 3: Object Browser Main Thumbnail View<br/>

  <p>Some objects also have 3-D views available, allowing the object to be seen 
    and rotated in a 360-degree plane. </p>
  <p>The <em>Magic Lens</em> tool has proved particularly popular on the site. The 
    <em>Magic Lens </em>allows a magnifying glass effect to be achieved over a digital 
    image, so that an area of the image, which moves with the mouse, is displayed 
    in an enlarged version. For some handwritten documents, the <em>Magic Lens 
    </em>is used to provide access to a <em>transcript </em>of the document.</p>      
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig4" id="Fig4"></a><img src="copeland_fig4.jpg" width="400" height="344" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Document Browser"/></p>

  <p>All these aspects of the <em>Object and Document Browsers</em> help the visitor 
    to feel much closer to, and achieve more interaction with, the objects and 
    documents in the collection, than would be possible even in the museum itself.</p>
  <h2>Object-Based Learning Application: Traditional Approach</h2>
  <p>Integrating this element of the site into classroom instruction enables students 
    to look directly at objects and documents and draw conclusions based on constructed 
    questions and responses. Teachers may choose a content-based approach, opting 
    to lead instruction that produces knowledge-based, factual results. Such outcomes 
    are demonstrated by developing very specific questions and activities that 
    satisfy content-based goals of purposeful learning. </p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="copeland_fig5.jpg" width="400" height="388" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Andrew Skinner and George Taylor"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig. 5: The page guiding student observations of &#39;Andrew 
          Skinner and George Taylor, <br/>

  <p>A constructivist and student-centered outcome can also be realized by allowing 
    students to explore the document on their own and develop their own lines 
    of questioning strategies. This type of approach is a great motivator for 
    learning, generating more thoughtful responses, and interesting student work.</p>
  <h2>Exhibition Tool</h2>
  <p>The implementation of the item browsers opened the way for the development 
    of the <em>Exhibition Tool</em>. The <em>Exhibition Tool</em> allows students 
    to visit the site and create and curate their own virtual exhibitions, containing 
    objects and documents that they select from the item browsers.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="copeland_fig6.jpg" width="400" height="390" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Vanguard High School"/></p>      <p class="caption">Fig. 6: Vanguard High School: Events that Caused the American 
          Revolution. <br/>
          Opening page [Student Work]</p>
  <p>Students may create exhibitions containing different sections. Within these 
    sections objects may be added and given individual labels, and optionally 
    grouped with a group label and heading. </p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="copeland_fig7.jpg" width="318" height="295" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Teacher Homepage"/></p>      <p class="caption">Fig. 7: Teacher Homepage from which students may be added 
          or<br/> 
          teamed up with one another; exhibitions viewed &amp; edited before<br/>
          submission for publication</p>
  <p>Teachers can register students in classes and sub-groups within these classes 
    and assign particular exhibition topics to the groups, or just to 
    individual students.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="copeland_fig8.jpg" width="400" height="385" border="0" alt="French &amp; Indian War section"/></p>      <p class="caption">Fig. 8: French &amp; Indian War section of &#39;Separation 
          Of A New World&#39;. <br/>
          This team linked the judicial reforms that followed 
          Salem&#39;s Witch Trials to the revolution.</p>
  <p>The <em>Exhibition Tool</em> thus enables students to enhance their critical 
    understanding of the American Revolution through direct, albeit digital, interaction 
    with primary sources in a way no textbook or museum visit could feasibly provide. 
    Students can use the <em>Exhibition Tool</em> and learn to &#39;think like historians&#39; 
    by using primary sources from the N-YHS both with or 
    without guidance from their teachers.</p>      
        <p class="caption"><img src="copeland_fig9.jpg" width="316" height="274" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Student exhibition"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig. 9: Student exhibition using thumbnail images to lead 
          into exhibition topics</p>
  <p>The <em>Exhibition Tool </em>and <em>Object and Document Browsers </em>both enliven 
    the classroom and provide students with opportunities to sharpen their analytical 
    skills while building their memories of key events and personalities from 
    the American past.</p>
  <p>Students and teachers may ask to have their work published on the site. The 
    exhibition must have the approval of the N-YHS advisory board, composed of 
    teachers, historians, N-YHS staff and others. If criteria are met, the site 
    is then uploaded for all to see, and will become a part of the permanent archive.</p>
  <h1>Object-Based Learning: Critical and Creative Thinking Approach</h1>
  <p>The Exhibition tool is meant to encourage and motivate students&#39; understanding 
    of the objects and documents in proper context. Of course teachers can apply 
    any method of instruction necessary to achieve final assessment of student 
    skill, knowledge and understanding. However, this tool, when tested among 
    high school students, proved to be an incredible tool for learning, and raised 
    levels of critical thinking.</p>
  <p>The <em>Exhibition Tool </em>when presented for exploration or discovery of 
    information on the subject allowed the construction of new knowledge and forms, 
    and was conducive to model building. When students received instruction to 
    fulfill certain requirements, they worked diligently and with great enthusiasm. 
    Many of the students were so immersed in their research they stated that they 
    were on-line during the wee hours of the morning looking for images to illustrate 
    their interpretations of this defining event from the past. They also indicated 
    how frustrated they were when the site was inaccessible because of work being 
    done by the developers during the early morning hours.</p>
  <h2>A Case Study – Vanguard High School, New York City</h2>
  <p>Vanguard offers small classes with intense interaction between students and 
    teachers, creative lessons, and a real sense of community. Many of the students 
    have not had great success in their primary education, requiring a great deal 
    of remedial work. It is one of a handful of alternative high schools across 
    the city that require students to complete a set of nine graduation <em>portfolios</em> 
    in addition to passing five Regents examinations. Vanguard has no electives.</p>
  <p>The school has grades 9-12, and class size is about 20 students per teacher. 
    The 9th grade peaks with 140 students, while the12th 
    grade student body ebbs to approximately 40 students, suggesting a high drop-out 
    rate. Students receive individualized attention in efforts to identify and 
    to resolve problems as early as possible. Parents are active in their children&#39;s 
    education, attending meetings with their child and the child&#39;s advisor. The 
    graduate rate is about 50%; attendance is noted at 81%, and there is a seven-year 
    graduation rate of 74.5%.</p>
  <p>Creative instruction drives project-driven classes that are demanding. Though 
    teachers struggle to meet the needs of all learners, some students find the 
    work too difficult. Investigation and inquiry-based methods are taught to 
    help students acquire better in-depth research and critical thinking skills 
    to explore topics of study. Knowledge and understanding are demonstrated through 
    portfolio assessment and oral presentations. Students are taught to discuss 
    their ideas, identify evidence, and ask critical questions (Jacobs, 2003).</p>
  <p>In the fall 2004, the <em>ARDLP</em> spent three weeks working with a grade 
    12 humanities teacher and his students, piloting the <em>Exhibition Tool.</em> 
    The students had a choice, either to curate an on-line exhibition, or to create 
    a reading book. Approximately 15 students selected the Web site project. The 
    students were prepped on events leading up to the American Revolution and 
    the impact of the War on the colonies. Their assignment was to locate objects 
    and documents in a &#39;free- style&#39; to illustrate fifteen causes of the American 
    Revolution and the War, including Non-Importation, the Boston Tea Party, Coercive 
    Acts, the Townshend Acts, and more. The students 
    were instructed to write supportive text and captions for an on-line exhibition. 
    The students could work independently, or they could collaborate with a partner. 
    They had nearly ten days to complete their projects.</p>
  <h3>ARDLP Observations</h3>
  <p>At first, the students appeared to be caught up in the novelty 
    of the site. There were so many features and so many objects and documents 
    that it was difficult to remain focused and on task. It was later determined 
    by both teacher and students that rummaging around the site was just part 
    of the process of discovery and exploration. Once that was out of their systems, most students tended to be literal 
    in their approach to looking for objects and documents. By consensus, 
    the students were dependent on the keyword search and showed great frustration 
    and disappointment when items for topics did not show up in great numbers 
    or at all, in response to their searches. For example, when they typed in 
    &#34;non-importation,&#34; most of the students expected to see a stream 
    of images that screamed out &#34;THIS IS ABOUT NON-IMPORTATION!&#34; </p>
  <p>With some coaching the students finally realized that they 
    needed to expand on their prior knowledge of the subject matter. They studied 
    the background prior to engaging in the activities and were being challenged 
    to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the content. Once the 
    goals were clearly defined, the layers of learning unfurled, and the students 
    became absorbed in object-based learning– learning from objects and primary 
    sources through exploration and context. They grappled with the complexities 
    of learning and understanding to find the interconnection between the primary 
    sources and the ideas that the sources communicated. </p>
  <p>In the end, the students made oral presentations of their work. The work 
    ranged from adequate to excellent. One student with time management issues, 
    and who met all sorts of challenges throughout his daily life, managed to 
    produce a small exhibition in two days. The content was all jumbled up in 
    his head, but some of his observation skills were highly acute. For example, 
    when trying to illustrate the event known as the Boston Tea Party, he found 
    the perfect image, yet it wasn&#39;t obvious to other learners. He identified 
    a textile, and on the lower left corner of an elaborate kerchief, which focuses 
    attention on an image of George Washington, was this amazingly rich engraving 
    of that well-known historical event. This detection may not seem monumental 
    to some, but for a learner attempting to generate his or her own meaning based 
    on investigation, that discovery demonstrated his ability to observe, inquire, 
    analyze and reflect, therefore using skill sets practiced by professionally 
    trained historians.</p>

  <h3>Student Outcomes</h3>
  <p>After the presentations, we collected summative data from the students. Their 
    surveys comprised open-ended questions as well as questions ranked on a rating 
    scale of 1 – 5, one being a <em>not all</em> type response and five, <em>extremely 
    so</em>. We inquired about levels of appropriateness for grade level; comprehensiveness 
    of the site&#39;s content; time spent on the Web site; opportunities to interact 
    with others; enjoyment of use; instructions for using the site; interest in 
    doing more social studies learning on-line; what they liked and didn&#39;t like 
    about the site; and suggestions for improvement. Twelve out of the fifteen 
    students returned the surveys, with a range of answers. Scores for navigability 
    were all over the map, with one – 1, and several 3-5s. Most students found 
    the site to be extremely comprehensive. Twelve out of the twelve returned 
    surveys indicated they would like to do more social studies-based learning 
    projects on-line. Other comments included: </p>
  <h3>On likes and dislikes: 
    </h3>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;I loved reading documents, and making connections 
          to artifacts. I didn’t like the editing process.&#34;</em></p>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;I like how background information was provided 
          with every picture or document.&#34;</em></p>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;The clarity of the magic lens.&#34;</em></p>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;I like[d] the fact that we can add pictures 
          to our test. What I least like was that some pictures that we needed 
          were hard to find.&#34;</em></p>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;I like the fact that it is easy to navigate, 
          but I didn’t like the fact that it’s kinda hard to find picture for 
          topics.&#34;</em></p>
        <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;What I like[d] was how it (assignment) 
          was on a Web site and how we helped [those] people with some feedback&#34;</em></p>
  <h3>On what they thought 
    was the main goal of the site:</h3>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;To help teach kids how to learn online 
          and not just in a textbook.&#34;</em><em></em></p>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;To familiarize students with the artifacts 
          found at the museum and the history surrounding them.&#34;</em></p>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;To help students comprehend the American 
          Revolution in a fun and interesting way.&#34;</em></p>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;The main goal of this web site is to give 
          us a better understanding of the American Revolution.&#34;</em></p>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;It&#39;s kind of like an online museum, so 
          rather than have to go out you can sit on a chair and get the same experience.&#34;</em></p>
  <h3>And, on suggestions 
    for improving the site:</h3>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;I think helping to categorize the images

          pictures and objects.&#34;</em></p>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;Having more object[s] and document[s] to 
          make you understand more.&#34;</em></p>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;Really nothing.&#34;</em></p>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;Finish the Web site.&#34;</em></p>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;I suggest improving the editing process, 
          when writing text and having well informed teachers, teach the students 
          how to navigate and benefit from using the web site.&#34;</em></p>      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>&#34;Really nothing, it might be hard to find 
          objects but at least you have to do some work.&#34;</em></p>
  <h3>Teacher Outcomes</h3>      <p>Initially, the teacher was a bit disappointed with the student work. 
          The teacher had hoped to give these students, whom he felt had a disadvantaged 
          education, a great experience in learning. Instead, he felt frustrated 
          that they were not able to make the giant leaps of inquiry- and object-based 
          learning independently. When he observed the majority of the students 
          struggling to apply their intellectual skills to their knowledge and 
          understanding, he felt a bit defeated. He also determined very early 
          on that the Web site was probably more of a &#39;diversion rather than a 
          teaching tool.&#39;</p>
  <p>However, after re-examination, given the short time frame for unit study, 
    the teacher realized that he had tried to cram in too much material. He also 
    recognized that a 20-30 per cent reduction in the research assignment (examining 
    3-5 causes) would have yielded a manageable assignment, leading to concentrated 
    research, greater knowledge and understanding, and a better experience for 
    the students. It is likely that the revelation suggested that a well-developed 
    plan and improved implementation, plus, a greater familiarity with the tools 
    at hand, would have produced the results he was really trying to achieve. 
    He realized that the site can be used to center focused learning, or it can 
    be used for broad exploration, as occurred at the outset. And after he saw 
    the presentations and looked closely at the on-line exhibitions, he came to 
    realize that real learning did indeed occur in that classroom. This also became 
    evident from the information gleaned from the student surveys.</p>
  <h2>Other Interactive Aspects of the Site</h2>
  <p>The ARDLP Web site has integrated other methods of <em>reading</em> primary 
    sources. We have created several games. Some games have been created by students, 
    others by teachers and by other people who know how to have fun with primary 
    sources. <em>Prosper or Perish: the Frederick Lindsay Loyalist Game</em> is 
    a role-playing game where students empathize with the character and gain understanding 
    of what it meant to live in the past, and that choices always have consequences. 
    The underlying lesson of this game is that learners, in this 
    case gamers, generate their own meaning based on investigation and exploration.

  <p>Another challenging game is actually a content-based lesson in disguise. 
    In the <em>Patriots versus Red Coats Game</em>, the essential outcome is for 
    students to acquire knowledge (facts) about the impact of the Revolution on 
    New York City. Critical data is explored and meant to reinforce what is ( 
    or should be) currently known by students. This is a question and answer 
    game where a player chooses a side (Rebel/British) and answers questions related 
    to the on-line exhibition. Students can play this game individually or in 
    groups in the classroom. It can serve as a jumping off point into bigger ideas 
    about the social, political and personal ideals of the era. But more importantly, 
    working with primary sources on the Web brings students to a new understanding 
    of what it means to dig and look deeply beyond the obvious.</p>

  <p>Making collections available on-line offers great flexibility and endless 
    possibilities for educating the public in general, and educators and students 
    specifically. In order to start the educational process, access to information 
    must occur. Information access empowers audiences in unimaginable ways: to 
    conduct research, make discoveries, draw connections, engage in higher ordered 
    thinking, and add to the interpretation of the content in the collections. 
    Primary source learning on the Web helps us to observe more carefully, formulate 
    questions, conduct research, discuss, collaborate, analyze, derive new meaning 
    and draw conclusions. This type of educational tool encourages active engagement 
    from audiences and lessens their roles as passive receivers of information 
    (Rhyne, 1997).</p>
