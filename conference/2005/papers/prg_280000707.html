        <h1>1-800-FOR-TOUR: Delivering Automated Audio Information through Patron&#39;s 
          Cell Phones</h1>
        <h2>Matthew Nickerson, Southern Utah University, USA</h2>
      <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">Many museums around the world rent 
          audio players to their visitors to provide automated tours delivering 
          pre-recorded information about their exhibits. Though generally pleased 
          with their patrons&#39; responses to automated audio tours, museum administrators 
          find that hosting them can be expensive, time consuming, and frustrating. 
          Ongoing advances in mobile wireless technology provide an alternative 
          to the current cumbersome method of renting sound players to museum 
          visitors. Many patrons bring their own &#39;digital sound player&#39; with them 
          in the guise of their personal cell phone. As cell phones proliferate 
          and the price of calling plans falls, cell phones may present a viable 
          alternative to current audio tour systems. History Calls was a recent 
          experiment using VXML technology to deliver an automated audio museum 
          tour directly to patrons&#39; cell phones.</p>
        <p id="keywords">Keywords: cultural heritage, automated tours, voiceXML 
          (VXML), wireless, cell phones</p>
        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>Automated audio tours are a popular resource at many cultural heritage 
          sites around the world. These types of tours were first introduced more 
          than two decades ago using personal audio cassette players. Many patrons 
          enjoyed these <em>personal</em> tours allowing them to enjoy sites more 
          privately, without a human guide or docent, and letting them move along 
          at their own pace. Typically a patron would rent a player for a fee 
          and then follow a proscribed route through the exhibit, accessing the 
          audio information periodically at predetermined locations. These types 
          of audio tours were very successful, and through the years they became 
          regular features at museums all over the world.</p>
        <p>In the 1990&#39;s, the technology improved as museums began to employ digital 
          files and players. Automated tours incorporating digital sound were 
          no longer held captive by the sequential nature of analog tape. Patrons 
          could wander through exhibits accessing information in any order they 
          pleased. Using digital players, the private and personal nature of automated 
          museum tours increased dramatically, and the popularity of this service 
          continues to rise (Martin, 2000).</p>
        <p>Though popular with patrons, managing these types of tours is a major 
          undertaking for the cultural heritage institutions that choose to employ 
          them. The digital players for audio tours require constant maintenance 
          for repairs, recharging, updates, and replacement. Whether the service 
          is provided solely by the institution or is shared/sub-contracted with 
          a private provider, the upkeep of automated audio tour machines is time-consuming 
          and expensive. Respondents to a 2001 survey of museums indicated the 
          largest disadvantages of automated tours were installation costs and 
          the challenges of equipment malfunction (Smith, 2001). </p>
        <p>This query, posted by a museum professional to a museum e-list hosted 
          by The British Interactive Group, reflects some of the most common fears 
          and frustrations of museum professionals when considering an audio tour:</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">I&#39;ve heard of some bad experiences from users of 
          this sort of kit - hard to use/control from visitors point of view, 
          easily broken/lost from the organisation&#39;s point of view. I would be 
          really grateful to hear from anyone with good experience of a particular 
          system. Or bad experience/systems to avoid. Also management of them 
          - a deposit system? Charging?</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">(British Interactive Group, 1999) </p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The main source of cost and frustration with maintaining a museum audio 
          tour system is the rental and continuous upkeep of the audio player 
          hardware. Large exhibits can require hundreds of these machines. Thousands 
          of patrons of all ages, interests, and technological know-how rent and 
          use the players, carrying them throughout the museum or gallery every 
          day. Commercial vendors have developed heavy-duty players, but accident, 
          careless handling, and absent minded patrons still result in damage 
          and loss. Exhibit information is stored directly on to each machine, 
          so updates must be accomplished individually. Sophisticated storage 
          racks can facilitate the updates and recharging en masse, but maintenance 
          is still a costly and time-consuming operation. </p>
        <p>In reviewing this important and popular museum service, it seems one 
          obvious way to alleviate much of the time, cost, and frustration associated 
          with hosting audio tours would be to get museums out of the player rental 
          business and distribute the tour through the patron&#39;s own machine. Technological 
          advances over the past few years now make this a viable option. Hand-held 
          wireless devices of all shapes and sizes are already accompanying museum 
          patrons on their visits. Why not capitalize on the most ubiquitous of 
          these machines by delivering automated audio tours directly to visitors&#39; 
          own hardware: their personal cell phones?</p>
        <h1>VoiceXML (VXML)</h1>
        <p>The growth and popularity of cell phone technology is astounding. There 
          are an estimated 1.5 billion mobile subscribers worldwide, with 2004 
          sales estimated at 648 million units (ITfacts, 2005). With the widespread 
          availability and popularity of wireless telephones, this technology 
          seems a logical option for testing a new method for audio tour delivery. 
        </p>
        <p>This case study describes a proof-of-concept project for delivering 
          automated audio museum tours via visitors&#39; cell phones. Based on its 
          success in commercial applications, we selected VoiceXML (VXML) as the 
          central development tool for the project. VXML is an XML-based markup 
          language designed specifically to implement interactive voice dialogs. 
          Its main function is to describe the user interface; that is, the exchanges 
          of requests and information between the caller and the application. 
          These exchanges, or dialogs, facilitate communication between two very 
          different world-wide networks: the telephone system and the Internet. 
          VXML dialogs feature several inputs/outputs, including synthesized speech, 
          digitized audio, voice recognition, and DTMF (touch tones). VXML dialogs 
          are described by documents (programs) that reside on a Web server and 
          work in concert with a voice server. The voice server receives/translates 
          voice input and also creates computer-synthesized voice messages (Larson, 
          2003). </p>
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a><img src="nickerson.fig1.jpg" width="300" height="141" border="0" alt="Screen Shot:  Interaction of Web server..."/></p>
        <p class="caption">  Fig 1: Interaction of Web server, voice server, and 
          telephone</p>
        <p>The gateway on the voice server allows these inputs/outputs to be processed 
          through standard telephony technology. The gateway is the bridge between 
          the phone system and the Web-based VXML dialogs.    The voice server 
          is the second key component in a VXML system. Though VXML is an open 
          language, to build a voice server usually requires the licensing of 
          proprietary systems such as voice recognition software and voice synthesis 
          engines. A simpler method for acquiring this type of voice capability 
          is to purchase a turnkey system, several of which are currently on the 
          market. There are commercial service providers as well that host VXML 
          applications, either in full or linked to a private Web server. As the 
          use and need for VXML grows, more commercial options will be available 
          to developers.</p>
        <p>The voice recognition process within the voice server is simplified 
          through the creation of VXML grammars. A VXML document defines a grammar 
          for each point in the dialog, enabling the speech recognizer to work 
          very fast and efficiently. The grammar defines a finite vocabulary specific 
          to the VXML document and its application, preparing the voice server 
          to respond to only a few words rather than thousands. </p>
        <h1>History Calls</h1>
        <p>A VXML system, as described above, was used to create an automated 
          audio tour for an exhibit of historic photographs in the gallery space 
          at a university library. The twenty photographs in the exhibit were 
          hung in traditional museum fashion. Creation of the automated audio 
          tour followed a four step process: 1) research, 2) preparing the audio, 
          3) creating the VXML document, and 4) linking to the voice server.</p>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Substantial research was conducted to learn about the people and events 
          depicted in the twenty photographs in the exhibit. The photographs covered 
          100 years of local performing arts history dating from 1901 to 2001. 
          Significant information was found at the public and university libraries, 
          and because of the local focus of the photo exhibit, community members 
          with first-hand knowledge of the people and events were also consulted. 
        </p>
        <p>The information gathered through the research process was used to create 
          description placards for each photograph, a three-fold exhibit brochure, 
          and the script for the audio tour. The tour script consisted of one 
          or two paragraphs per photograph, each translating into 30-60-second 
          recordings when narrated. </p>
        <p>Research also discovered important primary documents within the library&#39;s 
          extensive oral history collection. A review of the transcripts uncovered 
          several interviews directly relating to the people and events illustrated 
          in the photo exhibit. In addition, several individuals depicted in the 
          photos were still living in the area; they were contacted and interviewed 
          regarding their memories of the pictured events. These interviews were 
          recorded, and the digital sound files, along with the existing historical 
          recordings, became an integral part of the final product. </p>
        <h2>Preparing the Audio</h2>
        <p>Because sound was the crux of the project, special care was taken to 
          collect and capture the best possible audio in terms of both sound quality 
          and content. Three types of audio were designed into the tour and delivered 
          via the VXML document and voice server. First, the prepared script for 
          each photograph described above was read and recorded as an ndividual 
          sound file. To create sound of the highest quality, a professional actor 
          served as the narrator for the texts and the recordings were made in 
          a professional studio. In addition to the narration for each photo, 
          the script also included introductory remarks and brief instructions 
          on how to control and navigate through the automated tour.</p>
        <p>The second type of sound files used in the tour was excerpts extracted 
          from oral interview recordings. Short, 30-60-second clips directly related 
          to individual photos in the exhibit were cut from the longer interviews 
          and saved as individual sound files. The new interviews, conducted specifically 
          for this project, were recorded in the studio to ensure high sound quality. 
        </p>
        <p>The older recordings, some dating back to as early as the 1940&#39;s, were 
          also edited to provide short clips relating to the exhibit. It was found 
          that the age and recording medium of these older interviews often made 
          the sound quality unacceptable. In these instances, digital sound editing 
          software was used to clean and improve the selected cuts for use in 
          the tour. It is the inclusion of these first person narratives in the 
          phone tour that gave the project its name, </p>
        <h1>History Calls</h1>
        <p>The third audio type used in the tour was not pre-recorded; rather, 
          the VXML document and voice server produced the sound as a computer 
          synthesized voice. The text for these computer generated comments was 
          written into the VXML code and then translated into audio by the voice 
          server. </p>
        <h2>Creating the VXML Document</h2>
        <p>The VXML document controlling the tour was created and stored on a 
          local Web server along with the audio tour sound files. Before beginning 
          to write the VXML code, it proved very helpful and instructive to diagram 
          the options and paths that would be available to the user. This flow 
          chart of the tour incorporated not only the introductory text and the 
          information on each photograph but also the pathways and use for several 
          support sound files, including error/repeat warnings, redundant help 
          messages, a looping sound file to indicate a waiting mode, and the introduction 
          and instructions for the on-line user survey. </p>
        <p>The help and instructional messages were included as text messages 
          within the VXML document and were rendered by the voice server in computer 
          synthesized speech. This convention helped distinguish aurally between 
          the mechanics of the tour and the narration for the exhibit. The synthesized 
          voice immediately indicated that the listener had exited the tour narration 
          and was now interacting with the navigational/help module. </p>
        <p>Individually numbered sound files reflecting the numbered photos in 
          the exhibit, together with the accompanying navigational text messages, 
          served as the foundation for constructing the flow chart. Once the main 
          trunk was complete, the ancillary branches were added. These branches 
          included connections to help information, error warnings, prompt messages, 
          and the on-line survey. </p>
        <p>Like a movie director&#39;s story board, the flow chart served as a step-by-step 
          outline of the entire program. The programmer&#39;s job was to create in 
          VXML the paths and links indicated by the flow chart. As with most projects, 
          not every eventuality was covered in the initial flow chart, and the 
          designer and programmer worked together to iron out details as the project 
          came together. Because VXML is designed for voice applications, the 
          tags facilitate the creation of voice menu systems and their inherent 
          support structure. This project utilized many of the useful elements 
          VXML makes possible; for example,</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           The system signaled the user that s/he 
            was connected by playing exhibit appropriate music. <em>Main Menu</em> 
            choices or the <em>help</em> selection could be contacted over the 
            music at any time.</li>
        <li> 
           Menu and other navigational decisions 
            could be input either through voice or DTMF (phone touch pad).</li>
        <li> 
           If the user did not provide input within 
            a predetermined waiting period, the program would prompt for it. After 
            three different prompts, each more pointed than the last, the program 
            returned the user to the <em>Main Menu</em>.</li>
        <li> 
           Voice inputs that were unrecognizable 
            prompted another set of nested help messages, each asking the user 
            to repeat the choice, and concluding with the suggestion that the 
            user now try the phone&#39;s touch pad.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <h2>Linking to the Voice Server</h2>
        <p>The voice server for this project was provided by BeVocal, a leading 
          VXML hosting service. BeVocal, like other commercial VXML providers, 
          offers various plans according to the size and complexity of the project. 
          In comparison to commercial applications, <em>History Calls</em> was 
          a rather small operation and only required a minimal hosting package. 
          BeVocal provided 24/7 access to a voice server via a single toll-free 
          number with a limit of 5 simultaneous callers. They also provided limited 
          tech support as well as several on-line tools for testing and debugging 
          the History Calls VXML document.</p>
        <p>Once the final VXML document was finished and saved on the local Web 
          server, the BeVocal account was created and linked to the local document. 
          Once this link was established, the BeVocal gateway was immediately 
          available to accept incoming calls from patrons at the photograph exhibit. 
          A standard transaction incorporated the following steps: A patron call 
          to the toll-free number was accepted by the gateway, translated, and 
          forwarded to the voice server. The voice server interpreted the voice/DTMF 
          input from the gateway and forwarded this information to the VXML document 
          on the local Web server. The VXML code determined the appropriate response 
          which was sent back through the voice server and translated by the gateway 
          to be received by the patron. Initial tests of the system revealed a 
          few minor glitches that were easily corrected. Changes to the VXML document 
          were effective immediately, as were corrections and updates to audio 
          files.</p>
        <h1>Evaluation</h1>
        <p>Both a print and an on-line survey were made available to all patrons 
          at the conclusion of their visit. Like the tour, the on-line survey 
          was an automated audio experience administered through the user&#39;s cell 
          phone. The audio tour dialog contained several prompts inviting patrons 
          to respond to the audio survey as part of their tour experience. These 
          prompts appeared at the beginning, during, and at the conclusion of 
          the audio tour. Evaluation questions were delivered aurally and patron 
          responses received either through voice or DTMF input. The survey responses 
          were automatically entered into a database for evaluation. A unique 
          feature of the on-line survey was an opportunity for the patron to offer 
          an oral comment on the exhibit. This voice message was recorded and 
          saved to the data base as a digital sound file.</p>
        <p>A print survey was also made available to all visitors to the exhibit. 
          An advantage of the print form was that it reached patrons whether or 
          not they took advantage of the automated phone tour. In this way, general 
          data concerning patron reaction to the exhibit was received as well 
          as important data relating to why they did or did not choose to try 
          the automated audio tour. </p>
        <p>Evaluation of the History Calls project revealed several strengths 
          and weaknesses. As predicted, the upkeep of the tour was simple and 
          very low maintenance. Changes could be made to the server quickly and 
          efficiently, and these changes were immediately implemented on the user 
          side. </p>
        <p>The first person narratives within the audio tour were a big hit with 
          patrons and received a great deal of positive feedback on the exhibit 
          surveys. Though not often found in audio tours, programs that use a 
          variety of voices and perspectives can add interest and warmth to the 
          audio experience (Schwartzer, 2001). Admittedly, this type of audio 
          could be used in any audio tour system, not just those delivered through 
          cell phones, but hearing the first person narration through their own 
          telephones added to the reality and immediacy of the patrons&#39; experience 
          in a way that would not be possible using the digital players currently 
          in use.</p>
        <p>Both Voice and DTMF input were tested by patrons. In the &#39;quiet&#39; environment 
          of the exhibit space, most patrons were reluctant to use the voice input 
          option and relied primarily on their phone key pad. Of those patrons 
          who used the phone tour and responded to the survey, one-half relied 
          solely on DTMF to interact with the system and never used the voice 
          interface. Though shunned by these patrons in the library gallery, it 
          is suspected that voice interaction would prove more popular in outdoor 
          venues (zoos, historic sites). Voice interaction is also a powerful 
          accessibility tool and an important benefit to handicapped patrons with 
          limited mobility. </p>
        <p>Though not encountered in this test, some structures are not conducive 
          to cell phone reception. The difficulty of using cell phones inside 
          some buildings is another factor in favoring outdoor venues for cell 
          phone tours.</p>
        <p>A valid concern understood from the outset of the project was the additional 
          cost some patrons might incur by using their cell phone as the audio 
          tour playback device. Only one respondent to the survey indicated that 
          concern about cost prevented him/her from using the phone tour. Three 
          other respondents indicated that this concern limited their use of the 
          tour. Patrons seemed to have widely different service plans, and overall, 
          concern over cost and roaming was limited. At present, the expanding 
          market and strong competition among cell phone providers is leading 
          toward lower costs and increasing minutes. It is not unreasonable to 
          expect that concerns over the cost for these types of phone services 
          will diminish in the future as service plans become even more generous. 
        </p>
        <p>Evaluation of the VXML technology and phone tours specifically was 
          very positive. All of the respondents to the automated survey indicated 
          that the tour had improved their experience at the gallery and that 
          they would take advantage of similar cell phone tours if offered at 
          other cultural heritage institutions.   </p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Cell phones, PDAs, and other wireless hand held devices, as well as 
          new hybrids combining these technologies, are radically changing the 
          way many people communicate, interact, and participate in the world 
          around them. This rapid development and innovation in wireless technologies 
          portend a rising need and opportunity to take advantage of these advances 
          to explore new ways of distributing educational and cultural information. 
          One area of focus, explored here, is adapting these technologies to 
          deliver high quality, accurate, and engaging information directly to 
          visitors&#39; cell phones at museums, galleries, zoos, aquaria, botanical 
          gardens, historic sites, and other cultural heritage venues. History 
          Calls is one such project.</p>
        <p>The conversational mode employed by patrons as they interact with a 
          VXML system is an engaging and powerful tool for making cultural heritage 
          come alive and for bringing history into the present. The voice input 
          made possible by VXML allows patrons not only to view and learn about 
          cultural artifacts but to talk to them as well. The simple change from 
          digital player to cell phone immediately alters the relationship between 
          the patron and the audio information, and between the patron and the 
          artifact. </p>
        <p>Letting the museum/site create and host the audio content while patrons 
          supervise the care and upkeep of the players has many benefits. Beyond 
          the specifics of the History Calls project, this initial study suggests 
          several general benefits from employing a VXML-based cell phone tour 
          system, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Reducing the expense, time, and frustration 
            associated with maintaining audio players and their support systems</li>
        <li>Eliminating concerns over player damage, loss or theft</li>
        <li>Reducing the anxiety some patrons feel when using rented or unfamiliar 
          hardware</li>
        <li>Simplifying daily updates and other changes in recorded information 
        </li>
        <li>Expanding the use of audio tours into large outdoor venues where renting 
          machines might be problematic</li>
        <li>Offering voice interactivity to patrons with disabilities.</li>
      </ul>
      
        <p>Though this experiment was conducted in a museum/gallery setting, the 
          VXML system used in the project could easily be adapted to a host of 
          other cultural heritage sites and applications. The primary goal of 
          the project, to use patron hardware in delivering an automated audio 
          tour, proved successful and invites more research and trials of the 
          use of VXML and cell phone-based systems. </p>
