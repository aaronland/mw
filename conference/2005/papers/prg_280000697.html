      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>This report presents selected research results from DigiCulture, part 
            of a larger research project aimed at managing digital cultural content, 
            which was financed by Canadian Heritage during the fiscal year 2003-2004. 
            The larger project, entitled &#34;Réseau de recherche pour la gestion 
            du contenu culturel numérique&#34; (<i>Research Network for Managing 
            Digital Cultural Content</i>) was an initiative of CoRIMedia, a research 
            consortium at the Université de Sherbrooke for developing tools and 
            methods for managing multimedia content in a networked environment. 
            The project was composed of three parts: user behaviours, metadata for 
            multimedia data, and managing digital content. DigiCulture covered the 
        part focusing on user behaviours.</p>
      <p>The objective of DigiCulture was to study user behaviours in regard 
            to Canadian digital cultural content. Information science researchers 
            at the Université de Montréal, Dalhousie University, and the Université 
        Claude Bernard Lyon 1 developed six sub-projects in order to study various 
        aspects of this. A collaborative agreement was signed between the Musée 
            d&#39;art contemporain de Montréal (MACM) and the École de bibliothéconomie 
            et des sciences de l&#39;information (EBSI) at the Université de Montréal, 
            in order to frame this project and future collaborative projects. The 
            MACM was the first museum in Canada 
            devoted exclusively to contemporary art, and for many years was the 
            only one. It was used as the site for gathering data, and thus the study 
            focused on user behaviours with contemporary art materials. The six 
        sub-projects developed were:</p>
            <ol>
          <li> 
             a meta-analysis of reports the MACM had 
              commissioned on its users from its founding in 1964 to the present 
              day;</li>
          <li> 
             a profile of the clientele of the museum&#39;s 
              Médiathèque, commissioned by the MACM and produced through collaboration 
              between the researchers and a consulting firm;</li>
          <li> 
             a study of the information needs of users 
              of the Médiathèque, produced through interviews and the &#34;sense-making&#34; 
              approach;</li>
          <li> 
             modeling user needs and perceptions in 
              an environment in which users were navigating for pleasure and discovery, 
              by observing them, recording their interactions, and interviewing 
              them afterwards;</li>
          <li> 
             working out a typology of data housed 
              in various information systems at the MACM;</li>
          <li> 
             analysing the orientations, choices and 
              perceptions of digital information by museum professionals who develop 
              concepts for exhibitions and who carry out other mediation of digital 
              information.</li>
        </ol>
         
          <p>In this paper we present an overview of the project, and of sub-projects 
            1, 2, 5, and 6. Sub-projects 3 and 4 are nearing completion; the results 
            will be reported elsewhere. We report on the methodologies used and 
            give a general view of the most important findings. The work was centred 
            at the École de bibliothéconomie et des sciences de l&#39;information 
            (EBSI) at the Université de Montréal, but some also took place at other 
            sites. The themes of the sub-projects were chosen to reflect the important 
            facets of user behaviours with digital cultural materials.</p>
          <h1>Sub-Project 1: Meta-Analysis</h1>
          <p>Although most of the sub-projects involved personal interactions with 
            real users, the meta-analysis project sought to mine the user studies 
            the museum had conducted since 1964 to get a better understanding of 
            their objectives, the methods used, and their main results. The approach 
            adopted was to make an inventory of all documents related to user profiles 
            at the MACM, create a descriptive record of each, include the record 
            in the Médiathèque&#39;s catalogue, and make it available to the researchers. 
            Next, we synthesised the methods used for the studies, traced the notions 
            of information they contained, classified the questions formulated for 
            collecting data, identified the user profiles obtained and the variables 
            analysed for characterising the museum&#39;s user base, evaluated 
            the frequency and level of use of these profiles and variables, and 
            obtained data on the expectations of users of museum information.</p>
          <p>User studies are conducted for a variety of reasons. These in turn 
            influence the methodologies used. Contexts change too, and in the MACM&#39;s 
            case, some of the user studies had been undertaken for particular reasons, 
            such as a fundraising campaign or planning the move of the museum to 
            a new site. However, no inventory of the studies of the museum&#39;s 
            user base had been made over the years, nor had any ongoing review of 
            the user base been undertaken.</p>
          <p>The reports were scattered throughout the museum, and 13 were already 
            included in the Médiathèque&#39;s database. Annual reports yielded 
            references to almost as many more, for a total of 25. Because almost 
            all were available only in hard copy, the parts of the studies we wished 
            to analyse had to be digitised. These included objectives of the study, 
            entity that had carried out the study, entity that had ordered the study, 
            context, period covered, population studied, sample, number of respondents, 
            response rated, methodology, language of the questionnaire, number of 
            questions, list of the questions, average length of interviews, method 
            of processing the data, conclusions and recommendations of the study, 
            and data on user expectations. In addition, a record was made for each 
            study to include a summary of this information, in order to provide 
            an overview of the content of each study.</p>
          <p>The digitised material needed revising since there were errors in the 
            character-recognition files, most often one character being mistaken 
            for another. Some data had to be adapted or eliminated, since the N6 
            software used for the analysis could only process files in .txt format. 
            A series of codes was developed to categorise the parts of the reports 
            according to their information content. Each document was coded into 
            nodes of a tree structure developed for this purpose. The tree was revised 
            a number of times during the process of coding, with nodes being added, 
            subtracted, merged, or modified. One person did most of the coding, 
            but in order to assure consistency, intra- and inter-coder tests were 
            carried out at the beginning and throughout the process. After a number 
            of tests and after refining the definitions of the nodes, the rate of 
            inter-coder consistency went from 66% to 91%, and the intra-coder rate 
            improved from 88% to 92%.</p>
          <p>Some salient points from the meta-analysis are reported here:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
             Sampling technique used most often: random 
              soliciting of visitors exiting the museum (36%)</li>
          <li> 
             Mean number of respondents to the questionnaires: 
              551</li>
          <li> 
             Mean response rate: 57.3%</li>
          <li> 
             Language of the questionnaires: French 
              96%, English 60%</li>
          <li> 
             Mean number of questions: 24</li>
          <li> 
             Methodology used: direct contact and interview 
              (64% of the studies)</li>
          <li> 
             Objectives: user needs (57%), sociodemographic 
              profile of users (48%)</li>
          <li>Who conducted the studies: consultants from outside the MACM (72%)</li>
          <li> 
             Who ordered the studies: Communications 
              and Marketing (40%), Education and Documentation (24%)</li>
          <li> 
             Month most data was collected: August 
              (16%)</li>
          <li> 
             Month least data was collected: January 
              (3.4%)</li>
          <li>Method of data processing: 44% of studies quantitative, SPSS used 
            for 36%</li>
        </ul>
         
          <p>To date, the museum has used four user profiles: sociodemographic data, 
            data on users and leisure, data on users and the MACM, and data on users 
            and the Internet. In the 2003 study, this last profile was only touched 
            upon. Analysis of the questions in all four profiles helped to identify 
            29 variables they contained.</p>
          <p>Since the approaches and the levels of precision vary greatly among 
            the 25 reports, comparing and interpreting results require prudence. 
            However, much groundwork was accomplished in the process of completing 
            this sub-project, and the data can be further exploited as resources 
            permit. The meta-analysis has highlighted the need to systematise the 
            ongoing development of the inventory of user studies so that they can 
            continue to be compared over the years. In addition, all the questions 
            that users had been asked since 1964 were gathered, and these served 
            as the basis for constructing the questionnaire used in the second sub-project.</p>
          <h1>Sub-Project 2: Profile</h1>
          <p>This project sought to get a profile of users of the Médiathèque. Two 
            research methodologies were developed in order two study two types of 
            clientele: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> 
             an on-site survey allowed us to gather 
              data from visitors (n=103) who actually came to the Médiathèque;</li>
          <li> 
             a Web-based survey allowed us to gather 
              data from Web visitors (n=198) who visited on the Médiathèque&#39;s 
              Web site. </li>
        </ol>
         
          <p>The average time for completing the questionnaire was 8 minutes for 
            on-site visitors and almost 9 minutes for Web visitors. The data collection 
            for the two methods was carried out on the same dates.</p>
          <p>For the on-site survey, randomly-selected users forming a representative 
            sample were invited to complete the survey as they were leaving the 
            Médiathèque, on condition that they had not already done so on a previous 
            visit. Professional interviewers from the consulting firm collected 
            the data. The response rate was 75%.</p>
          <p>For the Web-based survey, a survey page inviting users to complete 
            the survey appeared when visitors landed on the Web site. Users who 
            did not wish to complete the survey were able to go directly to the 
            Médiathèque&#39;s site. In addition, cookies were used to identify 
            users who had already completed the survey so that they were not asked 
            to complete it again. The response rate was 42.9%, much higher than 
            one can usually expect with a Web-based survey.</p>
          <p>Of the clientele of the Médiathèque, 68% were women and 32% were men. 
            Users were relatively young, with 39% of them under the age of 25. Almost 
            all of them (95%) lived in the Montréal area, with a majority from the 
            city itself. However, the Médiathèque&#39;s Web site had a larger 
            number of users from outside the city, 40% being residents of places 
            other than Québec. Of these, 16% were from France. 
            French was the usual language of 75% of the visitors.</p>
          <p>Visitors tended to be educated, 60% of them holding a university degree 
            (compared to 24% of the population of Québec at large). A third of the 
            visitors had a master&#39;s degree. Interestingly, more visitors with 
            little formal education (29%) came in person than did those who visited 
            the Web site (12%). The Médiathèque attracts visitors who have studied 
            in art history and arts and letters, especially those who came in person, 
            while the Web visitors were much stronger in the plastic arts.</p>
          <p>The user profile indicates that the Médiathèque is heavily used, and 
            that the typical user is a woman under 34 who is French-speaking and 
            has a university degree. Users could be divided into two main groups 
            of about equal size: workers (46%) and students (44%). About half of 
            the workers used the Médiathèque as part of their work at the MACM itself. 
            In contrast, most of the visitors to the Web site work for organisations 
            other than museums.</p>
          <p>Among both on-site and Web-based users, 59% said they had used the 
            Médiathèque&#39;s Web site for over five years, and 92% said they 
            were at ease with navigating it; 63% said they most often accessed it 
            from home, 21% from work, and 10% from school. Users arrived at the 
            site using a variety of methods: 42% came as a result of a query to 
            a Web search engine, 21% entered via the museum&#39;s Web site, 14% 
            used a bookmark they had already made, and 11% arrived because of a 
            click they had made on another site.</p>
          <p>User satisfaction was strong, with global scores of 64% of all users 
            stating that they were satisfied or very satisfied. The main reason 
            given was the quality and relevancy of the information found. For on-site 
            visitors, 92% were satisfied or very satisfied, but the corresponding 
            figure for Web visitors was only 50%, suggesting that it would be useful 
            to make improvements to the Web site.</p>
          <p>Those who completed the survey were asked to suggest improvements. 
            The top three suggestions on-site visitors made were: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> 
             open earlier and for longer, </li>
          <li> 
             improve keyword searching, and 3. open 
              on week-ends. The top three suggestions Web users made were: 1. offer 
              a search manual for works in the museum, 2. put up photo archives 
              from past exhibitions, and </li>
          <li> 
             offer a search manual for biographical 
              information.</li>
        </ol>
         
          <h1>Sub-Project 5: Systems</h1>
          <p>This project sought to get a global idea of the MACM&#39;s digital 
            resources, which are grouped into three categories: Web sites, databases, 
            and audiovisual documents. From this, an attempt was made to identify 
            which of these resources might be of interest to MACM users, whether 
            the resources are already on-line or could be made available on-line.</p>
          <p>Three Web sites are considered here. </p>
        <ol>
          <li> 
             The MACM&#39;s Web site is the entry 
              point to the museum&#39;s resources. It includes the calendar of 
              events, general information on the institution, and information on 
              the permanent collection. In addition, it offers access to other levels 
              of information in the museum. </li>
          <li> 
             The Médiathèque&#39;s Web site focuses 
              on historical and research information available to the public. It 
              is the museum&#39;s focal point for searching, and three resources 
              it makes available are considered particularly useful: its list of 
              Web sites related to contemporary art, kept current by ongoing monitoring; 
              dissemination of biographical and bibliographic searches related to 
              the museum&#39;s exhibitions; and the directory of the museum&#39;s 
              exhibitions since 1964. </li>
          <li> 
             The third site is educational, and is 
              concerned with providing information in preparation for school visits 
              to the museum.</li>
        </ol>
         
          <p>A total of 84 internal databases were inventoried in this sub-project. 
            These can be categorised as two types: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
             bibliographical searches related to the 
              preparation of public events at the museum, and </li>
          <li>
             databases housing administrative and historical 
              information. </li>
        </ol>
        
          <p>Of these, 79 of the databases are in the Médiathèque, most of which 
            were built to house bibliographic information, using FileMaker Pro. 
            The remaining databases are found in a number of other departments or 
            as external databases housing information on the museum&#39;s collections 
            that can be consulted at the museum, including Artimage, The AMICO Library, 
            Artefacts Canada, Info-Muse, Société des Musées Québécois, and MultiMimsy. 
            These contain information on the works in the permanent collection and 
            on the documentation held at the museum. Their field structures are 
            analysed further in the context of this project.</p>
          <p>The audiovisual documents include audiocassettes; visual documents 
            such as slides, negatives, and photos; and videocassettes.</p>
          <p>In order to compare the fields in databases housing information about 
            the museum&#39;s collections and its documentation, the Canadian Heritage 
            Information Network&#39;s (CHIN&#39;s) data dictionary was chosen 
            as a starting point, since it is the oldest and is widely used. However, 
            it was developed for object and site descriptions, and this data dictionary 
            has few fields relating to documenting works and events. To meet its 
            own needs, the MACM has worked out its own data dictionary in conjunction 
            with building a centralised database of museum information. This database 
            has gone through a number of incarnations and mutations over the years, 
            and since it has not yet come to fruition, in-house systems are still 
            in use for the moment. Data is accumulating in a number of smaller databases 
            built to respond to immediate needs, and although there are some incompatibilities 
            among these databases, this ongoing temporary situation has been beneficial 
            in forcing constant revision of and reflection on how these information 
            resources meet real needs. This research project offered another reason 
            to analyse these database structures. As a first step, each field in 
            each database was compared against the CHIN data dictionary. Next, for 
            each database, the fields that had no analogue in the CHIN data dictionary 
            were compared against the field structure of the new centralised database.</p>
          <p>Data about the permanent collection of the MACM were found in 8 internal 
            and external databases. Data about documentary information were found 
            in 4 databases. Of course, each database has a different data dictionary, 
            and these were first compared against that of CHIN, then against that 
            of the new centralised database. Despite their differences, several 
            fields having to do with the description of works of art are common 
            to the databases, albeit with different field labels for the corresponding 
            entities. Over 75% of the databases had the following fields as part 
            of their structure: accession number, title, artist, object category, 
            width, height, depth, date production was completed, and transliteration 
            of the inscription. Over 50% of the databases had the following fields 
            as part of their structure: medium, support, name of the establishment, 
            number of elements, date production began, unit of linear measurement, 
            material, subject or image, exhibition title.</p>
          <p>All the databases had some unique fields with no analogue in other 
            databases because of the unique nature of the information each was built 
            to house. Some held information only on documents, while others are 
            image databases with fields built to include description metadata. The 
            large collection management database has information about loans, insurance, 
            and so on, but few fields for descriptive information about documents 
            or events. Only about 10% of its fields are found in the other database 
            structures analysed in the context of this study. </p>
          <p>One of the benefits of this study was to make an inventory of existing 
            systems. This helped highlight the differences in structures, in turn 
            reflecting different and changing needs of various museum activities. 
            Information systems need to be reviewed from time to time so they can 
            be adjusted in response to changing reality. A broader perspective of 
            information needs will clearly be of help in adjusting information systems 
            so that they can better meet the needs of their users.</p>
          <h1>Sub-Project 6: Mediators</h1>
          <p>This project sought to get input from internal users, employees of 
            the Musée d&#39;art contemporain de Montréal, and had its origins 
            in work of the museum&#39;s committee for computing, a group which 
            hopes to build an internal programming tool that can be used by employees 
            via the museum&#39;s intranet. The data analysis also constituted 
            the preparatory stage of a study of information choices, orientations, 
            and perceptions on the part of the museum&#39;s professional staff.</p>
          <p>An initial list of information fields identified in the museum&#39;s 
            project to build the internal programming tool was constructed. From 
            this list, a questionnaire to be used as the basis for structured interviews 
            was built, and pre-tests were conducted among members of the committee 
            for computing, after which adjustments were made to the questionnaire. 
            Next, the revised questionnaire was reviewed by DigiCulture researchers 
            and further adjustments were made. Twenty-two of the museum&#39;s 
            sixty-nine permanent employees, or 33,8%, were selected randomly to 
            participate in the data collection for this project. These participants 
            received the questionnaire in advance of their interviews, in order 
            to help them prepare their responses, and some arrived at the interview 
            with notes they had made. Two members of the museum&#39;s committee 
            for computing conducted the interviews, one asking the questions and 
            the other recording the responses and sometimes asking for clarification. 
            Analysis of the data involved elaborating categories emerging from the 
            responses, and then classifying the responses into these categories. 
            A matrix was built to house this information and facilitate the analysis.</p>
          <p>Six internal documents were used for the analysis. These are used in 
            the course of producing public events. It was necessary to show them 
            to the employees so they could recognise the documents, since the similar 
            titles of the documents seemed to provoke a great deal of confusion. 
            Nobody could name them all, but once the participants were presented 
            with the documents, all were easily able to confirm which ones they 
            used. Some used all six. These documents were: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
             a management document used by information 
              professionals in the Médiathèque for planning, scheduling, and coordinating 
              search activities; </li>
          <li>a calendar for booking the museum&#39;s exhibition spaces; </li>
          <li>a programming dossier used to present exhibition projects to the programming 
            committee; </li>
          <li>a production schedule, part of the programming dossier, but with more 
            widespread distribution; </li>
          <li>budget information, also part of the programming dossier, but with 
            more restricted distribution; </li>
          <li>the MACM master programming document, issued by the museum&#39;s 
            main departments, and partly available via the museum&#39;s intranet.</li>
        </ul>
        
          <p>Following are the principal results of the study that are useful to 
            report in this context. Over 68% of the respondents said that the work 
            they carried out frequently involved information seeking. In the six 
            internal documents used, 15 information zones were identified that are 
            not necessarily clearly or formally identified in the documents, or 
            that are identified in different ways from one document to another. 
            However, all these information zones are used to varying degrees, and 
            access to the information they contain is variable. Information circulates 
            in a wide variety of ways, as one would expect, especially in view of 
            the fact that some of it has strategic value. It was felt that some 
            kind of rights management should be undertaken relating to reading, 
            writing, and consulting information. In conjunction with this, it was 
            felt that there should be some method of validating information, such 
            as by recording the initial date the information was created and what 
            level of validation is applied.</p>
          <p>Museum employees use a wide variety of information sources, largely 
            digital. The preliminary findings of the study suggest that further 
            research in this area would be useful. Nine new information zones were 
            suggested by a range of museum employees (minimum 22.7%, maximum 77.2%). 
            Respondents had strict criteria for selecting information, notably accessibility, 
            currency, availability, relevance, accuracy, and reputable source. They 
            felt that about 75% of the information related to public events at the 
            museum was of interest to the public.</p>
          <p>It is useful to note some limitations of this project. As we mentioned, 
            the project was partly a response to a mandate of the museum&#39;s 
            committee for computing. From the perspective of those who program public 
            events, the study is rather exploratory. Thus some of the results should 
            be considered as indicative only, and these should be examined further 
            within the framework of a more elaborate study. Nevertheless, the results 
            obtained are valuable as input in developing a tool which will help 
            information to circulate in the context of the museum&#39;s operational 
            activities. The results of the study are more than adequate in the context 
            of its primary mandate, but as an exploratory activity to get insights 
            into programming public events, it would have been useful to record 
            the interviews and produce a transcript of them, as this would have 
            permitted more qualitative analysis. Unfortunately, resources to do 
            this were not available within the context of DigiCulture.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, however, this was the first time the information 
            needs of the museum employees were studied and analysed in a systematic 
            way. This first study suggests how useful it could be to study some 
            of these issues more closely. It is clear that there is a core of strategic 
            information available, and improving management of it would be beneficial. 
            Taking the users as a starting point to evaluate the performance of 
            information systems often reveals the spread between theory and practice. 
            The number of information zones users wished to have and their expectations 
            regarding an &#34;ideal&#34; tool are far from extravagant. The 
            project team feels making a programming tool available via the museum&#39;s 
            intranet will have a positive impact on how information circulates within 
            the museum. In addition, it will provide a solid basis for fostering 
            cooperation and the development of more efficient practices.</p>
          <h1>Discussion</h1>
          <p>The sub-projects carried out in the context of DigiCulture were a rich 
            source of information that helped us learn a great deal about user behaviours 
            in a museum environment. In sub-project 1, a great deal of work was 
            required to complete the meta-analysis, but the project resulted in 
            a rich mine of data that can be further exploited as resources are made 
            available. In addition, no such analysis had ever been undertaken at 
            the museum, and the new perspective gained from getting a view of users 
            over the years will be very helpful in planning for the future. This 
            project has highlighted the need for systematising ongoing development 
            of the inventory of user studies to permit further comparison as time 
            goes on. The methodology developed in the context of this project can 
            be used beyond the needs of DigiCulture, and this constitutes another 
            contribution of the project.</p>
          <p>Sub-project 2 provided a clear picture of the Médiathèque&#39;s users, 
            and pointed up both the degree to which some of the users leaned on 
            the Médiathèques resources and the very high degree of satisfaction 
            they expressed with its services. Workers and students in about equal 
            portions make up this specialised, faithful clientele, the majority 
            saying they had used the resources for over five years. The interviewers 
            noted that a number of on-site users remained long hours, sometimes 
            the entire span of the opening hours. One telling observation was that 
            more comfortable chairs be installed. Two of their top three suggestions 
            for improvements had to do with longer opening hours.</p>
          <p>As we noted, almost all the on-site visitors were satisfied or very 
            satisfied, but only half the Web visitors were. Undoubtedly some of 
            this is due to casual search methods such as plugging a single keyword 
            or a few keywords into a query on Web-based search engines, and another 
            part is undoubtedly due to the unsophisticated way in which search engines 
            process queries. However, this also suggests that improvements be made 
            to the organisation of the Médiathèque&#39;s Web site, as well as 
            to its content. A cursory look at the data from the logs reveals that 
            artists&#39; names and the titles of works were by far the commonest 
            keywords to bring users to the site. One can easily imagine a user trying 
            an artist&#39;s name as a keyword and hoping for pictures of works 
            by the artist, only to find as a result of a query the mention of the 
            artist&#39;s name in a bibliography. This is speculation on our part, 
            but it serves to show how we might formulate research questions in order 
            to study these logs in depth. We also need to consider the possibility 
            that the information the user was looking for was available on the site 
            but that it was not indexed in such a way that the query produced a 
            match.</p>
          <p>From a broader perspective, our results make us wonder whether we have 
            a clear picture of just how accessible content is to users. Perhaps 
            constructing a typology of digital cultural content is needed in order 
            to see just what that content is exactly, what kinds of information 
            it contains, why each piece of content is created, who uses it and why, 
            and what types of access we provide to it. Such activity might give 
            us valuable information we could compare against existing systems to 
            improve our Web-based information systems. The unusually high response 
            rate to our Web-based questionnaire is perhaps an indication of the 
            interest of the networked user community in helping us improve our systems. 
            Clearly this area should be explored further.</p>
          <p>In sub-project 5, the fact that a number of in-house systems are still 
            in use is an indicator of the dynamic nature of the needs of museum 
            staff. Earlier thinking was that an inventory of holdings and the administration 
            of them were the main reasons for automating museum systems. Such information 
            is of course essential, but it is no longer enough. The results of our 
            study support ongoing revision and reflection on the part of museum 
            staff by highlighting the need to revisit information needs from a broader 
            perspective. Clearly parallel and complementary systems serve real and 
            immediate purposes, but finding ways to integrate their information 
            content into a common system will ultimately pay off in better information 
            sharing and more efficient work flow.</p>
          <p>The needs of staff users were studied further in sub-project 6, and 
            the results point to the benefits that could be obtained if some of 
            the issues were studied more closely. We noted that employees use a 
            wide variety of information sources, most of which are already in digital 
            format. Since that is the case, emphasis might be placed on coordinating 
            the management and use of digital information. We also noted that finding 
            better ways to manage the core of strategic information available would 
            be beneficial. In addition, since staff members interviewed felt that 
            about 75% of the information related to public events at the museum 
            was of interest to the public, it might be helpful to look at ways some 
            of the information created in conjunction with the museum&#39;s programming 
            activities could be shared with the public. In this way, when the tool 
            being built becomes operational, further economies might be realized</p>
          <h1>Conclusions</h1>
          <p>This report on the general results of four of the six sub-projects 
            of DigiCulture already gives an indication of how fruitful our efforts 
            have been. Reports on the remaining sub-projects will strengthen this 
            notion, and more detailed reports on the results obtained will further 
            indicate how fertile the terrain we exploited for this project was. 
            Clearly much can be done to improve the use of Canadian digital cultural 
            content, and we hope we have pointed out some of the paths that might 
            be explored. Museums are not the only institutions worthy of study, 
            but they are very important as repositories and centres of culture.</p>
          <p>The first sub-project, providing a meta-analysis of the MACM&#39;s 
            user studies since the museum first opened, was ground-breaking in that 
            it unearthed some information which had lain dormant for almost forty 
            years, giving it new life as an element that informed other parts of 
            the study and that provides the basis for continuing analysis of user 
            needs and behaviours as the museum enters the next stage of its existence. 
            The second sub-project, providing a portrait of the clientele of the 
            museum&#39;s Médiathèque, showed just how valuable this service is 
            to those who study contemporary art, how much on-site users appreciate 
            its resources, and yet how much work remains to be done before Web-based 
            visitors will be entirely satisfied with it. The fifth sub-project highlights 
            the need for improving information systems so that the museum can carry 
            out its mandate and gives a strong indication of how difficult it is 
            to do so. Finally, the sixth sub-project highlights some of the difficulties 
            involved in harmonising information systems and in sharing information 
            both internally and externally.</p>
          <p>Some of the research paths our work has highlighted deserve to be explored 
            for their potential to offer substantial improvements to information 
            management and use. Clearly much remains to be done, but we hope our 
            work has shed some light on what that might be. </p>
