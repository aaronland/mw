        <h1>The Extended Museum Visit: Documenting and Exhibiting Post-Visit Experiences</h1>
        <h2>Gustav Taxén, The Royal Institute of Technology, and Emmanuel Frécon, 
          The Swedish Institute of Computer Science, Sweden</h2>
      <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">During the last couple of decades, 
          a growing body of research has provided insights into the complex processes 
          of learning that take place in museums. Interestingly, museum-related 
          learning is not limited to the actual visit: what takes place before 
          and afterwards has a profound effect on the learning outcome. The study 
          presented in this paper focuses on the post-visit aspects of the learning 
          process.</p>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">Previous research shows that visitors 
          make connections between their experiences in the museum and experiences 
          that happen after the visit. Sometimes these connections can occur weeks 
          or months (or even years) after the visit, depending on when the visitor 
          happens upon a situation that allows the connection to be made.</p>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">Documenting these events is obviously 
          quite difficult. Even though it is possible to re-establish contact 
          with visitors after a few weeks or months (e.g., through telephone or 
          e-mail), the information obtained is not <em>in situ</em>. The goal 
          of the present study is to attempt to acquire and analyze more data 
          from these <em>in situ</em> situations, and to re-present the data in 
          an exhibition. To this end, we have designed a system that allows visitors 
          to send images and text messages to a central server through e-mail, 
          SMS or MMS. The data from the server can then be visualized as a weblog 
          (blog) or in some other suitable form.</p>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">We collaborated with the Museum 
          of Science and Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. 
          A large part of the Museum&#39;s Science Centre is devoted to five mechanical 
          principles: the screw, the plane slope, the lever, the wheel and the 
          wedge. We have designed an exhibit that utilizes our system to present 
          messages (images and text) from visitors on the subject of the five 
          principles in the science centre itself. It is also possible to access 
          the messages through a public Web page.</p>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">From the Museum&#39;s perspective, our 
          exhibit not only provides new opportunities for documenting post-visit 
          learning processes, but also has the potential to provide new forms 
          of evaluation data that might be difficult to obtain through other means. 
          Furthermore, it allows Museum visitors to extend the original scope 
          of the mechanical principles exhibition by allowing them to provide 
          their own content (and reflections upon the existing content),  a re-occurring 
          theme in many recent technology-based exhibits.</p>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">The paper provides a description 
          of our system, the exhibit we have built, how the exhibit is managed, 
          and how it has worked in practice.</p>

        <h1>Learning In Museums</h1>
        <p>It is not uncommon for museums today to be involved in different forms 
          of educational activities, and the museum is often regarded as an important 
          tool for educating the public. However, the nature of the learning that 
          takes place in the museum has been the focus of both research and numerous 
          debates during the last few decades.</p>
        <p>A common late nineteenth century conceptualization of museum object 
          representation was that any given object could be seen as a representative 
          of its class. When designing displays, there was no room for ambiguity 
          regarding the meaning of any given object (Bennett, 1995, pp. 42-43). 
          In other words, the objects themselves and the way they were arranged 
          were seen as having the capability of communicating a certain specific 
          meaning to the visitor. This view of learning appears to have been very 
          influential until quite recently (e.g., Hooper-Greenhill, 1994) and 
          indeed, the notion of meaning as something encoded in the design of 
          an exhibition has been embodied within numerous communication models 
          for museums since the 1970s (ibid). A common assumption in these models 
          is that the visitor can later decode the designer&#39;s message that has 
          been encoded into an exhibition or exhibit. When this decoding does 
          not take place (or when it becomes erroneous), it is considered to be 
          the result of different kinds of interference, both with respect to 
          the exhibition itself (e.g., signs may have such a small font that they 
          become difficult to read) or with respect to other visitors (e.g., another 
          visitor moved in front of a sign as it was being read).</p>
        <p>However, such models of interpretation have recently been criticized 
          by researchers who argue that more holistic perspectives are required. 
          More specifically, it is claimed that museum visitors should be thought 
          of as active interpreters rather than as passive message decoders: their 
          background, previous experiences, current wishes, expectations and motivation 
          towards the subject at the time of the visit are factors that heavily 
          influence the learning outcome (e.g., Hooper-Greenhill, 1994; Caulton, 
          1996; Hein, 1998). In addition, learning does not just depend on the 
          interplay between the exhibition and the visitor: other physical and 
          social circumstances of the visit shape the learning process to a large 
          extent (Falk &amp; Dierking, 2000). So rather than focusing on the exhibition 
          as embodying a specific message (encoded by the exhibition designer), 
          these authors instead tend to focus on the museum visitor as a unique 
          individual who creates individualized meaning from the exhibit by way 
          of the interplay between the personal, social and physical circumstances 
          of the visit.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the learning process does not appear to end when visitors 
          leave the museum; in fact, it seems that many people continue to construct 
          new knowledge from their visit for long periods of time. Indeed, it 
          seems that many people draw conclusions that are related to their visit 
          <em>outside</em> the museum, after the visit, when they encounter a 
          situation that allows them to &#39;make a connection&#39; (ibid.,  4-10). Documenting 
          these situations is, naturally, quite difficult. Falk and Dierking mention 
          a number of studies where researchers have telephoned visitors some 
          time after the visit and asked them to recall the museum visit and describe 
          how it has shaped later encounters and experiences. Although important 
          and valid, this data consists of the learners&#39; recollection of their 
          experiences; there is typically no hard data from the actual situation 
          itself (e.g., video or tape recordings). Thus, one of the goals of the 
          study presented in this paper was to see whether it was possible to 
          obtain such <em>in situ</em> data through the help of modern communication 
          technology.</p>
        <p>We work with the Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm. The 
          specific target of our study is a collection of exhibits in the museum&#39;s 
          science center called the <em>Mighty Five</em>. These exhibits illustrate 
          five mechanical principles: the screw, the plane slope, the lever, the 
          wheel, and the wedge. The museum has been planning a re-design of its 
          science center for some time, and is currently evaluating the exhibits. 
          Thus, our work had the opportunity to provide data that might support 
          the evaluation process. One of the early results of the evaluation is 
          that many visitors fail to grasp the way the exhibits relate to one 
          another (i.e., that they constitute a set of different, yet interrelated 
          mechanical principles). By exhibiting examples of situations when the 
          <em>Mighty Five</em> have been discovered outside the museum, we hoped 
          that we would be able to provide additional context for supporting the 
          conceptual integration of the exhibits in the room.</p>
        <h1>Exhibit Description</h1>
        <p>Our work began with a pre-study where we developed the initial idea 
          for our exhibit: a sort of logbook where visitors could record their 
          museum-related experiences through cell phone SMS and MMS messaging. 
          The reason for focusing on SMS messages was that cell phones are ubiquitous 
          devices today: most people (even rather young children) own one, or 
          have constant access to one. It is a device that most people find natural 
          and easy to use, and SMS messaging is a well-known and popular communication 
          feature. Mobile telephones with cameras and multimedia messaging capabilities 
          are also becoming rather common, and would provide an additional data 
          channel for our visitor contributions as well.</p>
        <p>In order to judge the feasibility for such an exhibit, we began by 
          interviewing a small number of students and adults. The questions were 
          very open-ended, but mainly focused on the issue of motivation; i.e., 
          what would be enough to motivate a person to send an SMS message to 
          a museum exhibit? The answers indicated that for some people, the ability 
          to shape an exhibition in a museum and have other people read one&#39;s 
          opinions in the museum would be enough. For other people, some sort 
          of competition or explicit task was felt to be required. We also looked 
          at other similar applications that appeared to be successful. For example, 
          <em>City</em>, a free newspaper published in the Stockholm area, features 
          a daily SMS-chat column to which anyone can contribute: with a bit of 
          luck, the message will appear in print next morning. These initial investigations 
          suggested that it might be worthwhile to develop a prototype exhibit.</p>
        <h2>The Prototype</h2>
        <p>Our first design consisted of a large white book into which text was 
          projected using a computer projector. By pushing at the edges of the 
          book, it was possible to &#39;turn the page&#39;. Each &#39;chapter&#39; in the book 
          corresponded to one of the <em>Mighty Five</em>. Chapter selection was 
          done by placing one of five prepared phicons (physical icons) (Ishii 
          &amp; Ullmer, 1997), each corresponding to one of the <em>Mighty Five</em>, 
          on to an RFID tag reader. The book had the capability of receiving SMS, 
          MMS and (for completeness) e-mail messages, and each new message was 
          added as a paragraph in the book. A &#39;live&#39; copy of the book could also 
          be accessed from the WWW.</p>
        <p>The prototype was exhibited at two public events: the first was at 
          the annual Open House at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science, 
          and the second was at a project evaluation event at the Stockholm Concert 
          Hall. We estimate that roughly 150 visitors used the prototype during 
          these two events. The outcome of the first event was encouraging, although 
          it became obvious that the user interface for page-turning was quite 
          awkward in practice. As a result, we chose a new metaphor for the exhibit 
          – that of a book scroll – and the page-turning interface 
          was replaced by a handle for &#39;scrolling&#39; the text forwards and backwards. 
          The new prototype was received favorably at the second event, and the 
          new handle-based interface seemed to work well. Thus, we decided to 
          build a version suitable for exhibition.</p>
        <h2>Exhibition Version</h2>
        <p>The resulting exhibit is designed as follows. The core of the exhibit 
          is an off-the-shelf weblog (blog) installation (currently WordPress, 
          <a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org/">http://wordpress.org/</a>) 
          with two different output channels. Apart from being available as a 
          Web site like any other blog, the blog is visualized differently in 
          the museum. The exhibit itself is designed to suggest a magic book scroll 
          on which visitors can read the messages currently available (figure 
          1). Each message is drawn in a hand-written style and can contain any 
          number of pictures (figure 2). The messages are marked with the date 
          and time of their arrival. A wooden lever can be turned to scroll through 
          the book. One chapter at a time is shown; and chapter changing is done 
          by placing a wooden phicon on top of a large circular target (figure 
          3). The phicons have shapes that are intended to be reminiscent of the 
          <em>Mighty Five</em> and are color coded. The visuals are projected 
          from above using a computer projector, giving the book an attractive 
          surface glow. Because the exhibit makes use of RFID tags, the phicons 
          do not have any visible wires or buttons: the effect contributes to 
          the overall feeling of magic that we wanted to achieve. The design of 
          the Web site attempts to offer enough cues so as to connect the site 
          back to the exhibit (figure 4): hand-written titles, icons that resemble 
          the wooden phicons and with the same color codes, etc.</p>

          of January 2005.</p>
        <p>A poster and a stand with pocket-sized explanatory leaflets are positioned 
          next to the exhibit. They illustrate how messages arrive at the book 
          and also describe how visitors can contribute their own content. The 
          leaflet also lists relevant phone numbers and email addresses and provides 
          the URL for the WWW version of the book. </p>
        <p>The user interface of the exhibit consists of two input devices. The 
          first is an optical USB mouse that is hidden in the right-hand-side 
          of the book scroll. When the lever is turned, the mouse registers the 
          motion as mouse pointer movement, which is used to determine how much 
          to move the book text. The second input device is an RFID tag reader 
          which is hidden under the front side of the table on which the scroll 
          is positioned. This device recognizes RFID tags that have been embedded 
          into the five wooden phicons. Whenever the tag reader status changes, 
          a report is sent to the visualization system which, in turn, changes 
          the book chapter accordingly.</p>
        <p>The same phone number is used for SMS and MMS contributions. Chapter 
          differentiation is made by using the first word of the message or the 
          subject header (which is assumed to correspond to the name of one of 
          the five mechanic principles). Extended SMS messages (i.e., longer than 
          160 characters) are accepted. For e-mail contributions there is one 
          specific address for each of the <em>Mighty Five</em>. MMS messages 
          and e-mails may also contain pictures. Currently, all content is sent 
          to the blog without moderation, although current Web technologies would 
          make it simple to supervise new entries. Once an inappropriate message 
          has been discovered by the museum staff, it can immediately be removed 
          using any standard Web browser.</p>
        <h2>mBlog</h2>
        <p>From a technical point of view, the core of our exhibit is mBlog, a 
          system for mobile blogging being developed at the Swedish Institute 
          of Computer Science (Frécon, 2003), together with a set of programs 
          for the supervision of overall system behaviour. There are a number 
          of existing solutions for so-called moblogging, i.e. the ability to 
          send content to a blog from mobile terminals. For example, NewBay Software 
          markets FoneBlog (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newbay.com/">http://www.newbay.com/</a>) 
          to mobile operators, and a number of blogging systems have an e-mail 
          input interface, including TypePad/MovableType (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.movabletype.org/">http://www.movabletype.org/</a>) 
          and WordPress (<a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org/">http://wordpress.org/</a>). 
          Our system, however, differentiates itself through a very flexible architecture 
          and its ability to adapt to any blogging back-end that supports the 
          XMLRPC API (Winer, 2002). The system associates one separate operating 
          system process to each core task that it has to perform. There is, for 
          example, one process for SMS reception, one for the transformation of 
          SMS into blog entries, one for e-mail reception, one for the transformation 
          of e-mail messages into blog entries, and so on. A text based communication 
          protocol, with a separate set of commands for each process, is used. 
          This simplifies remote maintenance and allows the system to be run across 
          multiple computers for efficiency. All client-server connections have 
          a basic level of security that is based on the allowance or denial of 
          connecting hosts.</p>
        <h3>Robustness</h3>
        <p>For robustness, the system has several self-monitoring technical solutions 
          with a number of error recovery capabilities. These solutions also produce 
          reports when something does not work as intended. Connections between 
          processes are kept alive on a continuous basis: as soon as a client 
          discovers that a server has disappeared, it will periodically attempt 
          to reconnect until it succeeds. Also, a special supervision process 
          manages all processes that are part of the system. This supervision 
          process ensures that the other processes restart in case of error and 
          also provides a common context of execution, which provides the ability 
          for text-file logging and resource management. The system also provides 
          a number of commands for remote operation: manually restarting processes, 
          polling for their presence, forwarding their currently logged output, 
          etc. Furthermore, the system operator is automatically warned through 
          e-mail if any run-time errors or failures occur.</p>
        <h3>Data Integrity</h3>
        <p>Data integrity is another key aspect of the mBlog system. All processes 
          that accept input from other devices or processes work using spoolers. 
          Once received, the data is immediately copied to the <em>inbox</em> 
          spooler area. Each process separately monitors this area, and manipulated 
          data is copied to the <em>outbox</em> or <em>error</em> spooler area. 
          Data recovery is then a matter of copying a file from the appropriate 
          directory. Furthermore, all process activity is extensively logged, 
          database backups are done at a regular basis, and the log of the behavior 
          of the processes at the museum exhibit is dynamically copied back to 
          our local network,  allowing analysis of, e.g., user interface usage.</p>
        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>Our museum exhibit was assigned a location directly to the left of 
          the entrance to the room containing the <em>Mighty Five</em> exhibition, 
          underneath an existing poster that outlines the contents of the room 
          (figure 5). To the right of our exhibit are a classic blocks-and-tackles 
          exhibit and a larger exhibit that is intended to illustrate the principle 
          of the screw. To the left, directly in front of the entrance, is an 
          exhibit featuring a number of interconnecting cogs of different shapes. 
          In the center of the room is a partly enclosed area with different toys, 
          slides, and smaller exhibits, and the rest of the room is devoted to 
          larger exhibits, most related to the <em>Mighty Five</em>.</p>

        <p class="caption">Fig 5: Surroundings of the book scroll exhibit at the 
          Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm.</p>
        <p>In order to get the ball rolling, we wrote a number of messages for 
          each of the five categories ourselves (e.g., &#39;here is a sort of lever&#39; 
          together with an image of a playground see-saw or &#39;a playground slide 
          is a form of plane slope&#39;). We then left the exhibit alone for a couple 
          of weeks (with the exception of correcting a few technical issues that 
          arose early on). Our first authentic message appeared after approximately 
          one week: &#34;Hello! We from class 7AL have done research on the Mighty 
          Five. Lever: a pair of scales is a lever. Cheers from Niklas, Michael 
          and George.&#34; This was very encouraging, but unfortunately no further 
          messages appeared, so we decided to observe visitor behaviour at the 
          exhibit.</p>
        <h1>Observations</h1>
        <p>We observed visitors in the science center for a total of approximately 
          five hours spread over two days, and recorded our observations as notes 
          and still images (unfortunately, no video or audio recordings were allowed 
          – it is against the museum&#39;s privacy policy).</p>
        <p>The science center audience is quite heterogeneous. Most visitors are 
          children and appear to be between 2 and 18 years old, and normally one 
          or several adults accompany the children. The younger children almost 
          exclusively devoted themselves to the playground in the center of the 
          room and very few paid our exhibit any notice. Older children and adults 
          typically discovered our exhibit on their way to or from the blocks-and-tackles 
          or screw exhibits, but we estimate that it was overlooked by roughly 
          30-40% of the visitors that went by. It was more common for adults to 
          take note of our exhibit than for children, and this often happened 
          when they were waiting for their children to finish examining one of 
          the nearby exhibits.</p>
        <p>Of those who did interact with our exhibit, most seemed to investigate 
          the workings of the user interface (i.e., tried to put a different category 
          of  blocks at different locations in the exhibit to see what would happen). 
          A common tactic was to place the blocks on to the projection itself 
          (where the corresponding shapes are drawn), an action which unfortunately 
          does not achieve anything. Some tried to turn the handle before positioning 
          one of the blocks on the tag reader, also with  no direct visual effect. 
          Consequently, we have marked the active elements of the user interface 
          more clearly in red, which appears to have had a positive effect. Of 
          those visitors who did open a chapter in the book, a minority seemed 
          to actually read the content. Also, few visitors seemed to read the 
          poster or the leaflets. Indeed, very few visitors seemed to read any 
          of the written texts that appear elsewhere in the room. We are currently 
          experimenting with different ways of adding non-textual usage instructions 
          (e.g., cartoons) into the book itself.</p>
        <p>On a more positive note, we have evidence that for visitors who do 
          read the messages, our exhibit has the potential to support the other 
          exhibits in the room. For example, the images below show a woman and 
          a girl who, after some experimentation, managed to position a phicon 
          on to the tag reader to uncover one of the message categories. They 
          then went on to read the messages together (figure 6). During this activity 
          one identified and pointed to exhibits in the room that corresponded 
          to the different messages she and her companion discovered in the book 
          (figure 7). Thus, our exhibit allowed the two visitors to connect the 
          other exhibits to everyday objects and machinery in the &#39;real world&#39;, 
          suggesting that our exhibit has the potential to provide a more substantial 
          context for the exhibits in the science center than what was available 
          previously.</p>

        <h1>Dealing With The Lack Of Contributions</h1>
        <p>Based on the results of the pre-study, we had prepared for the possibility 
          of not receiving any messages to analyze by arranging for a contest 
          as an additional motivation. Since no new messages appeared, we announced 
          that we would distribute 10 movie tickets among the contributions that 
          arrived during a week-long period in connection with the Christmas school 
          holiday. A sign that informed visitors of the competition was added 
          to the exhibit. We also visited the museum in person, explaining the 
          exhibit to visitors and encouraging them to contribute. The response 
          was very favorable with regards to the exhibit itself and its core ideas, 
          but unfortunately, no further visitor contributions appeared. </p>
        <p>We always knew that there was a definite possibility that no messages 
          would arrive, but the poor outcome of the contest was nevertheless rather 
          surprising. At the time of writing, we have no data to support an analysis 
          of why visitors chose not to contribute, but we speculate that the reasons 
          may include the following.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Not a single mischievous message has appeared (apart from a small 
          number of automated spam e-mails), suggesting that it may be hard for 
          the visitors to understand that it is possible to actively contribute 
          to our exhibit. Contributing requires reading instructions, either on 
          the poster (or leaflets), or on the exhibit itself, and therefore our 
          exhibit suffers from the phenomenon that text in general seems to be 
          ignored in the <em>Mighty Five</em> room.</li>
        <li> 
           It appears that visitors tend to treat 
            the <em>Mighty Five</em> room as a playground with pedagogical opportunities 
            rather than as a room for learning. A minority of the adults we observed 
            took the opportunity to explain to their children the principles represented 
            by the different exhibits in the room. Rather, they would focus on 
            the practicalities of the exhibits (e.g., help the children work a 
            lever or tell them which button to push).</li>
        <li> 
           Our exhibit appears to be hard to notice 
            in its current location.</li>
        <li>Our target audience is slightly older than the majority of children 
          who  visit the science center.</li>
        <li> 
           Although many of the children and adults 
            we spoke to at the museum were quite enthusiastic about a <em>Mighty 
            Five treasure hunt</em> outside the museum, none actually went through 
            with the activity. It may be that for many people, the museum visit 
            ends when they leave the building, (i.e., it has no conscious post-visit 
            phase where the experiences of the visit are developed and elaborated 
            upon). Even if a situation is recognized as a museum-related learning 
            experience, it may be difficult to remember our exhibit (not to mention 
            finding the leaflet with the instructions for contributing). Or it 
            may simply be that the opportunity to win a movie ticket does not 
            constitute enough motivation for contributing.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>In summary, we have had to conclude that for our given context, obtaining 
          visitor contributions in the manner we intended is very difficult indeed. 
          Consequently, we have decided to focus on other forms of contributions, 
          such as engaging school classes in task-based activities. </p>
        <h2>A Treasure Hunt</h2>
        <p>The first activity we initiated was a treasure hunt activity that involved 
          two 6th grade classes (12 year olds) with 27 and 10 children, respectively.</p>
        <p>The activity itself was designed and hosted by a member of the museum&#39;s 
          educational staff, and it began in the science center&#39;s multimedia theatre 
          where (after a short introduction) the <em>Mighty Five</em> was presented 
          using a large notepad and models. Then, the children were divided into 
          five groups (one for each <em>Mighty</em>) and were asked to find an 
          example in the museum&#39;s machine hall, a large area in the science center 
          that contains numerous machines and machine components, engines, vehicles 
          and models. Each group was given a small notepad for writing something 
          about the find. The groups then searched for roughly 20 minutes (the 
          museum staff member and the teachers were present throughout to assist 
          when necessary). When a group had found an example, they were given 
          a digital camera and were asked to record their find. When all groups 
          were done, we collected the notepads and asked the children to go back 
          to the science center to examine the <em>Mighty Five</em> exhibits there. 
          Meanwhile, we e-mailed the children&#39;s notes and pictures to our book 
          scroll exhibit, and notified the children when all messages had appeared.</p>
        <p>It appears that the activity was largely successful: the children seemed 
          to enjoy the hunt, and both teachers and museum personnel were satisfied. 
          Indeed, the teachers expressed an interest in continuing the activity 
          in school (including reporting new sightings to the book scroll), and 
          the museum has asked us to extend the time our exhibit is on display 
          so that they can design a new pedagogical program around it. </p>
        <p>It should be noted that most of the children had not heard previously 
          of the mechanical principles such as those represented by the <em>Mighty 
          Five</em>, although of course the wheel and the screw were familiar 
          to everyone. This means that for this age group, the pedagogical potential 
          of the activity largely involved allowing the children to discover the 
          ubiquitousness of the <em>Mighty Five</em>. By drawing attention towards 
          fundamental and common mechanical principles, it may be possible to 
          lay the foundation for increased motivation for learning more about 
          how they work. In such a context, our exhibit has the potential to become 
          a growing collection of &#39;sightings&#39; that illustrate how frequently the 
          mechanical principles presented in the science center appear in everyday 
          life.</p>
        <p>Although we did not obtain enough data to analyze the learning outcome 
          of the treasure hunt activity (we had originally intended to use Grounded 
          Theory [e.g., Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998] as a method for organizing 
          and analyzing visitor contributions), the 10 messages we did receive 
          are nevertheless quite interesting. The texts can be divided into 5 
          categories: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Texts that copy the label of the exhibit 
            corresponding to the find, in part or in whole (4 messages).</li>
        <li>
           Texts that explain why the image in the 
            message constitutes a find (2 messages).</li>
        <li>
           Texts that, in a single word, describe 
            the type of machinery shown in the image (2 messages).</li>
        <li>
           Texts that explain how the mechanical 
            principle represented by the find works in this particular case (1 
            message).</li>
        <li>
           No text at all (1 message).</li>
      </ol>
      
        <p>The images associated with the texts contain either a depiction of 
          the group&#39;s find (8 messages), or a depiction of the group itself in 
          front of (or behind) their find (2 messages). </p>
        <p>In our interpretation, the messages illustrate that the children are 
          about to take the step from being able to recognize and name simple 
          mechanical principles to being able to describe how these work. The 
          fact that two groups decided to depict themselves in their images is 
          also interesting. The children were quite enthusiastic in general about 
          being able to contribute to a real museum exhibit and, not surprisingly, 
          being able to see a depiction of oneself in the exhibit supported and 
          strengthened this enthusiasm. We interpret this as a partial confirmation 
          of one of the conclusions we drew in our pre-study: that, for a visitor, 
          being able to shape and influence a museum exhibit can be a motivating 
          factor for contributing content.</p>
        <h1>Conclusions and Future Work</h1>
        <p>On the one hand, it seems clear that for our given context, it is very 
          difficult – if not impossible – to motivate visitors to 
          contribute with SMS/MMS/e-mail messages outside the museum in the way 
          we intended, unless they agree to do this as part of a special activity 
          of some sort. The reasons for this are probably numerous. We have already 
          identified a number of problematic issues with the design and placement 
          of our exhibit, and we have begun to address them. Even if a museum-related 
          learning situation is recognized as such by a visitor outside the museum, 
          there is probably no real motivation for bothering with picking up the 
          cell phone, finding the leaflet and sending a message. However, other 
          forms of obtaining <em>in situ</em> data, such as cultural probes (Gaver 
          &amp; Dunne, 1999) and technology probes (Hutchinson et al., 2003) have 
          been very successful in other contexts, and adopting them for the museum 
          learning context may be a suitable topic for a future study.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, our exhibit clearly has pedagogical benefits for 
          the museum. We have evidence that it has the potential to offer a &#39;real 
          life&#39; context for the mechanical principles presented in the science 
          center, and the exhibit appears to be very useful as a target for pedagogical 
          activities within the museum. We intend to continue to work with the 
          museum to develop new activities that involve our exhibit. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, the mBlog system has worked very well in practice, and 
          we envision numerous other museum-related applications with our system 
          as a key component. One idea is to add a <em>Q and A station</em> to 
          key exhibits in the museum, where visitors could submit questions related 
          to the exhibit and receive answers from museum experts, either directly 
          at the station or later (through SMS, e-mail, or the WWW). Previously 
          asked questions (and answers) could be accessed in a similar way as 
          in our book scroll exhibit.</p>
        <p>Finally, we hope that our experiment serves as an illustration of the 
          fact that non-standard forms of exhibits and exhibitions may require 
          iterative design <em>in place</em>, after they have officially been 
          opened to the public. Even if pre-studies and prototypes show that such 
          exhibits may be feasible, it may be necessary to modify (or even replace) 
          parts of them while they are on display. In situations like these, it 
          may also help to involve visitor representatives directly in the design 
          process (Taxén, 2004, Taxén et al., 2003).</p>
