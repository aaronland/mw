      <h1>Search Engines and On-line Museum Access on the Web</h1>
      <h2>Teresa Numerico, Jonathan P. Bowen, London South Bank University, 
            United Kingdom and 
        Silvia Filippini-Fantoni, Université Paris I - Sorbonne, France</h2>
      <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
      <p id="abstract">We can consider Web browsing as a similar experience 
            to visiting a museum, when we take decisions about where to stop and 
            where to skip over the exhibited objects. This is the same in museums; 
            there are some tools available to help people select what they want 
            to see such as maps, brochures, etc. Just as in a real museum, where 
            maps and brochures help people organize their visit, search engines 
            support the user in their navigation on the Web by assisting them in 
            finding the most relevant material, while ignoring the rest. The Web 
            is a unique &#34;museum&#34; where there are all sorts of data, including 
            multimedia objects, so it is particularly crucial to respect the potentially 
            different attitudes of users that may have various interests and different 
            perspectives. (This is once again the same in museums.) The role of 
            search engines is particularly problematic because they have to guarantee 
            the efficiency of the service without betraying the multiplicity of 
        users&#39; purposes. </p>
      <p id="abstract">The aim of this paper is to show the result of testing 
            the difficulty of access to useful museum-related resources that are 
            not very well known, but contain relevant information when search engines 
            and other query techniques are used. We will show that many museum Web sites 
            and databases belong to the hidden part of the Web that is not accessible 
            unless the precise URL is known. We will discuss some practical issues 
            on finding museum information and how museums could improve their search 
            rankings and their own searching facilities, especially with respect 
        to the widely used Google search engine.</p>
      <p id="abstract">Further, we will introduce some promising solutions for 
            finding museums&#39; Web sites and searching within them, such as Peer-to-Peer 
            (P2P) search tools, intelligent agents that are specialized for information 
            retrieval using &#34;clustering&#34; strategies based on user preferences, 
            as well as systems of collaborative filtering and collaborative categorization 
        from user experiences and judgments, allowing a personalized search.</p>
      <p id="abstract">All these alternative methods have only a little in common, 
            but share the characteristics of respecting the decentralized and dynamic 
            topology of the Web, while search engines are based on traditional techniques 
            of information retrieval; namely, strategies to access pre-structured 
            data using the appropriate pre-established queries. The Web cannot be 
            compared to a repository of structured data; it requires the development 
            of innovative approaches and methods that take into account its chaotic 
            nature. For all these reasons we do not consider the metadata solution 
            here in detail, despite its role in searching specific museum collections 
            on-line; we believe that there are interesting alternative methods to 
        investigate for the future.</p>
      <p id="keywords">Keywords: search engines, queries, mapping on the Web, 
        the hidden part of the Web</p>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Search engines play the role of mediators in accessing information, 
            providing the &#34;guided tours&#34; to visitors by letting them have 
            access to (and also preventing them from accessing) the available on-line 
            content. As in all other surfing experiences, users of museum Web sites 
            are very likely to obtain information on where to look on line via a 
            search engine. This gives an enormous power and a huge responsibility 
            to the companies involved, because they &#34;create&#34; and bias 
            the browsing experience of users by offering a choice of Web sites that 
            is unique for a given search engine, outside of which there is potentially 
            only chaos and incomprehensible noise. The question that arises spontaneously 
            from this premise is: how fair is this Web &#34;guided tour&#34; with 
            regard to museums and exhibitions that are not very well known and not 
            likely to become popular, or with famous museums whose Web sites are 
            not conceived to be retrieved by search engines effectively? Is there 
            no other solution than to use a search engine like Google (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com</a>), the most successful 
            search engine at the moment in terms of popularity and commercial achievement 
        (Cusumano, 2005), to look for a museum Web site?</p>
      <p>Here we concentrate on search engine technology that does not use metadata 
        (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/Metadata">http://www.w3.org/Metadata</a>). This is because 
            we believe that, while it is possible to use metadata effectively in 
            a limited situation like a museum collection covering a particular area, 
            it will far more difficult to scale this up to whole of the Web. This 
            would require on-line librarians to attempt to keep up with the Web&#39;s 
            contents, which are both dynamically changing and expanding at an increasingly 
            rapid rate. Simple metadata, such as a title, description and keywords, 
            are possible, and are included in many existing Web pages. However, 
            more complicated metadata is ignored by many existing search engines 
            and is unlikely to be included in a uniform manner across the entire 
            Web. The &#34;Semantic Web&#34; (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw">http://www.w3.org/2001/sw</a>, 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.semanticweb.org/">http://www.semanticWeb.org</a>), 
            proposed by Tim Berners-Lee and others at the World Wide Web Consortium 
            (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org</a>), is likely to be successful in 
            specific areas – e.g., XML-based RSS (Really Simple Syndication or RDF 
            Site Summary, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(protocol)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(protocol)</a>) 
            newsfeeds (Bowen et al., 2003) – but universal dispersion across the 
        entire Web will be much harder to achieve.</p>
      <p>One approach that can improve searching of the Web is to limit the 
            domain to a particular area of interest. For example, facilities searching 
            for on-line academic publications are improving as there is more collaboration 
            between publishers. See CrossRef (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.crossref.org/">http://www.crossref.org</a>) 
            that is using Digital Object Identifiers (DOI, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier</a>) 
            to identify articles as part of their metadata in a similar manner to 
            Universal Resource Locators (URL, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL</a>) 
            for Web resources, to which DOIs can easily be resolved (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/" target="_blank">http://dx.doi.org</a>). Google (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com</a>) is now providing searching 
            of academic papers in a similar but more specialized manner to its more 
            general Web search facilities (<a target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/">http://scholar.google.com</a>). 
            It is also providing other specialized facilities such as searching 
        of individual personal computers (<a target="_blank" href="http://desktop.google.com/">http://desktop.google.com</a>).</p>
      <p>An alternative more general solution to help with the problem of retrieving 
            important information on the Web is to use one or more &#34;metasearch&#34; 
        engines (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine</a>), 
            tools that do not maintain their own repository of Web pages, but rather 
            compare the search of various engines, removing any duplicate pages. 
            See, for example, Vivisimo (<a target="_blank" href="http://vivisimo.com/">http://vivisimo.com</a>), 
            which clusters results into categories so that it is easier to browse 
            them), Ixquick (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ixquick.com/">http://www.ixquick.com</a>), 
            Metacrawler (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.metacrawler.com/">http://www.metacrawler.com</a>) 
            and Dogpile (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dogpile.com/">http://www.dogpile.com</a>), 
            although beware of the lack of separation between paying Web sites and 
            high ranking results for these last two sites. There are also tools 
            that offer some deeper search capabilities such as Surfwax (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.surfwax.com/">http://www.surfwax.com</a>) 
            or Copernic (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.copernic.com/">http://www.copernic.com</a>), 
            which must be downloaded and installed, but the basic version is free.

      <p>In this paper we first consider the background 
        to the current situation from a philosophical standpoint and the problems 
        that can be encountered because of the disorganized nature of the Web 
        and the lack of universal semantic content. We consider practical aspects 
        of searching with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/">Google search 
            engine</a>, including some specific case study examples illustrating 
            some of the issues of using search engines in a museum context. We also 
            cover some practical issues in gaining a better search 
            engine ranking for museum Web sites. After discussing the problems 
            of metadata, we finish with consideration 
            of future developments: 
            the use of personalization facilities 
            in searching Web (Bowen &amp; Filippini-Fantoni, 2004), &#34;push&#34; technology and how search 
            technology could develop using the Peer-to-Peer
            approach, followed by a short conclusion. 
            If desired, and depending of the interests of the reader, these various 
        aspects can be read separately.</p>
      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>The Web can be considered as a potential source of all our knowledge, 
            but viewed in this perspective it has some disadvantages. The main limitation 
            is that the Web is a kind of enormous Borgesian Library of Babel, a 
            modern labyrinth where we can remain trapped in peripheral or even in 
            central areas, because of the huge overload of information accessible 
        and the general chaos of its organization. </p>
      <p>The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite 
            and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts 
            between, surrounded by very low railings. From any of the hexagons one 
            can see, interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution 
            of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per 
            side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance 
            from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase. One 
            of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another 
            gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and 
            right of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, 
            one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy one&#39;s fecal necessities. 
            Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and 
            soars upwards to remote distances. In the hallway there is a mirror 
            which faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men usually infer from 
            this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory 
            duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent 
            and promise the infinite ... Light is provided by some spherical fruit 
            which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in 
        each hexagon. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant <span class="BlockQuoteAuthorChar">(Borges, 1941).</span><em> </em></p>
      <p>The experience of the labyrinth described by this short novel gives 
            a very good flavor of the emotions that users have when they face the 
            so-called &#34;navigation problem&#34;: they feel lost and sometimes 
            trapped in cyberspace because they do not know where they are, what 
            the context of the piece of information that they are reading is, where 
            to go next in order to pursue the process they have started to acquire 
            the right information, and how to go back to the pages they have already 
        visited (Nielsen, 1990; Levene &amp; Wheeldon, 2002).</p>
      <p>Many users feel powerless with respect to the complexity of information 
            available. So the only possible way to avoid  chaos is to rely on search 
            engine &#34;intelligence&#34; to correctly interpret their queries, 
            adequately represent the Web’s resources and efficiently communicate 
            the relevant results available on-line. However we must be careful because 
            of the key filter role represented by search engines, giving a unique 
        interface with the entire Babel/Web library. </p>
      <p>The key role of creating an index of Web documents, if perceived as 
            the world&#39;s archives, is a critical and sensitive one. In order to explain 
            this role, we consider the insightful interpretation of the archive 
            and archivists&#39; importance in society made by the 20th century philosopher 
            Jacques Derrida, who died in 2004.  The term archive is related to the 
            Greek word arkhē, which has two meanings: commencement and commandment. 
            An &#34;archive&#34; keeps both these senses in its meaning, because 
            it is related to the memory and cultural heritage of a people, as well 
            as a catalogue providing an index by which all these memories can be 
            consulted in a useful way by people in the future. Archivists and museum 
            curators perform very powerful roles viewed from this perspective. According 
        to Derrida:</p>
      <p class="blockquote">They do not only ensure the physical security 
            of what is deposited and of the substrate. They are also accorded the 
            hermeneutic right and competence. They have the power to interpret the 
        archives. (Derrida (1996: 2)</p>
      <p>If we accept that all the relevant documents for the memory of all 
            the people in the world could be kept on the Web, then those who create 
            the index and the repository to make it all accessible hold huge power. 
            Such considerations are not well understood by the general public, but 
            experts in cultural heritage and museum curators should be more aware 
            of such issues. Moreover, due to their traditional area of expertise, 
            they should be in a good position to contribute to the debate, offering 
            potentially interesting solutions to the problem not only with regards 
            to their specific domain of interest, such as the conservation and the 
            exploitation of cultural heritage documents and objects, but also more 
            generally with respect to knowledge management. This is why we believe 
            that museum professionals provide an important readership for the subject 
        matter in this paper. </p>
      <p>In summary, search engines are the only really viable solution to navigation 
            problems on the Web, but unfortunately they have some limitations. Let 
            us now go more deeply into the details of the difficulties encountered 
            by someone trying to access the Web for the purpose of retrieving useful 
            material, and see the possible remedies that can be built in order to 
        remove the obstacles.</p>
      <h2>Search Engine Limitations</h2>
      <p>All search engines are necessarily partial in their choice of resources 
        presented to the user for a number of different reasons. For example:</p>
          <ol>
          <li> 
             There is a time limit in the capabilities of 
              crawlers (the intelligent software agents that explore the Web to 
              keep track, catalogue and classify Web sites). They take time to explore 
              the Internet and the growth of the Web is around 7.5 million new documents 
              per day; this means that the view presented by search engines can 
              never be completely up to date.</li>
          <li> 
             There is a language problem; most of the catalogued 
              resources are in English, but there are huge amounts of resources 
              in other languages. Search engines tent to privilege English language 
              resources because they dominate the Web.</li>
          <li> 
             The standard search engines are text based and 
              not image, sound or video based; it is difficult to catalogue the 
              resources based on other media, although there are some initial efforts 
              in this direction.</li>
          <li> 
             Search engines catalogue HTML (HyperText Markup 
              Language, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/">http://www.w3.org/MarkUp</a>) pages, not databases, 
              or other structured type of data or dynamic pages, unless a hyperlink 
              is created directly to the resource.  For example search engines do 
              not include their own pages dynamically generated by users&#39; queries 
              in their results.</li>
          <li> 
             Search engines use a partial representation of 
              the Web, using a particular algorithm, like PageRank for Google (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/technology/">http://www.google.com/technology</a>), 
              a proprietary cataloguing method. E.g., special relevance may be given 
              to metadata tags, to titles or to other elements of the page.</li>
          <li> 
             The legitimate commercial attitude of most search 
              engines or directories means that they attribute a high rank to paying 
              resources potentially independently of their content weight</li>
          <li> 
             Due to the enormous amount of data available, 
              there are so many results for each query that it is impossible to 
              scroll all of them, so the real results are only the resources sorted 
              on top of the output, or at least in the first two or three pages.</li>
        </ol>
         
          <p>Moreover considering the nature of the Web, we share the worries raised 
            by Lawrence &amp; Giles (1998) that are still very relevant:</p>
          <p>The Web is a distributed dynamic and rapidly growing information resource, 
            which presents difficulties for traditional information technologies. 
            Traditional information retrieval systems were designed for different 
            environments and have typically being used for indexing a static collection 
            of directly accessible documents. The nature of the Web brings up important 
            questions as to whether the centralized architecture of the search engines 
            can keep up with the expanding number of documents, and if they can 
            regularly update their databases to detect modified, deleted and relocated 
            information. The answers to these questions impact on the best search 
            methodology to use when searching the Web and on the future of Web search 
            technology<span class="BlockQuoteAuthorChar"> (Lawrence &amp; Giles, 1998).</span></p>
          <p>The experiment that they made was supposed to measure comparatively 
            the quality of search engines’ results, but they discovered that they 
            could also estimate the size of the entire Web on the basis of an analysis 
            of the overlap among the engines, without taking into account the invisible 
            Web (see later for more details). 
            Though it was very difficult to obtain a definite result, they concluded 
            that even the best search engine at that time, HotBot (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hotbot.com/">http://www.hotbot.com</a>), 
            did not cover more than 34% of the entire Web (Lawrence &amp; Giles, 
            1998). They repeated the experiment a year later (Barabási, 2002: 164) 
            but though there was a change in the comparative performances of search 
            engines, and Google was taking over HotBot, there was not a better result 
            in terms of absolute coverage of the Web. There are various practical 
            problems that can cause this lack of precision in results by search 
            engines, such as the technique used to retrieve information, the fact 
            that the documents searched may not exist any longer or they may have 
            changed their position on the Web so they are not accessible at the 
            previous address, etc. </p>
          <p>Therefore we are in the undesirable situation in which we have the 
            illusion that we can access all the available resources, while in practice 
            we have admittance only to a small amount of them. There is a risk that 
            many people might not be aware of the problem. It is as if Web users 
            can enter the biggest library in the world, where there are all the 
            books, photographs, music, films ever produced are available, but some 
            of the librarians have used various incoherent cataloguing styles. Some 
            of the librarians even changed the position of many of the resources 
            on the shelves, so they do not correspond to the catalogued descriptions. 
            Some other librarians are involved in powerful commercial interests 
            and catalogue only resources of interest to their sponsors. It is then 
            very difficult to achieve a correct correspondence between titles, authors, 
            subjects and shelf marks of the resources. There are exceptions consisting 
            of the catalogues created before the librarians became overwhelmed. 
            We can benefit only from those small parts of the catalogues, but very 
            often it is impossible to distinguish between correct and corrupted 
            catalogues. </p>
          <h2>Web Topology</h2>
          <p>In order to understand thoroughly the problems implied in searching 
            information on the Web, it is inadvisable to concentrate only on the 
            limits of the algorithms used by the various search engines; these practical 
            limitations are only part of the issue discussed here. There is another 
            key element that must be taken into account to provide a clear understanding 
            of the problem, namely the topology of the network. As a consequence 
            of the fact that Web hyperlinks are unidirectional, it is possible to 
            travel with ease only one way when following links. If two nodes (Web 
            pages) are not connected directly you can connect them through other 
            nodes, but in a directed network there is no guarantee that you can 
            follow an inverse path (Barabási, 2002: 167). The directedness has some 
            consequences for the network’s topology, effects that were discovered 
            by a group of researchers from AltaVista, IBM and Compaq when they did 
            some experiments on the topology of the Web (Broder et al., 2000). They 
            discovered that the structure of the Web has the characteristic form 
            of a &#34;bowtie&#34; (Kumar et al., 2002; see Fig.1).</p>
          <p class="caption"><img src="numerico-fig1.jpg" width="400" height="381"/></p>
          <p class="caption">Fig1: Characteristic &#34;bowtie&#34; structure of 
            the Web (Kumar et al., 2002).</p>
          <p>The network appears to be divided into four main different &#34;continents&#34; 
            that are only partially connected with each other. Except for the central 
            core that is the central area of the Web in which all the nodes are 
            reachable on average in about two links from any other node in the same 
            area, all the other continent are fragmented and some even isolated 
            from the rest of the network, as is clearly visible from  Fig. 1. These 
            continents will always be the topological structure of any directed 
            network as was shown by a team of researchers from Portugal 
            (Dorogovtsev et al., 2001).  Search engine repositories rely on the 
            work of Web crawlers, software agents that surf the Web, traversing 
            from one link to the next, so they cannot access Web pages that are 
            not connected to the rest of the Web through links (or explicitly submitted 
            to them by users), and these areas remain unexplored and hidden from 
            the search engines, increasing the deep or invisible 
            Web. As admitted also by Monika Henzinger, a manager of Google research 
            team, there are still open problems to solve in the area of researching 
            information on the Web:</p>
          <p>However, there are still many open problems and areas for future research. 
            […] The problem of uniformly sampling the Web is still open in practice: 
            which pages should be counted, and how can we reduce biases? Web growth 
            models approximate the true nature of how the Web grows: how can the 
            current models be refined to improve accuracy, while keeping the models 
            relatively simple and easy to understand and analyze? Finally, community 
            identification remains an open area: how can the accuracy of community 
            identification be improved, and how can communities be best structured 
            or presented to account for differences of opinion in what is considered 
            a community? (Henzinger &amp; Giles, 2004: 5190).</p>
          <p>Some of the problems mentioned in this passage have already been discussed, 
            but there is one that deserves some attention: the community identification 
            issue, as important in the context of museums as any other (Beler et 
            al., 2004). We can consider museum Web sites as a kind of community, 
            in which each Web site gives its own contribution to the general content 
            of cultural or scientific heritage and history. The possibility of identifying 
            this community would grant extra visibility to any single museum Web 
            site within the group. A Web page describing the content of a small 
            museum can easily attract only a little or even no visibility on the 
            Web, but if it is linked to a community of museum Web sites, the well-known 
            museums can improve its presence on the Web, helping small institutions 
            to become better known. In this sense, owners of museum Web sites should 
            not consider the other similar pages as competitors, but as opportunities 
            of obtaining extra visibility and new potential audiences.</p>
          <p>Another relevant and inevitable issue for search engines is the definition 
            of a balanced performance, both in terms of coverage and of freshness; 
            it is very difficult to have a large repository and also to refresh 
            the pages in a timely manner, in order to guarantee keeping up to date 
            with the frequent refresh rate of some pages. RSS newsfeeds have been 
            designed to address this problem in a limited way for frequently updated 
            news articles on the Web (Bowen et al., 2003). See, for example, the 
            Museophile museum discussions forum’s Web site (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.museophile.net/">http://forums.museophile.net</a>) 
            for a collection of regularly updated museum-related newsfeeds.</p>
          <h2>The Invisible Web</h2>
          <p>In any case, as we suggested before, there is a huge area of the Web 
            that remains invisible and closed to crawlers because of different reasons 
            (technical limitations, deliberate choice of crawlers, etc.). This means 
            that there is a large part of the Web that is not accessed by crawlers, 
            and it can contain high quality information. Which is the information 
            that is not available to crawlers but is theoretically accessible on 
            the Web? The answer to this question can be found in an interesting 
            book on the invisible Web (Sherman &amp; Price, 2001: chapter 4, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.invisible-web.net/">http://www.invisible-Web.net</a>). Some of 
            the categories of invisible Web pages can be found on museum Web sites. 
            There are various types of pages that crawlers are not able to surf 
            due to the invisible Web, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>sites that contain forms that need to be filled out in order to access 
            the real Web site;</li>
          <li>dynamically generated pages that contain inaccessible technologies 
            such as Flash or other multimedia formats with no text equivalent;</li>
          <li> 
            pages offering real-time data;</li>
          <li>documents in non-HTML formats (although Google is able to archive 
            PDF format documents, for example);</li>
          <li> 
             pages that give access to a database, even if 
              they are provided with an HTML Web interface, where in order to access 
              the data, it is necessary to insert a query and crawlers are not able 
              to interact with such a complex interface.</li>
        </ul>
         
          <p>Keeping this analysis in mind, we now discuss what is widely considered 
            to be the most effective Web search engine at the moment, Google, investigating 
            the characteristics that have made it so successful. We also consider 
            the risk that this technology inevitably represents for a democratic 
            diffusion of information, particularly for weak or non-commercial institutions.</p>
          <h2>The Google Search Engine </h2>
          <p>In this section, we concentrate on Google (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com</a>), which is the most successful 
            search engine so far, trying to understand the reasons for its power 
            in retrieving data on the Web. It is well-known that its efficiency 
            depends, beyond the huge number of indexed pages, mainly on its search 
            algorithm, PageRank, which is based on the exploitation of interconnections 
            of Web pages as a way to attribute authority to pages. According to 
            a recent (10 November 2004) estimate of the Google technical team, there 
            are almost 8 billion pages indexed in the repository (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/11/googles-index-nearly-doubles.html">http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/11/googles-index-nearly-doubles.html</a>). 
            The PageRank algorithm mixes a standard inverted index of all pages, 
            treated as vectors of strings, with a system that allows it to attribute 
            authority to a page according to the links that it receives from other 
            pages. A link from page &#34;A&#34; to page &#34;B&#34; is interpreted 
            as a &#34;mark&#34; given to the &#34;B&#34; page from the &#34;A&#34; 
            page. The value of the link depends also on the authority of &#34;A&#34;.</p>
          <p>So the success of Google is related to its capability of taking into 
            account the real topology of the Web when creating the ranking for the 
            pages (Brin &amp; Page, 1998). Pages linked by many authoritative pages 
            have more credentials to be considered relevant for the users. This 
            capitalizes on human knowledge and expertise since most links on the 
            Web have been inserted by a human being. However, even if the system 
            works well when looking for hubs and &#34;mainstream&#34; pages, Google&#39;s 
            results are less trustworthy when searching for &#34;minority pages&#34;. 
            When we seek information that is not very well known, or not very popular, 
            or even only written in a language that is not widely spoken, like Italian 
            for example, it is much more difficult to find (Cho &amp; Roy, 2004). 
            Though minorities&#39; protection is not typically at the center of the 
            users&#39; attention, it is a very relevant issue in the perspective of 
            the creation of the ecology of the Web as a collective and distributed 
            information tool.  Thus the ranking mechanism that is the main reason 
            for the &#34;fitness&#34; of Google performance produces at the same 
            time discrimination against all sorts of minorities present on the Web 
            (language minorities, scientific minorities, newly formed communities, 
            small local specialist museums, etc.).</p>
          <p>Minorities&#39; visibility is not the only problem that we encounter when 
            we use Google as our main front door to access the Web; there is also 
            the &#34;Google bombing&#34; phenomenon (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bomb">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bomb</a>). 
            As an example, try typing the string &#34;miserable failure&#34; into 
            the Google query box and the first result obtained is President Bush&#39;s 
            Web page on the White House Web site (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/gwbbio.html">http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/gwbbio.html</a>). 
            This is the outcome of the exploitation of PageRank algorithm characteristics 
            by a group of hackers. To achieve this result they did not need to alter 
            the target page. They only needed to create a network of pages, widely 
            cross-linked with each other, using that term and linked to the Bush 
            homepage. Notice that this activity is perfectly legal. And it is not 
            an isolated episode; all commercial companies can make the most of it 
            to increase the rankings of their homepages relative to the desired 
            keywords (Gori &amp; Numerico, 2003).  Museum Web sites could easily 
            be obscured by commercial enterprises wishing to sell artworks, for 
            example. The risk is that instead of obtaining, at the top of the list, 
            results relevant to cultural heritage and historical information provided 
            by museums, we could obtain fake artistic or cultural Web pages whose 
            aim is entirely commercial.</p>
          <p>Google includes more advanced search features (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/advanced_search">http://www.google.com/advanced_search</a>), 
            including options such as language, file format (PDF, PostScript, Word, 
            etc., as well as HTML), date of last page update, location of text to 
            be searched (e.g., limited to the title, page text, URL or even links 
            to the page), limited to a particular Internet domain address, etc. 
            It is also possible to search for similar pages or pages that link to 
            a Web site (e.g., to see if reciprocal links are appropriate from your 
            museum&#39;s Web site). This can be done directly by adding &#34;link:&#34; 
            in front of a URL within a Google search string (e.g., <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link:vlmp.museophile.org">http://www.google.com/search?q=link:vlmp.museophile.org</a>). 
            However, for most simple queries these additional facilities are not 
            needed. For further information on searching using Google, see Google&#39;s 
            on-line help information (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/help/">http://www.google.com/help</a>). 
            Calishain &amp; Dornfest (2004) provide more detailed information, including 
            technical information on incorporating Google searching into a Web site.</p>
          <p>Next we consider three case studies in the use of Google for searching 
            in the context of finding museum information on-line. The first considers 
            general issues and how they could apply to on-line museum information. 
            The others give examples of problems when searching for information 
            on-line.</p>
          <h3>Case Study 1: Google Vs. Experts</h3>
          <p>On Friday 11 February 2005, The Gadget Show, on Channel 5 UK television, 
            held a not very scientific but illustrative quiz between a person using 
            Google and a four-person team of “experts”. There were four questions, 
            each demonstrating the pros and cons of naive use of Google in searching 
            for information.</p>
          <p>The first question asked for the value of the mathematical constant 
          π to nine decimal places. The experts could only manage seven decimal 
            places. On typing &#34;pi&#34; into Google (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=pi">http://www.google.com/search?q=pi</a>), 
            the Google calculator (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html#calculator">http://www.google.com/help/features.html#calculator</a>) 
            gives π to eight decimal places instantly: 3.14159265. The π 
            Pages (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/pi/pi.html">http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/pi/pi.html</a>), 
            listed first by Google (although note that Google search lists will 
            vary with time as the Web changes), include a Java applet that speaks 
            the value of π (in French by default) continuously as well as displaying 
            the numerical values. This was enough to give the correct answer, assuming 
            that Java is working correctly on the user&#39;s client computer. This is 
            not always the case, so the pages could be made more accessible for 
            these without the necessary technology. Interestingly, none of the top 
            nine Google returns included the actual (approximate) value of π 
            in the short entries listed by Google and the tenth one only gave the 
            value 3.14 since this has been dubbed &#34;National Pi Day&#34; (14 
            March). This illustrates the importance of including the most critical 
            information in a Web site&#39;s listing in Google. A museum&#39;s home page should 
            include keywords that are critical and relevant to its mission.</p>
          <p>The second question asked for the age of the (British) Queen. This 
            of course is a moving value and a number of out-of-date Web pages were 
            found by Google giving the incorrect answer. The &#34;experts&#34; 
            were similarly unsure. Of course, the users of Google could have searched 
            for the Queen&#39;s birthday, a fixed value, and then calculated her age, 
            but even this is problematic since the Queen has an official birthday 
            and an actual birthday. Thus the combination of some background knowledge 
            with the use of Google could have resulted in the correct answer. The 
            use of quotation marks when querying Google could also have helped here, 
            together with knowledge that her name is &#34;Queen Elizabeth II&#34;. 
            Searching for &#34;age of Queen Elizabeth II&#34; (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=age+of+Queen+Elizabeth+II">http://www.google.com/search?q=age+of+Queen+Elizabeth+II</a>) 
            was not a very successful strategy since the individual words can appear 
            in any order anywhere on the Web page for Google to consider that a 
            match has been found. Note that &#34;of&#34; is considered a common 
            word by Google and is ignored anyway.</p>
          <p>Searching for &#34;Queen Elizabeth II&#34; age (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Queen+Elizabeth+II%22+age">http://www.google.com/search?q=&#34;Queen+Elizabeth+II&#34;+age</a>) 
            is a more successful strategy since the phrase &#34;Queen Elizabeth 
            II&#34; must be exactly in that form for a search match to be found. 
            In this case, the third entry (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.deadoraliveinfo.com/dead.nsf/enames-nf/Elizabeth+Queen+II">http://www.deadoraliveinfo.com/dead.nsf/enames-nf/Elizabeth+Queen+II</a>) 
            returned included the string &#34;Date of Birth: Current Age: 04/21/1926 
            78&#34; within the Google page itself, giving the correct answer and 
            the date of birth as well by way of confirmation. Note that searching 
            for the completely quoted string &#34;age of Queen Elizabeth II&#34; 
            (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22age+of+Queen+Elizabeth+II%22">http://www.google.com/search?q=&#34;age+of+Queen+Elizabeth+II&#34;</a>) 
            is not a good strategy. This only returned a single not very helpful 
            Web page on murals of the 1950s (<a target="_blank" href="http://beechcourtgardens.co.uk/church/murals.htm">http://beechcourtgardens.co.uk/church/murals.htm</a>). 
            A good strategy when using Google to search for terms for research purposes 
            is to quote individual phrases of words that should be together and 
            to include more that one quoted phrase if necessary, rather than quoting 
            longer phrases since this is likely to limit the search too much.</p>
          <p>As a general lesson, it is also a good idea either not to include information 
            that will date quickly on a museum Web site or to ensure that the information 
            is maintained and updated very regularly. Suitable management structures, 
            not to mention enthusiasm of the relevant museum personnel, need to 
            be in place for this to be done effectively.</p>
          <p>The third question requested the national flower of Turkey. 
            Again, a naive search for &#34;national flower of Turkey&#34; 
            (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=national+flower+of+Turkey">http://www.google.com/search?q=national+flower+of+Turkey</a>) 
            returns many commercial flower shop Web sites. In this case the experts 
            could answer the question, but the Google searcher in the television 
            program could not, although the answer (the tulip) can be found in the 
            second link from the Google query above (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sunsearch.info/alanya/english/sights/?profile_id=67">http://www.sunsearch.info/alanya/english/sights/?profile_id=67</a>). 
            Perhaps the Google user entered a different search phrase or the Web 
            sites listed by Google have changed. In any case, by quoting the phrase 
          &#34;national flower of Turkey&#34; (i.e., by insisting that this 
            phrase appears exactly in this form), a much better set of pages is 
            returned (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22national+flower+of+Turkey%22">http://www.google.com/search?q=&#34;national+flower+of+Turkey&#34;</a>), 
            with the answer included in nine out of the top ten sites within the 
            Google listing itself.</p>
          <p>Finally three out of the four experts (and Google) were asked where 
            the fourth member of the team used to work in Geneva. They did not know, 
            but since he was an academic with much on-line material about him available, 
            a Google search of his name together with &#34;Geneva&#34; was enough 
            to reveal the answer very quickly. Searching for information on academics 
            is often a very fruitful line of research, but searching for commercial 
            contacts may be more difficult because companies are much more secretive 
            about their employees. Museum personnel are often much more hidden on-line 
            than most academics, but they may be more accessible than employees 
            in industry. </p>
          <p>Many commercial Web sites are very impersonal, and it is difficult 
            to contact real people through them. There are well-known examples with 
            respect to this, which can cause customer relations difficulties in 
            the case of disputes. Academic Web sites often contain much personal 
            research material; museums form a halfway house between the academic, 
            and commercial extremes and the amount of information found on its personnel 
            will depend on the nature of the museum. The larger, more academic ones 
            tend to have more information. It is recommended that museums include 
            some form of contact information on their Web sites, although one should 
            be careful about the inclusion of e-mail addresses. These will be found 
            by spam e-mail &#34;spiders&#34; that are generating e-mail address 
            lists for unscrupulous sale and use, as well as by legitimate search 
            engines. There are technical tricks to avoid problems such as generation 
            of e-mail addresses using HTML character encoding, JavaScript or the 
            use of images (<a target="_blank" href="http://javascript.about.com/library/blemail1.htm">http://javascript.about.com/library/blemail1.htm</a>).</p>
          <p>In summary, a very important technique when using search engines in 
            general and Google in particular is to add double quote marks around 
            groups of words that you wish to appear together in the documents to 
            be returned. This can improve the quality of ordering of pages that 
            are listed significantly if done with care.</p>
          <h3>Case Study 2: Searching For Italian Art</h3>
          <p>The non-expert user faces difficulties when trying to find something 
            on the Web in a field in which they are not knowledgeable. Suppose that 
            we are in a situation of being young American students with some basic 
            knowledge of Italian who wants to investigate art museums.  They do 
            not want to know about Italian museums in particular, but they are interested 
            in art in general. They know that Italy 
            is the most important country for the Renaissance period since much 
            of the relevant Renaissance art can be found in Italy.</p>
          <p>We hypothesize that they are proud of their knowledge of Italian, and 
            will pose an Italian query &#34;museo arte moderna&#34; (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=museo+arte+moderna">http://www.google.com/search?q=museo+arte+moderna</a>), 
            meaning &#34;Renaissance art museum&#34;. What they are presented 
            with as the first page of results using Google is not a good selection 
            at the time of writing: only three Italian museums, one from Bozen (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.museion.it/">http://www.museion.it</a>), 
            another from Trento twice (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mart.tn.it/">http://www.mart.tn.it</a>), 
            and a third from Anticoli Corrado (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.anticoli-corrado.it/Museo.htm">http://www.anticoli-corrado.it/Museo.htm</a>) 
            - all not among the most relevant Italian museums of modern art; MOMA 
            (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.moma.org/">http://www.moma.org</a>) as the first entry and as 
            another entry the Museo d&#39;Art Moderna in Lugano, Switzerland (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.museodartemoderna-lugano.ch/">http://www.museodartemoderna-lugano.ch/</a>; 
            also the MUMOK in Vienna, Austria (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mumok.at/">http://www.mumok.at</a>), 
            the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfmoma.org/">http://www.sfmoma.org</a>), 
            and Museos en México from Artes e Historia México (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.arts-history.mx/">http://www.arts-history.mx</a>).</p>
          <p>On the second page the situation is no better: we have only 4 entries 
            out of ten for Italian museums and again they are only secondary museums, 
            compared to the Roman, Florentine and Venetian Museums. Moreover there 
            is a major misunderstanding here, because in Italian &#34;Arte Moderna&#34; 
            means Renaissance art (from the 15th to the 18th century) while in English 
          &#34;Modern Art&#34; normally refers to 20th century art (traditionally 
            post Cézanne); so not only was it not possible to find the important 
            Italian museums, but there was also a misinterpretation of the meaning 
            of the Italian query. There was no mention of the most important Renaissance 
            art museums such as the Musei Vaticani (<a target="_blank" href="http://mv.vatican.va/StartNew_IT.html">http://mv.vatican.va/StartNew_IT.html</a>), 
            the Uffizi (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.uffizi.firenze.it/">http://www.uffizi.firenze.it</a>), 
            the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.brera.beniculturali.it/">http://www.brera.beniculturali.it</a>), 
            the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.musis.it/capodimonte.asp?museo=1">http://www.musis.it/capodimonte.asp?museo=1</a>), 
            the Gallerie dell&#39;Accademia in Venice (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gallerieaccademia.org/">http://www.gallerieaccademia.org</a>), 
            or even of some of the most important museums of Renaissance art such 
            as the Louvre (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.louvre.fr/">http://www.louvre.fr</a>) 
            or the National Gallery in London (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/">http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk</a>).</p>
          <p>The situation is no better if instead of the Italian expression we 
            use the string &#34;Renaissance art museum&#34;. We get two entries 
            from the early Web site, the Web Museum (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/glo/renaissance">http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/glo/renaissance</a>), 
            two from another Web site called Art History  (<a target="_blank" href="http://witcombe.sbc.edu/ARTH16thcentury.html">http://witcombe.sbc.edu/ARTH16thcentury.html</a>)  
            a Web site about the Pope  (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.christusrex.org/">http://www.christusrex.org</a>) 
            from which you can reach the Vatican Museum&#39;s Web site directly, a private 
            collection of links about Renaissance art (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.providence.edu/dwc/Renart.htm">http://www.providence.edu/dwc/Renart.htm</a>), 
            plus three other US museums. The situation is no better if you use the 
            language preferences to select only Web pages written in Italian: using 
            the string &#34;museo arte contemporanea&#34; (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=museo+arte+contemporanea">http://www.google.com/search?q=museo+arte+contemporanea</a>), 
            you get pages written in Italian but not necessarily related to the 
            most relevant Italian museums, together with some pages related to US 
            or Switzerland museums, and even a commercial Italian publishing house 
            specializing in museum catalogues (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mazzotta.it/">http://www.mazzotta.it</a>). 
          </p>
          <p>This is just a quick example to illustrate the situation. The ordering 
            algorithm of Google favors highly linked Web pages; English language 
            museums have more “citations” since they are also linked from many Web 
            sites, including non-English language ones, and so receive a better 
            ranking.  An additional problem is that the query string could match 
            for a number of different languages and Italian is not a widely used 
            language, so there is possible confusion with Spanish and German museum 
            Web sites as well. It is also likely that Web sites of Italian museums 
            could not compete in terms of organization of information with other 
            country’s cultural institutions. In summary, the results obtained by 
            investigating on Google about modern art museums using Italian were 
            quite misleading with respect to the reality. This case study is just 
            to illustrate that you should not rely on one search engine, particularly 
            if you are exploring an area in which you are not an expert. It is very 
            important to have different resources to explore the Web in order to 
            obtain better information about  what is available on-line.</p>
          <p>However, we have to underline the inadequate attitude of Italian museums 
            since they do not seem to undertake relevant promotional activity on 
            the Internet effectively. For example, the Uffizi has allowed their 
            obvious Web address (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.uffizi.it/">http://www.uffizi.it</a>) 
            to be used by a company that sells art objects, and offers all sort 
            of different services, including information technology projects. The 
            same is true for the Vatican 
            that has allowed an obvious Italian domain name (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.vaticano.it/">http://www.vaticano.it</a>) to be used by a private 
            citizen who is producing and selling elastic Webbings for furniture. 
            An obvious address for the Vatican museums (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.museivaticani.it/">http://www.museivaticani.it</a>) is forwarded 
            to an alternative commercial Web location (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.alberghi.com/">http://www.alberghi.com</a> ) offering accommodation 
            in hotel rooms in different cities around the world. Even if the Vatican 
            museums use &#34;.va&#34; as a top-level domain name, they could take 
            more action to ensure that related Web addresses redirect visitors to 
            their main URL, although to be fair a number of Web addresses do redirect 
            appropriately (e.g., <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vatican.it/">http://www.vatican.it</a>, 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vatican.net/">http://www.vatican.net</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vatican.edu/">http://www.vatican.edu</a>). The Web site of the 
            Vatican museums is created as a subsection of the general Web site on 
            the Vatican (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.vatican.va/">http://www.vatican.va</a>) 
            and even their top-level domain (<a target="_blank" href="http://mv.vatican.va/">http://mv.vatican.va</a>) 
            does not redirect users to the main Musei Vaticani Web page correctly, 
            but rather to the main Vatican Web page instead.  </p>
          <p>The lack of interest of Italian museums in the Web can also be seen 
            with regard to Venetian museums, many of which still do not even own 
            their Web site. They are collected together in the general Web site 
            of the civic museums of Venice (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.museiciviciveneziani.it/">http://www.museiciviciveneziani.it</a>). 
            In this Web site you can find a lot of information about museums as 
            important as the Doge&#39;s Palace, Museo Correr, Ca&#39; Rezzonico, Ca&#39; Pesaro, 
            etc., but the user has to know how to navigate the Web site effectively. 
            For example, a database of objects contained in each museum is accessible, 
            searchable by different categories, but the section (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.museiciviciveneziani.it/frame.asp?sezione=collezioni">http://www.museiciviciveneziani.it/frame.asp?sezione=collezioni</a>) 
            is hidden as a sub-menu within the &#34;research services&#34; menu. 
          </p>
          <p>Even if Google can be seen as not favoring Italian Web sites, due to 
            the structure of its ranking algorithm, Italian museum Webmasters could 
            do better in improving the ranking for their Web sites in search engines, 
            in order to allow on-line visitors to understand the quantity and quality 
            of important artworks that are available in their collections. </p>
          <h3>Case Study 3: Searching For Renoir&#39;s Paintings</h3>
          <p>In this section, as a case study, we will describe the situation which 
            many museum curators or art students might encounter in trying to locate 
            useful material for an exhibition or research. One of the authors is 
            currently working on the Web site for an exhibition on Renoir and Cézanne&#39;s 
            paintings (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cezannerenoir.it/">http://www.cezannerenoir.it</a>) 
            from the Guillaume&#39;s collection of the Orangerie Museum in Paris (which 
            still appears to have no official Web site!), opening at the Accademia 
            Carrara, Bergamo, Italy (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.accademiacarrara.bergamo.it/">http://www.accademiacarrara.bergamo.it</a>).</p>
          <p>We first prepared an &#34;under construction&#34; page with the registered 
            domain and a few basic pieces of information about the exhibition, including 
            the title, a brief description of the content of the exhibition, a few 
            pictures and practical information. We did not put any effort into referencing 
            it through external links and search engines because it was only meant 
            to be a temporary solution. Thus it became part of that invisible Web 
            as mentioned earlier since no search engine was able to reference it, 
            even through a very specific search like &#34;Accademia Carrara Renoir 
            Cezanne&#34; (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Accademia+Carrara%22+Renoir+Cezanne">http://www.google.com/search?q=&#34;Accademia+Carrara&#34;+Renoir+Cezanne</a>). 
            That gave access to all sort of on-line articles about the exhibition 
            but not to the exhibition Web site itself.</p>
          <p>During the preparation of the Web site, there was a need to make a 
            list of the most important museums that included Renoir&#39;s paintings 
            in their collections so that they could be referenced on the Web site. 
            We started by looking for the word &#34;Renoir&#34; on Google (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Renoir">http://www.google.com/search?q=Renoir</a>). 
            There was a list of on-line material on the painter but no trace of 
            a museum Web site till the end of the second page, where the first one 
            to appear was the Phillips collection&#39;s Web site in Washington DC, which 
            holds one of the most beautiful and popular paintings by the artist: 
          &#34;Le déjeuner des canotiers&#34; (Luncheon of the Boating Party, 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.phillipscollection.org/html/lbp.html">http://www.phillipscollection.org/html/lbp.html</a>), 
            followed only at the end of the third page, by the Web site of an exhibition 
            on Renoir and other artists from the Collection Guillaume (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/orangerie/">http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/orangerie</a>), 
            very similar to the one the Accademia Carrara was organizing, a Web 
            site that we had accessed many times before during the preparation of 
            our own Web site and that, considering our interest in it, should have 
            appeared at the top of the list (see the section 
            on personalization later). Exploring the other search result&#39;s pages, 
            there was only a trace of a few other museums, including the Getty (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.getty.edu/">http://www.getty.edu</a>) in Los Angeles, but no 
            evidence whatsoever of museums like the Musée d&#39;Orsay (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.musee-orsay.fr/">http://www.musee-orsay.fr</a>) in Paris or the 
            State Hermitage Museum (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/">http://www.hermitagemuseum.org</a>) 
            in St. Petersburg, which holds many exemplars of Renoir&#39;s paintings 
            and whose Web sites are fully available in English. </p>
          <p>Unhappy with the results, we decided to make the search more specific 
            and look for &#34;Renoir museum&#34; (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Renoir+museum">http://www.google.com/search?q=Renoir+museum</a>). 
            The results were no better, as this listed, besides the reference at 
            number one to a &#34;brochureware&#34; Web site for Renoir museum 
            that is an estate which belonged to the artist (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.riviera-magazine.com/tourisme/cagnes/MuseeRenoir-us.html">http://www.riviera-magazine.com/tourisme/cagnes/MuseeRenoir-us.html</a>), 
            once again the Web site of the Phillips collection, and on the second 
            page, the Getty Museum (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.getty.edu/art/collections/bio/a620-1.html">http://www.getty.edu/art/collections/bio/a620-1.html</a>), 
            the San Diego Museum of Art (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sdmart.org/exhibition-renoir.html">http://www.sdmart.org/exhibition-renoir.html</a>) 
            and the Museum of Fine Arts (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mfa.org/artemis/results.asp?am=renoir">http://www.mfa.org/artemis/results.asp?am=renoir</a>) 
            in Boston. In between these Web sites there were a number of articles 
            that make reference to museum exhibitions or collections but were not 
            the museum Web site themselves (e.g., see the Google Directory entry, 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Art_History/Artists/R/Renoir,_Pierre_Auguste/">http://directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Art_History/Artists/R/Renoir,_Pierre_Auguste</a>). 
            The results did not help much because it only added a couple of museums 
            to the list, and mostly minor museums that only had one or two paintings 
            by the artist. There was still no trace of the Musée d&#39;Orsay or the 
            Hermitage. It was also strange that there were no other French museums, 
            since we knew that, as well as the Musée d&#39;Orsay, the Louvre, the Musée 
            de Grenoble (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.museedegrenoble.fr/">http://www.museedegrenoble.fr</a>) and the 
            Musée de l&#39;Orangerie had works of art by the French impressionist artist. 
          </p>
          <p>So we decided to search for results using &#34;Renoir&#34; (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=fr&amp;q=Renoir">http://www.google.com/search?hl=fr&amp;q=Renoir</a>) 
            and &#34;Renoir musée&#34; (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=fr&amp;q=Renoir+musée">http://www.google.com/search?hl=fr&amp;q=Renoir+musée</a>) 
            in French pages only. However, here once again the results were very 
            disappointing. No museum Web page seemed to appear in the first pages 
            of search results for &#34;Renoir&#34; (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Renoir">http://www.google.com/search?q=Renoir</a>) 
            while for &#34;Renoir museum&#34; (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Renoir+museum">http://www.google.com/search?q=Renoir+museum</a>), 
            the first museum to appear on the list (seventh position) was the Musée 
            Marmottan (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.marmottan.com/">http://www.marmottan.com</a>), 
            followed in ninth position by the Musée des beaux-arts du Canada (National 
            Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, <a target="_blank" href="http://national.gallery.ca/">http://national.gallery.ca</a>). 
            Finally at page two (with the default ten items on each set of Google 
            search results), there is a link to a page of the Musée d&#39;Orsay, which 
            unfortunately only led to an empty page in the Spanish version of the 
            site with the name Renoir on it!</p>
          <p>At this point we were curious to find out what resources were available 
            on the Musée d&#39;Orsay Web site for Renoir and we specified the search 
            (by limiting it to French pages) even further by looking for &#34;Renoir 
            Orsay&#34; (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=fr&amp;q=Renoir+Orsay">http://www.google.com/search?hl=fr&amp;q=Renoir+Orsay</a>) 
            and surprisingly enough the Musée d’Orsay Web site was only fourth in 
            the list of Google results, preceded by other irrelevant material. If 
            not limited to the French page, for the same query (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Renoir+Orsay">http://www.google.com/search?q=Renoir+Orsay</a>), 
            the museum Web site would only have appeared on the third page of Google 
            results.</p>
          <p>As for the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, we were also quite 
            surprised that no search results gave access to Renoir material from 
            the museum&#39;s Web site, knowing that it had about 21 paintings from this 
            artist. So we refined the search query for &#34;Renoir Hermitage&#34; 
            (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Renoir+Hermitage">http://www.google.com/search?q=Renoir+Hermitage</a>) 
            and once again we were surprised by the result. The first two results 
            were from the Guggenheim Hermitage Museum in Las Vegas, which apparently 
            hold two portraits of the artist, followed by a link to a Danish Web 
            site with information about the Hermitage Museum and its collection. 
            The Hermitage Web site itself only ranked fourth; however, this was 
            not with a list of works of art by the artist but with a link to a page 
            of a special exhibition they had held on him. If I wanted to have access 
            to a list of works of art by Renoir available in the museum, I would 
            have to go on the Hermitage museum Web site and look for them in the 
            collection&#39;s database. Only by doing a database search on Renoir would 
            I have had access to a list of 21 paintings. This is a typical example 
            of the problem of the invisible Web as mentioned earlier since there 
            are no direct links to the information in the museum&#39;s database for 
            the search engine Web crawlers to find. </p>
          <p>After facing all these difficulties, we finally decided to give up 
            and resort to the old fashion method of looking for information in a 
            book. In the library there was a book on Renoir that had a list of works 
            of art from the many museums around the world.</p>
          <p>Later, an art historian colleague mentioned the Web site Artcyclopedia 
            (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.artcyclopedia.com/">http://www.artcyclopedia.com</a>) 
            that includes lists of paintings by artists including Renoir (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/renoir_pierre-auguste.html">http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/renoir_pierre-auguste.html</a>). 
            In fact it was exactly what was required in this particular situation, 
            but it was not found by Google in the searches that were made, or it 
            least it was not spotted among the many sites returned as being good 
            sites for the purpose of this research. Overall, this case study illustrates 
            that even large museums have very little direct visibility on the Web 
            through search engines like Google when it comes to detailed content 
            of their collections. In the next section, we consider a few simple 
            techniques that can help to alleviate the situation.</p>
          <h2>Improving Your Search Engine Ranking </h2>
          <p>Museums are not as proactive in ensuring they rank well on Google as 
            many of their commercial counterparts. However there are some basic 
            tactics that are worthwhile, and that do not require great financial 
            cost to implement. Google&#39;s PageRank algorithm uses both links to and 
            links from a Web site to determine its position when returned from a 
            giving search query. It is a good idea to encourage links to your museum’s 
            Web site and also to be generous in including links from your museum 
            to related resources. These can be mutually reinforcing since sites 
            with links to other Web sites (&#34;portals&#34;) naturally attract 
            links to them.</p>
          <p>To find sites for possible cross-linking, it is worthwhile entering 
            keywords relevant for your site into Google itself, requesting that 
            highly rated sites link to you, and adding links to these sites from 
            your own museum Web site. The sites that are found will naturally have 
            a high Google ranking already, and links to and from these will help 
            to increase your own site&#39;s rating on Google. A personal message (e.g., 
            via email) illustrating that you have actually looked at the Web site 
            properly and appreciate the content is usually best. Nothing can guarantee 
            a cross-link back to your own site, although having good on-line content 
            yourself (which most museums can provide with some effort) is likely 
            to encourage this. More altruistically, linking to other lesser known 
            but related museum Web sites will help those sites and ultimately your 
            own site as these become more highly rated. Forming virtual communities 
            of museum Web sites in this way is beneficial to all involved in terms 
            of increased visibility on Google.</p>
          <p>It is a good ideal not to change the internal structure of your Web 
            site unnecessarily, at least at the topmost levels. All search engines 
            can only scan your Web site periodically ,and any changes are likely 
            not to be reflected for a while, resulting in bad links from search 
            engines until they have rescanned your W site. Ensure that the most 
            useful subsections of your Web site have a simple Web address linked 
            directly from the main page if possible. The BBC is particularly good 
            at this since they need to broadcast internal Web addresses visually 
            and verbally (e.g., see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts">http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts</a> 
            also mapped from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/art">http://www.bbc.co.uk/art</a>, 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/society">http://www.bbc.co.uk/society</a> 
            also mapped from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/culture">http://www.bbc.co.uk/culture</a>, 
            etc.).</p>
          <p>In the case of major changes to a Web site, the home page should be 
            resubmitted to the major search engines. It is only worth considering 
            resubmission to the major search engines. As an example, in statistics 
            collected on the Virtual Library museums pages since 1999 (<a target="_blank" href="http://extremetracking.com/open?login=vlmp">http://extremetracking.com/open?login=vlmp</a>), 
            there are only five search engines providing more that 1% of the referrals 
            each: Google (64.4%, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com</a>), 
            MSN Search (15.5%, <a target="_blank" href="http://search.msn.com/">http://search.msn.com</a>), 
            Yahoo (12.4%, <a target="_blank" href="http://search.yahoo.com/">http://search.yahoo.com</a>), 
            AltaVista (2.8%, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.altavista.com/">http://www.altavista.com</a>) 
            and Excite (2.3%, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.excite.com/">http://www.excite.com</a>). 
            Submitting a site to the first three of these is probably the most critical, 
            and in particular Google (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/addurl.html">http://www.google.com/addurl.html</a>), 
            which has a very simple submission form with no registration required. 
            Microsoft runs a commercial submission service, Submit It! (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.submit-it.com/">http://www.submit-it.com</a>), aimed more at 
            businesses than not-for-profit organizations. Yahoo allows submissions 
            (<a target="_blank" href="http://submit.search.yahoo.com/">http://submit.search.yahoo.com</a>), including 
            free submissions (<a target="_blank" href="http://submit.search.yahoo.com/free/request">http://submit.search.yahoo.com/free/request</a>), 
            although registration as a Yahoo user is required. After this, the law 
            of diminishing returns very much applies. For a comprehensive list of 
            search engines listed by country, see Search Engine Colossus (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.searchenginecolossus.com/">http://www.searchenginecolossus.com</a>). 
            In general it is not worth paying a commercial search engine submission 
            Web site for a museum since apart from the major search engines, most 
            others will have very little effect on traffic to a Web site.</p>
          <p>It is best should ensure that all your Web pages are interlinked by 
            at least one hyperlink to allow Web spiders to find them. This is especially 
            critical if you have a database and wish this to be indexed by Google 
            and other search engines. There should be links to the next (and previous) 
            record in the database, for example, and the links should also be organized 
            hierarchically since most search engines will only scan a Web site to 
            a limited depth, which will vary depending on the search engine.</p>
          <p>It is possible to include quite complicated and detailed metadata in 
            Web pages if desired. (See later for a more general discussion.) For example, the Dublin Core Metadata 
            Initiative (DCMI, <a target="_blank" href="http://dublincore.org/">http://dublincore.org</a>) 
            specifies many metadata terms that can be included in HTML Web pages 
            as metatags if desired (<a target="_blank" href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms">http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms</a>). 
            Here is some example Dublin Core metadata that could be included in 
            the &lt;head&gt; section of a Web page (adapted from <a target="_blank" href="http://icom.museum/vlmp">http://icom.museum/vlmp</a>):</p>
          <p class="code">&lt;meta name=&#34;DC.Title&#34; content=&#34;WWW Virtual Library 
            museums pages (VLmp)&#34;&gt;</p>
          <p class="code">&lt;meta name=&#34;DC.Creator.name&#34; content=&#34;Jonathan Bowen&#34;&gt;</p>
          <p class="code">&lt;meta name=&#34;DC.Creator.address&#34; content=&#34;London South 
            Bank University, UK&#34;&gt;</p>
          <p class="code">&lt;meta name=&#34;DC.Creator.e-mail&#34; content=&#34;jonathan.bowen@lsbu.ac.uk&#34;&gt;</p>
          <p class="code">&lt;meta name=&#34;DC.Publisher&#34; content=&#34;International 
            Council of Museums (ICOM)&#34;&gt;</p>
          <p class="code">&lt;meta name=&#34;DC.Type&#34; content=&#34;Bibliography&#34;&gt;</p>
          <p class="code">&lt;meta name=&#34;DC.Format&#34; scheme=&#34;IMT&#34; content=&#34;text/html&#34;&gt;</p>
          <p class="code">&lt;meta name=&#34;DC.Identifier&#34; content=&#34;http://icom.museum/vlmp/&#34;&gt;</p>
          <p class="code">&lt;meta name=&#34;DC.Language&#34; scheme=&#34;ISO639-1&#34; content=&#34;en&#34;&gt;</p>
          <p class="code">&lt;meta name=&#34;DC.Rights&#34; scheme=&#34;URL&#34; content=&#34;http://vlib.org/admin/Copyright.html&#34;&gt;</p>
          <p>However, this information is not used by many search engines. At a 
            simple level, nearly all Web pages include a title, and some include 
            a description and keyword metadata. E.g.:</p>
          <p class="code">&lt;title&gt;Virtual Library museums pages (VLmp)&lt;/title&gt;</p>
          <p class="code">&lt;meta name=&#34;description&#34; content=&#34;Directory of museums, 
            part of the Virtual Library, an expert-run catalog of sections of the 
            Web. VLmp is also supported by the International Council of Museums 
            (ICOM) and the Museophile initiative.&#34;&gt;</p>
          <p class="code">&lt;meta name=&#34;keywords&#34; content=&#34;museums, museum, museos, 
            museo, musées, musée, musees, musee, museus, museu, museums, museum, 
            galleries, gallery, libraries, library, reference, Web, directory, catalog, 
            catalogue&#34;&gt;</p>
          <p>This is more likely to be taken into account by search engines. The 
            title is displayed by all major search engines and a suitable short 
            description line with important keywords should be included on every 
            Web page on a Web site. The &#34;description&#34; metadata is often 
            used as a brief explanation when a search engine displays a Web site. 
            Otherwise the first few lines of the actual Web page are typically used, 
            and these should always be as descriptive and meaningful as possible 
            because of this. The &#34;keyword&#34; metadata can be used to list 
            important keywords and phrases, perhaps in different languages if very 
            significant. The words in all these metadata entries may be weighted 
            to be more important for keyword matching than the rest of a Web page, 
            depending on the search engine.</p>
          <p>For general advice on consideration of search engines for a museum 
            Web site, the information in Bowen &amp; Bowen (2000) is still applicable. 
            It is possible to assess a Web site&#39;s popularity in terms of links to 
            it for search engines such as Google, AltaVista and HotBot (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkpopularity.com/">http://www.linkpopularity.com</a>). The 
            on-line tools available on the PageRank Web site may also be found to 
            be useful for checking and improving a Web site with respect to search 
            engines (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pagerank.net/">http://www.pagerank.net</a>). For more detailed 
            information on technical aspects of Google, see Calishain &amp; Dornfest 
            (2004).</p>
          <p>In this section, we have considered some of the possibilities that 
            a museum Web master has to improve the ranking of the museum&#39;s Web site. 
            However there are a lot of other opportunities to advance the service 
            that the search engines and other search-based Web sites are offering 
            to visitors, such as the personalization of search tools to make them 
            capable of profiling the user&#39;s preferences and to act on them effectively. 
            In the next section we consider the future and some of the customization 
            tools that are already available in advanced Web sites offering database 
            retrieval facilities.</p>
          <h2>Metadata Issues</h2>
          <p>After analyzing Web topology in detail and its effects on the activities 
            of search engine crawlers, we contest that it is best not to rely on 
            the addition of metadata to all information available on museum Web 
            sites, as well as in all other Web pages, in order to retrieve information 
            on the Web, although this may be possible on a smaller and perhaps collaborative 
            scale (Wisser, 2004). Let us start our discussion by considering the 
            Semantic Web (SW, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.semanticweb.org/">http://www.semanticWeb.org</a>), 
            which can be seen as the grand challenge project of adding metadata 
            automatically or manually to the entire Web: </p>
          <p>The main idea behind SW is that we try to extend the current Web with 
            additional information to make it possible that computers do understand 
            the content of Web pages. Of course, we are not going to remove or replace 
            the current Web. The SW is an extension, an additional layer on top 
            of the already existing Web<span class="BlockQuoteAuthorChar"> (Van Harmelen 2003: 2).</span><em></em></p>
          <p>The basic idea of the Semantic Web is to add a layer to the Web, as 
            it is now, to provide the users with extra information about the content 
            and the meaning of Web documents so that users can more easily access 
            what they are searching for. Though this project seems to be very promising 
            for restricted parts of the Web, such as good categories for e-commerce, 
            library catalogues or specific museum collections, it seems to be at 
            least problematic, from an epistemological point of view, to create 
            a standard vocabulary for metadata that is suitable for application 
            to every area of knowledge. The creation of ontologies is a very intractable 
            task, and nobody knows if the effort will ever end with a consistent 
            worthwhile result. </p>
          <p>Moreover, it is not clear at the moment if machines should be able 
            to attribute semantic tags directly to data, or if we need a group of 
            people with a librarian&#39;s mentality to add metadata information to all 
            the resources in a normal way. Both solutions, though involving different 
            difficulties, seem to share the characteristics of being a huge amount 
            of work that would take a long time and risk the need for a never-ending 
            checking endeavor. If we look at the Semantic Web, according to Tim 
            Berners-Lee vision, it will &#34;add logic to the Web&#34; (Berners-Lee, 
            1998). So even if we suppose that it is possible to overcome all the 
            various practical obstacles and achieve the desired result, what we 
            will end up with is something that is not similar to the Web as Berners-Lee 
            invented and we have learnt to appreciate, but instead a completely 
            new system. It will become a semantic-oriented database, and it will 
            lose the associative and innovative links opportunities anticipated 
            by Bush (1945), being restricted to the logical structure imposed by 
            the metadata layer that is not capable of taking into account the serendipitous 
            connections between different topics. </p>
          <p>The discussion about metadata applied to the museum collections&#39; cataloguing 
            process necessarily starts with acknowledgement that it is a useful 
            tool to organize materials and objects in order for them to be sorted 
            out when needed; however there are some issues that should be considered 
            very carefully before starting such an undertaking.</p>
          <p>In order to add metadata to collections of data, it is necessary to 
            make a huge cataloguing effort; even if the archival strategy inside 
            one institution is very consistent, there is no way to guarantee the 
            complete objectivity of the endeavour. Whoever has even a little experience 
            with attaching metadata to collections knows that this procedure is 
            inevitably influenced by the attitude of the interpretation made by 
            the archivist and is similar to a translation of catalogued documents. 
            Metadata are pictures, images of the objects themselves that offer a 
            unified vision of the database of the collection, but there is a cost 
            for the creation of the homogeneous vision: the removal of all the characteristics 
            that cannot be described by the fields defined at the beginning. </p>
          <p>As an example of the subjectivity and sometimes inadequacy of some 
            metadata standards, consider the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI, 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://dublincore.org/">http://dublincore.org</a>), hosted 
            by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oclc.org/">http://www.oclc.org</a>), that provides a significant 
            joint effort by those interested in the production and distribution 
            of on-line content. This initiative is to produce a metadata standard 
            in order to catalogue on-line resources. Looking at the &#34;elements&#34; 
            of the description, it can be seen that they were conceived with consideration 
            of offline resources such as books and articles in journals. Elements 
            such as Date, Publisher, Type, Source (a reference to a resource from 
            which the cataloguing object is derived), Coverage (spatial localization, 
            temporal localization, jurisdiction) are inadequate for the description 
            of on-line resources, and possibly even misleading for a correct interpretation 
            of their dynamic, multimedia, multi-author nature. </p>
          <p>Moreover, we have the issues related to comparisons between different 
            cataloguing styles in different institutions, despite the fact that 
            they may be dealing with the same types of documents or objects. Standards 
            can be misleading, but if they are not used it is even more difficult 
            to compare different databases or pose queries on them to obtain relevant 
            information that is available. When content is obtainable on-line, the 
            retrieval techniques should take into account not only the internal 
            cataloguing rules, but also how these rules can be linked to rules adopted 
            by other similar archives on the Web. It is idealistic to imagine that 
            a unique cataloguing style for all documents available in museums around 
            the world can be achieved. Such a project would not only be almost impossible 
            to realize, but would also be contrary to the spirit of the Web that 
            has more to do with the associative character of information that is 
            freely obtainable. </p>
          <p>In conclusion, there is an open question that needs to be raised: is 
            the effort of attaching metadata to museum collections proportionate 
            to the benefits offered in terms of facilitating access of material 
            in an on-line environment, such as the Web? It is clear that the use 
            of metadata is helpful internally in order to preserve, archive and 
            organize resources, but it is less clear if it is the right direction 
            to pursue for on-line access of materials. In the last section of this 
            paper, we will consider the future of search engine technology. These 
            approaches have not necessarily been applied directly to museums collections, 
            but it is possible that they could be used beneficially in such an environment.</p>
          <h2>The Future</h2>
          <p>It is impossible to predict the development of searching on-line with 
            any accuracy in our view. However, this section will consider some eclectic 
            issues that we believe to be important and that have the potential to 
            be developed significantly with regard to search engine technology and 
            usage.</p>
          <p>There are appealing user interface developments in the presentation 
            and visualization of search engine results as well as other aspects. 
            See, for example, KartOO (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.kartoo.com/">http://www.kartoo.com</a>), 
            a meta-search engine with a visual display map that helps to emphasize 
            the relative importance of different related keywords through their 
            displayed size, together with links between them (Bowen et al., 2003).</p>
          <p>There is also interesting research on content-based information retrieval 
            (CBIR) for both 2D and even 3D images, research which could be increasingly 
            useful for searching museum collections that have been digitized. See, 
            for example, the European SCULPTEUR Project (Semantic and content-based 
            multimedia exploitation for European benefit, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sculpteurweb.org/">http://www.sculpteurWeb.org</a>), including 
            3D object searching for museums (Goodall et al., 2004). However, image 
            search is beyond the main scope of the current paper, which concentrates 
            on text-based searching with search engines in finding existing (museum-related) 
            information on-line.</p>
          <p>The Virtual Library museums pages (VLmp) were an early attempt to form 
            a linked collection of museum Web sites allowing individuals in different 
            countries to participate in a virtual community and in an altruistic 
            spirit (Bowen, 2002). This could be developed further into a collaboratively 
            linked set of museum collections&#39; databases where objects across a wide 
            range of museums could be searched as easily as the Web is searched 
            today. However, this remains a vision for the future (Bowen, 2000), 
            despite some limited successes like Australian Museums &amp; Galleries 
            Online (AMOL, <a target="_blank" href="http://amol.org.au/">http://amol.org.au</a>), conceived in the early 1990s 
            to provide combined access to a number of Australian museum collections 
            and soon to be relaunched as the Collections Australia Network (CAN). 
            Such efforts are to be commended, but we really need museum collection 
            searching at the meta-level, combining this and other similar efforts 
            around the world, to provide a successful and widely available resource 
            of international value.</p>
          <p>The distributed Web mining research area is multifaceted, so we can 
            identify various streams that belong to it in one sense or another, 
            but they all share the view that a unique, centralized data repository 
            management is not the best way of investigating the variety of content 
            on the Web. They also mainly rely on the idea that machine-learning 
            bottom-down strategies can help both the indexing process and the personalization 
            of results according to users&#39; preferences. We can distinguish at least 
            three different approaches: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
             <em>Deep Agents</em> and focused crawling strategies 
              that allow the crawlers to create their own index while browsing the 
              pages, without relying on a unique repository. This paper is not the 
              right place to go more deeply in details in the present research in 
              the field; for more information on this topic, see Gori Numerico (2003) 
              and for further information see, for example, Diligenti <em>et al</em>. 
              (2000) and Chakrabarti <em>et al</em>. (1999).</li>
          <li><em>Shallow Agents</em>, personalization issues and &#34;push&#34; 
            technology.</li>
          <li><em>Peer-to-Peer</em> (P2P) clustering creation.</li>
        </ol>
        
          <p>We consider the last two aspects above in more detail in the following 
            sections.</p>
          <h3>Personalization Issues </h3>
          <p>Despite the existence of many search engines, searching on the Web 
            is still not an easy task (Shanfeng et al., 2001). Investigation into 
            the use of Web search engines indicates that users can typically encounter 
            a number of difficulties. These include the issue of finding information 
            relevant to their needs and also the problem of information overload 
            (Stobart &amp; Kerridge, 1996), as illustrated in the earlier case studies. 
            Typically, a search on Google, MSN Search, Yahoo! or AltaVista, for 
            example, can result in thousands of hits, many of which will not be 
            pertinent to a user’s enquiry. This is due in part to the keyword search 
            approach, which does not necessarily capture the user&#39;s intent. Another 
            reason for irrelevant results from search engines is a semantic gap 
            between the meanings of terms used by the user and their use in Web 
            pages stored by search engines. In addition, each search engine normally 
            has its own non-customizable ranking system, where users cannot tell 
            the search engine what preferences to use for search criteria (Kerschberg 
            et al., 2002).</p>
          <p>Software called intelligent searching agents has been developed in 
            order to try to ameliorate these problems. Typically, these tools include 
          &#34;spider&#34; or &#34;Web crawler&#34; software (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler</a>) 
            that can be trained by the user to search the Web for specific types 
            of information resources. The agent can be personalized by its owner 
            so that it can build up a picture of individual likes, dislikes and 
            information needs. Once trained, an agent can then be set free to roam 
            the network to search for useful information sources. Different methods 
            of gathering the user&#39;s data are applied by means of various personalization 
            techniques and associated agents. </p>
          <p>Relevance feedback, for example, is a powerful technique having its 
            roots in traditional textual Information Retrieval (IR) research (Li 
            et al., 2001). It is an interactive process of improving the retrieval 
            results by automatically adjusting the original query based on information 
            feedback by users about the relevance of previously retrieved documents. 
            In the metasearch engine SavvySearch (Shanfeng et al., 2002), for example, 
            now Search.com (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.search.com/">http://www.search.com</a>), relevance feedback is 
            used for selecting suitable source search engines. Two types of events, 
            namely no results found and actual visits made are identified as negative 
            or positive feedback from the user (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.search.com/help/index.html?tag=se.fd.box.main.help">http://www.search.com/help/index.html?tag=se.fd.box.main.help</a>). 
          </p>
          <p>Another commonly used technique is user profiling, which, unlike relevance 
            feedback, has its origins in the field of information filtering and 
            recommendation. In user profiling, the system monitors a stream of information 
            and selects what matches the user&#39;s interests (Li et al., 2001). These 
            interests can be inferred explicitly by asking the user to fill in a 
            profile. Yahoo, for example, has taken advantage of its relationship 
            with visitors to deliver more tailored answers in specific areas: its 
            yellow pages, weather information and My Yahoo! (<a target="_blank" href="http://my.yahoo.com/">http://my.yahoo.com</a>) sections all use members&#39; 
            ZIP codes or other personal data to deliver tailored information (Olsen, 
            2003).</p>
          <p>A similar concept is applied in Google personalized (<a target="_blank" href="http://labs.google.com/personalized">http://labs.google.com/personalized</a>), 
            which invites users to create a profile by selecting categories of interest 
            from a pre-selected list. Once the profile has been defined,  users 
            can choose the degree of personalization they want via a slide bar at 
            the top of the screen. At the lowest setting the results appear the 
            same as users would get with the standard Google search engine. For 
            instance, users expressing an interest in art and searching for the 
            word &#34;Morandi&#34; (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Morandi">http://www.google.com/search?q=Morandi</a>) 
            will receive listings on the artist as opposed to receiving links to 
            the Italian singer. The degree of personalization can also be adjusted 
            on a sliding scale in real-time, allowing users to receive results that 
            follow their preferences or are more general in nature (Pruitt, 2004). 
            The type of personalization that Google&#39;s prototype offers is fairly 
            minor; it allows users to check a few areas of interest but no more 
            than this. For example, demographic preferences cannot be selected, 
            and there are not even very many subcategories from which to choose. 
            However the value of the application, as underlined by Goodman (2004), 
            is in the functionality of the slider or dial, which allows the user 
            to watch the impact of changing settings on how the search results are 
            ranked.</p>
          <p>Explicit user profiling depends on the willingness of users to provide 
            information about themselves and their awareness of self-needs. However, 
            many Web users prefer not to provide personal information if they do 
            not benefit from it immediately. A search engine user may prefer not 
            to spend time creating a profile when searching for information for 
            a research paper. In this case, the system has to construct the user 
            model by inferring knowledge from the user&#39;s behavior and exploiting 
            user feedback about the relevance of documents implicitly.</p>
          <p>Many search engines already use some rudimentary implicit personalization 
            features. AltaVista (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.altavista.com/">http://www.altavista.com</a>), 
            for example, uses so-called &#34;geotracking&#34; technology to detect 
            visitors&#39; Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and guess their geographical 
            location. That can provide useful context for some searches, for example, 
            in returning museum-related results for a query on &#34;Picasso&#34; 
            from a user based in France (Olsen, 2003). In a more sophisticated way, 
            WebWatcher (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.webwatcher.org/">http://www.Webwatcher.org</a>) also monitors 
            and learns from the actions taken by its users. It continuously adapts 
            its behavior and improves its efficiency when visiting Web sites that 
            it has accessed in the past. WebWatcher&#39;s learning is based on an active 
            user profile, the interests that the user has expressed during the current 
            search and the Web page that is being currently accessed (Vozalis et 
            al., 2001). Another example is Eurekster (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.eurekster.com/">http://www.eurekster.com</a>), 
            a search engine able to learn from the user&#39;s search habits; if the 
            user follows a link and spends more than a minute on  the page, that 
            link will be closer to the top the next time the user searches that 
            term (see later for further details).</p>
          <p>Once the data concerning the user&#39;s interests has been collected either 
            implicitly or explicitly or even in both ways, which is often the case 
          – e.g., see the software agent, Syskill &amp; Webert, (Pazzani et al., 
            1996) – appropriate search results are determined and delivered. This 
            process usually follows one or a combination of the following techniques: 
            content based or collaborative filtering. The content-based approach 
            first represents the user’s preferences and then evaluates Web pages 
            relevance in terms of its content and user preferences. WebWatcher falls 
            into this category. On the contrary, the collaborative approach determines 
            information relevancy based on similarity among users rather than similarity 
            of the information itself (Kerschberg et al., 2002).</p>
          <p>An example of such system is Eurekster (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.eurekster.com/">http://www.eurekster.com</a>), 
            which allows the user to get his/her friends to join one of the service&#39;s 
          &#34;Searchgroups&#34;. The links the friends like will appear higher 
            in the user’s results when he/she searches on the same term. For example, 
            take a search for &#34;Sisley,&#34; the popular Impressionist artist. 
            Without refinement, Eurekster brings back a variety of results, leading 
            off with the clothing company. But the user is thinking of the impressionist 
            artist who is listed only in position three. By clicking on the site, 
            the user interest in it is registered by Eurekster (implicit user profiling). 
            Now, if one of the registered friends of the user does the same &#34;Sisley&#34; 
            search, the artist&#39;s Web site moves up to position one, with a little 
            Eurekster &#34;e&#34; icon next to it. That&#39;s to alert them that someone 
            in their network likes this site. Eurekster does more than refine the 
            results. It can also show the user the things that other people in his/her 
            network are looking for. So when the user searched for &#34;Sisley,&#34; 
            anyone else in his/her network sees that query get listed in the &#34;Your 
            Friends Recent Searches&#34; area in the right-hand column of the Eurekster 
            search results page. To protect privacy, Eurekster makes it possible 
            to do a &#34;private search&#34; by checking a box below the search 
            box (Sullivan, 2004). </p>
          <p>As the Web can be considered a social network, this property can be 
            exploited for search purposes also on the side of potential explicit 
            or implicit social collaboration in the organization and categorization 
            of the network information. If we can create devices that allow us to 
            share and organize collectively the knowledge of each individual member 
            of the community, and if we succeed in creating methods to propagate 
            trust and control distrust (Guha et al., 2004), then we can benefit 
            from the expert evaluation of links and from the creation of a collectively 
            built, trustworthy, free knowledge base (Resnick et al., 1994). </p>
          <p>In the social data mining systems, which represent an enhanced version 
            of the collaborative categorization, it is not even required that the 
            users be engaged in an explicit contribution to the community. The system 
            seeks to exploit users’ behaviours to detect the information implicit 
            in the records of their existing activities (Amento et al., 2003). </p>
          <p>A successful example of implementation using these techniques is the 
            Amazon knowledge management system, which monitors the buying habits 
            of previous clients to provide prospects with suggestions which are 
            frequently very effective, relying on preferences of other similar customers. 
            The overall system also benefits from the creation of the sense of belonging 
            to a virtual community of shared interests (Beler et al., 2004).</p>
          <p>The hypertextual, distributed and associative nature of the Web implies 
            the necessity of innovative research strategies in order to overcome 
            the weaknesses and shortcomings of the current information retrieval 
            techniques. Distributed and social systems of data mining offer promising 
            approaches to Web search techniques and methods. Collectively, museum 
            Web sites are in a very privileged position to exploit community building 
            in order to retrieve, suggest, and evaluate their available content. 
            Though the cultural institutions are not particularly powerful from 
            the economic point of view, they are very rich in term of the quality 
            of the audience. They attract a range of people from specialized professionals 
            to a well-cultivated community that, if correctly stimulated, could 
            be eager to communicate with each other and build up the collaborative 
            filtering structure to spread and share information. </p>
          <h3>Push Versus Pull Technology</h3>
          <p>Until now we have considered ways to allow users &#34;to pull&#34; 
            the information desired from the Web through search engines. However, 
            there is also another way to get to the same information; that is to 
            say, through the so called &#34;push technology&#34; . The concept 
            of information &#34;push&#34; technology originated as a way to automate 
            the searching and retrieval of information from the Internet, such as 
            stock market, news and weather forecasts. Based on user-defined criteria, 
            a push application automatically searches a database for specific information 
            and delivers it straight to the end-user&#39;s desktop. It is a convenient 
            way to receive information the user may not otherwise know exists, and 
            eliminates the need to go and find it (Murray, 2002). </p>
          <p>In simplest terms, push refers to software that delivers Web information 
            to consumers, rather than forcing consumers to forage through the Web 
            to find it. The concept attracted considerable attention in the mid-1990s 
            when PointCast, a now-defunct company founded in 1992, launched the 
            first push technology-based product to deliver customized news and other 
            information to users&#39; desktops. PointCast Network was free. To use it, 
            the user needed to download the PointCast client program, which was 
            available from PointCast&#39;s Web site and many other places. The initial 
            success of this product, as well as similar ones like BackWeb and Castanet, 
            was mainly due to the fact that it seemed to reduce the problem of information 
            overload. But despite the clamor, push technology has encountered some 
            difficulties in gaining users&#39; confidence. Some early detractors, in 
            fact, complained that having their computer automatically log onto the 
            Web and retrieve data on a predetermined schedule was obtrusive; others 
            objected that the filters employed by these programs were not smart 
            enough to sift the truly relevant information from the unnecessary. 
            And many others simply saw a basic contradiction between the concept 
            of push and the interactivity of the Web: push technology renders the 
            user passive, as with television (Flynn, 1998). </p>
          <p>Yet many analysts say that at least in theory, the idea of aggregating 
            Web content and then delivering it to users makes sense (Flynn, 1998), 
            as proven by the fact that different push technology-based products 
            keep on being launched onto the market. The last of a long list of companies 
            which have taken up push technology to facilitate the search of information 
            by their users is Google Alert (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.googlealert.com/">http://www.googlealert.com</a>, 
            not affiliated with Google). This alert facility tracks anything on 
            the Web by automatically running daily personalized Google searches 
            and alerts users to new results by email, RSS or an on-line browser. 
            The driving vision beyond this project, as admitted by Gideon Greenspan, 
            Google Alert’s founder, was &#34;to cut through information overload 
            by providing a personalized service that connects people directly with 
            their interests&#34; (GoogleAlert, 2004).</p>
          <p>These same principles could be also applied in a virtual museum context, 
            where some institutions especially the big ones, whose Web contents 
            get updated on a daily basis, could set up personalized alert systems 
            that identify recent additions to the Web site and alert the user, based 
            on specified preferences or related preferences of similar users. This 
            is for example the case of the Louvre or the National Museum of Photography, 
            Film and Television (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nmpft.org.uk/">http://www.nmpft.org.uk</a>) 
            in Bradford, UK, which are planning to introduce systems based on this 
            philosophy: instead of providing everybody with standard information 
            concerning the museum&#39;s activities, services and products, the personalized 
            alert system will allow the virtual visitor to set their own profile 
            by defining their personal interests on a fill-in form and sending an 
            e-mail address or a mobile phone number. Whenever a relevant exhibition, 
            conference or concert of interest is about to take place, the user will 
            be automatically informed about it by e-mail or SMS text message (Filippini-Fantoni, 
            2003). By doing so, the user will find out more easily about information 
            of interest without making the effort to visit the museum&#39;s Web site 
            and look for it. By facilitating access to information with a minimal 
            effort from the user, such alert systems can improve the relationship 
            between the user and the institution. This is why we can foresee that 
            these push solutions will find easy application in the museum context.  
          </p>
          <h3>Peer-to-Peer Searching</h3>
          <p>Besides personalization and push technology, there is another interesting 
            stream of research that we believe will offer interesting perspectives 
            for cultural institutions and heritage information archive. Distributed 
            Information Retrieval (DIR) studies problems of searching distributed 
            and heterogeneous repositories. The distributed searching standard, 
            Z39.50 (ISO, 1998; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/">http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency</a>) 
            exists but is rather complicated and not very widely used in practice. 
            In order to obtain results using DIR, there are various issues that 
            need to be tackled: the identification of a common language for the 
            resource description, the creation of repository selection schemes and 
            the development of methods for merging different ranked lists returned 
            from searches in inhomogeneous archives. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks 
            are distributed and dynamic; they allow the participation of many members 
            and the use of low cost systems, built on the principle of utilizing 
            unused computing resources. </p>
          <p>SETS (Search Enhanced by Topic Segmentation) is a very promising project 
            in this area. It puts together the machine-learning tradition of topic 
            segmentation studies and social network results, integrating them with 
            P2P search methods (Bawa et al., 2003). This is a topic segmentation 
            based network that provides efficient search facilities on P2P networks. 
            The key idea is to arrange sites in a network such that a search query 
            probes only a small subset of sites where most of the matching documents 
            reside. In the network, there are two kinds of links: short distance 
            links connect sites within the same content segment; long distance links 
            connect pairs of sites from different segments, so that queries are 
            routed only in the relevant areas of the network, without invading all 
            the networks with irrelevant traffic. The idea behind this project is 
            to create various dynamic networks based on subject clustering that 
            can be used to route questions matching the subject of the specific 
            sub-network.</p>
          <p>Museums could create a special Peer-to-Peer (P2P) dynamic network that 
            connects different institutions according to their areas of interests. 
            The repository of documents should not be kept centrally, but as in 
            P2P networks be distributed all over the network. This lack of centralized 
            network has different advantages: it reduces the cost of using a unique 
            repository (and the consequent need of making it profitable as in search 
            engines ones), it guarantees better coverage of relevant materials due 
            to the dynamic control within each subnetwork, and it favors the precision 
            of results in terms of the quality of the queries that match, due to 
            the machine-learning dynamic clustering of similar Web sites. Note that 
            the system works on Web sites, not on individual Web pages like search 
            engines.</p>
          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>Information retrieval techniques are one of the key issues for the 
            development of the Web as the huge repository of worldwide information. 
            It is still an open question which is the direction of research to pursue 
            in order to achieve the best results. We are sure that there is still 
            space for new paradigms and new models since we are just at the beginning 
            of the research in the field. However it is critical that cultural institutions 
            such as museums, the heritage and memory keepers, be aware of the issues 
            under discussion and not rely completely on commercial enterprises for  
            solutions.  They must provide interesting suggestions to commercial 
            partners and underline for them the necessity for qualitative evaluation 
            of results. For example, an open source search engine is a possible 
            route to the future (e.g., see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nutch.org/">http://www.nutch.org</a>). 
            It is desirable for the museum community to participate in or monitor 
            joint initiatives – like SCULPTEUR (Goodall et al., 2004) and the DELOS 
            European Network of Excellence on Digital Libraries (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.delos.info/">http://www.delos.info</a>) 
            that started in 2004, for example – to investigate and check for new 
            promising solutions to content-based information retrieval problems 
            with respect to museum collections on the Web. </p>
