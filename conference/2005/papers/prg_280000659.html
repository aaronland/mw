        <h1>Digitisation of Community Indigenous Knowledge in Developing Countries: 
          A Strategy for Uganda</h1>
        <h2>Elisam Magara, East African School of Library and Information Science, 
          Makerere University, Uganda</h2>
        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">Ugandans aspire for positive cultural 
          values for the promotion of socio-economic development and equal opportunities 
          for all – a heritage that is free of negative cultural values, 
          practices and traditions. However, the major constraint of developing 
          countries has been the absence of community-based information systems 
          to enable local people to contribute to decision-making, planning and 
          management. While technological advancement constitutes a vital component 
          of economic development, there is a conspicuous and persistent lack 
          of indigenous knowledge (IK) technological advancement and a greater 
          dependency on exogenous technologies. </p>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">A qualitative research design team 
          collected data from various IK communities and institutions that were 
          selected purposively. Interviews, observations, and document analysis 
          were the main forms of data collection. IK experts, knowledgeable and 
          skilled personnel, and community leaders, among others, were selected. 
          Data was analyzed and presented according to the main objectives and 
          themes of the study. </p>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">It was observed that there is hardly 
          any system of recording, documenting, preserving and safeguarding documentary 
          heritage, or of democratizing access and raising awareness of its significance 
          to the achievement of community objectives. This paper attempts to establish 
          the documented IK, the content, form and attributes of records kept 
          about IK; assesses the digitization requirements; and propose strategies 
          for its digitization in Uganda. This strategy would provide direction 
          to various stakeholders towards the digitization process. A co-ordinating 
          unit in the country, with appropriate management structures in place 
          to set guidelines and carry out marketing and awareness strategy, is 
          a priority for the appropriate digitization of IK in Uganda.</p>

        <h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Therefore, if it is seen good to the king, let a 
          search be made in the royal Archives there in Babylon, to see whether 
          a decree was issued by Cyrus the king for rebuilding of this house of 
          God in Jerusalem … Then Darius the king made a decree, and a search 
          was made in Babylonia, in the house of the Archives where the documents 
          were stored. And in Ecbat’na, the Capital which is in the province 
          of Media, a scroll was found on which this was written (<em>Ezera, </em><em>5:17</em><em> 
          – 6:1).</em></p>
        <p>Indigenous Knowledge (IK) is highly valued in traditional African societies 
          for its practical results and implications for life (Gyeke, 1996:137). 
          IK and cultural heritage and tradition can be historically traced – 
          not only in Uganda, but also in developing countries and the world at 
          large. In preliterate society, man depended on live memory and the spoken 
          word. We have collections of palaeographic writings found in very early 
          civilisations that are believed to have begun around 4000 BC in the 
          river valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates (Mesopotamia), in the Nile 
          valley, and a thousand years later in the Indus valley (Harley &amp; 
          Hampden, 1964:9). In fact, like all archaeological disciplines, palaeography 
          shows writing as a heritage of man’s entry into historical time. 
          By 2700 BC, Sumerians had established private and government libraries 
          for preserving their varied hieroglyphic writings, that were adapted 
          by the Babylonians to cuneiform, scripted on wet clay (Sengupta &amp; 
          Chakraborty, 1981:13). Similarly, the Egyptians’ hieroglyphics 
          on papyrus sheets were adopted by the Mediterranean world: Assyrians, 
          Hittites, Canaanites, and others, up to late 1022 AD. For many years 
          world wide, IK has been preserved and maintained by various institutions 
          such as governments, university libraries, church libraries, museums, 
          public libraries, private libraries, historical and research institutions, 
          literary societies, and national archives (Sengupta and Chakraborty, 
          1981:29-76). </p>
        <p>In Africa, colonial administration was determined by the dominance 
          which agencies of foreign control were able to assert over our (African) 
          Indigenous structures (Brett, 1973:19) to transfer skills and resources 
          to the indigenous population (Brett, 1973:21). Many derogatory labels 
          such as primitive, pagan, and ungodly were given to IK in the past. 
          Christianity took a similar approach to African culture. As a result, 
          many Africans who converted to Christianity started to look down on 
          their cultural heritage, and the IK of their dances and music, let alone 
          forms of worship, was practically obliterated. The incorporation of 
          Christian religious education into school syllabi served to prejudice 
          the students against their traditional culture and increasingly to neglect 
          African culture. This led to a decline in the use of IK. </p>
        <p>Uganda is a multi-ethnic nation forged through a colonial approach 
          where territorial boundaries were drawn out of political or administrative 
          expediency rather than ethnic or cultural considerations. The country 
          is well endowed with cultural, historical, and natural sites of great 
          archaeological and tourist importance (Gakwandi, 1999:96). Ugandans 
          aspire to positive cultural values for the promotion of socio-economic 
          development and equal opportunities in cultural heritage. This strategy 
          aims at tapping Uganda’s diverse cultural heritage through mobilisation 
          of people and resources in the social and economic environment. </p>
        <p>To provide socio-economic transformation in Uganda, the Poverty Eradication 
          Action Plan (PEAP) promises to deliver substantial improvement to Uganda 
          and its poorest people by the year 2017. Under the Uganda Poverty Reduction 
          Strategy, PEAP is hoping to transform Uganda into a modern economy. 
          It envisages the creation of an enabling environment for rapid and sustainable 
          economic growth and structural transformation (Government of Uganda, 
          2000). Despite progress made by the government on PEAP, there is still 
          no co-ordinated strategy for disseminating information to the community 
          for national development. While technological advancement constitutes 
          a vital component of economic development, there is a conspicuous and 
          persistent lack of IT application to IK, and consequently a greater 
          dependence on exogenous technologies. Much has yet to be done to create 
          the appropriate climate for the infusion and integration of IK innovations 
          into the mainstream of industrial, technological and economic growth 
          and development. This requires a co-ordinated network of information 
          sources, systems and services to ensure sustainability, conservation 
          and regeneration of IK resources, and the exchange and sharing of information 
          and experience among communities.</p>
        <p>This paper provides a mechanism through which relevant information 
          on community IK can be electronically documented and made available 
          to other communities, and shows how to create linkages between Ugandans 
          and the rest of the global community. </p>
        <h1>A Framework for Digitisation of Community IK</h1>
        <p>A community is associated with a quality relationship that involves 
          the sharing of more than just physical space. At the micro level, community 
          includes households, individuals and gender roles. Community values, 
          principles, norms, and unwritten rules and procedures comprise the cultural 
          knowledge resource of a community (Holsapple and Joshi, 2002:53). Indigenous 
          knowledge is unique to a given culture or society and communities (Roseroka, 
          2002:1). In fact, UNESCO (1995) provides guidelines for safeguarding 
          documentary heritage: its aim is to safeguard the world’s documentary 
          heritage, democratise access to it, and raise awareness about its significance 
          and the need to preserve it. In Uganda, there is hardly any system of 
          recording, documenting and preserving indigenous information, let alone 
          a mechanism for capturing IK to cope with dynamic world needs. Digitisation 
          is ideal for sharing, exchanging, educating, and preserving indigenous 
          knowledge and cultures. This requires a clear design for metadata and 
          standards procedures, multimedia technologies, and appropriate structures 
          for access and use.</p>
        <h2>The Metadata and Standards</h2>
        <p>Various indigenous groups have been able to record and preserve significant 
          aspects of IK (Hunter, Koopman &amp; Sledge, 2002:1). A number of systems 
          exist, ranging from the traditional cataloguing approaches of Machine 
          Readable Cataloguing (MARC), Anglo American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd (AACR2), 
          and WorldCat (Online Computer Library Centre (OCLC on-line Union catalogue). 
          The other approaches include the United States MARC (USMARC), Online 
          Public Access Catalogues (OPACs), Web OPAC, Matchbox, and Dublin Core 
          that facilitate network resource information retrieval (Weibel, 1997:6). 
          Recently, a team of metadata researchers visiting Quinkan rock art in 
          Cape York, Australia, proposed a collaboration with Quinkan Culture elders 
          (Nevile, 2003:1). The team developed <strong>Matchbox – </strong>a 
          cataloguing system, using qualified Dublin Core (DC) Metadata – 
          to describe, collect, and represent Quinkan culture. The description 
          that is produced for items in Matchbox can be represented completely 
          in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), written in plain text with tags; 
          and the content, in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) (Nevile, 
          2003:6). Weibel (1997:9) defines the Dublin Core elements as title, 
          creator, subject, description, publisher, contributor, date, type (category), 
          format, identifier, source, language, relationship to other resources, 
          coverage, and rights. Hunter classifies metadata requirements for multimedia 
          as bibliographic metadata and formatting metadata that include structural, 
          content, events and rights (Hunter, 2002:6). At the National Library 
          of Education in the USA, Sutton and Oh (1997:21) identified the variables 
          of a gateway to educational materials to include systematic metadata 
          profile, syntax and well-specified practices (standards), prototype 
          interfaces, harvesting tools for retrieving (multimedia), and organisational 
          structure and use. On the Web, recording the Unique Resource Identifier 
          (URI), Universal Resource Locator (URL), Universal Resource Names, (URN), 
          and Universal Resource Characteristics (URC) is a fundamental requirement 
          for the bibliographic description of networked resources (Schwartz, 
          1997:12). The URI, for instance, is the primary work of the Dublin 
          Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES). Domain-specific ontologies have been 
          developed by two different International Organisations for Standards 
          (ISO) working groups to standardise the semantics associated with the 
          description of museum objects and multi-media content (Hunter, 2002:1). 
          However, no single ontology or metadata model exists for describing 
          IK multimedia content. </p>
        <h1>Multimedia Technologies</h1>
        <p>Hunter (2003:3) has observed that technologies in a digitisation environment 
          are multimedia in nature. These technologies include images, audio, 
          video, and multimedia. Images technologies consist of photographs, prints, 
          manuscripts, documents, drawings, paintings, movie stills, and posters. 
          Audio technologies include songs, music, plays, interviews, oral histories, 
          radio programs, speeches, lectures, performances, language recordings. 
          Video/film technologies include full features, documentaries, news clips, 
          anthropological/expedition footage, home movies, animation; whereas 
          multimedia include presentations and slide shows (Hunter, 2002:3). </p>
        <p>The Cultural Centre of the Smithsonian National Museum of the American 
          Indian, USA, has developed a set of inexpensive, simple, and robust 
          software tools designed to enable description, annotation and rights 
          management of collections of mixed media digital and physical objects 
          in various IK categories (Hunter, Koopman &amp; Sledge, 2002:2). This 
          institution has also developed a search, retrieval, and presentation 
          interface which retrieves different result sets, and aggregates the 
          results automatically into coherent multimedia Synchronised Multimedia 
          Integration Language (SMIL) (synchronised) presentations. The developers 
          recommend that design requirements for software include a security mechanism, 
          a simple user interface, robustness, low cost, interoperability, portability, 
          flexibility, and scalability (ibid:6). According to them, software tools 
          should be built on international standards such as Dublin Core, in order 
          to ensure maximum interoperability between disparate databases. They 
          also recommend an additional security mechanism such as XML Encryption, 
          XML Digital Signatures (XML Digital), Security Assertion Mark-up Language 
          (SAML), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and watermarking techniques (Hunter, 
          Koopman &amp; Sledge, 2002: 18). </p>
        <h2>Structures for Access and Use</h2>
        <p>One way of ensuring IK developments in African Countries is to establish 
          documentation units and networks where recorded information is stored 
          and made available for use by all those who wish to access IK (Chisenga, 
          2002:98). For example, in Australia, various networks, including the 
          Australian Cultural Network (CAN), Government Information Locator Services 
          (GILS), Environmental Resources Information Network (ERIN), The Education 
          Network of Australia (EdNA), Australian and New Zealand Land Information 
          Council (AZLIC), and the Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO), 
          have attempted digitisation of community IK (Maguire, 1997:18). Similarly, 
          the Land Data Bank System in Sweden and the New York Computerised Criminal 
          History System in the USA facilitate the sharing of information among 
          various systems (Gavrel, 1990:23). That is why it is important to define 
          distributed digital access strategy, search/discovery services, interfaces, 
          and user and information systems or gateways (e.g. African Digital Library) 
          to create the environment in which the user is in control of the use 
          of information (Maguire, 1997:18). In fact, Andemichael, Magara and 
          Nyumba (2003:79) suggest a system to register, index, search, and make 
          reports. Although technology has made more information more available 
          to more people, at the same time it has made access to it more difficult 
          (Feather, 1994:35). The major concern is how to adapt these technologies 
          to meet the needs of the developing world (Magara, 2002b:146). In 
          fact Ngulube (2002:64) believes that proper marketing of IK systems, 
          products and services will promote the accessibility and usage of IK 
          information in developing countries. Magara (2002c:254) suggests 
          the integration of ICT into curriculum, to ensure information literacy 
          skills and change attitudes among communities. This, however, requires 
          that when formulating a digitisation strategy, the needs of users be 
          considered for sustaining the usage of a system. This paper provides 
          the guidelines for sustainable digitisation of IK information in Uganda.</p>
        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p>A qualitative research design was adopted, and the IK institutions 
          and organisations from which to collect data were purposely selected. 
          Interviews, observations and document analysis were the main data collection 
          methods. The respondents of the study were IK information managers, 
          skilled personnel, government officials, and community and institutional 
          leaders, among others. Interviews were conducted with the Heads of programmes 
          on culture, library and archives in both UTV and Radio Uganda. The officials 
          in charge of Culture and Tradition in Buganda Kingdom, and the Secretary 
          to ultimo Court on the Origins of Norms of Clans of Buganda at Kasubi 
          Tombs were interviewed to represent traditional and cultural foundations 
          and Sites. The librarians of the National Library of Uganda, Parliamentary 
          Library, Uganda National Council of Science and Technology, Uganda Society, 
          a Deputy Librarian in charge of the Africana Section, Makerere University, 
          and 2 Librarians concerned with information and reference in Makerere 
          University were interviewed. The Ag.. Government Archivist of the National 
          Archives, Entebbe; 2 Conservators, African Creation of the Art Gallery, 
          and the Public Relations Officer, Uganda National Cultural Centre (The 
          National Theatre) formed part of the interviewees. The study also interviewed 
          one Lecturer in the Department of Music, Dance and Drama; the Principal 
          Conservator of the Uganda Museum and the Librarian Uganda Society;. 
          a desk officer at National Council of Sports, and one proprietor of 
          a traditional sport (Mr. Kagongi). Physical visits were made to observe 
          how information on IK is documented in the Uganda Museum, National Archives, 
          and historical and traditional sites. Analysis of documents of the institutions’ 
          brochures, strategic plans, finding aids, Web sites, and company files 
          was done. Data was analyzed and presented according to the main theme 
          of the study, including the institutions that keep IK information, the 
          content of IK, the records kept about IK, and the digitization requirements 
          for IK. </p>
        <h1>Findings</h1>
        <p>The study identified places that manage IK information, that information’s 
          content, the records kept about it, and requirements for digitising 
          it.</p>
        <h2>Institutions that Keep IK Information in Uganda </h2>
        <p>A number of efforts have been made in the promotion of community IK 
          in Uganda, with varying degrees of success. The institutions that have 
          made efforts include the Uganda Museum, National Council of Science 
          and Technology, National Art Gallery, National Council of Sports, National 
          Archives, various cultural centres, the National Library of Uganda, 
          the Deposit Library and Documentation Centres, among others. </p>
        <p>The National Library of Uganda (NLU), formally Public Libraries Board, 
          1964, participates in the promoting of a reading culture. It acts as 
          a depository of national and foreign government documents, and compiles 
          and publishes a national bibliography. This new NLU role was formerly 
          a responsibility of Makerere University Library (Africana Section) from1958 
          and the Documentation Centre at Uganda Management Institute from 1969. 
          Currently, Makerere University Library keeps general literature on Africa: 
          books, papers, letters, notices, reports, diaries of events, church 
          memoranda, registers, and manuscripts that are important to Uganda’s 
          heritage. Its materials date back to the late nineteenth Century. The 
          National Archives offers research service and enriches the cultural 
          heritage of the country. It preserves and disposes of records and archives, 
          and makes records available for consultation. </p>
        <p>The Department of Antiquities and Museums is responsible for historical, 
          archaeological, and palaenotological sites within Uganda. These include 
          traditional sites, buildings, signposts, and tombs. It is concerned 
          with conservation, research and preservation of sites. This role derives 
          from the Historical Monuments Act of 1967, which provides for the legal 
          protection of sites of historical, archaeological and palaeontological 
          importance. The over-all aim of this department is to develop such sites 
          into educational centers for the people of Uganda as well as for interested 
          foreign visitors. The specific objectives include preserving, conserving, 
          promoting, and presenting the national cultural heritage. </p>
        <p>Uganda Museum was established in 1902 and became a part of the Ministry 
          of Culture and Community Development in 1954. The other two museums 
          are in the towns Kabale and Soroti, which provide homes for limited 
          ethnographic collections. The Uganda Museum portrays the lands of Uganda 
          and activities of its people, collects and keeps document information 
          as well as artifacts about the culture, history and natural history 
          of Uganda, and offers rich ethnographic displays of a wide range of 
          traditional life of the peoples of Uganda. Uganda&#39;s cultural, historical 
          and natural sites and monuments preserve a wide range of documentary 
          heritage of Ugandan culture, including royal burial sites, traditional 
          dances, traditional scriptures, drums, etc.</p>
        <p>Radio Uganda and Uganda Television (UTV), which started in 1962 and 
          1963 respectively, are mandated to educate, entertain, inform and mobilize 
          people. They both offer programmes related to culture and religion, 
          entertainment, gender issues, education, and sports. They play different 
          kinds of music, ranging from local to international. They have been 
          instrumental in mobilizing and sensitizing people to the dynamics of 
          community development and cultural heritage. </p>
        <p>The National Theatre was established by Ordinance of the Legislative 
          Council in 1959 as the main centre for developing performing arts in 
          Uganda. The Theatre facilitates the presentation of cultural songs and 
          cultural dances, drama and poetry. It aims at preserving culture by 
          educating the masses through music, dance and drama. It has a resource 
          centre about art and culture, and a crafts village. Besides the National 
          Theatre, the National Cultural Center (the Nommo Galley) was established 
          in 1964 to promote fine art. Its major areas are textile designs, ceramics, 
          and scripture. The National Council of Sports is mandated to organise 
          games and sports in the country. They have introduced African traditional 
          games and sports to preserve African culture. For example, schools are 
          now encouraged to organise indigenous sports and games like <em>Omweso 
          (</em>a local indoor sport that helps in memorizing and counting<em>) 
          </em>and <em>Amahiri </em>(a traditional field sport with rich language 
          and logic components<em>)</em>. In fact, the <em>Amahiri</em> Sport 
          Association in Uganda was established in 2004 to promote and encourage 
          <em>Amahiri</em> sports in Uganda. </p>
        <p>Educational institutions in Uganda are attempting to transfer indigenous 
          knowledge to the students in a number of fields. At Makerere University, 
          the Departments of History, and Music, Dance and Drama are involved. 
          The others are the East Africa School of Library and Information Science, 
          the School of Fine and Industrial Art, and the Faculty of Technology. 
          For example, the Department of Music, Dance and Drama trains specialist 
          teachers to be performers, composers, choreographers, and playwrights 
          using traditional dances. On its part, the East African School of Library 
          and Information Science has introduced palaeography, oral history and 
          tradition, museum, preservation and conservation, and archives management 
          to its curriculum.</p>
        <p>The Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (UNCST) with 
          the assistance of UNESCO and the International Development Research 
          Council (IDRC), is promoting the use of community Tele-centres in Uganda 
          (eg, Nakaseke, Buwama and Nabweru) to enable communities in remote places 
          to access information on the global network. UNCST is also currently 
          promoting the adoption of the African Traditional Healing System to 
          involve the people in health care delivery and the fight against HIV/Aids. 
          Emphasis is in areas of traditional medicines, pure herbalists, herbalists/spiritualists, 
          divines and magicians, mixed activity practitioners, bone settlers, 
          and traditional midwives. </p>
        <p>UNESCO has put in place the Preservation and Revitalisation of Uganda’s 
          Oral and Intangible Heritage Programme. It includes on its list of World 
          Heritage Sites two Ugandan heritage sites, Bwindi Impenetrable National 
          Park and Rwenzori National Park. The General Information Programme (PGI) 
          of UNESCO, co-ordinated by NLU, has undertaken a CD-ROM project that 
          targets collection of locally published books. </p>
        <p>However, although all the above institutions and initiatives are focused 
          on the preservation of culture heritage, there is no central strategy 
          in place to collect, store, preserve, co-ordinate and enable access 
          to IK information in Uganda. </p>
        <h2>Records kept about IK</h2>
        <h3>Content of Community IK Kept</h3>
        <p>The study attempted to establish the content of the community IK kept 
          in most of the institutions. The majority of institutions keep information 
          relating to the history of people and their institutions, customs and 
          cultures. These include marriages, sports, crafts, medicine, indigenous 
          technology of Uganda’s Tribal groupings, traditional dances, traditional 
          foods, chiefdoms. Other information relates to norms and values, cultural 
          beliefs, dress codes, drama, traditional medicine/herbs, child naming 
          and funeral rites. </p>
        <p>For example, in UTV, the information kept ranges over all subjects 
          and is in different formats. They classify the IK into 2 categories: 
          “hard” and “soft” programming. The “hard” 
          includes documentaries, features, talk shows, discussions, and infomercials, 
          while the “soft” is basically entertainment and drama. On 
          the other hand, Radio Uganda keeps information on how traditions, cultures, 
          tribes rate on certain issues concerned with beliefs and health, and 
          with indigenous agricultural methods.</p>
        <h3>Format of Records</h3>
        <p>The majority of the institutions keep information in the form of a 
          catalogue or use other finding aids manually. For example, the majority 
          of Libraries record their holdings in the form of Card catalogues, book 
          catalogues, Accession lists, and bibliographies. In the National Archives, 
          there are a number of finding aids, including catalogues, index cards, 
          accession registers, repository lists, storage lists. Although the majority 
          of institutions had access to on-line services and the Internet, there 
          was little information on IK kept there. Makerere University Library 
          and NLU had access to CD-ROMs, OPAC and the Internet for keeping information 
          about Uganda culture. In Radio Uganda, tapes, compact cassettes or digital 
          audio-tapes are used to record information on IK. In Kasubi Tombs, people 
          who live in the palace orally store and disseminate information. In 
          the Art Gallery, information is kept on index cards, register books, 
          and notice boards. The Art Gallery has a ledger to register what objects 
          have been bought, and records each item using index cards. UTV has 
          a catalogue where all materials in the library are registered, and they 
          use simple numbering and dates to access materials. At Radio Uganda, 
          a catalogue is used as the access point for IK.</p>
        <h3>Attributes of the Records</h3>
        <p>Information recorded about IK varies with institutions. In the majority 
          of the institutions, codes have been used to enable easy access and 
          reference. The Uganda Museum lists the name of the object, date on which 
          it was discovered, its use, the researcher, the place where it was collected, 
          and its condition. Staff at Kasubi Tombs record titles of the kings, 
          wives of the kings, songs. Libraries record authors, title, call numbers. 
          The Art gallery records the origin of the object, when it was made, 
          and its use. The price of some art pieces is also recorded, and the 
          number in stock. Theatres record information on sounds, actors and 
          actresses, rhymes. The information kept in UTV and Radio Uganda includes 
          titles of the songs, duration, producer, number or volume of the tape, 
          number of songs on the tape. </p>
        <p>There is really no one system of recording, documenting and preserving 
          IK, nor is there a mechanism to develop the culture of safeguarding 
          documentary heritage, democratising access and raising awareness of 
          its significance in the achievement of community objectives. </p>
        <h2>Requirements for the Digitisation of IK in Uganda</h2>
        <p>The major aim of this study was to establish the strategies for digitisation 
          of community IK in Uganda.</p>
        <h3>The Need for Digitisation</h3>
        <p>The majority of respondents agreed with a proposition for digitisation 
          although most of them had not computerised their own records and IKs. 
          In libraries, digitisation was envisaged to facilitate retrieval, indexing, 
          and cataloguing of information materials. In UTV, digitisation of information 
          helps locate information since it is kept in files. Some of the institutions 
          have Web sites. For example, Radio Uganda uses the Internet when accessing 
          news and current affairs from other organisations and countries. According 
          to Radio Uganda, digitisation would help to access and co-ordinate information 
          to ease locating and retrieving information. On the other hand, UTV 
          wants to have a networked database of all libraries (audio-Visual or 
          book materials) that keep IK information. According to them, the organisations 
          would build a library management system to facilitate easy access to 
          information on IK. Digitisation would facilitate research, and information 
          would be centred in one place. It was suggested that for proper sharing 
          of information, organisations should put in place Web sites to facilitate 
          the co-ordination and free flow of information. The following strategies 
          were found to be the prerequisites for the digitisation of IK in Uganda.</p>
        <h4>a) Co-ordination</h4>
        <p>According to the study, there is a need for a central co-ordinating 
          body – having one central place where people can look for IK. 
          There was a demonstrable need to co-ordinate IK in record centres, archives 
          and libraries, museum, art galleries, and traditional institutions in 
          Uganda. In fact, Makerere University Library recommended the establishment 
          of a consortium of IK institutions to enable the sharing of textbooks, 
          journals and theses on information about IK. Radio Uganda suggested 
          putting in place an organisation to facilitate access of IK information. 
          Generally, a need for establishing a National Cultural Heritage or IK 
          Centre that should fall under the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Socio 
          Development was expressed.</p>
        <h4>b) Facilities and Resources</h4>
        <p> It was observed that a strategy to obtain funds from government and 
          non-governmental organisations should be devised. Government should 
          be urged to increase its funding commitment to the development and management 
          of cultural and IK information. It was felt crucial that institutions 
          and organisations establish registries and Archival centres with proper 
          access and finding aids. Establishing IK resource centres at different 
          communities with modern information and communication services would 
          facilitate the digitisation of IK. </p>
        <h4>c) Preservation of IK</h4>
        <p>There was an expressed need for promotion and preservation of Ugandan 
          culture. The need for promoting cultural heritage, encouraging living 
          cultures and creativity, and ensuring standards to monitor and to safeguard 
          the documentary heritage was expressed. In fact, the School of Fine 
          Art pledged to establish ethnic galleries at district levels. The materials 
          collected would include photographs and videotape. The legal and ethical, 
          intellectual property rights, and cultural restrictions would be invested 
          in a government policy-making body. UTV suggested a maintenance policy 
          or law protecting IK. </p>
        <h4>d) National IK Secretariat and Committees</h4>
        <p> Uganda Museum recommended the establishment of a secretariat based 
          at the Museum. Buganda Kingdom suggested working committees constituted 
          by cultural institutions, whose role would be co-ordinating IK. This 
          and similar observations support the UNCST’s initiative of an 
          Indigenous Knowledge National Committee. The secretariat should be able 
          to co-ordinate the establishment of a national committee and a community 
          at tribal group and ethnic levels as well as institutional levels. Findings 
          suggest that community and national committees should be able to steer 
          the information gathering process about IK at the community level and 
          the establishment of national policies regarding processing and dissemination 
          of IK. The committees should liaise with the Secretariat in various 
          matters such as establishing information systems for IK, carrying out 
          research, and generating, processing, storing, and disseminating information 
          on IK. Accordingly, findings suggested co-ordination between district 
          offices, local committees and the secretariat. Membership to such committees 
          would include prominent cultural leaders within tribal groupings and 
          institutions. Institutions also proposed that a general assembly and 
          a general meeting work as a medium of discussion and communication among 
          the national and community committees. Village and community committees 
          were proposed to enable data collection at the grass roots. The national 
          committee would be responsible for ensuring communication channels and 
          easy access to transport and storage facilities.</p>
        <h4>e) Marketing and Sensitisation about IK</h4>
        <p>From the study, it became clear that educating and sensitising the 
          public as well as information professionals on the importance of preserving 
          IK is the way to go for the digitisation of IK in Uganda. This requires 
          an intensive marketing campaign and government support. It was suggested 
          that government put in place demonstration centres about the restoration 
          of culture. Accordingly, a need was expressed to integrate IK into the 
          school and university curricula in related disciplines and programmes. 
          The National Council of Sports suggested that indigenous people be trained 
          on how to give information to the public. Likewise, the public should 
          be enabled to access the provisions defined in the Access to Information 
          Bill, 2004. Outreach programmes and public lectures to capture and record 
          oral history and oral tradition should be designed and implemented. 
          Publications about IK and its accessibility in Uganda should be made 
          available to make people aware of their art and culture. Publishing 
          most of the information on IK through magazines and newspapers is crucial.</p>
        <h1>Observations</h1>
        <p>The digitisation of community IK in developing countries is a vital 
          strategy in preserving culture identities, bridging the past and the 
          present, and transferring information required by various users within 
          and between community networks. This requires a strategy to address 
          community values, principles and norms.</p>
        <p>There is no institution responsible for co-ordinating the collection, 
          management, use and proper utilisation of IK, but there is an unco-ordinated 
          mechanism available among the IK institutions to share community IK. 
          The semblance of partnership available lacks guidelines/policy for the 
          proper utilisation and preservation of IK. The Ministry of Gender, Labour 
          and Social Development has attempted setting standards and making guidelines 
          for the preservation of IK. A number of policies to guide IK in Uganda 
          include the Copyrights Act, 1964, the Patents Act (cap 216), the Trademarks 
          Act (cap 217). A number of proposals have been made, including the Copyright 
          and Neighbouring Rights bill, the Trade Mark bill, the Industrial Property 
          bill, and the Traditional Medicine Practice bill (Ikoja-Odongo, 2004:186). 
          In addition, the Ministry for Disaster Preparedness under the Prime 
          Minister’s office is responsible for preparing for such unfortunate 
          events and planning necessary prevention, preparation and recovery arrangements 
          (Ikoja-Odongo, 2002:324). Although the government has proposed legislation 
          on Freedom of Access to Information and a National Information and Communication 
          Policy, none of these guidelines provides a strategy for digitisation 
          of IK in Uganda.</p>
        <p>There is a lack of institutional registers in most institutions and 
          communities. Such registers are necessary to record such information 
          as African traditions, customs and cultures, legal documents governing 
          cultures, institutions, indigenous technology and medicine. No standard 
          scheme is available to define the content, format and attributes of 
          records about IK. In addition, there is a need for a national register 
          of all information concerning various cultures; this is a perquisite 
          to any machinery/policy to monitor its implementation. </p>
        <p>A co-ordinating body with a management structure in place would facilitate 
          the deposition of IK at the centre selected for purposes of preservation. 
          However, availability of facilities and resources, with a marketing 
          and sensitisation strategy, is crucial for such co-ordination.</p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>The digitisation of IK answers two questions: <strong>What is that? 
          </strong>and <strong>Where is that?</strong> This eases reference to 
          the location of and the time trends of the required information. It 
          helps in finding trends in various IK and investigating social, economic, 
          political and cultural relationships as well as relationships between 
          IK record attributes. The digitisation of community IK may be linked 
          to driving a vehicle that requires an engine and wheels (ICTs), the 
          body (Community), passengers (Content), the driver (information Professionals, 
          experts, IK Managers, etc), and driving and traffic policies (standards, 
          ICT policies). Digitisation requires the metadata showing locations 
          for content (e.g. communities, sites, traditions, medicines, and subjects). 
          A policy guideline for the digitisation of IK is a priority. A requirement 
          analysis needs to be done for the overall feasibility of the project 
          in Uganda. </p>
        <h2> Strategies For The Digitisation Of Community IK</h2>
      <ol>
        <li> 
           A secretariat for IK should be established 
            for the administration of IK management and preservation in Uganda. 
            This will be responsible for setting standards, registration of IK, 
            acquisition of funds for projects in IK, and provision of reports 
            on IK on behalf of the Government.</li>
        <li> 
           National and Community or Institutional 
            committees responsible for capturing IK in Uganda should be established 
            to bring together the stakeholders in a particular IK. A national 
            register of all IK should be compiled by the secretariat. This will 
            require a nomination form of what should be included in the Register. 
            UNCST and the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development should 
            take the lead.</li>
        <li> 
           Preservation should be given a priority 
            in IK management. Policy guidelines on the preservation and conservation 
            of IK in Uganda should be drafted and presented by the responsible 
            ministry. . Institutions need to be aware of preservation techniques 
            and approaches. Preventive measure, reformatting or reproduction techniques 
            including photocopying, microfilming, recording, and digitising have 
            to be enhanced</li>
        <li> 
           A bibliographic control that requires 
            all partners to participate needs to be maintained by the National 
            committee. This will require a database of both national, and community 
            or institutional registers that have controlled access to users. Conservators 
            and archivists should come out and join hands with Uganda Library 
            Association to produce a code of ethics which should establish limits 
            on cost of access, form of access and relationship between owners 
            and custodians of the IK. Policies on copyrights, cultural restrictions, 
            and public investment in private IK management need to be clearly 
            stated. Forms of distribution and product identification and control 
            need to be observed in the policy. When digitising, there is a need 
            to put in place technical and usage standards for various functions 
            like scanning or data compressions/reduction.</li>
        <li> 
           The digitisation of community IK needs 
            a marketing and awareness strategy as a priority approach. Promoting 
            the programme to target groups, raising funds, making copies of IK 
            in various formats: micro images, audio tapes, films, videos and digital 
            representations in various languages; is important. Promotional materials 
            need to be developed. Exhibitors and displays of IK, articles in news 
            papers, and the formation of strategic alliances with other partners, 
            including museums, galleries, park sectors, tourism, etc., need to 
            be encouraged. Promotion and publicity for stakeholders, together 
            with education and training for staff and implementers, are prerequisites 
            to the success of the project.</li>
        <li> 
           There is a need for curriculum review 
            and development at all levels of the educational system in Uganda. 
            Schools should introduce simple preservation techniques of IK at various 
            levels. Training institutions in the areas of library and information 
            science should introduce IK curriculum and short courses to cover 
            IK management systems, digitisation of IK, and preservation and conservation 
            of IK. The institutions that keep and store IK should organise sensitisation 
            seminars and workshops to promote its use. </li>
      </ol>
       
        <h1>Recommendations for Developing Countries</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Digitisation of IK suggests not only that 
            the technology is available, but also that it is appropriate for 
            the promotion of IK in Uganda at the moment. There is a need for first 
            developing the culture of preserving IK, together with a thorough 
            awareness campaign and sensitisation programmes for the appropriate 
            adoption and utilisation of IK.</li>
        <li>
           Information requirement analysis is necessary 
            for the creation and integration of new technologies in the management 
            and preservation of IK. A cost benefit analysis for application of 
            digitisation is a priority. Financial models and methodologies need 
            to be developed to specify the baseline conditions and requirements, 
            strategic implementation plan, benefits determination, security and 
            risk analysis. </li>
        <li>
           At the Organisational level, database 
            management systems technologies are essential before the adoption 
            of digitisation; developmental support must be offered by various 
            organisations. </li>
        <li>The Traditional Knowledge and ecological functions must be emphasised 
          to create a functional digital IK in the country.</li>
      </ul>
