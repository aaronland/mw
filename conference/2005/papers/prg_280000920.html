        <h1>Enhancing The Heritage Experience</h1>
        <h2>Namir Anani, Director General, Canadian Heritage Information Network, 
          Department of Canadian Heritage, Canada</h2>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.chin.gc.ca/">http://www.chin.gc.ca</a></p>
      <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
        <p id="abstract">With the emergence of the knowledge society in today&#39;s 
          current environment of information globalization and rapid technological 
          change, enhancing the public&#39;s involvement in knowledge discovery and 
          creation is pivotal to enhancing the heritage experience. The changing 
          face of the virtual society, the developments in information and communication 
          technologies and their use suggest that personalization, convenience, 
          and meaningful interactivity through on-line services would help museums 
          further impassion and engage the public in the coming years. Although 
          the global influence of technologies is transforming our economy and 
          society, technology alone does not create knowledge. Technology can 
          only serve to empower people to develop new knowledge. Our approach 
          must therefore place people at the centre of the process. This keynote 
          presentation discusses several environmental trends in the virtual realm 
          and how they might be leveraged to enhance the overall heritage experience.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Citizens&#39; knowledge and skills are becoming a barometer for measuring 
          the well-being and health of a society. The public&#39;s desire to fully 
          participate in the new knowledge economy is pushing the boundaries of 
          conventional learning and educational services (Scott, 2003). The definition 
          of on-line services is also shifting rapidly towards high-quality, convenient, 
          personalized, and comprehensive interactivity. This is evident in the 
          substantial growth of self-administered services provided by the banking, 
          commerce, communication, and other industries.</p>
        <p>The public is also adopting new mobile (Statistics Canada, 2004a) and 
          fixed technologies at an unprecedented rate. Technologies that enable 
          anytime, anywhere services are becoming essential daily tools. While 
          this rapid evolution of technology and services is changing our most 
          common day-to-day activities, this is occurring at the expense of time, 
          which is becoming a scarce commodity, requiring yet further refinements 
          to services in order to entice public usage.</p>
        <p>The role of individuals in the virtual realm is also changing from 
          that of passive recipient to that of creator and distributor of content 
          (Canadian Heritage Information Network, 2004). Public membership in 
          e-forums for sharing ideas and cultural commentary is also on the rise 
          and is testimony to the changing dimension of civic participation and 
          self-expression in the digital environment. The 2000 General Social 
          Survey conducted by Statistics Canada (2001) found that 30% of Canadian 
          individuals on the Internet make use of on-line chat services, and just 
          over 15% subscribe to a newsgroup or listserv. The on-line public is 
          evermore in search of knowledge that is pertinent to its current environment. 
          Whether it is for vocational or health reasons, formal education or 
          simply personal enjoyment, the relevance of the information plays a 
          major part in its consumption by the public.</p>
        <p>At a primary level, a key task of museums is to transmit knowledge 
          to society. The societal and technological changes highlighted above 
          suggest that nurturing this relationship requires a careful analysis 
          of the services currently offered by museums. As we aim for enhanced 
          on-line participation and public engagement, current developments suggest 
          that personalized, convenient, and interactive on-line services will 
          help museums further impassion and engage the public in the coming years 
          (Canadian Heritage Information Network, 2004).</p>
        <h1>Museums &amp; the Knowledge Society</h1>
        <p>Museums play a vital role in the development and well being of society. 
          According to the International Council Of Museums (2001), they provide 
          acquisition, conservation, communication and exhibition services for 
          the education and enjoyment of society. In so doing, museums connect 
          the public with its heritage, and provide opportunities to better understand 
          and rationalize the world we live in. </p>
        <p>Museums have so far been successful in participating in the virtual 
          realm by creating rich digital content and contextual information using 
          sophisticated displays, thus educating the public about their original 
          collections.</p>
        <p>The new knowledge economy is one driven by human knowledge and intellectual 
          capital, and being shaped in large part by our schools and universities. 
          To participate in the new era, museums have been forging collaborations 
          with educational institutions to provide the public with educational 
          products and tools. This is a thoughtful alliance that partners museums, 
          the custodians of authoritative heritage content, with members of the 
          educational community, who know best the needs of students in the new 
          economy. The view of museum content as authoritative means that museums 
          are well placed to take advantage of this given that trust is an important 
          factor in users&#39; attitudes toward on-line content. According to a recent 
          report by Market &amp; Opinion Research International (MORI) for the 
          Common Information Environment (CIE) group (2005), museums are among 
          the established organizations in which people have a fair amount of 
          trust.</p>
        <p>The challenges to delivering educational products in the virtual realm, 
          however, remain significant. Issues of technological know-how, standards, 
          copyright, and intellectual property are constant preoccupations.</p>
        <p>The emergence of the knowledge society and the knowledge economy signifies 
          a new era requiring a fresh perspective on the way heritage education 
          is provided. The public&#39;s ability to interact, research, share, and 
          discuss information has changed dramatically in the last two decades. 
          The public consumption and exchange of information using non-formal 
          educational settings is also greatly altering the equation of knowledge 
          acquisition and creation in society. The public is increasingly relying 
          on non-formal settings to complement its learning objectives. Its use 
          of e-forums, e-tutorials, and interactive, personalized learning environments 
          to share and rapidly acquire relevant information that meets its needs 
          is becoming ever more popular.</p>
        <p>Knowledge is a product of discovery built mainly upon a reasoned assimilation 
          of information complemented by interpretation, dialogue, debate, and 
          rationalization. The ability of heritage institutions to create on-line 
          environments in which the public can interact with museums and others 
          will therefore go a long way to advancing heritage knowledge.</p>
        <p>To this end, CHIN has been working with Industry Canada&#39;s Communications 
          Research Center and the National Research Council examining ways in 
          which next generation video-conferencing (i.e., broadband, real-time, 
          multi-point) can facilitate public (in this case, classroom) interaction 
          with museum experts.  This work is on-going and additional research 
          into best practices for providing direct access to museum experts will 
          be pursued in the coming year through a partnership with the Online 
          Computer Library Center (OCLC).</p>
        <h1>Trends &amp; Drivers</h1>
        <h2>Technology Adoption</h2>
        <p>The public use of new communication technologies, especially mobile, 
          is increasing quickly. Digital literacy is becoming a widely accepted 
          demographic measure in many countries. In Canada, it is estimated that 
          71% of the public has access to the Internet, and this number is growing 
          at an unparalleled rate. A combination of the fall in price of broadband 
          connections, coupled with the high rate of adoption of new communication 
          technologies, including data, voice and video streaming, are creating 
          unprecedented opportunities for memory institutions to develop and offer 
          knowledge services.</p>
        <p>The use of technologies that enable on-line services is also on the 
          rise. Tools offering data, voice, and video communication are becoming 
          must-haves for business, and increasingly for the public at large. But 
          learning new technologies comes at a cost of time and effort, and as 
          such, the main driver behind the public&#39;s adoption of technology is 
          not likely the simple facilitation of daily activity. Considering the 
          trends, it is more likely that the drivers behind the rapid adoption 
          of technology are things such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           the flexibility and convenience to conduct 
            business outside normal working hours;</li>
        <li> 
           the ability to research and acquire knowledge 
            outside formal educational settings;</li>
        <li>the capacity to reach and communicate with larger audiences, bridging 
          geographical and cultural boundaries and time zones; and,</li>
        <li> 
           the abilty to create content, share data, 
            and express oneself in a virtual society that knows few social boundaries.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>Another important driver for technology adoption in the knowledge economy 
          is the keep-up factor. As technology evolves offering new opportunities 
          for us to reach for, research and learn, so does the desire to adopt 
          new ways of maintaining relevance in a society that is redefining itself 
          on a daily basis. </p>
        <h2>On-line Services</h2>
        <p>That the use of flexible and convenient on-line services is becoming 
          more prevalent is evident in the substantial growth of on-line, self-serve 
          options provided by the banking, government, commerce, music, communication, 
          and other industries. Additionally, on-line services encompassing search 
          engines, chat functions, instant messaging, call center integration, 
          and personalization utilities, are becoming more widespread and finding 
          growing uses in both B2B and B2C industries. The main features governing 
          such services are convenience, interactivity and personalization responding 
          to specific needs.</p>
        <p>It is no wonder that a recent finding by the Pew Internet &amp; American 
          Life Project (2004) indicates that using search engines ranks as one 
          of the most popular on-line activities. The same is true in Canada: searching 
          is the third most popular use of the Internet after email and browsing 
          (Statistics Canada, 2004b). Additionally, it was highlighted that the 
          search engine feature ranked highest by the American public was the 
          ability to return results tailored to specific search needs, in comparison 
          to other features such as speed and privacy. This is a good indication 
          of the public preference for tools and services that respond to specific 
          rather than generic needs.</p>
        <p>The public&#39;s expectations of service providers in the virtual realm 
          are changing radically. Where the public at one time more or less accepted 
          whatever on-line services were available, it is now demanding personalized 
          services to meet individual needs. The popularity of personalization 
          is seeing successes in many industries and stems from the fact that 
          the public finds it more convenient to maintain control of its interaction 
          with the service provider.</p>
        <p>Other key features of these on-line services are the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           customization, including the client&#39;s 
            ability to change the way services are viewed from a Web browser and 
            what level of interaction with the service is permitted;</li>
        <li> 
           client relationship management that provides 
            additional, optional services to complement the basic services offered;</li>
        <li>two-way interactivity and immediate on-line assistance with client 
          queries; and,</li>
        <li>intelligent technology that continuously learns about individual habits 
          and preferences and continually repurposes services to meet the changing 
          needs of the public.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>This movement toward services on-demand is a reflection of the virtual 
          society and its preferred interactions with various businesses. More 
          than ever before, on-line consumers are dictating when, where, and how 
          they will interact with a service offering. In the process, clear trends 
          are emerging showing that personalization and convenience will increase 
          customer loyalty and help ensure sustainable public engagement.</p>
        <h2>Public Participation On-line</h2>
        <p>The public&#39;s role on-line is changing from that of passive recipient 
          to that of creator and distributor of content. Studies indicate that 
          a large majority of Web users have been creating, in the form of personal 
          or family Web sites and diaries, their own material for publication 
          on the Internet, in this way contributing to the growing amount of available 
          on-line content. This is also supported by the recent popularity of &#34;blogs,&#34; 
          which have developed into a means of content creation, sharing and cultural 
          expression. This new trend, although not yet widely adopted by a high 
          percentage of Internet users, is another indication of the changing 
          dimension of civic participation and self-expression in the digital 
          environment.</p>
        <p>The on-line public searching for and participating in knowledge and 
          learning opportunities is very diversified. However, several studies 
          suggest that on-line knowledge seekers typically fall into the following 
          four categories based on their knowledge needs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lifelong learners search for answers to specific questions for the 
          purposes of general knowledge and enrichment.</li>
        <li>Discovery learners search not necessarily for answers to specific 
          questions, but for the purposes of general knowledge and enjoyment.</li>
        <li> 
           Formal learners access formal learning 
            settings and create knowledge for formal educational purposes.</li>
        <li> 
           Professional learners access information 
            to create knowledge pertinent to their careers and working environments 
            (in the heritage domain, this translates to researchers, curators, 
            historians, others).</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>This is also supported by CHIN-commissioned research (Orange Kiwi, 
          2003) and user feedback analysis that found that the on-line behaviour 
          of visitors to the Virtual Museum of Canada (VMC) is driven by specific 
          needs, from students completing homework assignments to professionals 
          researching health issues like diabetes or osteoporosis (Statistics 
          Canada, 2004b). Additionally, that there is a large representation of 
          visitors from educational institutions signifies an opportunity going 
          forward for better meeting the needs of formal learners.</p>
        <p>In the redesign of the VMC, which is underway, CHIN&#39;s Portals Management 
          and Design team is examining the creation of &#34;interest-based&#34; 
          views thereby allowing visitors to input relevant information about 
          their needs to personalize the VMC interface to suit their specific 
          needs, which could, and likely would, change from visit to visit.</p>
        <h2>On-line Learning </h2>
        <p>The speed with which information and communication technologies are 
          growing, combined with the changing needs of the on-line public, is creating 
          numerous opportunities for developing new standards of quality in educational 
          services.</p>
        <p>As mentioned, personalization and convenience are becoming prerequisites 
          to the public&#39;s interaction with on-line services. Accordingly, personalized 
          learning is becoming a widely accepted educational model of the future. 
          The main advantage of this model is its support for learning that is 
          unrestricted by time, place or other barriers, and tailored to learners&#39; 
          continuously changing requirements.</p>
        <p>The emergence of the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) model is clearly 
          offering viable solutions to personalized learning. The foundation of 
          these VLEs is being built on the strengths of individual Learning Objects 
          (LOs) that can be coupled and decoupled in a variety of ways to enable 
          knowledge creation. Although much has been published on the subject 
          of LOs, issues of standards and common definitions, technological know-how, 
          and funding models, for example, are currently a subject of much debate. 
          It is evident that to successfully enable the VLE model, many catalysts 
          need to be in place. These are, to name a few,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>harmonized and widely accepted standards;</li>
        <li>closer collaboration between museums (the owners of digital content) 
          and the educational community knowledgeable in the creation of course 
          content;</li>
        <li>economically sound business models to enable and sustain the development 
          of LOs, as funding is a major preoccupation;</li>
        <li>procedures for authenticating and preserving LOs; and,</li>
        <li>a life cycle management process for configuring and continually updating 
          LOs.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>It remains to be seen, however, whether LOs will be a transitional 
          answer or the end solution to building learning environments. Perhaps 
          future advancements in cognitive search tools and search engines will 
          provide another avenue for assembling knowledge objects directly from 
          raw data.</p>
        <h1>From Content to Services</h1>
        <p>Current changes in personalized learning and knowledge creation in 
          the virtual realm call for a careful analysis of the needs and supporting 
          tools necessary to further engage the public in heritage knowledge and 
          fulfill this demand at a much larger, holistic scale than ever before. 
          To date the museums&#39; offering on the World Wide Web can be summarize 
          in three progressive stages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           first generation of content on the Web 
            that involved posting of electronic versions of paper literature, 
            through which limited personalization or interaction with either content 
            or human expertise was possible. These documents were largely produced 
            for teachers by museum education specialists. An excellent example 
            of a first-generation virtual complementary visit is the pre-visit 
            manual prepared by Fort William Historical Park (2004);</li>
        <li>the second generation involved a more engaging multimedia content 
          (voice, video and data) that immersed the audience in the intended environment;</li>
        <li>the third generation offered anew, more sophisticated level of interactivity 
          and personalization, by allowing the user to create personalized spaces 
          and restructure or add content, in addition to interactivity that allows 
          the user to navigate and explore the content based on preferences.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>In order to further advance the knowledge discovery it is important 
          that elements of dialogue, debate and rationalization are introduced 
          in the process. This would require a shift from interactivity with content 
          to offering on-line services supported by human interactions (citizens 
          to citizens, and citizens with the museums). Services that would build 
          engaging relationships between the public and the museums and further 
          increase public interest in the institution&#39;s original objects, such 
          services may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           pre-visit experiences that would include 
            e-tutorials moderated by expert knowledge (museum professionals), 
            and that provide interactive simulations and presentations to increase 
            public interest in and preparation for knowledge discovery surrounding 
            a particular exhibit or museum. In a 2001 survey, conducted by the 
            IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, of visitors to a multi-institutional 
            art and culture Web site, respondents identified the pre-visit experience 
            as the second most important aspect of their visit. The pre-visit 
            was identified by 35% of on-line visitors as being the most important 
            aspect of their visit, second only to accessing museum content, which 
            46% of visitors identified as the single most important aspect of 
            their visit (Vergo et al., 2001);</li>
        <li>
           post-visit experiences that would include 
            on-line discussion forums to provide opportunities for the exchange 
            and interpretation of knowledge acquired at an exhibit or museum (citizens 
            to citizens, and citizens with heritage professionals), and that further 
            engage the public in other heritage content or institutions;</li>
        <li>
           virtual learning environments for sharing 
            research and engaging teachers and students in further advancing heritage 
            knowledge; and,</li>
        <li>interactive e-workshops for professionals and the public.</li>
      </ul>
      
        <p>To participate successfully in the provision of on-line services, the 
          latter needs to be efficient, effective, and just in time. They must 
          provide the public with flexible and context-sensitive access anytime 
          and anywhere to interactive expert knowledge, learning materials and 
          other services. This must also be done in a personalized way that meets 
          individuals&#39; specific needs and interests.</p>
        <p>If implemented properly, on-line services can provide the public at 
          large with a dynamic, engaging environment, and raise individuals&#39; desire 
          to return to the original collections and experience the heritage objects 
          face to face. Additionally, as people interact with such services, their 
          feedback, combined with on-line tracking and metrics, will allow museums 
          to better respond to the evolving needs of the public and make better 
          use of the virtual medium to provide experiences not possible in the 
          physical world.</p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>We are clearly embarking on a new era of knowledge creation and attainment 
          that favours personalized learning, convenience, and meaningful interactivity 
          that enables dialogue, debate, and rationalization. This requires a 
          shift from interactivity with content to offering on-line services supported 
          by human interactions (citizens with citizens, and citizens with museum 
          professionals).</p>
        <p>The rapid evolution of enabling technologies, coupled with the fast 
          rate of adoption by the public, is creating new avenues for heritage 
          knowledge advancement and public engagement. Although the global influence 
          of these technologies is transforming our economy and society, technology 
          does not create knowledge. Technology can only serve to empower people 
          to develop new knowledge based on their needs and preferences. Our approach 
          must therefore place people at the centre of the process.</p>
        <p>A closer look at the conventional services offered by museums and how 
          they can be presented to and accessed differently by the public will 
          help further amplify their role in the knowledge society. This will 
          entail a holistic undertaking that may involve pre-visit experiences 
          that would lead to the original objects, complemented by post-visit 
          on-line experiences, contributing to sustainable heritage discovery. 
        </p>
        <p>Museums have a noble role in society to promote cultural expression 
          and heritage knowledge, as these are essential ingredients to increasing 
          interactions between people, having them commit to each other in building 
          healthy communities, and weaving a stronger social fabric. The ability 
          for museums to rapidly embrace current trends and amplify their role 
          in the emerging knowledge and services on-demand society is crucial 
          in meeting their mandate to provide society with a mirror of its creativity, 
          past and present, and through that mirror, an opportunity to imagine 
          and shape the future.</p>
