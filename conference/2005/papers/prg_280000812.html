        <h1>Providing Deaf and Hard-Of-Hearing Visitors With On-Demand, Independent 
          Access To Museum Information and Interpretation Through Handheld Computers</h1>
        <h2>Nancy Proctor, Antenna Audio (London), UK</h2>
        <h3 id="abstract">Abstract </h3>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">This paper discusses the use of 
          handheld computers or PDAs to provide accessible interpretation for 
          deaf and hard-of-hearing visitors to museums and visitor attractions. 
          It describes the differing needs of and attitudes towards deafness and 
          hearing loss among this diverse population, and outlines best practice 
          guidelines for producing access tours for deaf and hard-of-hearing audiences. 
          These guidelines are based on visitor feedback and evaluations of digital 
          Sign Language and Subtitled Guides at three museums in the US and UK 
          in 2003 and 2004: the British Sign Language Multimedia Tour at Tate 
          Modern in London, the American Sign Language Guide at The Great Blacks 
          in Wax Museum in Baltimore and a Subtitled Guide at the International 
          Spy Museum in Washington, D.C. </p>
        <p id="keywords">Keywords: Access, deaf, deafened, hard-of-hearing, sign

          wireless</p>
        <h1>New Technologies for Access</h1>
        <p>For many deaf and hard-of-hearing visitors, new handheld technologies 
          offer the first chance to tour cultural attractions in complete independence, 
          receiving interpretation about the exhibits on demand and in a visual 
          format – video or text – on a handheld computer or PDA. 
          Thanks to the mobile screen-based platform, a number of solutions are 
          now possible for providing access to audiences of varying needs based 
          on the following digital guide concepts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
           Sign Language Guides provide Deaf visitors with subtitled video footage of 
            signed interpretation; </li>
        <li> 
           Subtitled Guides add an extra layer of communication to audio-visual tours 
            for visitors who are hard-of-hearing or deaf visitors who do not sign; 
            and</li>
        <li> Audio+™ Text Tours make audio tour scripts and other textual 
          information available in a full-screen, scrollable, large print format 
          along with the audio guide.</li>
      </ol>
       
        <p class="caption" style="
text-autospace:none"><img src="proctor.fig1.jpg" width="400" height="274" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Deaf visitors to Tate Modern"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 1 :  Deaf visitors to Tate Modern use the British 
          Sign Language Multimedia Guide.</p>
        <p>Text and signed content is locally-stored on the handheld device or 
          accessed through a wireless network that connects to a central server. 
          In a wireless network, practically limitless information and content 
          with real-time interactivity can be delivered to visitors in the gallery, 
          including video and still images that provide additional context for 
          the exhibits and other interactive features. Often the same handheld 
          computers, wireless infrastructure, and even content deployed for multimedia 
          and audio tours can be re-utilized in Sign Language, Subtitled Guides 
          and Audio+™ Text Tours. Conversely, text and signed content produced 
          for handheld tours can be repurposed for use online and in multimedia 
          kiosks, CD-ROMs and DVDs. </p>
        <h2>Diverse Audiences</h2>
        <p>Deaf and hard-of-hearing audiences are far from homogeneous, and no 
          single solution will satisfy every special need; there are, however, 
          areas of overlap among these disparate audiences that offer strategic 
          opportunities to broaden access, and not just to deaf and hard-of-hearing 
          visitors. Good access benefits all visitors.</p>
        <h3>Who is Deaf?</h3>
        <p>The Deaf community is a cultural and linguistic minority, which includes 
          people who were born deaf, were deafened before beginning to speak, 
          or who may have deaf parents and whose first language is one of the 
          world&#39;s many sign languages. People who identify themselves in this 
          way do not consider themselves to be disabled, but as members of a specific 
          community, describing themselves as Deaf with a capital D.</p>
        <p>The use of museums, libraries and archives has often figured low in 
          the cultural experiences of those whose first language is sign language, 
          as written text represents a second or &#39;foreign&#39; language and is therefore 
          a less accessible or direct route to information. Often there is very 
          little provision of information and interpretation in sign language 
          at museums, and deaf visitors requiring sign language interpretation 
          are usually required to book in advance or attend talks as a group. 
        </p>
        <h3>Who Is Hard Of Hearing?</h3>
        <p>Varying degrees of hearing loss and various communication means and 
          skills make it difficult to define a uniform public that is hard-of-hearing. 
          Some people can hear audio played at a high volume. Users of digital 
          hearing aids may find that a t-coil makes standard audio tours accessible, 
          or that subtitled audio content is the most accessible form of interpretation. 
          Still others are deaf but communicate through text, lip reading and 
          speaking instead of sign language. Many people with hearing loss also 
          have other sensory impairments, such as tunnel vision, or mobility difficulties 
          as a result of aging, which can impact their ability to use digital 
          guides and other interpretation facilities.</p>
        <p>There is an equal diversity of both cultural and personal attitudes 
          towards hearing loss; some people may aim to integrate with the hearing 
          population as much as possible, while others tend to identify with distinct 
          communities of people with similar needs. Regardless, with 20 to 26 
          million people who are hard of hearing in the US alone, there is huge 
          demand for cultural and visitor attractions to communicate effectively 
          with this population. Cultural tourists who are hard of hearing have 
          generally been offered audio tour scripts and other printed matter as 
          the primary source of interpretation on site. While this may be adequate 
          for some, it tends to impose a choice between the audio tour and the 
          script on those visitors who would simply like an audio tour with subtitles 
          in a convenient, portable format. Other hard-of-hearing visitors don&#39;t 
          like to carry a script when the majority of visitors are using a digital 
          guide; they would prefer a solution that allows them to tour alongside 
          and interact with their hearing companions more easily. </p>
        <h1>New Solutions</h1>
        <h2>Sign Language Guides</h2>
        <p>In many communities here is a high take-up of new technologies by deaf 
          people; here there can be quicker acceptance of the handheld computer 
          platform amongst the deaf population than others. In addition, the Sign 
          Language Guide is a particularly good way to provide access for deaf 
          children: most children learn to sign long before they learn to read, 
          so a Sign Language Guide is ideal for reaching deaf children under six, 
          even when they can&#39;t yet read the subtitles and other text.</p>
        <p>Crucially, the Sign Language Guide is not a simple translation of a 
          tour into a sign language. Unlike more traditional signed interpretations 
          of television broadcasts or presentations, the Sign Language Guide must 
          not only communicate information about the displays, it must also help 
          engage deaf visitors with the exhibits – teaching, entertaining 
          and inspiring them. The deaf visitor, like any visitor, has after all 
          come to the museum or gallery to see its collections and exhibitions, 
          not to watch signed television on a very small screen! Interpretation 
          on the PDA is therefore interpretation in both senses: it communicates 
          in the Deaf visitor&#39;s preferred language, but it also goes beyond simple 
          facts and information to <em>interpret</em> the objects on display, 
          drawing the visitor into a three-way dialogue among the exhibit, the 
          tour message about the exhibit, and his or her personal reaction to 
          both. </p>
        <p>The &#39;voice&#39; of the interpreter is key to this conversation among exhibit, 
          interpretation and the visitor. Although the Sign Language Guide must 
          remain faithful to the museum&#39;s message and approved script, it also 
          needs to read as the <em>interpreter&#39;s</em> commentary in order to communicate 
          fluently and effectively to a Deaf audience and not feel like a stilted 
          translation. The interpreter literally embodies the tour&#39;s message and 
          strongly impacts the tour experience. It is therefore imperative to 
          choose the sign language interpreter(s) carefully, looking for an ideal 
          match between the interpreter&#39;s skills and interests and the message 
          of the museum or gallery producing the tour. </p>
        <p>The negotiation of these three elements – the exhibit, the interpretation, 
          and the visitor – requires careful structuring of content in the 
          Sign Language Guide. Generally speaking, the Sign Language Guide should 
          never stand on its own: it should always bring the visitor back to the 
          exhibit, never being complete without that direct experience of the 
          object(s) in the space. This aim governs the ordering of information 
          in the tour, including the interspersing of signed interpretation with 
          other multimedia content and interactive elements. Just as importantly 
          it informs the inclusion of pauses in the tour content and moments in 
          which the visitor interacts with the displays. To the extent it is possible, 
          the pacing of the signed tour should be roughly equivalent to that of 
          a spoken tour. As with any tour, the visitor requires time to look and 
          think, and the ability to pause, rewind, replay and fast forward content 
          in order to remain in control over his or her experience. An effective 
          Sign Language Guide, taking all of these points into account, is a multi-faceted 
          tool that will help each deaf visitor find a unique way of engaging 
          with the museum or gallery.</p>
        <p>Because of the prevalence of sign language dialects, some deaf visitors 
          cannot rely on signing alone, even when using their national sign language: 
          for example, the British Sign Language sign for &#39;Saturday&#39; differs between 
          London and neighboring Essex, so even understanding opening dates can 
          be a challenge! Subtitles for the signed content overcome these regional 
          differences and reinforce deaf visitors&#39; understanding of words, phrases 
          or ideas that may be unfamiliar by showing the text for a sign at the 
          same time as that sign is made in the video footage on the PDA. Subtitling 
          is also useful to show visitors the correct spelling of someone&#39;s name, 
          or underscore a key date or other figure where these items may be finger-spelled 
          by the interpreter in the video footage and therefore be harder to catch 
          on the PDA&#39;s small screen. Subtitled signs can be referenced in a sign 
          language glossary as part of the tour to provide additional support 
          to the visitors&#39; grasp of the language and information in the tour. 
          By seeing subtitles with signs for art and other specialist terms with 
          which they may not be familiar, visitors both learn about the objects 
          on display, and also learn the signs and words necessary to enable them 
          to participate more fully and delve more deeply in these topics. Thus 
          Sign Language Guides increase access not only to the museum, but also 
          to the fields of study addressed in the museum.</p>
        <h2>Subtitled Guides</h2>
        <p>For those who don&#39;t use sign language, Subtitled Guides can be an indispensable 
          part of the museum visit, providing subtitled audio-visual content to 
          visitors with a range of abilities. In the past, visitors with hearing 
          difficulties who prefer text have often used printed copies of the audio 
          tour script or other written materials as their primary interpretation 
          in the museum. But scripts can be awkward to carry and read in dark 
          galleries, and the hard-of-hearing visitor can feel cut off from the 
          audio-visual tour experience that their hearing companions are enjoying. 
        </p>
        <p>Now, using a screen-based device, visitors with some hearing can listen 
          to the audio content while reading subtitles where necessary to aid 
          in comprehension. Others with greater hearing loss may rely more on 
          subtitles for understanding the audio content. In both cases, visitors 
          enjoy a small, portable, back-lit device that can include interactive 
          multimedia features and activities. The Subtitled Guide allows hard-of-hearing 
          visitors to enjoy the same kind of tour experience as their hearing 
          companions, promoting social interaction among visitors of all abilities. 
        </p>
        <p>As with the Sign Language Guide, there is more to making a successful 
          Subtitled Guide than simply adding scrolling script to the audio content. 
          A program developed for subtitling must take into account the reading 
          speeds of visitors in order to ensure that the audio and text can be 
          synchronized. Large print text is preferable to make the subtitles accessible 
          to those with low vision, and other visibility standards such as high 
          contrast and resolution should be employed. It may also be desirable 
          to include facilities in the interface to toggle the subtitles on and 
          off. These considerations impact interface design, the size of the content 
          window and therefore the overall look and feel of the subtitled guide. 
          Indeed all visual elements of the program should be designed with an 
          awareness of how they will work with the subtitles. </p>
        <p>Audio design can also be different in a Subtitled Guide: it may be 
          preferable to record audio content using certain voices, chosen for 
          their clarity to those with hearing loss. A simple narration may be 
          best, eliminating background music and other audio elements that may 
          make the narration less intelligible.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Subtitled Guides enjoy a high degree of economy of scale 
          in terms of sharing content with the audio-visual program, so do not 
          necessarily require significant investment beyond the original audio-visual 
          tour. In fact, the museum may prefer to subtitle all its audio-visual 
          programs, since subtitles can be helpful to all visitors regardless 
          of their ability. </p>
        <h2>Audio+™ Text Tours</h2>
        <p>Audio+™ Text Tours are an easy way to make audio tours accessible 
          to hard-of-hearing visitors. In contrast to Subtitled Audio-Visual Guides, 
          there is no visual content in an Audio+™ Text Tour other than 
          text. For this reason, the entire screen can be given over to the audio 
          script, allowing visitors to read while listening to the audio tour, 
          or use either the audio or the text exclusively. </p>
        <p>A flexible interface is best with an Audio+™ Text Tour: while 
          an automatic function scrolls the script slowly up the screen in synch 
          with the audio content, a manual function also allows the visitor to 
          page at will through the text of each commentary. Volume controls for 
          the audio content also allow the audio to be muted should visitors choose 
          only to read the tour. Those who prefer not to consult the text can 
          simply wear the PDA as an audio player, ignoring the screen. </p>
        <p>Like Subtitled Guides, Audio+™ Text Tours are efficient to produce 
          and can serve both hearing and hard-of-hearing audiences equally well. 
          They also afford opportunities for future expansion of the audio tour 
          program to include additional text and audio-visual content. </p>
        <h1>Best Practice in Access Guide Design for Deaf and Hard-of-hearing 
          Visitors</h1>
        <p>In 2003 and 2004, Antenna Audio produced digital guides for deaf and 
          hard-of-hearing visitors to three museums in the US and the UK:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
           Tate Modern&#39;s British Sign Language Multimedia Guide in London, England</li>
        <li> 
           The &#39;Voices of History&#39; American Sign Language Tour of the Great Blacks in 
            Wax Museum, Baltimore, Maryland</li>
        <li> 
           The Subtitled Guide to &#39;The Enemy Within: Terrorism in America 1776 to Today&#39; 
            exhibition at the International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C.</li>
      </ol>
       
        <p>A summary of each project and of its evaluation by visitors can be 
          found in the appendices to this paper. </p>
        <p>Subsequent to each project&#39;s individual review, these three access 
          tours were evaluated together by a several different groups at various 
          events in the US and UK in 2004, to help us understand where each program&#39;s 
          strengths and weaknesses lay for a range of audiences:</p>

        <p>From this wide range of users, we have been able to derive the following 
          &#39;best practice&#39; guide for designing access tours for Deaf and hard-of-hearing 
          visitors.</p>
        <h2>Access Guides For Deaf And Hard-Of-Hearing Visitors</h2>
        <p>For visitors who have some hearing, there is a number of access options 
          based on the standard audio tour model:</p>
		  <ol>
          <li> Audio tours with:
            <br/>
            a.Volume control <br/>
        b.Clear, easy-to-understand narration without background 
         music or sound effects <br/>
        c.T-coils to work with digital hearing aids</li>
          <li> Hardcopy text guides, including:<br/>a.Audio tour scripts (regular and large print)<br/>
         b.Catalogue and label text booklets</li>
 
          <li>Subtitled Guides for audio-visual tours </li>
          <li> Audio+™ Text Tours for audio-only tours</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For deaf visitors, the following digital tour solutions are available:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> Hardcopy text guides, including: <br/>
            <p> a.Audio tour scripts (regular and large print)<br/> 
            b.Catalogue and label text booklets</p>
          </li>
          <li> Subtitled Guides for audio-visual tours</li>
          <li> Sign Language Guides including subtitles</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In all cases, the availability of access tours should be well publicized 
          with signage and publicity materials that include standard accessibility 
          symbols.</p>
        <h3>Best Practice: Sign Language Guides</h3>
        <p>Sign Language Guides provide signed commentary for the tour, and are 
          designed primarily for sign language users. The following issues should 
          be taken into account when designing a Sign Language Guide: </p>
        <h4>Tour content</h4>
      <ol>
        <li> 
           Choose appropriate, high quality signers: whether 
            a native sign language speaker, or a respected authority, the right 
            narrator is key to the success of the Sign Language Guide</li>
        <li> 
           Tell a great story: the narrator creates atmosphere, effect 
            and drama for your message</li>
        <li>Subtitle signed content to reinforce understanding</li>
        <li> 
           Use large text for visitors with low vision</li>
        <li> 
           Set both signers and text against high contrast backgrounds 
            for better visibility</li>
        <li>Include a sign language glossary of new or unfamiliar terms where 
          possible</li>
      </ol>
       
        <h4>Operations</h4>
      <ol>
        <li> 
           Provide the handheld device on a neck strap, so visitors can more easily sign 
            to others while taking the tour</li>
        <li> 
           Provide deaf awareness training for distribution staff</li>
        <li> 
           If no distribution staff know sign language, consider playing a signed video 
            at the distribution desk to instruct deaf visitors in the use of the 
            tour</li>
      </ol>
       
        <h3>Best Practice: Subtitled Guides</h3>
        <p>Subtitled Guides make audio content accessible in an audio-visual guide 
          without using signed commentary. Subtitled Guides can be used by either 
          deaf or hard-of-hearing visitors. When subtitling an audio-visual guide, 
          take the following points into consideration:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use large text for visitors with low vision</li>
        <li> 
           Set text against a high contrast background for better visibility</li>
        <li> 
           Carefully match reading and listening speeds so that text and 
            audio content remain synchronized</li>
        <li> 
           Include the audio content with volume control so those with some 
            hearing can follow the audio and the subtitles simultaneously, or 
            can mute the volume if desired</li>
        <li>Use clear, easy-to-understand narration, and consider removing background 
          music and sound effects to avoid obscuring the narrator&#39;s voice </li>
        <li> 
           Provide t-coils for visitors with digital hearing aids</li>
        <li> 
           Publicize<strong> </strong>the availability of access tours with 
            signage and publicity materials that include standard accessibility 
            symbols</li>
        <li> 
           Consider playing a signed video at the distribution desk to instruct 
            deaf visitors in the use of the tour</li>
      </ol>
       
        <h3>Best Practice: Audio+™ Text Tours</h3>
        <p>Audio+™ Text Tours make audio tour scripts and other textual 
          information available in a full-screen, scrollable, large print format 
          along with the audio content. Audio+™ Text Tours can be used by 
          either deaf or hard-of-hearing visitors. The following production issues 
          should be taken into account when creating an Audio+™ Text Tour: 
        </p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
           Use large text for visitors with low vision</li>
        <li> 
           Set text against a high contrast background for 
            better visibility</li>
        <li> 
           If automatic scrolling of each text screen is provided, be sure 
            to match reading and listening speeds so that text and audio content 
            remain synchronized</li>
        <li> 
           Consider including a manual override so that visitors can scroll 
            through the tour text at will, regardless of where the audio is</li>
        <li> 
           Include the audio content with volume control so those with some 
            hearing can follow the audio and the subtitles simultaneously, or 
            can mute the volume if desired</li>
        <li>Use clear, easy-to-understand narration, and consider removing background 
          music and sound effects to avoid obscuring the narrator&#39;s voice</li>
        <li>Provide t-coils for visitors with digital hearing aids</li>
        <li> 
           Publicize the availability of access tours with signage and publicity 
            materials that include standard accessibility symbols</li>
        <li> 
           Consider playing a signed video at the distribution desk to instruct 
            deaf visitors in the use of the tour</li>
      </ol>
       
        <h2>Repurposing Resources For The Access Guide</h2>
        <p>The production of any digital tour usually requires the commitment 
          of precious resources and funds on the part of the museum, gallery or 
          visitor attraction, so it is essential to obtain as many uses out of 
          any new and existing assets as possible. The technical infrastructure 
          of an existing wireless network or multimedia tour system offers the 
          most direct opportunities to get multiple uses out of the same investment. 
          At Tate Modern the wireless network in the galleries serves any of three 
          tours to the same stock of PDAs, and can also be used by Tate staff 
          for back-office and administrative purposes.</p>
        <p>In many cases, multimedia and interactive resources can also be repurposed 
          from the museum&#39;s other tours and digital publications to help create 
          the Sign Language or Subtitled Guide. Conversely, the signed video footage 
          and subtitles can be added to a museum&#39;s website, on-site information 
          kiosks or digital catalogues to expand access to these publications. 
          And this is not just an economic consideration: at Tate Modern the interactive 
          games and instant messaging facilities shared by the BSL and multimedia 
          highlights tours serve to bring deaf and hearing audiences together 
          in the galleries, emphasizing common interests and experiences rather 
          than segregating visitors on the basis of ability. Links to Tate Modern&#39;s 
          website, included in emailed &#39;bookmarks&#39; of information that visitors 
          send themselves from the tour, also build the visitor&#39;s relationship 
          with the museum and help extend it into the school or home.</p>
        <p>As is the case in any project to repurpose content across platforms 
          and audiences, assets are far more likely to be reusable in the future 
          if they are created with the goal of repurposing in mind from the outset. 
          The audiences and publication platforms that the repurposed assets will 
          be aimed at should be established early on in the content production 
          process. This will help the script writers and designers consider how 
          best to craft a multimedia message for maximum reuse, and will also 
          flag any copyright problems or additional expenses that could arise 
          when a given asset is published in a new way.</p>
        <p>At the Great Blacks in Wax Museum, the script of the Voices of History<em> 
          </em>audio tour was used as the basis for the American Sign Language 
          tour script, while Tate Modern&#39;s British Sign Language Multimedia Tour 
          is an adaptation of the Multimedia Highlights Tour. Perhaps contrary 
          to expectations, however, it is not enough simply to translate the English 
          script into a sign language in order to produce an accessible tour. 
          Information is structured differently for oral delivery than for reading. 
          Similarly, an idea may need to be structured or phrased in a particular 
          way in order to be communicated optimally to a sign language user. In 
          addition, as with any translation, there can be profound cultural differences 
          in how an idea is understood or received by Deaf people in comparison 
          to its common usage in the original language. These and the different 
          amounts of time required to convey a given bit of information in sign 
          language in comparison to the original written or spoken language must 
          be taken into account when structuring the sign language script. An 
          expert signer can help with the translation and provide an approved 
          sign language script to the signer who is actually videoed for the tour.</p>
        <p>In particular, the temporal difference between a signed and a spoken 
          statement can be marked. Although each of the world&#39;s official sign 
          languages and sign language dialects is unique, they generally differ 
          from written and spoken languages in their three-dimensional and often 
          a-linear nature. Meaning is not created in British Sign Language, as 
          in English, for example, by the linear sequencing of ideas in time or 
          space of the spoken or written statement. Instead, ideas can be elaborated 
          and placed in the three-dimensional space that exists in front of and 
          around the signer. They can be touched upon, literally, and combined 
          in a semiotic structure that is articulated in the physical areas between 
          and among interlocutors. The difference in length and structure between 
          sign language and written languages also means that in order to guarantee 
          logical synchronization, the Sign Language Guide&#39;s subtitles are generally 
          a translation from the sign language, rather than a simple reuse of 
          the original text script. </p>
        <p>Nor are the world&#39;s many sign languages universally intelligible to 
          all sign language users. French Sign Language is as distinct from German 
          Sign Language as spoken and written French is from German. American 
          Sign Language has more in common with French Sign Language than with 
          British Sign Language. It is therefore necessary to build a distinct 
          tour for each sign language audience addressed in any given museum, 
          just as catalogues, audio tours and wall texts are provided in a variety 
          of written or spoken languages.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the audio tour script represents a completed body of research 
          and a coherent statement of the museum&#39;s key messages about its displays 
          that can be reiterated in the sign language guide. In addition, the 
          written text provides a valuable starting point for any subtitling or 
          concept captioning that may accompany the signed interpretation. </p>
        <p>Thanks to these technical advances, museums have ever-increasing means 
          to reach new audiences and better serve all visitors. Good access for 
          any given audience often means better access for all. With nearly universal 
          legislation requiring cultural sites to enable physical and intellectual 
          access, there has never been a better time for museums to test these 
          new solutions and learn how best to integrate each into a complete visitor 
          services and interpretation program.</p>

        <h1>Appendix A: Tate Modern&#39;s British Sign Language Multimedia Tour</h1>
        <h2>Overview And Evaluation Summary</h2>
        <p>British Sign Language (BSL) is the preferred language of 50,000-70,000 
          people in the UK, and is more widely used than Welsh or Gaelic. The 
          British Government recognised BSL as an official language in 2003, and 
          it is recognised by the Greater London Authority as a minority language. 
        </p>
        <p>In October 2003, Tate Modern piloted the world&#39;s first wireless sign 
          language guide as part of a three-tour programme, also including an 
          audio-visual Multimedia Highlights Tour for young people aged 16-25 
          and a text-based Collections Guide that consisted of a searchable database 
          of catalogue essays and labels on works in the permanent collection 
          displays. All three tours were sponsored by Bloomberg and provided in 
          the galleries on PDAs loaned by Toshiba.</p>

        <p>Tate Modern has always aimed to work at the cutting edge of educational 
          technology. Audio guides have been part of the interpretation and education 
          strategy since Tate Modern opened in May 2000, winning awards for its 
          tours for children and for the visually impaired. Over the past two 
          years, with sponsorship from Bloomberg, Tate Modern has also worked 
          with Antenna Audio to develop a system of gallery interpretation that 
          connects handheld computers or PDAs to a wireless network and provides 
          multimedia information, communication and access to database-stored 
          texts. In 2002, Tate Modern&#39;s Multimedia Tour Programme received the 
          British Academy for Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award for Technical 
          Innovation, while in 2003 it was awarded the Museum and Heritage award 
          for Best New Product or Service. </p>
        <p>Tate Modern&#39;s BSL Multimedia Tour was an opportunity for deaf and hard-of-hearing 
          people to visit the gallery and gain independent access to information 
          in their first or preferred language - BSL. In addition to multimedia 
          and interactive content about the artworks, the BSL Tour featured video 
          footage of Claire Morgan Burton, the Curator of Special Projects at 
          Tate Modern, discussing works on display in British Sign Language, as 
          well as signing by contemporary deaf artists, who gave the artists&#39; 
          quotations used in the tour, and deaf visitors. Several deaf people 
          questioned the choice of narrator – a hearing person who uses 
          BSL fluently – feeling that it would be more appropriate to employ 
          a deaf person for this task. Others felt that this choice was entirely 
          appropriate, as Claire could speak to visitors with the authority of 
          a Tate curator. For all tour users, however, the inclusion of deaf artists 
          and visitors as additional &#39;voices&#39; in the tour was a good one.</p>
        <p>The BSL tour included many of the interactive and multimedia features 
          developed for the Multimedia Highlights Tour, such as games and instant 
          messaging. Visitors taking either tour could send each other text messages 
          in the gallery, and request further information about the art they had 
          seen to be sent to their home e-mail addresses. These features encourage, 
          via Tate&#39;s Web site, both a sense of community and exchange of ideas 
          among visitors, and a continuation of the in-gallery experience after 
          the visitor has left their home or school. In fact, Deaf visitors responded 
          very similarly to hearing visitors regarding the tour&#39;s multimedia content, 
          confirming that much of the material from the audio-visual Multimedia 
          Tour can be transferred with signed translation to the BSL tour. Nonetheless, 
          the script for the sign language version of the tour had to be completely 
          rewritten to work when signed in BSL, which has a different conceptual 
          and linguistic structure than English. The final BSL script was written 
          in English but in such a way that a signer could easily translate phrases 
          and meanings into BSL while being videoed.</p>
        <p>Optional subtitling and &#39;key word captioning&#39; gave an additional means 
          whereby visitors could access information in English text, while a video 
          Glossary of art terms provided a sign language definition of any unfamiliar 
          art terms that the visitor encountered in the interpretative content. 
          Participants in the focus group commented that deaf people are not exposed 
          often enough in BSL to academic subjects, such as the interpretation 
          of contemporary art, and may not be fluent in those concepts, either 
          in written English or BSL. The subtitles were therefore a hugely valuable 
          addition to Tate Modern&#39;s BSL tour. Likewise, the Glossary function 
          was a significant support to achieving greater fluency in art terminology 
          and concepts. The &#39;key word&#39; concept captioning, on the other hand, 
          did not prove to be of significant added value as an alternative to 
          the full subtitling, as most visitors chose simply to use the subtitles.</p>
        <p>The BSL tour users were very sensitive to fluctuations in speed and 
            rhythm in content delivery and playing. The BSL Tour relies on video 
            much more heavily than the Highlights Tour, so any slowness in playing 
            the content is a real irritation; for example, slower PDA processor 
            speeds or network connectivity problems can slow down the signing on 
            screen, creating comprehension difficulties for the BSL user – rather like listening to an artificially-slowed audio track for a hearing 
            person. </p>
        <h2>Quantitative Evaluation</h2>
        <p>In order to inform the further development of both the audio-visual 
          and the BSL tours at Tate Modern, all users of the Multimedia Tours 
          were asked to complete a questionnaire evaluating their experience: 
          130 BSL users responded to the survey regarding the BSL Multimedia Tour.</p>
        <p>Of the BSL tour users, 84% were from the UK. Of these, the majority 
          were over 21 (20% were 21-25; 39% were 26-40; 18% were 41-60), in contrast 
          to the Multimedia Highlights Tour, which was specifically designed for 
          younger visitors, aged 16-25. Only 18% of the BLS Multimedia Tour users 
          were under 21 years of age, and 3% were over 60. The BSL tour users 
          ranked themselves as very comfortable with technology, with 62% considering 
          themselves above average in computer literacy.</p>
        <p>Although there were half the artworks on the BSL tour, deaf visitors 
          stayed longer than those taking the audio-based Multimedia Highlights 
          tour: their average visit was 77 minutes, with a maximum of 240 minutes, 
          in comparison to an average of 70 minutes for hearing visitors. This 
          lengthier visit of fewer displays may be in some part a result of the 
          visual structure of a sign language guide which requires visitors to 
          look at the displays and at the interpretation on the screen as two 
          temporally separate actions, in contrast to an audio-based guide where 
          the visitor can simultaneously look at an exhibit and hear interpretation 
          about it. </p>
        <p class="caption" style="text-autospace:none"><img src="proctor.fig3.jpg" width="400" height="244" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: User Satisfaction Ratings"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 3: User Satisfaction Ratings at Tate Modern</p>
        <p>Regardless, BSL tour users reported a very high satisfaction level: 
          79% reported that the tour had improved their visit; 6% indicated no 
          change; 1% reported that the tour had made the visit worse; and 14% 
          did not respond to this question. </p>
        <p>The Sign Language Guide was also credited with the ability to bring 
          deaf visitors back: 84% of visitors who come once or twice a month would 
          come more often if there were a permanent Sign Language Guide, while 
          78% of those visiting once or twice a year and 74% of first-time visitors 
          would return more often.</p>

        <h2>Qualitative Analysis</h2>
        <p>All visitors who completed questionnaires on the BSL tour were encouraged 
          to leave their comments in order to provide more qualitative feedback 
          on the tour. In addition, Tate commissioned an independent evaluator, 
          Susie Fisher, to carry out research on the Multimedia Highlights Tour 
          for hearing visitors and the BSL Multimedia Tour during December 2003. 
          Fisher&#39;s evaluation consisted of three focus groups, one of which looked 
          exclusively at the BSL tour, and three accompanied gallery visits where 
          visitors using a PDA were accompanied through the gallery as they used 
          the Multimedia Highlights Tour. A mixture of users and non-users were 
          included in the sample (the non-users were asked to try out the tour 
          but wouldn&#39;t have chosen to take it otherwise). </p>
        <p>The BSL focus group consisted of one two-hour discussion with Claire 
          Morgan of Tate Modern as interpreter. The deaf participants included 
          2 women and 1 man, aged 16-25.  All were higher education Arts students 
          who had previously used the Tour – young, stylish, and in love 
          with art.</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;I saw the Jackson Pollock and looked at it 
          all the way through.&#34;</p>
        <p>The BSL Tour is uniquely valuable to deaf visitors, so generally speaking, 
          deaf visitors have been deeply grateful for any material designed for 
          the deaf and reluctant to criticise the BSL Tour.</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;We&#39;re lucky to have Art where you can press 
          a button.&#34;</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;Having access for deaf people means a lot 
          less doubt. It&#39;s very unusual.  It&#39;s nice to have more information.&#34;</p>
        <p>At the same time, these visitors are ready to debate and looking for 
          challenging discussions about Art. </p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;They should have Art experts and non experts.  
          People signing to say what they thought.  Here&#39;s the debate and compare 
          to the different backgrounds.&#34;</p>

        <p>The BSL Tour includes similar content to the Highlights Tour, and several 
          functions are common to both tours, such as the <strong>Tate Txt</strong> 
          messaging system, interactive map of the galleries, games, and visitor 
          polling.  Nonetheless, the script for the sign language version of the 
          tour had to be completely rewritten to work when signed in BSL, which 
          has a different conceptual and linguistic structure than English. The 
          final BSL script was written in English but in such a way that a signer 
          could easily translate phrases and meanings into BSL while being videoed.</p>
        <p>Deaf visitors responded very similarly to hearing visitors on most 
          of the key content issues, and confirmed that much of the material from 
          the audio-visual Multimedia Tour can be transferred with signed translation 
          to the BSL tour.</p>
        <p>Like hearing visitors, BSL users did find that the tour gave them information 
          at the right level:</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;It&#39;s high enough, easy to understand.&#34;</p>
        <p>They enjoyed getting involved in the gallery community of hearing and 
          deaf visitors through the tour&#39;s opinion poll:</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;I loved to see the results.  It&#39;s a really 
          nice idea, the graphics bar chart.  It&#39;s changing opinion.  It&#39;s really 
          interesting.&#34;</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;You see hearing people with audio guides and 
          you think &#39;Why haven’t I got one&#39;?  I&#39;m equal.&#34;</p>
        <p>They wanted to hear from the artists themselves:</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;More about the Artist themselves, Mark Rothko 
          talking about a picture.&#34;</p>
        <p>And they appreciated the use of videos of artists:</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;The video really helped us understand what 
          the artist does.&#34;</p>
        <p>They found it hard to orientate in the gallery because of the size 
          of numbers for tour stops on the wall labels and lack of correspondence 
          between room names on the tour map and in the galleries:</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor"> &#34;It took a long time, difficult to follow.&#34;</p>
        <p>On the other hand, some issues were more salient for deaf people than 
          hearing visitors.  It is genuinely empowering for deaf people to have 
          a BSL tour; it leads them into greater fluency and learning about arts 
          concepts. Conscious of having to work hard to achieve the level of information 
          which is readily available to hearing people, deaf users were particularly 
          grateful for the Glossary function:</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;The glossary is so useful.  They are new words. 
          What does that mean?&#34;</p>
        <p>Participants in the focus group commented that deaf people are not 
          often enough exposed to academic subjects, such as the interpretation 
          of contemporary art, in BSL.<strong> </strong> They may therefore not 
          be fluent in those concepts, either in written English or BSL.  </p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;It&#39;s good for deaf people to learn new things 
          and useful for deaf people to improve their language skills.  For example, 
          the word &#39;Impressionists&#39; teaches us how to use that sign.&#34;</p>
        <p>English subtitling therefore provides a bridge between the concept, 
          the sign language, and the wider art discourse that is carried on in 
          English. Each linked element – Signing, Glossary, and Subtitle 
          – bolsters the users&#39; understanding of the others and increases 
          their fluency and capacity.</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;The English is at a higher level.  With subtitles 
          you read the English as well. Grab both.&#34;</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;New art words, a signed dictionary to say 
          what they are.&#34;</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;It&#39;s giving you the tools, you can understand 
          the basic concepts.&#34;</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;I like to use the glossary.  It&#39;s more an 
          explanation of the arts.  The visual BSL gives you confidence.  It&#39;s 
          a starting point.&#34;</p>
        <p>As deaf people and students of Art, some deaf visitors were particularly 
          concerned about getting the most educationally out of the tour experience; 
          they wanted more information and less play: </p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;I didn&#39;t use the game.  I want serious info 
          and the opportunity to hear about Art.&#34;</p>
        <p>But others were equally passionate about their subject and ready to 
          debate this point.</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;Playing games helps you understand things, 
          because artists themselves play games.&#34;</p>
        <p>Susie Fisher concluded that in this initial, interpretation-hungry 
          period of the introduction of the BSL tour, deaf people may need a more 
          straightforward presentation of serious art content that is more information-based.</p>
        <p>The narrator of the BSL Tour is a Tate Modern curator who is a hearing 
          person who uses BSL fluently. Several deaf people questioned this choice 
          of narrator, feeling that it would be more appropriate to employ a deaf 
          person for this task. Others felt that the tour and the need for BSL 
          interpretation in the gallery generally gained legitimacy from being 
          interpreted by a Tate curator who is fluent in BSL.</p>
        <p>The BSL tour users were also very sensitive to fluctuations in speed 
          and rhythm in content delivery and playing. The BSL Tour relies on video 
          much more heavily than the Highlights Tour so any slowness in playing 
          the content is a real irritation; for example, slower PDA processor 
          speeds or network connectivity problems can slow down the signing on 
          screen, creating comprehension difficulties for the BSL user – 
          rather like listening to an artificially-slowed audio track for a hearing 
          person. </p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;It&#39;s really frustrating pausing and having 
          to wait.  Very frustrating.  I don’t know how to resolve it and go on 
          to the next.&#34;</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, deaf people were overwhelmingly positive about the provision 
          of such tours in galleries and were delighted to see interpretation 
          in their first language rather than having to rely on interpretation 
          in English or wait for a monthly BSL-interpreted gallery tour.  The 
          focus group evaluation demonstrated that this audience will make serious 
          and thorough use of a BSL tour and will be thrilled to have the opportunity 
          to take a BSL Tour whenever they want to visit.</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;It&#39;s great to have a BSL Tour Model. I 
          would come here in my own time and study all around the gallery. Thank 
          you.&#34;</p>
        <p class="blockquoteauthor">&#34;Now that I have the information, I look at 
          the art with greater understanding.  Before it was la la la in my brain.  I feel closer now.&#34;</p>
        <p>The BSL Multimedia Tour makes it possible for deaf visitors to enjoy 
          the same high quality, on-demand interpretative content that hearing 
          visitors have come to expect from Tate Modern&#39;s audio and audio-visual 
          tours.</p>
        <h1>Appendix B: The American Sign Language Guide at the Great Blacks in 
          Wax Museum</h1>
        <p>The Great Blacks In Wax Museum, a private non-profit cultural and educational 
          institution in Baltimore, Maryland, was founded in 1983 by Drs. Elmer 
          and Joanne Martin. Featuring over 100 wax figures, the museum details 
          the African American experience from ancient Africa and slavery, through 
          the civil rights era, and up to today. Because it is a wax museum committed 
          solely to the study and preservation of African American h istory, it 
          is among the United States&#39; most dynamic cultural and educational institutions, 
          continually updated as African American history and its interpretation 
          develop over time.</p>
        <p>A primary motivation for establishing the Great Blacks In Wax Museum 
          was to &#34;use education, history, and example to help mainly culturally 
          disadvantaged youth overcome feelings of alienation, defeatism, and 
          despair&#34;  As a result of their exposure to the Museum and its programs, 
          these young people, as well as many adults, learn more about their heritage 
          and have a greater understanding of significant contributions to civilization 
          by people of African descent.</p>
        <p>Intellectual access is a top priority for the Great Blacks in Wax Museum. 
          In order to better reach visitors whose first or preferred language 
          is American Sign Language (ASL), The Great Blacks in Wax Museum collaborated 
          with Antenna Audio to create an ASL tour based on the Voices of History 
          audio tour of the museum. The Sign Language Guide at The Great Blacks 
          in Wax Museum is the first digital American Sign Language tour to be 
          offered in a US museum. A tour for visually-impaired visitors, which 
          provides enhanced visual descriptions of the exhibits, is also available 
          at the museum, alongside a children&#39;s and adults&#39; audio tour. All tours 
          are complimentary with admission to the museum.</p>
        <p>Following the Voices of History audio tour script, the Sign Language 
          tour discusses many of the significant individuals and events depicted 
          at the Museum. The tour also provides visitors with the option of concept 
          captioning for the signed video footage, depending on their needs and 
          preference, as well as general information about the Museum and a help 
          function. Feedback from visitors indicated that while concept captioning 
          is helpful, full subtitling is even more welcome as a support to their 
          understanding of the signed content. </p>

        <p class="caption">Fig 5 : Nathie Marbury narrates the Voices of History 
          American Sign Language Guide to the Great Blacks in Wax Museum in Baltimore, 
          Maryland, which includes optional concept captioning</p>
        <p>The Sign Language Guide is presented in ASL by Nathie Marbury, a well-known 
          Deaf story-teller and teacher. The decision to engage Nathie Marbury 
          as interpreter was very carefully and deliberately made. First, Marbury&#39;s 
          storytelling skills were ideally suited to the nature of the Voices 
          of History tour and indeed to the African American tradition of storytelling 
          and oral histories.  Secondly, Marbury&#39;s first language is ASL, ensuring 
          that the histories represented in the tour are fluently and accurately 
          communicated to the ASL audience. And finally, being a Deaf African 
          American, Marbury was able to embody the voices of the tour more fully, 
          making the commentary more immediate, compelling and personal for the 
          target audience – not just a translation from a script designed 
          for hearing people. </p>
        <p>During the design of the American Sign Language Guide, Antenna Audio 
          consulted with members of the Technology Access Program at Gallaudet 
          University in Washington, D.C., the world&#39;s only liberal arts university 
          designed exclusively to deaf and hard of hearing students, to get invaluable 
          feedback on how to make the guide most useful for American Sign Language 
          users. Cary Barbin, research engineer for the Technology Access Program, 
          commented after his visit to Great Blacks in Wax Museum:</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">For the first time in front of the exhibitions, 
          I was able to see the stories presented in American Sign Language rather 
          than reading off a binder in the dark. This enabled me to follow 
          the story visually. The ASL guide really enriched the whole museum 
          experience.</p>
                <h1>Appendix C: The International Spy Museum&#39;s Subtitled Guide</h1>
        <p>The International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C. offers a highly interactive, 
          multimedia experience. Numerous computer stations, video monitors and

        <p>A new special exhibition, <em>The Enemy Within: Terror in America 1776 
          to Today</em> included the museum&#39;s first access tour designed for visitors 
          who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. The PDA-based guide to the exhibits 
          used in this popular attraction combines Subtitled Guide elements with 
          scrollable text pages providing the script from the audio tour. Three 
          videos from the exhibition play on the PDA in full with subtitled transcriptions 
          of their soundtracks. Scripts and descriptions for 17 shorter exhibits 
          are also available in a full-screen display mode. </p>
        <p>No audio is included in the Spy Museum&#39;s Subtitled Guide, and feedback 
          on this point from visitors and evaluators indicated that the program 
          would benefit from its inclusion. In this way the Spy Museum&#39;s PDA tour 
          would have greater appeal for those who have some hearing but like to 
          supplement their audio understanding with reference to the script. </p>
