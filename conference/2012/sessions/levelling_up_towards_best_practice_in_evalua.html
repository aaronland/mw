                                <div class="item odd"><p><span>Games,  and game-like experiences, are becoming increasingly important to  museums seeking to engage new audiences and to provide deeper engagement  with existing audiences. Demonstrating the value of commissioning and  producing games as a core activity of museums is imperative. At the same  time, the sector is encountering a new, cold wave of realism in  evaluating its online presences. Old canards about new audiences are  being thrown out the window, and a more rigorous focus is being applied  to the business of gaining and measuring audience attention.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>There  is a risk, however, that these engagement metrics, oriented towards  page-based content and measurable proxies for interaction in social  media are poorly suited for the kind of immersive, deep engagement that  good games can offer. This paper will identify and discuss best practice  in the field of museum games evaluation in order that such evaluation  might also move towards standardisation and wide acceptance, with the  end result of improving games in our field.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>Most  museum games are web-based, and have an explicit educational intent.  Examples from our own experience include High Tea, Memory (Wellcome  Collection), Launchball, Rizk and Thingdom (Science Museum). These types  of games will be the focus of this paper, though we expect the  methodology to have applications across other gaming activities.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>Drawing  from our own institutional practices, across the cultural heritage and  informal learning sectors, and looking at the area of ‘persuasive’ games  in general, we will focus on initial objective setting and three areas  of evaluation:</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>1.  Quantitative evaluation: What are the best tools and methods to measure  overall interactions, in-game interactions, and profile game  achievement against audience segments?</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>2.  Qualitative evaluation: How can we use interviews, surveys, and focus  groups to gain a deeper understanding of player motivation and  experience and are they sufficient? Can we find more useful and rich ‘in  the wild’ where people freely discuss games?  If we choose that route,  what are the best approaches to gathering and analyzing that data?</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>3.  Pre vs Post-release evaluation: How reliable or valid are expert  reviews and user testing of games prior to release? How do these results  compare with those from summative evaluations?</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>In  each of these areas, we will also consider aligning evaluation  approaches for different types of games: autonomous games, and gamified  or gameful experiences. Technical appendices will describe both  quantitative and qualitative methods.</span></p>
