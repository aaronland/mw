                                <div class="item odd"><p class="paperabstract"><em>‘Let’s Get Real: How to evaluate online success?’</em> is a report published by Culture24 in September 2011 at their UK conference of the same name.</p>
<p class="paperabstract"> It looks at the work from a unique action research project that took place in the UK between June 2010 and Sept 2011 involving 24 organizations and agencies from across the cultural heritage and arts sector.  The report details the collaborative process of the project, and shares in-depth information on the data and learning gained by the organisations involved.</p>
<p class="paperabstract">The key findings in the report will be the starting point for this professional forum and will be the subject for an open discussion and debate led by the report authors (and project leads) Jane Finnis and Seb Chan.</p>
<p class="paperabstract">Some of the findings in the report are challenging for the cultural sector and could be seen as a wake up call to ‘get real’ about the way we measure and define value online. The report itself champions a more honest appraisal of success online in recent years and a willingness to openly admit and learn from mistakes.</p>
<p class="paperabstract">Jane and Seb will present the thinking around each of the key findings from the report before chairing an open discussion on the challenges these findings present.</p>
