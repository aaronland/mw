</p><h3>

In Search of Meaningful Events: Curatorial Algorithms and

Malleable Aesthetics</h3>



<b><a href="../../bios/au_6367.html">Andy C. Deck</a></b><p>



</p><p>



        

     So much of the contemporary experience of the World Wide Web

is searching and sampling of the unfinished, insufficient

precursors of what one may expect tomorrow.  In the climate of

&#34;cool&#34; that prevails, many are occupied with looking, searching,

and waiting rather than with dialogue, synthesis, derivation, and

playful production.  In fact the trend is encouraged: the more

pages of &#34;search results&#34; we scan the more advertising we see. The significance of

editorial selection and algorithms that shape the resulting view of the internet

extends beyond aesthetics.  Yet the concentration of authority around the mass

market internet portals engages discursive formations that have emerged in recent

years with respect to art and the public sphere, institutional critique, and

freedom of speech.  Artists are posing questions about the limits and function of

the arts in the sphere of the internet.  Insofar as public institutions treat

their web sites as publicity tools  glorified pamphlets  one must turn toward the

margins of creative production for clues about latent alternatives.  Fortunately

the margins and centers of the internet continue to mingle, especially in a

technical sense.  So one may still entertain some marginally central questions: If

an art form overturns the paradigm of broadcast, allowing reciprocal action

between transmitter and receiver, in what consists the act of curation?  Is the

curator then a moderator?  An artist?  A programmer?  Malleable aesthetics provoke

such questions.

</p><p>

     The cybernetic systems I have in mind may prove incompatible

with normative museum practices, with the curation of objects and

the documentation of art that exists prior to its reception.  The

malleability I mean transforms hypertext and hypermedia: its essence lies in

profound reconfigurability in response to feedback from observer/participants. 

Whereas the beauty of existing hypertext and hypermedia art is supposed to reside

in the masterful interplay of prospective narratives wired in by the author, the

allure of malleable aesthetics is the potential digression toward and development

of any direction.  Incompatible with forced enclosure, the purest forms of this

category of production are licensed to assure that programming code remains in the

public domain.           

</p><p>

    Some of the most intriguing microcosms of malleable aesthetics to date have

been textual interactive systems that privilege the familiar signification of

natural language as writing.  The call and response of textual dialogue, whether

at the pace of conversation or in a slower, gradual accumulation of related ideas

(&#34;bulletin boards&#34;), offers a suggestive model for the articulation of meaning

online.  There are dozens of varieties of dialogic text systems that embody

different approaches to the control of events and interface.  One bland form,

chat, imposes a potential anonymity, sometimes resists the use of one&#39;s preferred

language, and favors people who can type.   But usually there is little or no

censorship.  While this type of communication may foster subtle, shared events and

ideas, usually there is no lasting record, except in the memories of the readers

and writers.  

</p><p>

</p><center><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="hubba.gif"/></td></tr><tr><td>

Jim Woodring</small></td></tr></tbody></table></center>

<p>

Variations of the chat interface include the categorization of discussion topics,

and the ability to whisper to (or exclude) some readers.  Perhaps due to the

transience of this type of speech, &#34;freedom of chat&#34; remains controversial only

among the most domineering hosts.  Microsoft and AOL use the popularity of chat to

leverage their power as a marketing venues.  Despite differences in their revenue

models, both are developing a base of users for online consumer colonies.  That

users have no profound, programmatic control of the underlying software greatly

limits the malleable potential of such systems.  Public feedback used in this way

becomes a disposable byproduct in the pursuit of market share.  It seems clear

enough that developments that do not serve this pursuit will not flourish in

regulated commercial software spaces, where feedback is reduced to what Hans

Magnus Enzensberger has termed the &#34;lowest level compatible with the system.&#34;

(Enzensberger, 1982).  

</p><p>

There is little enough reason to believe that norms  held-over from broadcast are

applicable to the internet.  Even the notion of communicative reciprocity seems a

bit dated, since it appears to have more to do with ham radio than with the cagey

mediation of software.  It would be a mistake, also, to assume that the appearance

of persistence, in the form of the database, is a panacea for the passive legacy

of broadcast.  However, those forms of persistence that contribute to the

diffusion of control over public interactive systems, lead toward malleable

aesthetics.  When feedback might affect the purposive qualities of a system,

politics enters the picture.  &#34;Once something is going to be permanent everybody

cares about it&#34; (Antin, 1992).  And so it goes even in the corners of cyberspace. 

Those interfaces that give people opportunities to contribute in a cumulative way

are usually absent from the fortified web sites of corporate media (and museums).  

</p><p>

Really to include the unknown lays open a Pandora&#39;s Box of expressive liberties to

an anonymous public.  Most institutions are reluctant to pursue web ventures that

cannot insure a degree of decorum.  Fearing what might happen, they front web

sites that inexpensively advertise their stuff.  In so doing, they contribute to

the mutation of the internet into an elaborate yellow pages catalog.  Here, public

institutions follow the lead of the marketing sector, instead of standing with

artists and intellectuals who would advance a different culture than the bogus

authoritarianism of commercial television.

</p><p>

Clearly this is not to advocate institutional support for puerile uses of the new

media.  The amazing growth of the web is evidence of the will of people to leave a

mark  aesthetical, rhetorical, or otherwise  and it is with this in mind that one

must ask whether museums, and other public institutions, will endorse or reject

that will?  Insofar as the museum on the web will become more than a repository of

support materials referring to a permanent collection, it must address the issue

of feedback.  Is it wanted?  With what limits?  How might it be used?

</p><p>

Situating the museum and curator in the network of public

collaboration, it may be said that control or moderation of input can take the

form of preemptive interface design and programming, concurrent moderation by a

living participant, or retroactive exclusion, censorship, and editing.  Concurrent

moderation is the unviable offspring of broadcast and the chaperone.  Likewise,

that there exists a technical solution able to resolve the political difficulties

of real public participation is a myth. If an interface stops the cacophony of

chat and the banality of &#34;my first homepage&#34; it might also prevent the ideal

contribution, whatever that may be.  Software should not be used like a Kafkaesque

bureaucracy to hide the trail of responsibility and repression.  Instead of

resisting the response of the public, instead of serving as apologists for

mediocre software, and instead of abstractly ascribing responsibility to

&#34;technology,&#34; institutions need to become more accountable.  Due to the political

implications of interactive system design, it should be open to revision and

debate.  In moving away from the stuffy, cosmetic web sites that have sprung up

all over, the need for more transparent control policies is evident.           

</p><p>

Paradigmatic of this openness are the multi-user, object oriented &#34;MOO&#34; projects

that have derived from role playing, text only &#34;multi-user dungeons&#34; (MUDs). 

Participants with access to the internet connect to a computer that hosts the MOO

server software and database. Typically, the people who use the MOO most become

the policy architects and chief content providers.  It is not unusual for a 

leadership committee to consist of a geographically

dispersed group of interested users.  As with chat, the transience of utterances

tends to make censorship a rarity, but in those situations where someone&#39;s behavior becomes

really disruptive, generally, a joint decision is made concerning the best

response.  This process, which ranges from democratic to oligarchic in practice,

invokes a governmental, consensual protocol for the harmonization of online

discourse. This kind of governance has predominated on the MOO systems over the

last decade, and in practice it allows a wide latitude for expressiveness.  

</p><p>

Regardless of whether the MOO participants consider themselves artists, conflicts

of authority arising from the regulation of collaborative, public art projects can

be arbitrated in this way.  Rather than preemptively or automatically stifling

behavior, it encourages participants to resolve their own differences, as tends to

happen outside of digital channels.  Although not ideal, this model can also

provide a flexible mechanism for institutions to defray controversy over online

content: the responsibility for settling disagreements is delegated.  

</p><p>

MOOs differ significantly from chat for several reasons.  For one thing,

persistent characters and environments give continuity to repeated visits.

Although anonymity is an option, the metaphorical space of a MOO becomes familiar,

as do the various personalities.  Regular visitors can contribute many types of

&#39;objects&#39; to the database--descriptive, programmatic, automatic, responsive. 

Users confront one another at the boundary of natural language and programming,

but both novices and &#39;wizards&#39; can meet and converse in this border zone.  People

with modest programming skills add features (scripting, &#34;rooms&#34;) to the MOO for

others to use.  Nor is it unusual for the underlying source code, which can be

obtained freely, to undergo changes.  The resulting synergy, by which the space is

gradually reinvented, opens onto unanticipated paths.  The term &#34;malleable

aesthetics&#34; as I mean it refers to this ability to accumulate not only statements,

or data, but also the structural changes wrought by users of the system.  

</p><p>

Hybrid interfaces have appeared that attempt to give a more

visual form to MOO personas and places.  This has been tried in numerous ways

without widespread success.  Although networked, user-directed constructions are

possible with multimedia (witness the World Wide Web itself), creating graphical

avatars and imagery for visual MOOs demands some uncommon skills  the public is

generally unfamiliar with programming languages and authoring tools.  Networked

action games like Quake, while in some respects graphically responsive, impose a

stark thematization.  Whereas MOO thematics span from quest games to postmodern

culture, the graphical hybrids remain mired in layers of procedural complexity and

graphical preconception.

</p><p>

Even if, through simulation, one is able to traverse a game

&#34;world,&#34; this remains the preconceived, labyrinthine navigation of non-malleable

hypermedia.  In the arena of the reality engine, extension of default boundaries

founders at the counterintuitive, mouse-driven interfacing of level editing, image

processing, solids modeling, and motion control.  As a result gimmicks that offer

superficial choices abound.  But whatever virtual wallpaper one selects, a shoot

&#39;em up game is still a shoot &#39;em up game.  The challenge latent in all the

hybridized multi-user systems is the retrieval of narrative and visual thematics

from engineers, programmers, and the competing demands of commodification in the

marketplace of software and services.          

</p><p>

Probably it will not be long before microphones and digital video cameras explode

the dominance of the mouse as a device for contributing to spontaneous, networked

audio-visual events. One can imagine low budget, &#34;on the scene&#34; reporting being

produced by independent documentarists equipped with little more than a video

camera, microphone, PC, and internet connection.  Some indication of this pattern

is already evident in the global spread of talk radio and independent music

through streaming digital audio.  Such technologies promise to bring an

intuitiveness to the creative use of computers that will make the boundary between

player/consumer and producer/artist more permeable.  

</p><p>

But at the corporate portal, and within the intranet, a concurrent involution

threatens this promise with cookie-cutter software that reduces creativity to one

of several options and equates expression with consumption.  Still, given the

tools that are widely available, the boundary is not altogether firm.  While

firewalls, filtration, transmission asymmetry, and security mechanisms encroach

insidiously on the technical feasibility of new forms of reciprocal communication,

nonetheless experimentation continues.  The Java language, originally conceived of

as a control language for interactive television, has become a popular means to

orchestrate so called &#34;client server&#34; communications.  Using it to implement a

collaborative drawing system, I have found that in spite of the limitations of the

mouse, the programming language, and the browser context, I&#39;ve become involved in

a relationship with a public imagination that interests me more than mine alone. 

The things that have been made  things that have happened  in this unusual space

keep me focused on overcoming the looming sense of inadequacy.  Many times I have

corresponded with people in dream-like non-verbal dialogues.  While I&#39;m away from

the place, some of my collaborators leave their experimental animations, whereas

others labor away on a single image.  Because the saved drawings can be &#34;played

back,&#34; in the same sequence of strokes and marks used by the artist, the products

of this program resemble time-lapse studies.  Eventually I&#39;d like to give people

of an editorial disposition tools to script metanarratives using the material that

has already been made.  

</p><p>

I wonder whether it would be good to let people erase things in the database. 

This would subvert my desire to accumulate a seamless retrospective view.  Perhaps

the solution is to proceed in both directions, though I can oversee only one. 

This is called &#34;forking&#34; in the field of free software development.  Open source,

GNU General Public Licensing allows anyone, if desired, to produce derivatives of

my software.  Having put so much labor into the project, it is not easy to let it

go like this, but that&#39;s the only alternative to a world in which the software

wheel is reinvented again and again.  With software, derivation is more productive

than invention.

</p><p></p><center><a href="http://www.andyland.net/draw" target="_blank"><img src="draw.jpg"/></a></center><p>

In building the program, I have been struck by the many ways that censorship intertwines itself with design.  Each configuration can discourage someone and

attract another.  Interfaces interpellate subjects.  It is from this point of

reference that the term &#34;curatorial algorithm&#34; comes to make sense to me.  The

programming and design decisions I&#39;ve made determine, broadly, 

what people are likely, and able, to produce with the drawing software.  In

practice, I rarely delete or censor what people have added to the database. 

Certainly there are elements of graffiti, shout outs and attempts at self

promotion.  But I&#39;m not keen to tell people how to use the software or what to

write.  In this respect, I avoid the conventional role of the curator.

Nevertheless, it is clear that making the interface less (or more) simplistic,

dissuades some people from drawing.  Design decisions, then, which may derive from

programming logistics or various biases, can amount to a form of feedback

selection.  The people who are put off by the design ultimately will not be

represented in the collective art that is made.  

</p><p>

With this in mind, I have tried to make an interface that at first view seems

simple, but which also retains a certain functional depth, a capacity for

subtlety.  I conceive of this software as a sort of bridge between entertainment

and a creative process.  It has been my experience that people learn by doing, a

common observation that is expressed more eloquently by Andreas Huyssen in writing

of the  Heiner Müller&#39;s &#34;learning plays&#34;:

</p><blockquote>

Don&#39;t learn from them (object lesson, theater as finished product, uncritical

acceptance of thesis), but, by actively reproducing them, learn through them

(example lesson, re-production of a process, Bei-Spiel, critical trying out of

behavior). (Huyssen, 1976) 

</blockquote>

Software has the potential to stage the contradictory processes of dramatic

presentations, and to allow people to learn by the acting through of situations.

But it also has the potential to forestall such imaginative investment, leading

users through a procession of preselected hierarchical hoops.

As individuals, small groups, or modestly funded museums, the pace of content

production set by advertising sponsored, venture capital infused, web sites

appears unattainable.  And probably pace is not a virtue anyway.  Instead of

emulating it, systems can be implemented that encourage the creative participation

of visitors.  Such sites may be popular and at the same time conducive to the

&#34;critical trying out of behavior.&#34;  In this sense, it is possible to compete with

the emerging web entertainment industry; and, what is more, this competition need

not follow in lock step with the genres and values of the Gee Whiz industry. 

Rather, the opportunity exists to close the gap between passive pass-times and

nuanced artistic and intellectual engagement.
