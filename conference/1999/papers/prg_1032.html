<h3>

<a name="sec1"></a><b>1. Introduction and Background</b></h3>

According to architect Christopher Alexander <a name="cite1"></a><a href="#[1]">(Alexander

et al., 1977)</a>, a pattern &#34;... describes a problem which occurs over and

over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution

to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million

times over, without ever doing it the same way twice&#34;.

<p>Although this definition came from architecture, patterns are now used

in many other contexts, including computer-based applications, where they

focus on design aspects <a name="cite2"></a>(<a href="#[5]">Gamma

et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#[2]">Appleton, 1997</a>; <a href="#[10]">Schmidt

et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#[3]">Bernstein, 1998</a>). <i>Design patterns</i>

are ways to record systematically the experience of software designers

and to make it <i>reusable:</i> they help designers solve a problem by

identifying a similar problem and by adapting its solutions rather than

re-starting the definition of the problem solution from scratch <a name="cite3"></a>(<a href="#[7]">Garzotto

et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#[8]">Nanard et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#[9]">Rossi

et al., 1997</a>). As such, they represent a way to improve the quality

of a software product while reducing the development cost.

</p><p>In this paper, we focus on design patterns for museum Web sites. Since

design patterns are discovered, not invented, our research started from

a systematic exploration of a large set of sites chosen from the <i>Best

of the Web</i> nomination list of &#34;Museums and the Web &#39;98&#34; conference.

We discovered a number of recurring design problems, we factored out some

common design contexts and solutions, and expressed them in terms of design

patterns. In this paper, we present this experience and we describe a sample

of our patterns. We will also outline some statistical results on their

frequency and distribution in a sample of the inspected sites.

</p><p><a href="#index">(Back to table of contents)</a>

<br/> 

<br/> 

</p><h3>

<a name="sec2"></a><b>2. Defining Design Patterns</b></h3>

The basic constituents of a design pattern are the following:

<ul>

<li>

the <i>pattern name, </i>used to identify the pattern univocally; the use

of pattern names makes easier to refer to patterns and constitute a well-defined

vocabulary available to the designers;</li>

</ul>



<ul>

<li>

the description, in general terms, of a <i>design problem </i>to be solved;

it expresses the pattern motivation and the context or scenario in which

the pattern can be applied;</li>

</ul>



<ul>

<li>

the description, in abstract terms, of a possible <i>solution </i>or a

number of possible solutions for the design problem;</li>

</ul>



<ul>

<li>

an (optional) <i>discussion</i> of possible restrictions of use, or of

any other aspect which can be useful for the pattern understanding and

use (such as examples of use).</li>

</ul>

In some situations, a problem can be regarded as a specialisation of the

problem addressed by other patterns, and the solution can be defined by

refining previously identified solutions or by combining them. In this

case, the resulting pattern is defined as a <i>variant</i> of one or more

previously defined patterns.

<p>The definition of a catalogue of design patterns requires the adoption

of a reference <i>model </i>for the subject of design. For example, if

the design refers to programs, an implementation model must be chosen <font face="Symbol">-</font>

usually, it is the object-oriented model <a name="cite4"></a>(<a href="#[12]">Schwabe

et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#[11]">Schwabe &amp; Rossi, 1998</a>); if the

design refers to system architectures, a system model must be adopted (suitable

for the specific category of systems under consideration - e.g., the Dexter

model for hypermedia). A model provides a vocabulary of terms and concepts,

which allow to formulate the various constituents of a pattern in an uniform

(clear and concise) way.

</p><p>For the design of WWW hypermedia, we have adopted HDM - the Hypermedia

Design Model. We will not describe here the primitives of the HDM language,

which is widely known and is extensively reported elsewhere <a name="cite5"></a>(<a href="#[6]">Garzotto

et al., 1993</a>). (We will shortly explain the meaning of the various

HDM terms we will use as they appear in the pattern description).

</p><p>We just mention here one aspect of HDM which may be useful from a methodological

and analytical perspective. HDM distinguishes among multiple design dimensions

- content, structure, navigation, dynamics, presentation. The <i>content</i>

concerns the semantic nature of the information carried on by the application.

The <i>structure</i> is the organisation of the application content. The

<i>navigation</i>

refers to links and browsing mechanisms available to explore the structure.

The <i>dynamics</i> defines the run-time behaviour of links and active

media, and the operations available to the user to control them. The <i>presentation</i>

describes how all the previous features are shown to users, i.e., the visual

properties of layout elements. These dimensions help to distinguish among

different aspects of a design problem. It should be desirable that each

pattern is formulated in such a way that it addresses a single dimension

only; unfortunately, design choices are oftentimes interdependent, especially

those concerning content, structure, and navigation. Consequently, the

same pattern may involve different aspects.

<br/> 

</p><h3>

<a name="sec3"></a><b>3. Examples of Design Patterns for Museum Web Sites</b></h3>

So far, our investigation has mainly focused on structural and navigation

design, and on content aspects which are intrinsically related to them.

In this section we will present some examples of patterns discovered in

our analysis of 32 museum Web sites, selected from the nominations for

the &#34;Best of the Web&#34; award at &#34;Museum and the Web&#34; conference in 1998.

These sites are reported in the following table. A more exhaustive list

of patterns defined in our preliminary catalogue can be found in <a name="cite6"></a>(<a href="#[4]">Discenza,

1998</a>).

<p><br/>

</p><p>The design patterns reported in this section mainly concern with the

design of groups of Web pages, named &#34;collections&#34; in the HDM terminology.

A collection denotes a set of application elements called &#34;collection members&#34;.

Members can be pages or collections, in turn, which grouped according to

some objective or subjective criteria. Collection members very often concern

the same category of topics or subtopics (for example, &#34;sculpture works&#34;,

or &#34;sculpture of a given artist&#34;). In this case, we have taxonomic collections,

made of elements which belong to the same &#34;class&#34; (according to come domain

oriented classification). In other cases, elements are collected since

they are all relevant for some specific situation of use or for user&#39;s

task (for example, &#34;all the most frequently visited paintings in the museum&#34;,

or &#34;all the most representative pieces in the museum for a quick overview

of its content&#34;). They satisfy some ad-hoc, subjective requirements, not

easily expressible in a formal way.

</p><p>We will first present two basic design patterns for collections - Pure

Guided Tour and Pure Index. We will then introduce a number of variants,

achieved either by refining the problems and solutions expressed by these

basic patterns, or by combining them and their variants.

<br/> 

</p><p><b>Pattern Name: </b>Pure Guided Tour (sometime denoted only Guided

Tour, for short).

</p><p><b>Problem</b>: Given a collection, provide a navigation structure which

is easily understandable by users, particularly those who are accessing

the collection for the first time, want to explore all its content with

no preference on a particular item, and like to be &#34;guided&#34; across the

collection contents.

</p><p><b>Solution</b>: Identify an order among the collection members, and

create links from the first one to the second one, from the second one

to the third one and so on, until the last one, and all their inverse links.

Create an additional page containing a short introduction to the collection

content and purposes; and define a link from this page to the first member

of the collection. To improve user understanding of the collection rationale,

include here also representative &#34;identifiers&#34; of the members - textual

titles and/or visual representatives, such as miniature pictures. Present

identifiers in a visual order consistent with the order defined for navigation

among members. You may also include in the center any content which can

be relevant to understand the collection rationale: &#34;common&#34; information

which concern <i>all </i>member pages (e.g., a biographical note about

an artist, if the collection is about his works), a short introduction

to the collection theme and purposes, some explicit explanation about its

scenario of use, and similar.

</p><p><b>Discussion:</b> The proposed solution involves structure, navigation,

and content aspects.

<br/>In HDM, the composite object defined with the above rules is named

<i>guided

tour</i>. The additional page included in the collection is named

<i>center</i>.

A guided tour center has the purpose to make clear what is the intended

meaning of the collection and to provide an overview of its contents. Still,

the level of user understanding is dependent from the expressiveness of

the center content (e.g., the choice of the member identifiers), and from

the intuitiveness of the collection order. The main advantage of a guided

tour is that it provides a fast exhaustive access to all its member in

a cognitively simple way for users. It is suitable for &#34;naive&#34; users or

for users who are at their first exploration of the collection, or users

who have a &#34;passive&#34; attitude and like to be guided in the exploration

rather than to engage a free navigation across the collection. The main

disadvantage of a guided tour is that members must be traversed sequentially,

since there is no way to select one of them directly. Thus, the linear

navigation in a guided tour is also appropriate when the number of members

of a collection is relatively small, so that the user does not get bored

to traverse all elements and does not feel the need of &#34;flying&#34; through

the collection jumping from one member to another, nor to rapidly reach

the end of the tour.

<br/> 

</p><p><b>Pattern Name: </b>Pure Index.

</p><p><b>Problem: </b>Given a collection, provide users with a fast efficient

access to each member, and make clear what is the collection intended meaning

and which are its members.

</p><p><b>Solution: </b>In HDM terms, the solution consists of creating an

<i>index.

</i>Define

an additional page in the collection (named index

<i>center</i> - as in

a guided tour) which provides a collection overview, by containing at least

the identifiers of all members (textual titles and/or visual representatives,

such as miniaturised pictures); define links from the center to each member,

and vice versa.<i> </i>The center my also include any information which

can be relevant for improve user&#39;s understanding of the collection rationale

(e.g., a short introduction to the collection theme and purposes, some

explicit explanation about its scenario of use, or some &#34;common&#34; information

which is relevant to <i>all </i>member pages).

</p><p><b>Discussion:</b>A pure index is very similar to a pure guided tour

- see the pattern above - but its navigation structure is different. As

in the pure guided tour pattern, the solution involves structure, navigation,

and content aspects. An example of pure index is the collection of all

paintings of a given art period, with the center describing all the painting

titles coupled with artist names, a short introduction to that period and

an explanation about the criteria of painting choice.

<br/> 

</p><p>There are a number of possible variants to these basic patterns. The

following one, named Hybrid Collection, combines the two basic patterns

described above.

<br/> 

</p><p><b>Pattern Name: </b>Hybrid Collection.

</p><p><b>Variant of: </b>Pure Index, Pure Guided Tour.

</p><p><b>Problem: </b>Given a collection, provide a navigation structure which

is easily used by various types of users: users who want to scan the collection

exhaustively, users who have a &#34;passive&#34; attitude, and users who are interested

to subsets of the collection (not known a-priori) or to a specific subject;

make clear what is the collection intended meaning and which are its members.

</p><p><b>Solution:</b> Define an order among the collection members and create

a center page as in a guided tour or an index; define links from the center

to the first member and from each member to the next and previous one,

as well as links from the center to each member and vice versa.

</p><p><b>Discussion:</b> The navigation structure proposed by this pattern

combines index and guided tour navigation. The main advantage of this hybrid

pattern, with respect to the pure guided tour and index, is that it speeds

up the page access within the collection, and allows to achieve a compromise

to satisfy requirements of different type of users, or of different situations

of use, within the same design. Users can choose among different navigation

styles according to their (evolving) needs. For example, users may prefer

to traverse the collection sequentially (in the guided tour style) the

first time they visit it, but may adopt the index style if they visit the

collection again or gain experience about the system. Users may start sequential

navigation and after a while, if they are not satisfied, jump to the center,

inspect the list of members and directly access one of them. Such a need

typically occurs when the collection is significantly long (say, more that

8-10 members), or when moving from page to page becomes frustratingly long

with the delay access time of WWW.

<br/> 

</p><p>The following patterns are variants of the basic guided tour and index

pattern, and refine their navigation properties. Their are &#34;acceleration

patterns&#34; which introduce features to speed up the user&#39;s access to the

collection members, and to reduce the number of page loading from the remote

server.

<br/> 

</p><p><b>Pattern Name</b>: Circular Guided Tour.

</p><p><b>Variant of: </b>Pure Guided Tour.

</p><p><b>Problem</b>: Consider the same problem for the Pure Guided Tour pattern,

but also assume that users may need to restart the exploration of the collection

again, one or more time, or return to a previously visited element (e.g.,

since they are studying the collection content).

</p><p><b>Solution</b>: Define a basic guided tour and then extend it with

a link from the last member to the first one (or from the last member to

the center).

<br/> 

</p><p><b>Pattern Name: </b>Accelerated Index.

</p><p><b>Variant of: </b>Pure Index.

</p><p><b>Problem: </b>Consider the same problem as discussed for the Pure

Index pattern, but also assume that from each member user wants to have

a fast access to the collection overview (or outline), and to each members,

without accessing a different page every time.

</p><p><b>Solution:</b> Define a structure very similar to the Pure Index,

but i) the center stores only the member identifiers with the corresponding

links to each member; and ii) the center is not a separate page but it

is visually included in each member of the collection. Such an &#34;embedded&#34;

center visually appears as a list of links - or links plus collection members

identifiers - and can be arranged in several ways: it can be placed on

the top or/and the bottom of the member page or defined as a left-side

frame. A combination of these three lay-out solutions can also be provided.

</p><p><b>Discussion:</b> This design solution involves structure, navigation,

content, and presentation; it differs from the Pure Index pattern for presentation

aspects, i.e., the way of visually perceiving the center, and from the

absence of real links form the center to the members and vice versa. The

main advantage of the Accelerated Index with respect to the Pure Index

is that it avoids loading the page with the collection center every time

the center content is needed. Since we are talking of Web-based applications,

this is a consistent advantage, because the access to the network is often

slow, and with the Accelerated Index the access to a different member of

the collection requires only one-step (directly towards the sibling member)

instead of two (one-step upwards to the center and then one-step downwards).

The disadvantage of the Accelerated Index is that placing the center within

a member page reduces the screen space available for displaying the content

of the member page. If we compare the various presentation design proposed

in the solution, when a member page is long the second solution - left

side frame - is smarter than the solution in which the center is described

in the page bottom or in the top: it allows users see the center without

scrolling down (if they are placed at the beginning of the page) or up

(if they are at the end of the page). The combination of the three solutions

resolves the described consequences, but introduces redundant mechanisms

of navigation.

<br/> 

</p><p><b>Pattern Name:</b> Accelerated Hybrid Collection.

</p><p><b>Variant of: </b>Hybrid Index.

</p><p><b>Problem:</b> Consider the same problem defined for the Hybrid Collection,

but also assume that from each member, users want to have a fast access

to the collection overview (or outline) and to each members, without accessing

a different page every time.

</p><p><b>Solution:</b> Define a structure very similar to the Hybrid Collection,

but i) the center stores only the member identifiers with the corresponding

links to each member; and ii) the center is not a separate page but it

is visually included in each member of the collection. Such an &#34;embedded&#34;

center visually appears as a list of links - or links plus collection members

identifiers - in a left-side frame.

</p><p><b>Discussion:</b> As the Accelerated Index, this design solution involves

structure, navigation, content and presentation, and differs from the Hybrid

Collection for presentation aspects, (i.e., for the way of presenting the

center, and from the absence of real links from the center to the members

and vice versa). Advantages and disadvantages are similar to the ones of

the Accelerated Index. We do not propose here the placement of center links

on bottom and top of the pages since we suggest to include here the links

to the previous and next member (and we want to avoid an access of links

in these areas).

<br/> 

</p><p>The following pattern concerns navigation within nested collections,

i.e., collections whose member are collections in turn. Nested collections,

very typical of museum Web sites, are ways to express the conceptual organization

of contents in classes and sub-classes (for example, the collection of

all paintings in a museum can be organized by artist, physical allocation,

movement, etc.) according to subjective or objective criteria. Navigation

within nested collections can be inefficient and disorienting, especially

if the depth of nesting is high. The following pattern represent a typical

solution of our inspected Web sites to reduce such problems.

<br/> 

</p><p><b>Pattern Name</b>: Top Level Ancestors.

</p><p><b>Problem</b>: Improve efficiency of navigation within a deeply nested

structure of collections, providing users with easy understandable mechanisms

to access alternative branches of a set of nested collections hierarchy.

</p><p><b>Solution</b>: Define a link from any element of a nested collection

to each member of the first level collection, i.e. to each son page of

the root of the hierarchy induced by the nesting structure.

</p><p><b>Discussion:</b> Within nested collections, the various styles of

navigation within a single collecting, induced by the index and guided

tour patterns, are integrated with navigation across collections at different

levels. The basic movements is one-step downwards and one-step upwards,

i.e., from the center of a collection to the center of the collection at

the previous or the next level. Downwards step-by-step navigation can be

acceptable when a user needs to explore &#34;horizontally&#34;, in a breadth-first

style, the various branches of the hierarchy; it can be extremely inefficient

when the users proceeds &#34;vertically&#34; (depth-first style): once they get

the bottom level and want to access alternative branches in the nested

structure, moving upwards step by step can be extremely slow. Most Web

sites provide a &#34;go-home&#34; facility which allows users return to the home

page, that is usually the center of the top-level index where all the possible

top-level branches are listed. A more efficient solution, proposed by this

pattern and discovered in many Web sites we have inspected, is make visible

and available at any time during the navigation within a nested structure,

the list of all top level branches, and to offer the user the possibility

of accessing each of them directly. From a topological perspective, in

the hierarchical relationship induced by the nesting structure, these elements

are, directly or indirectly, the oldest ancestors of any element in the

hierarchy - hence the source of the pattern name.

<a name="sec4"></a><b>4. Pattern Analysis of Museum Web Sites</b></h3>

Our design patterns have been &#34;discovered&#34; by intensively visiting and

analysing the museums Web sites described in Table 1. For each discovered

pattern, we have studied its frequency and distribution. This section will

report a portion of these statistical results, concerning the patterns

(described in Section 3) in 11 of the 32 inspected sites.

<p>The exploration of each Web museums has been carried out in exhaustive

way, visiting all nodes and traversing all links (except to a few complex

Web site marked by &#34;*&#34;, where we visited a significant portion of the site,

omitting some sections).

</p><p>Table 2 contains information related to the use of indexes. The term

&#34;level&#34; denote the level of nesting of a given index in the hierarchy induced

by the top-level nested collection (the one rooted at the home page). For

example, an index which is not member of any other index has level 0 (this

is also called &#34;top-level index&#34;); an index which is member of an index

at level 0 has level 1, and so on. The dimension is the number of members

of an index. Table 2 reports the dimensions of the indexes at each level where

they appear.

</p><p>Sometime index members are grouped in subgroups; in other terms, this

means that the index collection merges members of several collections.

In such a case, the dimension is expressed in terms of a sum, where each

addendum is the number of elements of a subgroup.

</p><p>The symbol &#34;/&#34; is used to list the different dimensions of different

indexes at the specified level (for example: 3/4/6 means: &#34;at this level,

there are three indexes, with 3, 4, and 6 members respectively).

</p><p>The symbol &#34;&gt;&#34; is used when the dimensions are very variable, so that

there are several indexes having an higher number of members with respect

to the specified number.

</p><p>Two main results can be derived from Table 2:

</p><ul>

<li>

indexes are intensively used in all sites (and therefore can be surely

considered a mile-stone concepts in Web site) but index structure is very

variable both even within the same site. Only in 9% of indexes have a regular

shape, i.e., the number of members in indexes is well-balanced (almost

uniform) at any level (see for example Odyssey Online).</li>

</ul>



<ul>

<li>

54% of Web sites have indexes with subgroups, and these are typically used

at levels 0 and 1; this may suggest that to capture explicitly, in a new

design pattern, the concept of subgroup.</li>

</ul>

<p><br/>

</p><p>Tables 3, 4, and 5 report some results concerning guided tours and hybrid

collections, and highlight that, on the contrary of indexes, guided tours

are not employed in every Web site.

</p><p>Table 3 shows the sites in which pure guided tours or different variants

of guided tours occur. The frequency of use of guided tours is 63% of sites

have at least one guided tour (pure or variant). The variant Hybrid Collection

is used in 45% of sites.

</p><p>Table 4 concerns pure guided tours only. An analysis of Table 4 shows

that only 36% of our inspected sites uses pure guided tours. We have also

observed that these are mainly used to browse among pages related to artists

or to works in art collections. In one case - Monet Exhibit - two guided

tours have a quiz-like interactive behaviour: at any member page, there

is a question on the page subject and going-next is allowed only if the

user has answered the question correctly.

</p><p>Table 5 discusses how the Hybrid Collection pattern occurs at the various

levels, and presents their dimension.

</p><p>An analysis of the Tables 4 and 5 shows that the guided tour dimension

is very variable; furthermore, it points out that many tours are in a sense

incorrect, in that they have only next links, to move forwards, but no

previous link: the only way to traverse backwards the sequence of guided

tour members is by using the &#34;back&#34; command provided by the browser.

<a name="sec5"></a><b>5. Conclusions</b></h3>

One of the main goals of our research in the last ten years has been to

support the process of developing hypermedia application (off-line and,

more recently, on-line, mostly in the art domain) from the requirement

analysis phase to implementation and testing. This paper reports the first

results of a new branch of research in this mainstream, which aims at supporting

the dissemination and reuse of design experience in museum hypermedia.

This can be achieved by defining and distributing an evolving catalogue

of design patterns. We believe that such a catalogue can represent a powerful

conceptual tool to significantly improve the quality/cost rate of developing

cultural hypermedia, in arts as well as in other domains, and may lead

to a useful high-quality standardization of these products.

<p>We are planning to continue the work reported in this paper in a number

of directions:

</p><ul>

<li>

to discover new patterns, addressing more intensively content and presentation

aspects (presentation, multimedia and implementation patterns);</li>

</ul>



<ul>

<li>

to check the frequency and the distribution of the discovered patterns

by means of an exploration of other Web sites, in related areas;</li>

</ul>



<ul>

<li>

to compare the discovered patterns of museums Web sites with patterns of

museums hypermedia on CD-ROM;</li>

</ul>



<ul>

<li>

to refine and evaluate the quality of our patterns with respect to user

requirements, in order to identify which patterns are more appropriate

in which situations of use. To address this problem, we are designing a

set of experiments of pattern validation which will involve samples of

real users, with different profiles and different goals.</li>
