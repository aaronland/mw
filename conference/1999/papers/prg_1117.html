</p><h3>Distributing a Licensed Resource to Schools and Libraries</h3>



<b><a href="../../bios/au_4465.html">Sonja Staum-Kuniej</a></b>, Herron School of Art Library, USA<p>





Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)-University Libraries in partnership with the Art Museum Image Consortium (AMICO) has undertaken a unique demonstration project to serve as an AMICO University Subscriber/Distributor to the local Indianapolis K-12 Public Schools and Libraries. This collaborative model between a museum image consortium and an academic library will serve multi-use educational needs of the K-12 schools, public libraries, and museums throughout the greater Indianapolis area by way of implementation of the most efficient and appropriate technologies currently available.</p><p> 



University Libraries received a $290,000 National Leadership Grant from the Federal Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) to provide access to the AMICO Image Library Database for the greater Indianapolis Area K-12 Schools and general public.  The IMLS is a federal agency that fosters innovation, leadership and a lifetime of learning by supporting museums and libraries. The institute&#39;s library programs help libraries use new technologies to identify, preserve and share library and information resources across institutional, local and state boundaries.  Our joint project provides an unparalleled mechanism to test various delivery models of this vast AMICO Image Database to an urban K-12 Educational Community (Indianapolis) as well as life-long learners throughout regional public libraries.  This paper will outline the project, report on progress to date, plans for related curriculum development, experiences in crafting user licenses for the school and library communities, and the technical challenges of delivering large multimedia databases. 





</p><h3>THE PROJECT</h3>



<h4>General Description</h4>



The life of the project will run from October 1998 through September 2000. University Libraries and the AMICO Consortium proposed to provide models to support the delivery of the AMICO image library over the Internet to the K-12 community as well as the greater Indianapolis Area for use in art education and other related curriculums.  It is anticipated that access to the AMICO Image Library will be through IP filter, password, and/or authentication. This multi-purpose project will test pre-designed models of support/delivery of the image library currently under development.  The primary goals of the project are to define  &#34;Best Practices&#34; regarding delivery and licensing models as well as to provide value-added content to the K-12 educational curriculum.  A major outcome of the project is the development of curriculum to be added to the AMICO image library and available to the K-12 educational communities.<p>



The University Library/AMICO Image Library demonstration project objectives include:



</p><ul>

	<li>Demonstrating how a local university library can collaborate with communities to provide access to emerging technologies and demanding networked services to regional schools and public libraries.<p>

	</p></li><li>Exploring the viability of cost sharing among regional institutions to provide licensed access to resources that might otherwise be beyond the reach of some local institutions.<p>

	</p></li><li>Building on local input to add value to resources acquired on license and to create special added value that will serve local needs. Evaluating the contributions made by the users as well as the service provider in this model.<p>

	</p></li><li>Documenting generalized practices and products of a model program of cooperation between libraries, schools and museum with emphasis on how the community is served, technology is used, or education is enhanced. 

</li></ul>



The IMLS grant project activities are defined by four distinct phases of implementation and three models of delivery.  Prior to the writing and award of the grant, a pre-planning phase existed which included a focus group of local area educators.  The purpose of the focus group was to explore the Indianapolis area Educators&#39; interest in our proposed project as well as seek consultation on the proposed project objectives and goals (March 19,1998). We are confident that this pre-planning focus group was critical to the success of the funding of the project as it provided the specific guidance, information needs, contacts to create an advisory board, defined user expectations, level of local interest, and desires of the area educators.  Without taking this first step, we would probably not have had enough of the &#34;big picture&#34; we needed to complete a successful proposal or a successful project. The minutes of the focus group meeting are found in the Appendix.<p>



Throughout the four phases of the project mentioned above, University Libraries will provide the technical support needed to deliver the AMICO Image Library in three discrete intensity levels, Access Models I - III.  Access Model I involves a high level of interaction and supporting resources from the Project Director and grantees to five select schools.  The selection criteria for this model is based on the technology level of the proposed school as well as the ability to follow through on the project.  Model II is a middle intensity level in which the Project Director serves as project consultant to the educators involved.  In Access Model II the educators are provided stock curriculum developed during the Access Model I implementation.  Access Model III provides minimal support and the AMICO image library is available for general use and life long learners through the public libraries.  Model III runs the life of the grant.   An analysis will be completed at the end of the two-year project to determine the most desired support model needed to facilitate the use of the AMICO Image Library in the K-12 educational communities.</p><p>



Current collaborative initiatives exist within the Indianapolis area libraries among all types of libraries, public and private, that enable the distribution of the AMICO database. An example is the statewide INSPIRE (INdiana SPectrum of Information REsources) project which provides a full range of commercial databases that support educational, cultural, personal, and economic interest of Indiana residents from homes, offices, libraries, schools, and businesses free of charge to those who have internet access.  The access mechanisms for Access Model III (general use/life long learners) will &#34;piggy-back&#34; on the structures, both technical and political which exist for the INSPIRE project.</p><p>





University Libraries will provide the resources, support, and methods to deliver the AMICO Image Library over the Internet to the greater Indianapolis area K-12 educational communities. Due to a large number of IP addresses for the area schools and public libraries we are in the process of designing a referred URL process. One access method by the area educators to the AMICO Image Library distributor/server will be handled through a referred URL from IMCPL and/or IUPUI to the RLG AMICO distributor.  All designated users will come into IUPUI and/or IMCPL and be referred out to RLG in the way of an IP address that serves as an authentication site.  As previously mentioned, mechanisms currently exist via the INSPIRE Project which allow the Indianapolis Marion County Public Library to serve as such a gateway for the authentication and access to the AMICO Image Library for the area educators and life long learners.  We are in the process of establishing similar access avenues at IUPUI.</p><p> 



To briefly summarize the broader project goals, project grantees have committed to develop access models as well as the means to test the proposed distribution mechanism; propose and test license agreements; and demonstrate use and application of the image library in the K-12 classroom.  The grant will provide curriculum development and the structure through mini-grants to educators to develop model lesson plans/curriculum around the AMICO Library.  Teacher institutes will be held to facilitate training and use of the AMICO Image Library in the classroom and mechanisms to share experiences, issues, and concerns will be implemented.  To date both internal and external moderated electronic discussion lists have been established for educators to discuss and share model lesson plans and web classes, educational experiences, applications, uses, and knowledge of the Image Library.  





</p><h3>THE PROJECT PARTICIPANTS:</h3>



The primary participants of this demonstration project include IUPUI University Libraries; and the Art Museum Image Consortium (AMICO). The designated users of the project are those K-12 Educational and the Public Library Communities of the greater Indianapolis area or nine contiguous counties.  



<h4>Primary Participants</h4>



<h4>University Library at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis </h4>

University Libraries&#39; strong commitment to technology and community partnerships is reflected in the special technical and instructional initiatives that it supports.  As the primary participant in the project, University Libraries is one of the most technologically sophisticated academic libraries in the country (<a href="http://www-lib.iupui.edu/">http://www-lib.iupui.edu</a>).  This technically advanced library offers an infrastructure to faculty and students, which provides transparent and integrated access to electronic resources via the Internet as well as digital initiatives for instruction and publication.  University Libraries was well positioned to serve as a distributor of the AMICO Image Library. University Libraries is currently engaged in ongoing collaborations with Indianapolis area organizations; established delivery/licensing mechanisms through the countywide library system such as the INSPIRE project previously referred to; and, maintains a state-of-the-art technology infrastructure within the University Libraries system. 



<h4>Art Museum Image Consortium (AMICO)</h4>

AMICO  (<a href="http://www.amico.net/">http://www.amico.net</a>) is a non-profit consortium consisting of 26 of the largest art museums in North America. Their primary mission is to enable educational access to multimedia documentation of art.  This consortium provides a unique and growing resource numbering approximately 20,000 digital images in 1998 and growing rapidly. AMICO members are consciously exploring new social and economic models for intellectual property and delivery of their image library.  It is expected that this experiment in metropolitan-area-wide delivery involving Universities, schools and public libraries in collaboration with AMICO will serve as a potential model for nationwide access to the resource.

<h4>Greater Indianapolis Area Educational Communities</h4>



<h4>K-12 Schools</h4>

The Greater Indianapolis Area Schools are defined as those schools, public and private, that reside in the nine county central Indiana area. Participating schools will access the AMICO Image library for use in the multi-disciplined based K-12 educational communities.  The central Indiana student population totals over 160,000 students.  The Public Schools alone have a total enrollment of over 131,625; Private school enrollment exceeds 29,928 students.  The Indianapolis schools are currently well networked and are implementing digital imagery into their instructional environment(s).  It was felt that this project would enhance technical applications in place by providing models for greater distribution and application of this technology into the classroom as well as facilitate the critical assessment and evaluation of the use(s) of educational access to multi-media documentation of art. 



<h4>Central Indiana Libraries and Current Partnerships</h4>

The libraries of central Indiana have a special collaborative relationship that has been developed throughout the past several years and includes public and private libraries of all types.  These initiatives have established a successful precedence for cooperative ventures such as the IUPUI/AMICO project.  In addition to regional collaborations, the area libraries are also part of a State wide initiative, the INCOLSA INSPIRE Project mentioned earlier.  The goal of the Indianapolis Marion County Public Library System (IMCPL) and the INSPIRE project is to provide the residents of Indiana access to electronic information resources through content-rich, full-text, commercially available databases.  The Inspire Project has established methods to IP filter and authenticate all libraries in Marion County and the State of Indiana via the IMCPL gateway.  As mentioned earlier, this current, ongoing project will serve as an access model allowing the IUPUI/AMICO demonstration project to share current authentication initiatives within the Indianapolis community. 

	

<h4>Indianapolis Museum of Art</h4>

The Education Department at the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA, <a href="http://www.ima-art.org/">http:// www.ima-art.org</a>) hopes to access the AMICO Image Library for use as supplementary educational material.  While their Programs focus on educational activities related to paintings and objects in their permanent collection, access to auxiliary art images found in the AMICO Image library would provide value-added content enrichment to their instructional efforts. Negotiations to participate are underway.



<h3>PROJECT PHASES I - IV</h3>



<h4>PHASE I (October 1998-May 1999)</h4>



Phase I of the project runs from the granting of the project by IMLS October 1998 through May 1999.  During this phase the Advisory Boards were selected and implemented, the Project Director and support staff were hired, and general publicity initiated. Other critical activities included the selection of 5 beta sites/schools for Access Model I, planning a Mini-Grant Summer Teacher Institute, and developing guidelines for Area Educator AMICO Curriculum Development Mini-Grants (Access Model II). 



<h4>Personnel and Expertise Involved</h4>



<h4>Advisory Boards</h4>

Two Advisory Boards were established.  One board serves in the interests of the K-12 educational community and the other in the interests of the public libraries of central Indiana.  When necessary, meeting attendance overlaps from one board to another to share experiences, concerns, issues, and ensure the overall project needs are met to the best of everyone&#39;s ability. 



<h4>The K-12 Advisory Board</h4>

The K-12 Advisory Board serves pre-IMLS granting through the entire life of the award (1998 through 2000).  The IMLS IUPUI/AMICO Project Director serves as the Chair of this Advisory Board.  Flexible membership was encouraged in an effort to accommodate the changing needs of the Advisory Board members and area educators.  Board member volunteers were solicited from a variety of school districts and other educational institutions within the greater Indianapolis area.  The Advisory Board worked in collaboration with University Libraries and AMICO to select and hire the Project Director.  Forthcoming K-12 Advisory Board member activities involve participation in the selection of mini-grant recipients, and, to serve as consultants in the implementation and evaluation of the project.<p>  



As previously mentioned, a pre-grant AMICO/University Libraries Project Focus group was held with greater Indianapolis area educators March 19, 1998.  The purpose of this meeting was to determine the feasibility and level of project interest among the area educators, as well as to define the elements required to make such a project viable for the local community.  Interest among the educators present was extremely high and, we were assured that the greater Indianapolis area would be positioned to support the project in theory, and practice as well as technologically. 



</p><h4>Public Library Advisory Board</h4>

The other board constituency established was the Public Library Advisory Board.  An individual from the IMCPL Central library serves as the chair of the Public library Advisory Board.  The role of the Public Library Advisory Board is to serve as consultants on the delivery of the AMICO Image Library to community &#34;life-long learners&#34; as well as the students.



<h4>Project Team</h4>

The grant defined the key personnel required to carry out the efforts of the grant to include a Project Director, a Co-Project Director, and technical and clerical staff provided by all grantee participants based on respective resources.  The Project Director&#39;s primary responsibilities are to develop model lesson plans, co-ordinate and actively promote the project, keep tasks on target, and facilitate the implementation and evaluation of the use of the AMICO Image Database.  The responsibilities of the Co-Project Director are to assist with training and promotion of the IUPUI/AMICO IMLS project and also serve as the liaison from the AMICO University/Herron Library Testbed project. The role of the technical and clerical support staff is to provide technical expertise to the Co-Project Directors as well as needed administrative support.



<h4>Project Director </h4>

Once the Advisory Boards were in place, the next major and almost simultaneous activity was to design a position description for the Project Director and initiate the hiring process. University Libraries IMLS Team members met and drafted a Project Director position description based on the skill sets, qualifications, and requirements defined by the Area Educators at the first focus group in March 1998.  The University Libraries IMLS team met with the K-12 Advisory Board in consultation on the job description as well as the selection and interview process of candidates. The severely limited turn around time available to interview and hire the candidate combined with the extremely unique qualifications and background required of the Project Director created quite a challenge for the team. These factors were complicated as we are a large university immersed in deep and diffuse bureaucracy.  Once we had selected the final 4 candidates, it took almost two weeks to get permission to interview from IUPUI Human Resources. We had to wait to schedule interviews until we had secured the permission. When the permission was granted we were left with a window of only 3-4 days to schedule and complete the entire hire process. In an effort to expedite the process all correspondence except the actual interviews were conducted via E-mail or the telephone.



<h4>Responsibilities and Requirements of the Project Director and Hourly Staff</h4>

The Project Director is responsible for the overall management of the grant.  Their term extends the entirety of the project.  This individual is responsible for the implementation, outreach, publicity, training, usage, and evaluation of the database by area educators.  The two immediate and primary activities of the Project Director were to develop pilot curriculum modules around the AMICO Image Library for dissemination to the Access Model I recipients, and to plan the Mini-Grant Summer Teacher Institute program held for select area educators.  The Project Director also serves as chair of the K-12 Advisory Board. In consultation with the K-12 Advisory Board, the Project Director is expected to assist with mini-grant participant criteria development; promotion of the mini-grant opportunities to educators; and the selection of the mini-grant recipients.<p>



To accomplish these responsibilities and maintain the necessary credibility within the educational community, the K-12 Advisory Board felt strongly that the Project Director should possess the characteristics and skill sets listed below.



</p><ul>

	<li>The Project Director must know the Indiana Curriculum. <p>

	</p></li><li>Possess multi-discipline-based expertise.<p>

	</p></li><li>Proven competency with the Internet and technology.<p>

	</p></li><li>Excellent presentation and people skills. <p>

	</p></li><li>Proven ability to communicate well; to be a motivator and innovator; and to be creative.<p>

	</p></li><li>Preferably a K-12 educator and/or Media Specialist with recent classroom experience.<p>

	</p></li><li>Technical and clerical assistance will be needed to achieve the high level of interaction with the educators.

</li></ul>

	

<h4>Co-Project Director/ AMICO Liaison for Herron/University Library Testbed Project</h4>

The Responsibilities of the Co-Project Director for this project include:



<ul>

	<li>Liaison from the AMICO Herron/University Library Testbed project. <p>

	</p></li><li>Assist Project Director with the administration and promotion of the project<p>

	</p></li><li>Assist Project Director with training

</li></ul>



<h4>Clerical and Technical Assistance</h4>

At a minimum it was felt that it would require two half time positions at 20 hours each for the full term of the grant to assist the Project Director with related project tasks, e.g., reports, technical support, and demonstrations in the field. The Project Director will write the required job descriptions and fill the positions based on anticipated needs.  It is expected that the positions involve a technology person and a clerical support person to assist with administrative tasks.   





<h3>IMPLEMENTING THE GRANT:

Promotion, Pilot AMICO Curriculum, Mini-Grants 

and the Mini-Grant Summer Teacher Institute</h3>



<h4>Promotion</h4>

Major activities organized during Phase I by the IUPUI Project Team include the promotion and publicity of the project to the greater Indianapolis area educators through existing relevant professional organizations, literature, listservs, and networks within the Indianapolis educational and library communities.  These conveyance mediums are targeted for participation and dissemination of information regarding the project at conferences, seminars, and workshops.  All promotional materials are created in consultation with the Advisory Boards, AMICO, and University Libraries. The primary responsibility for promotion resides with the Project Directors and the IUPUI IMLS project team. Obviously, these activities are on going throughout the life of the grant.



<h4>Pilot AMICO Curriculum</h4>

One of the primary responsibilities of the Project Director in Phase I is to create pilot AMICO curriculum for distribution and use by the K-12 greater Indianapolis area educational community.  The K-12 Advisory Board will provide guidance and input for the curriculum development.   In an effort to provide relevant curriculum for the educators and maintain relevant use of the AMICO Image Library, it is required that the curriculum be aligned with the State of Indiana Proficiency Guidelines.  And finally, the grant stated that the developed curriculum must come back to the grant partners for further use and study.



<h4>Targeting Five Area School Mini-Grants for the Summer Institute</h4>

During Phase I, ten educators from five greater Indianapolis area schools will be selected based on ability, interest, and proposed use of the image library.  These individuals will work in collaboration with the Project Director in the planning of the Mini-Grant Summer Teacher Institute that will be held during Phase II, of the project, June 1999.  The selected Educators involvement will run the life of the grant proposal.



<h4>Developing Mini-Grant Criteria and Promotion</h4>

Prior to the selection and implementation of the Mini-Grants to the five select schools, the Project Director will work with the Advisory Boards and project staff to develop Mini-Grant criteria and guidelines for the selection process as well as for promotional purposes to the K-12 educational community.<p>



The purpose of these mini-grants is to support the core participants in the development of curriculum using the Image Library.  As determined during the original focus group meeting March 19, 1998, the responsibilities of mini-grant recipients include: 



</p><ul>

	<li>Attend the Summer Teachers Institute.<p>

	</p></li><li>Develop AMICO curriculum modules by August 1999<p>

	</p></li><li>Implement these modules in their Fall and Spring semesters<p>

	</p></li><li>Participate in the evaluation process<p>

	</p></li><li>Train and mentor fellow educators as to the application of the resource in instructional activities

</li></ul>

	 	

	 			

<h4>Mini-Grant Summer Teacher Institute</h4>

The Project Director, the K-12 Advisory Board and the Indiana University School of Education staff will be responsible for planning the Summer Teacher Institute that will be held June 1999.







<h3>PHASE II (June/July 1999)</h3>



<h4>Summer Teachers Institute </h4>

The primary purpose of the Mini-Grant Summer Teachers Institute is to provide training in the use of the AMICO Image Library; develop model curricula; and to share applications, experiences, and model lesson plans as they relate to the project.



<h4>Curriculum Development and the Summer Teachers Institute </h4>

Outcomes of Summer Teachers Institute will include published preliminary lesson plans shared among participants and distributed to the greater Indianapolis Educational Service Area as well as nationally through the AMICO consortium.  The seminar will be open to other interested constituencies, which might be looking towards involvement at a later date and/or interested in the technology without the mini-grant support. It is anticipated that three credit hours from the IU School of Education will be awarded upon successful completion of the Summer Teachers Institute requirements.  The details concerning the requirements and credit hours are currently being arranged.  Educators will be selected in part based on their ability to participate as well as on the quality of their proposed use of the AMICO Library.<p>



Following the Summer Institute and prior to curriculum implementation in classes during the fall 1999, the Advisory Boards will meet to review model curricula and advise on implementation.  The Public Library Advisory Board will review the project status and advise on those curriculum components which might be useful in the public library area.





</p><h3>PHASE III (Fall 99 through Spring 2000)</h3>

	

<h4>AMICO Image Library Curriculum Implementation</h4>

After the Summer Institute and based on the review and recommendations of the Advisory Boards, the curricula will then be implemented into the greater Indianapolis area pilot schools.  The Project Director is responsible for coordinating and following up on this implementation.  To facilitate the efforts of the curriculum implementation, it is anticipated that there will be continued intensive publicity (talks, demos, etc.) at professional educational and library meetings, conferences, and on-demand requests.  To support the efficiency, sustainability, publicity, and dissemination of the project, Mini-grant recipients will be responsible to mentor and train other educators.  It is anticipated that both Project Directors may be involved at this level.





<h3>PHASE IV (Summer/Fall 2000)</h3>

	

<h4>Project Evaluation</h4>

Project evaluation will occur throughout the life of the grant.  All users of the AMICO Image database will be surveyed, including public libraries, art education programs, and area educators.  Our experience at University Libraries has demonstrated that focus groups provide a great deal of valuable information, insight, and guidance in the development and implementation of a project.  As a result, focus groups will be held throughout the project to solicit input, guidance, and reflect on the project as it progresses.  These focus groups will include the various Advisory Boards and participants as well as other community input from students and users.  At the end of the grant a final report will be prepared by the Project Director to be distributed to all parties involved in the grant.

	



<h3>The Access Models Phases I-IV</h3>



The AMICO Image Library will be made available to the greater Indianapolis area schools via three different models for user support. The purpose of this approach is to develop a variety of models to test and determine the &#34;best practices&#34; for delivery of the AMICO Image Library to the K-12 environment.  

 	

<h4>Model I: High Intensity</h4>

The first model is a high-intensity delivery model and will run from February 1999 through September 2000.  This application process will determine five select Indianapolis Area K-12 schools. Mini-grants will be awarded to two educators from each school through a selection process based on individual interest, ability to follow through and technical capabilities.  Selections will be determined by the K-12 Advisory Board and the Project Director in collaboration with AMICO and the University Library.  The selected educators will be provided funding, training, and technical support. The mini-grant holders will be required to create curriculum around the AMICO Image Library in tandem with the State of Indiana Educational Curriculum Proficiencies.  In addition, the selected educators will be required to participate in the Summer Teachers Institute to be held Summer 1999. Upon completion of the workshop and curriculum requirements, the educators will receive equitable graduate credits from the IU School of Education.<p>



The Project Director will work closely with these selected schools and educators to ensure the projects success. In addition, as support and a resource to the selected schools, it is expected that the Project Director will spend a pre-determined number of hours per semester in-house working with the selected educators at their respective schools.  These efforts will assist to enforce the technology, application, and use of the AMICO Image Library database. To facilitate more effective use of project time, educators will be required to hold a minimal level of technological competency to participate in the project.  Teachers involved in the intensive work in the Spring 1999, and Summer 1999, will mentor participants in the Fall 1999.

	

</p><h4>Model II: Middle Intensity</h4>

Model II will run from Summer 1999 throughout the 1999/2000 academic year.   During this delivery Model, the Project Director will serve as a consultant to the area educators selected for the Summer Teachers Institute (June 1999).  The additional educators participating at this level will be provided procedural documentation and stock curriculum developed during the Model I implementation and will meet periodically with the Project Director for input, feedback, and assistance on the project.<p> 



Support structure resources for these educators to collaborate and network will be area educator focus groups.  These groups will be held on a periodic basis to discuss the project&#39;s uses, issues, benefits, and challenges.  These focus groups will be coordinated by the Project Director.  Electronic listservs will also be established as another mechanism for sharing use, issues, and information as it relates to the project.



</p><h4>Model III: Low Intensity</h4>

Model III will run the life of the grant. The AMICO Image Library will be available for general use throughout the Indianapolis Marion County Public Library system.  There will be little hands-on support from the Project Director at this level of intensity.<p>



The Project Partners, IUPUI and AMICO, hope to work with the museum educators in Indianapolis and the librarians in public library system to determine a means to present this opportunity to the general public while monitoring use of the AMICO Library.

	



</p><h3>Technical Considerations: Delivery Mechanisms for Access and Authentication</h3>



The project anticipates providing access to the AMICO Image database mounted on the Research Libraries Group server made available over the Internet through IP filter/password and the Indianapolis Marion County Public Library Gateway. In collaboration with the Advisory Boards, the Project Director is responsible for implementing the delivery of the AMICO Image Database to the greater Indianapolis area schools and public libraries by Summer 1999.<p>



IP filtering will be used to provide access for public libraries and the greater Indianapolis area schools. Access to the community will also be delivered through individual user authentication in Indianapolis (Marion County).  The project will use the Indianapolis Marion County Public Library (IMCPL) cards as the authentication mechanism.  IMCPL already has means in place to authenticate users over the Web.  IMCPL cards are available to anyone who lives, goes to school, or teaches in Marion County. As previously discussed proven collaborations exist within the greater Indianapolis area which provide methods for remote access from home to a variety of electronic resources.  Access to the AMICO Library will share these methods.</p><p>



An alternate delivery mechanism will be via CD-ROM technology.  Participating educators will select AMICO images needed to support model lesson plans built around the respective images.  Along with the curriculum, these images will be downloaded to CD-ROMs for distribution to other area educators. This process will enable wider distribution and sharing of the project to other area educators.  In addition, it will avoid bandwidth and Internet issues and provide educators greater instructional flexibility within their respective classroom.  The resources to accomplish this will be provided through in-kind supplies and equipment provided by the Indianapolis Public School System and other area schools. Dependent upon an individual school&#39;s technological capabilities, selected AMICO Library images may be downloaded to a participating school&#39;s server for designated use in AMICO/University Library IMLS grant project.



</p><h4>Fee Structure</h4>

The AMICO Consortium proposed the following fee structure for license to the AMICO Library: One cent charged per public library card holder; ten cents per K-12 student; and twenty-five cents per University level student. These license fees will be waived in the 1998/1999 year due to the AMICO University Testbed status of University Libraries. A nominal fee will be requested for 1999/2000.  It is expected that RLG will charge at its prevailing rates for levels of use associated with the Indianapolis region during the project.



<h4>License Contracts, Control, and Security of Images</h4>

As stipulated in the grant, all schools and libraries are responsible for providing students and faculty with an understanding of the users and uses allowed under the terms of the license.  One of the major results of this two-year demonstration project is the development of adequate and appropriate license models, which can be offered to the K-12 and public library communities.  At the most recent Advisory Boards meeting held January 15, 1999, AMICO presented licensing models to the board for review and feedback from the educational communities concerned. At the time of the writing of this paper, both boards were reviewing the language in the AMICO contracts.  Immediate concerns expressed by the K-12 communities included the proposed inability to manipulate the images for educational purposes.  The K-12 Advisory Board members felt strongly that this imposed restriction limited the implementation and creativity for use in instructional endeavors.  The K-12 Board members believed the educators would want the students to be able to manipulate the images.  In addition, educators did not anticipate the same level of difficulty monitoring the use of the images, which predicated AMICO&#39;s proposed terms for the K-12 community.  The issues expressed by the Public Library constituency involved the proposed inability to download the images at all.  It was felt that such limitations would impede the full application of the image library for life long learners to provide presentations to community organizations as well as K-12 students to complete assignments. It was suggested that such limitations might actually compromise some of the research objectives of the grant.  Discussions related to what the designated users believe is viable and to what will provide adequate licensing agreement are ongoing.  



		

<h3>EVALUATION EFFORTS AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</h3>



The evaluation efforts will scrutinize pre-determined research objectives set forth by the AMICO consortium and agreed upon by AMICO and University Libraries.  As of this writing, evaluation mechanisms are under development and not fully established.  When hired, the Project Director will work quickly with the Advisory Boards to create and enact evaluation models and methods. It is expected that these efforts will be ongoing throughout the life of the grant.  The research objectives to be evaluated include:	

	

<ul>

	<li>Identify who uses the AMICO Image Library (Digital Library) and why? Include an assessment tool for the use of the AMICO Image Library to the benefit of learning.<p>

	</p></li><li>Increase understanding of user needs for teaching and research use of the AMICO Image Library (Digital Libraries) and the systems architectures needed to support them.<p>

	</p></li><li>Establish if the license terms proposed by the AMICO consortium are acceptable.<p>

	</p></li><li>Design means for user feedback and dialogue with AMICO members, University Library participants, and Indianapolis Area Educators. 

</li></ul>



	

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>



This IMLS demonstration project provides a unique opportunity to develop and test a variety of image database delivery/access mechanisms and a range of inter-institutional collaborations between public libraries, local museums, regional public and private schools, universities, and a consortium of museums.  It will address, test, and determine distribution issues related to the technology, licensing, delivery, and multiple uses, of a major digital image library within the K-12 and public library environments.<p> 



The IMLS project meets the growing need within the educational community to harness the benefits of technology while providing content-rich curriculum to the K-12 educational community.  It enriches instructional contributions to the community as well as those activities that relate to education. It offers creative solutions to delivering information over the web to the educational community and serves a leadership role for other organizations to emulate.  Finally, it provides explicit attention to development of technology/curriculum models and guidelines that will be readily disseminated and applicable to other urban communities nationwide. Our major contributions will also include an evaluation of the demonstrated uses of the application of the AMICO library within the K-12 educational community.  To some degree the sustainability will be determined through the application and evaluation of the project.  However, mechanisms are currently in place within the greater Indianapolis area to continue this project well beyond the life of the IMLS grant.</p><p> 



Some elements which contributed to the successful granting of the project include: the pre-grant focus group held March 19, 1998, to determine area educators interests, needs, and to establish the needed Advisory Boards for the project; a developed technological environment within Indianapolis area educational communities; an initial Advisory Board meeting to review Project Director applications, the role of the Board, and to introduce AMICO; and the universal enthusiasm and faith in the project among all participants.

<b>Minutes</b>:</p><p>



IUPUI University Libraries&#39; current Grant with AMICO as a University Testbed was described.</p><p>



<b>Purpose</b></p><p>



The purpose of the proposed Grant between IUPUI University Libraries and AMICO is to provide digital images access from AMICO to the greater Indianapolis and nearby school districts and community, for the use in their Art Education and other various curriculums.  </p><p>



<b>Usage</b></p><p>



The AMICO images may be used by students to create portfolios, or manipulate them for assignment purposes.  There were some questions about whether or not students could publish the images on their Web pages, but it was assumed this would qualify as an electronic portfolio.  No one would be allowed to reproduce the images for sale.  The copyright restraints from AMICO are liberal in the ways students could use these images.  Many of the educators expressed concerns about the copyright guidelines and would be thankful to have a database they knew was accessible. This year, 20,000 images are available, and it is expected that AMICO will double that in their first full year.  In the first 5 years AMICO hopes to expand that to 250,000 images.</p><p>





<b>Time Frame</b></p><p>



 The grant period is 2 years.  General time table:</p><p>



April 17, 1998 - - Grant application must be postmarked by this day<br/>

September, 1998 - - Grant awarded<br/>

January, 1999 - - latest date for project director to start working<br/>

Summer, 1999 - - summer institute?<br/>

Fall of 1999 - - beginning to use database as part of the curriculum.</p><p>





After the period of two years is over, and if the image database service is being used, then it is assumed that we will find a way to make the database available indefinitely.</p><p>





<b>Fees and Licensing</b></p><p>



During the Grant period there will not be a fee for educators.  IUPUI will work with AMICO on this issue.</p><p>



AMICO&#39;s current fee structure is:</p><p>



One cent per Public Library card-holder;<br/>

Ten cents per K-12 student;<br/>

and Twenty-five cents per student at the University.</p><p>





It was suggested that there might be a way to write this into the proposal.</p><p>



<b>Technology</b></p><p>



</p><ul>

	<li>Schools should have the ability to download the database onto a server.<p>  

	</p></li><li>Maybe a small part of the training would include discovering what the schools have by way of space to download the images and, if there server is out of space, what could be done to ensure this isn&#39;t a problem.  Maybe the University Library may have server space to give them?

</li></ul>



<b>Control and Security Issues</b>



<ul>

	<li>Authorization through IMCPL for Marion County only.<p>

	</p></li><li>Techs at schools could devise there own safety measures.<p>

	</p></li><li>Accessibility also through public libraries?<p>

	</p></li><li>If beyond Marion County, some kind of authentication security method would have to be in place.

</li></ul>



<b>Project Director</b><p>



Implement a Project Director to be responsible for the implementation of the database by use of outreach, publicity and to chair an advisory group.</p><p>



a. Applicants should be nominated and hired though a steering committee</p><p>

b. This person should be required to:



</p><ol>

	<li>know the Indiana curriculum, not strictly an art person;<p>

	</p></li><li>be an expert on internet and the technology it would take to implement the image database;<p>

	</p></li><li>possess good PR skills, communication skill, oral and written, and be a good motivator;<p>

	</p></li><li>willing and able to be hands-on as well as oversee planning development;<p>

	</p></li><li>be creative and innovative;<p>

	</p></li><li>and it is preferred that this person be a K-12 educator who has recently been involved in the schools or class room.

</li></ol>



c. It was suggested that this person could be a grad-student, retiree, doctoral candidate, or someone in between jobs, however the group agreed that an experienced teacher might work best with the K-12 environment, possibly a library media specialist.<p>





d. An educator who would be willing to leave the classroom may expect a salary ranging from 55,000 to 60,000 with University benefits, although they may accept less if they consider the position as a possibility for professional development.</p><p>





e. The group agreed that a project director, with support, would be able to successfully implement the plan, within the given time period, in approximately 10 schools.  The school districts are ready and willing to implement this type of technological aid.</p><p>





<b>Curriculum Building, Implementation &amp; Participation</b></p><p>



The State of Indiana already has a curriculum for the school districts.  The need then is to know how to incorporate these images into the existing curriculum.</p><p>



</p><ul>

	<li>The best way to implement the database usage may be a two-tiered program: a specific intensive training for 20 or 30 individuals; and a general program from support purposes.<p>

	</p></li><li>In one program, it would be necessary to focus on a small group from selected schools, perhaps 10.  Another approach could be to have at least 2 or 3 people from each school to participate in an intense Workshop or Institute.  The program director would spend a certain amount of hours per semester (20?) in-house at the schools working with the selected educators at their respective schools to enforce what has been learned.  The idea is to train these teachers so that they can hold there own training sessions at the school.  This would be done during school time. <p>

	</p></li><li>Participating teachers should already have a working knowledge of the technology to avoid using time to teach basics.<p>

	</p></li><li>The second program could include participation though various Workshops and Summer Institutes to various interested educators.<p>

	</p></li><li>Graduate students from the School of Education and/or Herron School of Art Education could be used for support.<p>

	</p></li><li>Participation could be used as credits/hours for continuing education.  However, teachers will need more incentive beyond credit hours to actively participate in the database training.  For us to compete, we would need to offer cash, equipment, or travel incentives as well as credit hours.<p>

	</p></li><li>There may be participation for developing text to augment the images to store on CD&#39;s and then use in the classroom. Maybe pay $100 per unit.<p>

	</p></li><li>CD-ROM&#39;s could be used as a mechanism for distribution. Supplying CD burners may be a good incentive for participation.<p>

	</p></li><li>Incentives probably should be tailored to the needs of the particular schools. 

</li></ul>



<b>Matching</b><p>



The Grant requires matching dollar for dollar in kind if the amount goes over $250,000.</p><p>



<b>Budget Notes</b>:</p><p>



</p><ul>

	<li>Teacher substitute pay - $50 - $85/day.<p>

	</p></li><li>Costs of equipment and technology - servers and space? (University in-kind?)<p>

	</p></li><li>Find other creative ways to support matching by way of the school contributions.<p>

	</p></li><li>Schools are willing to contribute in-kind cost information.

</li></ul>



<b>Advisory Board</b><p>



Names were solicited for an advisory board whose duties would include review of applicants for the project director position, and teacher grants.  Volunteers include:</p><p>
