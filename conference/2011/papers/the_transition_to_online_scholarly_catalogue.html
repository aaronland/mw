<h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
<p class="AbstractText">The scholarly catalogue has long been a critical part
    of a museum&#39;s mission, providing authoritative information about collection
    objects for scholars, students, and the general public. Often based on years of
    painstaking research and richly illustrated, print catalogues form one of the
    building blocks of art history. The catalogue&#39;s print form, however, is
    arguably the very component that prevents it from realizing even greater
    potential. High cost and relatively small print runs limit its accessibility,
    and printed books cannot easily change to reflect new acquisitions or new
    scholarly knowledge. While the online environment holds much promise for making
    collection catalogues more current, interactive, and widely available, museums
    still face significant financial and organizational challenges in making the
    transition online. This paper describes the challenges and successes of nine
    institutions as they step through a project to deliver a scholarly catalogue to
  their online environment.</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Getty Foundation is currently funding the Online
          Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI), a five-year initiative to explore the
          potential for scholarly collection catalogues in an online environment,
          determine the institutional resources needed, and support the creation of
          replicable models: specifically, whether the online delivery of scholarly
          catalogues can:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Offer a more dynamic relationship between a
            catalogue&#39;s research, publication, and re-publication phases</li>
          <li>Directly link a wide array of primary and
            secondary resources to the record of a work of art, (resources ranging from
            archival and conservation documentation to audio and video interviews)</li>
          <li>Make greater use of comparative images</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Eight museums have received support: SFMOMA, Art Institute
          of Chicago, Seattle Art Museum, Tate, Walker Arts Center, the Freer Sackler
          Gallery, LACMA, and the National Gallery have completed planning and are now
          entering the implementation phase. Specifics can be found on the Getty’s
          website
          (<a href="http://www.getty.edu/foundation/funding/access/current/osci_fact_sheet.html">http://www.getty.edu/foundation/funding/access/current/osci_fact_sheet.html</a>).</p>
        <p>There may be some existing models within the museum
          environment that institutions can draw upon as a starting point. For example,
          exhibition modules are discrete resources reflecting not only a physical
          installation but also some degree of scholarship around it and may be in
          default of an exhibition catalogue. However, the major difference is that the
          focus of these exhibition modules is towards a broad audience and have a PR
          incentive; true scholarly work is not the primary focus.</p>
        <h2>What’s the Big Deal?  </h2>
        <p>There’s no question that museums are attuned to the process
          of bringing much of their (traditionally printed) content to the online
          environment – collections, curricula, exhibitions, etc. – so the
          principle is well established. So, how hard can it be to take a
          well-established scholarly editorial process that results in a print
          publication and make it available on the Web? Do the three goals that the
          Foundation’s initiative seeks to address really represent a transition? As the
          project participants are finding out, things are never that easy, for a number
          of reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Paradigm Shift</li>
          <li>Opportunity</li>
          <li>Cost</li>
          <li>Digital Rights and Permissions</li>
          <li>Published or Data Driven?</li>
          <li>Maintenance &amp; Support</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Paradigm Shift</h3>
        <p>What may be obvious to those of us who work in “new media”
          and Web departments in museums may not be obvious to scholars, curators and
          conservators. The opportunities that arise from transitioning to a scholarly
          catalogue online cover creating a rich and engaging digital resource. The
          tradition of a printed volume that has that ‘thump factor’ when it is dropped
          on a desktop as a manifestation of one’s work is significant. Curators are
          challenged with how an online work that may not be obvious as a discrete
          endeavour translates to their scholarly world. How do they refer to it in their
          resume? How do they send a comp copy to a fellow curator or Trustee? How does
          one gauge the acceptance of the publication within the curatorial community
          when ‘copies sold’ is no longer a measure? How do online publications support
          the road to tenure? If it can be updated when a re-attribution occurs, how do
          they know when the publication is finished? Is it ever finished? There are
          great benefits to an online catalogue, but they rely on taking advantage of the
          opportunities that the new medium provides; it requires making the editorial
          process easy; fitting this system into the existing architecture; having the
          appropriate resources to support it; and ensuring that comprehensive access is
          planned for through services like Google Scholar and World Cat.</p>
        <p>The issue of curatorial buy-in is critical. One of the
          catalysts for OSCI was a meeting of the Association of Art Museum
          Curators in 2008, where this subject was discussed, but initiating the
          conversation within an institution outside of this project may present a
          challenge because it does represent a paradigm shift. What makes it a challenge
          is communicating its value, because the measures of success that curators have
          traditionally used are no longer there. What does success look like? What
          academic needs can this initiative service? What is the compelling reason to
          transition? The issue of transitioning to an online catalogue is part of the
          broader issue of museums coming to terms with what it means to be a cultural
          organization in the 21st Century, elegantly summed up in the 2010 Horizon
          Report, Museum Edition:</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">…the future of the museum may be
          rooted in the buildings they occupy but it will address audiences across the
          world - a place where people across the world will have a conversation. Those institutions
          which take up this notion fastest and furthest will be the ones which have the
          authority in the future. … the growing challenge is to ... encourage curatorial
          teams to work in the online world as much as they do in the galleries. <br/>
         <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> (Johnson<i>, 2010)</i></span></p>
        <h3>Opportunity</h3>
        <p>Obviously an institution could simply choose to use its
          existing print production process, stop at the point of transmittal to the
          press, and post a PDF version of the catalogue to the website. This raises
          issues of accessibility and acceptance. How will an audience consume the
          catalogue? How will they find it? How will they use a PDF? While search engines
          are improving the ways they index PDFs, it is a constraining format, and there
          is little added value beyond the ability to search, and copy and paste the text
          electronically. However, the opportunity presented by transitioning to an
          online version is to create a much more engaging, useful, usable and citable
          version of its predecessor. To put it bluntly, why do it if there’s no added
          value? What does the Web environment offer that makes online catalogues more
          useful? How are researchers going to use them? What tools can be added to
          assist the scholar and the scholarly research process? It is at this point that
          an online scholarly catalogue becomes a much bigger deal, because to support
          this “version 2.0” requires revisiting the entire editorial and production
          process and identifying the new skills and tools that are required to support
          it. Furthermore, there is a greater expectation that the catalogue itself
          becomes less a snapshot in time, but much more a dynamic document that can
          reflect the institution’s scholarly research, and that of the field.</p>
        <p>The writing and editorial process for a printed catalogue is
          well established and (relatively) simple. It is likely based on the exchange of
          a word processing document between editor and author until it is final, at
          which point it goes to a layout process and to press. The complexities that an
          online catalogue adds, assuming one takes advantage of the opportunities
          offered in the online world, can greatly increase the production effort.
          Providing front-end functionality such as bibliographic references that can
          pop-up, tombstone metrics that can be converted on the fly, and metadata that
          can be added to improve discoverability all require additional staff expertise
          and a mechanism to manage and create the product. All this immediately
          introduces additional production complexity.</p>
        <p>Other opportunities exist in this medium which don’t exist in
          the print world – opportunities that dovetail into the larger online
          architecture that exists for an institution. For example, by including a
          ready-formatted citation within the publication, the institution can directly
          track citations to it. Opportunities like this hopefully add to the argument for
          securing curatorial support.</p>
        <h3>Cost</h3>
        <p>There is a belief that taking something that was once
          printed or physical and making it digital somehow eliminates much of the cost.
          This belief is pervasive at the museum executive level but is certainly not the
          case when transitioning to an online catalogue. Certainly, removing the print
          piece from the process would eliminate printing costs, but it does not
          eliminate the costs of writing, editing, photography/imaging, rights and
          graphic design. Transitioning to online adds additional costs that are not
          applicable to print and may include one or all of these: software programming,
          multimedia authoring, interaction/web design, and database administration. Cost
          is a significant factor for an institution, and this transition should not be
          taken on with cost-reduction as a key driver. Cost reductions may not be seen
          until processes and architectures are properly in place and an ongoing program
          of digital publishing is established.</p>
        <h3>Rights</h3>
        <p>While an institution may own the rights to its catalogue
          images, comparative images present a significant problem. A lending institution
          may be perfectly fine licensing image use for print publication: it is defined
          in scope, controlled in presentation and distribution, and attributable. In the
          online world, these constraints and controls do not apply. Most institutions
          have not yet come to terms with something that does not have a specific print
          run, a licensing model where the number of people viewing their image is
          (largely) directly related to their fee, and where an additional print run
          means additional licensing fees. In the online world, to use another
          institution’s images increasingly requires a term fee - Web rights for 5 years,
          for example - but this is unsustainable as it likely requires a re-editing
          process at the end of the term or degrades the product. Indefinite online
          rights are unusual and/or expensive.</p>
        <h3>Published or Data Driven?</h3>
        <p>Printed catalogues may be pump-primed with the output from a
          database, but that is where dynamic data’s role stops: the printed catalogue
          represents a snapshot in time of the tombstone information of the works
          contained in it. Any institution with an online collections presence is likely
          using some kind of collections management system with an application (at the very
          least, some kind of Web publishing tool) to deploy the content to their
          website, so the opportunity exists to use that mechanism to publish the
          catalogue. The question then becomes: should the catalogue be published as a
          snapshot like its predecessor, or presented dynamically directly from data?
          Either option is possible, so, technology architecture aside, it becomes a
          policy or curatorial decision. To deliver dynamically presents the opportunity
          to make updates in real time, but likely the scholarly prose refers to the
          tombstone information, so there is a danger of introducing inconsistencies into
          the catalogue unless the institution commits to ensuring that any
          re-attributions, for example, are mirrored in the text.  A crucial factor in the decision-making
          process of transitioning online is the question of update frequency. It has a
          substantial impact not only on production methodology and architecture but also
          on ongoing support of the catalogue post launch.</p>
        <h3>Maintenance &amp; Support</h3>
        <p>A traditional print catalogue is printed and distributed.
          With the exception of storing inventory and ordering another print run when
          stocks are low, there isn&#39;t much else that is required. Not so for an online
          catalogue, which has much more of a life-after-publish and may bring with it
          additional costs, such as hosting fees, databases licenses, etc., which may be
          small and subsumed within other operational costs, but are nonetheless a
          consideration. Again, the question of data integrity and timeliness arises. If
          a re-attribution occurs, should the catalogue be refreshed? There are a number
          of institutional policy-level decisions that arise for this digital transition.
          This is a great example of one of the challenges of technology deployment in
          museums. Too many technology-based projects are funded based on getting the
          product to launch, while not enough emphasis is placed on the consequences of
          maintaining that product for whatever its lifetime is determined to be.</p>
        <hr width="30%"/>
        <p>So this is a big deal, bigger than one might assume at the
          outset. This paper attempts to point out the challenges, obstacles and
          solutions reported by the project participants as the initiative progresses, and
          to offer broad and generic recommendations under the guise of what works rather
          than what is good or best practice. Many participating institutions are
          retro-fitting the process into their existing architecture, perpetuating the
          organic nature by which museum technology architectures grow. The following
          sections represent topics that the group discussed at its latest convening in
          November 2010.</p>
        <h2>Technology Architecture</h2>
        <p>The project participants represent a cross-section of
          mid-sized and large museums. The existing architectures that these museums use
          to deliver their current online presence are as different as the museums
          themselves, often having grown organically over time. However, by and large
          they all follow a basic best-practices technology principle by adhering to a
          tiered approach; that is, the separation of data, application (or logic) and
          presentation. This modular approach offers a great deal of flexibility and
          scalability at the macro level of managing data – if data is separated
          from how it is presented, it can be presented on many different platforms and
          channels by applying different logic to it. For example, wrapping data in HTML allows
          presenting it in a Web browse; wrapping it in a PDF allows for a more
          controlled delivery.</p>
        <p>For all participants, their Collections Management System
          (CMS) is central to how they intend to deliver their online catalogue. The
          majority of participants have TMS (or EmbARK), though several have a custom-developed
          system. The ease with which the online catalogue process can be inserted into
          this environment is dependent on how the catalogue is to be presented, the
          frequency of its update, and the extent to which the existing architecture is
          open and flexible. An overriding challenge for all participants is that CMSs
          are designed to manage data; they were not designed to publish nor to provide
          an elegant editing environment, particularly one that supports rich text,
          symbols, hyperlinks, layering, embedded media, and some kind of presentation
          previewing. Institutions are attempting to solve this problem in a variety of
          ways, largely involving some kind of authoring tool layered over their CMS. In
          several cases, Drupal is being looked at as an authoring tool that deploys into
          a database rather than publishing to a website; in other instances,
          institutions are supporting the curator’s desire to continue to use a word
          processing application as they have traditionally done. Ingesting these
          documents into a database requires some kind of transformation, either manual
          or using a parsing application. This approach is fundamentally not that
          different from a tool like Drupal, but it brings with it document management
          complexity and raises the question of where the master content resides –
          is it the documents themselves or their representation in data? In one case,
          SharePoint is being used to satisfy the document management component.</p>
        <p>For the institutions that have a custom developed CMS,
          integrating the publication of an online catalogue into their architecture is
          presumably straight-forward, assuming that in-house support and expertise is
          available. In theory, the benefit of a custom-developed CMS is that one can
          build the functionality one needs with greater ease than find a vendor-provided
          system. However, that presupposes a number of things: that the application was
          built in a modular way; that the application code is properly maintained and
          well-documented; that there is enough institutional memory surrounding its
          architecture; that there are still programmers around who know the language it
          was written in. The realities of custom-developed solutions, particularly in
          the museum world, often are that they have been built by a now-departed
          employee or, as in one participant’s case, by a single-employee vendor who is
          winding down the company. Situations like this make it quite a challenge to
          retrofit functionality and clearly demonstrate the need for institutions to
          select technology solutions where the viability of the vendor is a contributing
          factor or the implications of an in-house solution are well understood.</p>
        <p>Having a vendor-based CMS that doesn’t support the desired
          functions requires a number of actions: the institution determines a
          workaround; talks to the vendor about adding additional functionality (this
          will likely incur a development cost); or documents the requirements and
          selects a product that will integrate and provide the functionality. All of
          these options are being pursued by the participants, largely around TMS. TMS
          has a number of benefits in regard to this project: the next version release
          will provide much better support for rich text within descriptive fields, and
          has the publishing component eMuseum which provides a mechanism to tailor the
          catalogue presentation. However, the challenge of getting content in and
          providing the supporting editorial environment to create a rich and engaging
          online catalogue still remains.</p>
        <p>Image management is another potentially significant
          challenge. Not all the participants have a Digital Asset Management System, but
          the extent of the challenge is based on scale. For a catalogue with dozens of
          images, the requirement to manage images automatically is not great. By
          following simple rules about file organization and  transformation workflow and adhering to filenaming
          conventions, one could quite easily provide manual image support for the
          catalogue. For larger scale productions in the hundreds of images and up, the
          most productive approach should be a digital asset management tool that will
          guarantee consistency for the image production and deployment tasks. For some
          institutions, their DAM is integrated with their CMS. While this is very
          convenient, it is not a requirement as long as one follows a
          filenaming-convention that is generated in the CMS and based on unique and
          attributable metadata for the image: the accession number, for example.</p>
        <p>Summarising from a macro component point-of-view, the
          technology architecture that is required to support an online catalogue is
          comprised of the following: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>an authoring environment that will support
            creating the required online catalogue content and all its intricacies; </li>
          <li>a database, more often than not a CMS; </li>
          <li>a publishing tool that presents the required
            online catalogue; </li>
          <li>an image management tool that may or may not be
            built into a CMS.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Process and Workflow</h2>
        <p>Given the potential complexity of producing an engaging
          online catalogue, a smart approach is to use an existing printed catalogue as a
          starting point. A number of the participants are taking this approach, although
          there may not be a huge advantage to be gained, depending on how complex the
          catalogue is planned to be. But, if one is planning to create a rich, layered
          catalogue that takes advantage of the interactivity and non-linear engagement
          that the Web can support, much more support is needed for the content creation
          process. As well as providing the tools to author a non-linear resource, it
          might have to allow the creation of citations and provide a mechanism for
          document management and referencing.</p>
        <p>To create a sustainable, reproducible mechanism as opposed
          to a one-off publication, the catalogue needs to be created as data rather than
          as a document; i.e. the scholarly prose, tombstone information, citations,
          bibliography, etc – all items that need to be linked and referenced
          – need to be managed as data. Therefore, a database in the form of a CMS
          is central to the process. Starting with already-written text is a plus, but
          much work still needs to be done to organize the content for its delivery
          online.</p>
        <p>The workflow needed to create an online catalogue is not
          that different from a traditional print publication, but the support tools, the
          technology environment and the skills are different. Key acceptance challenges
          will be on the curatorial side, where there is likely minimal experience with Web
          authoring tools. The approaches that participants have taken during the
          planning phase are varied and depend on a number of factors, including
          expertise in developing complex Web content and access to appropriate human and
          technology resources.</p>
        <p>By far, the most crucial question to resolve is what the
          catalogue will look like and how it will function. This suggests that one of
          the first experts required for the project is a Web designer or user experience
          designer. Addressing this question informs the complexity of the editorial
          environment and the process. For example, a decision to support pop-up
          citations requires a totally different approach to how they must be managed: as
          discrete data objects coded via a mechanism for assigning them within the copy,
          much like the rich text editors available in blogging software.</p>
        <p>The workflow to generate the content may require multiple
          levels of review and editorial work; building this into a system is complex.
          Advanced Web Content Management Systems (WCMS) may have workflow engines that
          can be employed to marshal content, but providing this capability in a CMS is
          problematic. If one is planning on using a CMS to develop the content, the use
          of status flags assigned to fields to denote where it is in the process can be
          used in place of a rigorous workflow engine.</p>
        <p>Another crucial question that greatly impacts process and
          workflow is the frequency of update. This decision informs how the catalogue
          will be delivered (published or data driven), and how much effort should be
          assigned to engineering automatic tasks as opposed to manual ones. If an
          institutional decision is made for an annual or bi-annual update, it is
          probably worth the extra development effort of implementing some automatic
          processes; a commitment to update every five years, however, greatly diminishes
          the benefit of automation.</p>
        <p>In an ideal world the process to produce an online catalogue
          has to start with a clear definition of the end result: what success looks
          like. While there’s no question that curators can start their research and
          writing, or indeed, start with an already completed manuscript, the complexity
          of the process dictates that the scope of the final product must be understood
          to inform the staffing, resources and infrastructure that will be required.</p>
        <h2>Staffing and Resourcing</h2>
        <p>As the participants have found, this project involves many
          departments and functions, including Curatorial, Conservation, Collections
          Information, Information Technology, Web/New Media, Design, Registrar,
          Publications, Imaging and Legal. For the most part, the projects seem to center
          around the Web/New Media or Collections Information departments: interesting
          given that this is a publication, but probably due to the fact that the project
          centers around the institution’s CMS.</p>
        <p>One crucial decision for institutions is where ultimate
          responsibility for the project lies. The decision is really an institutional
          one and is based on what the catalogue means to the institution. It is very
          similar to the question of where a museum’s Web department should sit –
          it depends on what the museum wants its website to be. If the website is a
          communication tool, the Web department should report to Communications &amp;
          PR; if it is an educational tool, it should report to the Education department.
          Obviously, the Museum Director is ultimately responsible, but discipline-based
          choices for oversight of the project will greatly dictate the final product.
          For the participants, oversight of their projects ranges from directors, chief
          curators, communications and audience engagement, and collections information,
          with some institutions establishing advisory boards.</p>
        <p>While publications departments are involved in the projects,
          none appears to be playing the central role that it would for the traditional
          printed catalogue. This is an interesting observation, indicative of the
          latency with which museum publications departments are addressing the issue of
          digital publication. One might assume from this that the institutions have
          somehow decided that this is not a publication: ironic, because publications
          departments are expert at complex project management.</p>
        <h2>Challenges and Hindsight</h2>
        <p>As the project progresses, the participants come together
          periodically to report on progress and discuss challenges and solutions. These
          convenings are a great opportunity for mutual support and advice, and the
          following two sets of points summarise a session at the most recent
          convening dealing with challenges and hindsight. There were many consistent
          threads in the challenges that participants documented; in particular, the need
          to maintain consistent staffing for the life of a medium-term project was of
          great concern. The following challenges, in no particular order, offer a
          compact summary of the things to watch out for, and while some are specific to
          the online catalogue process, many resonate with any online project:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Coping with staff attrition – remaining
            staff must juggle competing priorities and new responsibilities </li>
          <li>Finding ways to best represent information
            within our current database structure and/or augment with a separate content
            management tool</li>
          <li>Determining how to have online catalogue entries
            peacefully coexist or integrate with other existing online object content; e.g.
            online collections and Provenance data, in a way that is easily understandable in
            an end-user experience</li>
          <li>Accommodating the project within current
            workload</li>
          <li>Maximizing the potential of an online catalogue</li>
          <li>Identifying related images and negotiating
            rights</li>
          <li>Completing all digitization, including
            management of metadata inclusion for a large number of images</li>
          <li>Producing a sample Web template with one artist
            or related group of work</li>
          <li>The contract hire of a scholarly content
            facilitator to marshall the editorial process</li>
          <li>Front-end navigation – integrating the
            user experience to allow for different engagement levels, consistency and
            project identity</li>
          <li>Evaluation – planning scholarly and
            practical evaluation of the site and its contents. Examining potential use by
            different audiences, assessing if fit for purpose</li>
          <li>Editorial &amp; publishing resources – how
            to secure in-house editorial and Web publishing resources to support future
            research projects?</li>
          <li>Dealing with the new pressure this creates on
            existing systems and applications while avoiding the Rube Goldberg machine</li>
          <li>Balancing different collections imperatives and
            institutional funders (e.g. general educational vs. scholarly outreach)</li>
          <li>Presenting flexible, overarching narratives in
            an asset-driven project with fairly structured data</li>
          <li>Corralling staff expertise in curatorial and conservation
            for a long-term research project not directly tied to an exhibition</li>
          <li>Ensuring strategic integration of the online
            catalogue development with other digital publishing initiatives; i.e.,
            transforming our collection management system into a publishing powerhouse to
            deliver to different targets such as gallery interactives, exhibition Web
            sites, and mobile publications</li>
          <li>Adequately resourcing the publication process
            with staff who possess the emerging skill sets needed for producing
            multifaceted digital publication</li>
          <li>Dealing with shortage of time and human
            resources</li>
          <li>Managing scholarly references and bibliography
            already existing in print format</li>
          <li>Working by definition within the constraints of
            a print format</li>
          <li>Ensuring that the catalogue meets audience needs
            and carries the appropriate scholarly weight</li>
          <li>Understanding the distinction between an online
            archive and an online publication</li>
          <li>Project management and coordinating different
            aspects of the project such as content, software and interface development</li>
          <li>Understanding the institutional impacts of the
            project on resources and workflow</li>
          <li>Understanding where the catalogues fits in the
            current strategic thinking</li>
          <li>Creating innovative design that is adaptable,
            with an easy-to-use authoring tool that is affordable </li>
          <li>Determining technology to use for gathering and
            analyzing feedback about content</li>
          <li>Defining the scope of the catalogue and
            prioritizing objects</li>
          <li>Editing translations of foreign language
            inscriptions</li>
          <li>Settling on the Web designer</li>
          <li>Dealing with the fact that the research and
            writing process has led to new discoveries with innovative arguments which make
            it hard to define limitations to the project and other initiatives</li>
          <li>Realizing that our front-end audience research
            took longer because responses were richer and more complex and helpful than we
            anticipated </li>
          <li>Finding that our photography took much longer
            than anticipated because we searched files for existing photos and discovered
            earlier conservation shots</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The second list is suggestions, the products of hindsight:
          and what decisions the participants would have made differently with the
          benefit of hindsight. Again, these “woulda”, “coulda”, “shoulda” nuggets of
          advice are not only critical for an institution considering the transition to
          online for their scholarly catalogue, but are also pertinent to any online
          project:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start Small: define realistic content goals
            based on anticipated resources and workload</li>
          <li>Be mindful of sustainability: Initial technical
            implementation may be overly complex and require  narrow skill sets</li>
          <li>Remember that this is a “real” publication, with
            real schedules, and should be treated as such</li>
          <li>Photography for the publication should commence
            as soon as the scope is fully defined.</li>
          <li>Involve the Collections Database Administrator
            as a key team member from the outset</li>
          <li>Contract contributors sooner</li>
          <li>Have a full, inclusive discussion on
            look-and-feel for an ideal website</li>
          <li>Research and resolve metadata/image integration
            systems early in the process</li>
          <li>Build more administrative and editorial support
            into the project plans and budget</li>
          <li>Increase the amount of born-digital material in
            the project</li>
          <li>Assess website capabilities and audience needs
            early</li>
          <li>Involve a large internal community early on</li>
          <li>Split apart development of content and capture
            procedures from interface development</li>
          <li>Adopt publishing model early, as it relates to
            content development (e.g. “chapter” concept introduced midway into planning
            phase).</li>
          <li>Involve software developer in early visual
            designs</li>
          <li>Develop &amp; test database-driven tracking of
            assets early</li>
          <li>Analyze new middleware solutions early</li>
          <li>Select case studies to demonstrate the range of
            potential issues</li>
          <li>Apply best practice for exhibition catalogue
            production to this “publication.”</li>
          <li>Invest in early design to promote discussion and
            consideration of the content implications.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Summary &amp; Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This paper reviews the OSCI project’s work in progress, with
          the Foundation’s goal to inform the field through an interim and final
          publication. To start the process, an institution has to ask the fundamental
          question, “What is an online scholarly catalogue?” In some ways the answer is
          going to be institution specific, but hopefully the work that these participant
          museums are doing will help define broader answers to that question. In its
          printed form there is clarity on the authorship of a scholarly catalogue, but
          that may not be so apparent in the online world. It will arguably be seen as a
          product of the institution rather than the individual, and consequently,
          authority will come from the institution rather than the individual. This may
          be a hard curatorial-pill to swallow, and the institution needs to do its
          upmost to maintain that individual curatorial authority. However, the potential
          benefit is greater with wider and easier access to curators’ work (with the understanding
          that they are providing more of a scholarly “service”); citations will
          certainly increase. Initially this may be a hard conversation to have, but it
          is much better to have that conversation upfront. The key may be to find one
          curator to focus on, and hope the “me-too” effect takes hold.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the conversation about how the catalogue looks
          and how it functions has to happen across an institution: it cannot be confined
          purely to the curatorial ranks because the expertise that can decide these
          questions lies elsewhere. How it looks and how it functions will play key roles
          in determining how successful it is, but this will be difficult to measure
          since the metrics for measuring success are different. How will you measure whether
          it is outperforming print? How will page views measure against copies sold? If
          reaching an untapped audience is a measure of success, how will you know that
          has happened? A definition of what success looks like is key for an institution
          to identify at the outset.</p>
        <p>These projects are unquestionably collaborations and involve
          many disciplines within the museum field. Scholarly research and writing aside,
          two key points to understand are that this project involves the transformation
          of a repository into a publishing tool, and it also requires an authoring
          environment. An institution has to consider whether it has the resources to
          support this, either internally or through contract work; there is no doubt
          that it requires a learning curve and an investment. The decision to transition
          cannot be based on financial motivations and must be made for the long term.
          This last point addresses sustainability and highlights one overriding
          observation that any interested institution has to understand. It is implicit
          in all the discussions and strategizing that the project participants are
          having amongst themselves and in their institutions – this is not a
          “technology project”.</p>
