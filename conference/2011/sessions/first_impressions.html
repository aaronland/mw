                                <div class="item odd"><p>We will bring together museum technology professionals who have made a job change since the MW community last gathered in April 2010. In a lively roundtable discussion, the group will offer first impressions of their new posts; consider how leaving one job and starting another may have influenced their thinking about their former positions; and discuss the different ways in which technology, change, innovation, and collaboration are approached in their past and present worlds. Participants will offer their thoughts on the interview and hiring process and examine the ways in which it forced them to characterize and communicate their talents, skills, history, goals, and outlooks. Though the session will provide a fun peek at the experiences of friends and colleagues, it should also serve as a serious meditation on the nature of change in a fast-evolving job market and offer several useful case studies by peers who have recently chosen to pursue a new challenge.</p>
<p>Susan Chun will serve as session moderator; participants include Bruce Wyman (currently Director of Creative Development, Second Story Interactive Studios); Christina DePaolo (currently Director of New Media, Balboa Park Online Collaborative); Koven Smith (currently Director of Technology, Denver Art Museum); others are welcome to contribute.</p>
