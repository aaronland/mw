		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Lugano is a small city in Canton Ticino,
		  the Southern part of Switzerland. The city blends Italian culture and Swiss
		  hospitality, and enjoys a rich cultural heritage, from Renaissance frescoes to
		  modern architecture and to monuments from the Italian Enlightment. Lugano is a
		  common destination for primary and secondary school classes during their field
		  trips from all over the region. According to school programs, the goal of such
		  field trips is different according to grade. “Learning about your city” is an
		  overarching learning goal for grades 8 and 9, so that visiting the city means
		  understanding its structure, history, and life. In higher grades, cultural
		  goals are more important, and a visit to Lugano is a way to (a) see the
		  cultural heritage of the city, its history and artistic treasures; and (b)
		  understand the city as a lively economic space, manifested through shops,
		  banks, tourism, etc. Finally, for schools from rural regions, a visit to Lugano
		  is also a way to (c) experience the city as an urban space different from the
	    mountains and countryside.</p>
		<p>Careful planning, preparation and follow-up
		  allow teachers to turn school trips into real learning experiences, at the same
		  time engaging and memorable for children. CityTreasure was designed for
		  supporting teachers in this process with a pinch of technologies, blending
		  mobile phones and outdoor learning activities. CityTreasure is basically an
		  SMS-based treasure hunt through the streets of Lugano, targeted to school
		  classes from grades 8-12. It capitalizes on the results of an eTourism project
		  (<i>eTreasure</i>; Cantoni et al., 2008),
		  and was developed in collaboration with the city school district. The challenge
		  of CityTreasure is using mobile technologies for blending curriculum-relevant
		  content into an engaging activity fostering observation, active learning and
	    retention in a powerful informal learning experience. </p>
		<p>The paper is structured in three sections.
		  The first section, Related Works, provides an overview of the theoretical basis
		  of CityTreasure and reports on related works. The second section, Children
		  Hunting for Treasure, describes the technologies, the design of the game and
		  the development of content, as well as implementation with the schools. The third
		  section, Evaluation, presents and discusses the evaluation. The conclusions
	    follow.</p>
		<h2>Related Works</h2>
		<h3>Location-based games and city games</h3>
		<p>CityTresure can be described as a very
	    simple augmented reality team-based city game that supports informal learning.</p>
		<p><i>Game</i> indicates a set of rigid structures – namely, rules – that generate a game
		  space which players enter for pleasure (Salen &amp; Zimmermann, 2004; Betrus
	    &amp; Botturi, in press). Rules not only define allowed moves, but also establish
		  the goal for which players compete or collaborate. As Huizinga (1955) put it,
	    games are</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote"> a voluntary activity or occupation
		  executed within certain fixed limits of time and place, according to rules
		  freely accepted but absolutely binding, having its aim in itself and
		  accompanied by a feeling of tension, joy and the consciousness that it is ‘different’
	    from ‘ordinary life’ (p. 28).</p>
		<p> Games like soccer, poker, pool, or Stratego
		  can fit this definition, but at its core,<i> playing</i> describes a child’s activity of exploring the world, and of
		  learning (Sutton-Smith, 1979). Gee (2003) emphasizes that games promote a
		  critical and active way of learning, and it is not by chance that playing is
		  the primary learning modality for human beings: from 0 to 5 years, children
	    learn about themselves and about the world through playing.</p>
		<p>Playing always entails learning: learning
		  the rules, learning a new strategy, learning how to beat the opponent or the
		  system (Botturi &amp; Loh, 2008). This is why games and videogames have such a
		  powerful learning power (Gee, 2003) and why they have always been part, in
		  different forms, of the Western educational tradition (Betrus &amp; Botturi, in
	    press).</p>
		<p>From the perspective of educators, games
		  can be used to foster learning in different ways (Betrus &amp; Botturi, in
		  press): games and videogames (a) increase motivation; (b) support complex
		  understanding; (c) allow reflective learning; and (d) provide constant feedback
		  that allows self-regulation. Why is it so? Basically, while classrooms need
		  students, games need players. Unlike  students who follow teachers in class
		  activities, players are the actual engine of a game: if a student does not pay
		  attention, he doesn’t learn, but the activity goes on; on the contrary, if a
		  player does not move, nothing happens in a game (Prensky, 2006). Playing means to
		  be a protagonist, and learning becomes a “natural” thing to do for winning. In
	    other words, learning is situated.</p>
		<p>Of course, not all games are alike, and
		  different games should be used for different purposes. For example, games based
		  on digital technologies (videogames, but also mobile games or Internet-based,
		  occasionally Flash, games) can support complex rule systems managed by the
		  machine, so that they can embed simulations. Digital technologies also allow
		  the development of mobile games that enrich real locations with digital content
		  delivered through mobile (possibly location-aware) devices. Also, digital games
	    are appealing to digital natives (Prensky, 2001), just because of their media.</p>
		<p>City games can be considered a subset of so-called
		  pervasive games, where the game experience is extended into the real world thanks
		  to mobile technologies, and changes according to (1) the players’ position
		  within the context, and (2) the players’ actions (Benford, et al., 2005). In
		  city games, the issue of context (i.e. territory) awareness and the issue of getting
		  the right information (from the territory) in order to fulfil the games’
	    requirements is crucial. As these games are location-dependent, in the
		  literature they have been also called <i>location-based
		    games</i>. Nicklas, Pfisterer and Mitschang (2001) emphasize that players move
		  around the real world and interact with the game by changing their position and
	    visiting certain places that are of interest to the game.</p>
		<p style="text-autospace:none">In the last years, location-aware
		  and pervasive games have been quite successful both in academic and
		  professional fields, achieving the status of new outdoor technological
		  entertainment (Han et al., 2005). Games such as <i>Geocaching</i> (Webb, 2001), <i>Can
		    You See Me Now?</i> (Flintham et al., 2003) and <i>Human Pacman</i> (Cheok, et al., 2003) had –
	    and still have – many followers in different countries around the world.</p>
		<p style="text-autospace:none">Besides, some companies are
		  massively promoting marketing initiatives related to this kind of game; for
		  instance, Pepsi Co. with the game <i>Pepsi
	    Foot</i> (Diercks, 2001).</p>
		<p>The learning potential of location-based
		  games comes from connecting technology and real spaces and objects. Educational
		  location-based games have been implemented for several purposes, from nature
		  and science learning in wood camps (<i>Mistery
	    Trip</i>; Martin, 2008), to history and business finance (<i>Dow Day </i>and <i>Hip Hop</i> <i>Tycoon</i>, presented at <a href="../http://lgl.gameslearningsociety.org/">http://lgl.gameslearningsociety.org</a>).</p>
		<p>Nicklas, Pfisterer and Mitschang (2001) classified
		  location-based games in three categories, depending on the degree of dependence
	    on specific location-related information: </p>
		<ul>
		  <li><span style="font:7.0pt &#34;Times New Roman&#34;"></span>Mobile games: the game does not need to track
		    the players’ position. Proximity sensing and local communication are sufficient
		    in order to generate location-based interactions.</li>
		  <li><span style="font:7.0pt &#34;Times New Roman&#34;"></span>Location-aware games: the geographical position
		    of the players matters and is tracked by the system. The game experience is
		    fully related to the location the player is visiting.</li>
		  <li>Spatially aware games: the surrounding objects are part of the game.
		    Game interactions can be connected to objects and specific spaces.</li>
	    </ul>
		<p><i>CityTreasure</i>, presented in the following section, can be considered as a location-aware
		  game, where the interaction with the geographical location of the players
	    matters in order to achieve the goals of the game.</p>
		<h3>Informal learning</h3>
		<p>By their very nature, games cannot be
		  formal. Indeed, somebody who is obliged to play a game cannot be really said to
	    be playing (or having fun! Cfr. Botturi &amp; Loh, 2008). Games, in any form, foster <i>informal learning</i>.</p>
		<p>Rogers defines <i>informal learning</i> as
	    </p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">all the
		  incidental learning, unstructured, unpurposeful but the most extensive and most
	    important part of all the learning that all of us do everyday of our lives (Rogers, 2004). </p>
		<p>Informal learning has been studied mainly
		  in relation to  job skills, in the domain of vocational training and workplace
		  studies (Garrick, 1998; Hager, 1998). Tourism, and cultural tourism in
		  particular, is another relevant area for informal learning, as it offers a rich
		  experiential context where people learn about culture, art, and history
		  (Inversini &amp; Cantoni, 2008). Blending cultural and touristic informal
		  learning with games was the challenge of eTreasure, the source project of
	    CityTreasure. </p>
		<p>eTreasure also dealt with the so-called <i>economy
		  of attention </i>(Davenport and Beck, 2001). Attention is actually a scarce resource
		  and for this reason nowadays is treated as an economic element (Iskold, 2007;
		  Falkinger, 2007). eTreasure and CityTreasure were deigned to help tourists and
		  students to visit a given place focusing their attention first on a specific
		  issue (e.g., the cultural heritage field), and secondly on a particular aspect
		  (e.g., the author of a fresco). Framed within the compelling context of a game,
		  directed attention provides a strong basis for starting an informal learning
	    process.</p>
		<h2>CityTreasure </h2>
		<p>This section presents the CityTreasure
		  system in two aspects: the mobile technologies used and the design of the
	    system and of its content.</p>
		<h3>Technologies</h3>
		<p>CityTreasure was born out of the experience
		  of eTreasure, a mobile game-based platform for tourists (Cantoni, Inversini
	    &amp; Rega, 2008). The system was originally developed, and then adapted to use
		  with schools, by the NewMinE Lab of the Università della Svizzera italiana
		  (USI) in Lugano, Switzerland, in collaboration with Orange Switzerland as
	    technological partner.</p>
		<p>eTreasure is a digital treasure hunt engine
		  that can support any number of paths and locations. Players can interact with
		  the system with any GSM mobile device using SMS (Short Message System)
		  messages. SMS were chosen because (a) they are among the easiest ways of using
		  a cell phone; (b) the cell phone is widely used and perceived as something
		  deeply private, at the same time being a sort of communication hub; and (c) SMS
		  systems can be easily extended to integrate more text and other media through
	    MMS (Multimedia Message System).</p>
		<p>The system is composed of two layers
	    (Figure 1). </p>
		<ul>
		  <li><span style="font:7.0pt &#34;Times New Roman&#34;"></span>The first layer is devoted to SMS routing, and
		    is provided and hosted by the technological partner (Orange Switzerland). The
		    SMS routing server is called SMSC (Short Message Service Centre) and operates
		    as a hub for sending SMS messages to the right player. The interface used for
		    the communication with the application server is called EMI (External Machine
		    Interface). </li>
		  <li><span style="font:7.0pt &#34;Times New Roman&#34;"></span>The second layer is the application server where
		    all the technology related to the application is hosted: the database with
		    content, and the software that keeps track of the position of players within
		    the treasure hunt path, composing the next message to each of them based on
		    their answers. The application server also stores timestamps and results for
		    each player action, and generates user statistics. </li>
	    </ul>

		<p class="caption">Fig 1: The eTreasure/CityTreasure
	    System.</p>
		<h3>Game design and content development</h3>
		<p>Groups of students participating in
		  CityTreasure are competing with each other in order to win the game. Different
		  from normal treasure hunts, where the fastest wins, CityTreasure is based on
		  score: the best observers of the city and of its cultural heritage win. In
		  order to understand the actual design of the system and of the content, the
	    game dynamic should be illustrated first.</p>
		<p>The sparkle of the game is competition
		  among groups of students, each equipped with a city map and a cell phone.
		  Through the cell phone, the system tells students to locate a spot on the map
		  (a Point of Interest, PoI), and asks them a question about it. Students have to
		  find it on the map, walk to it, and find the solution to the riddle (Figure 2).
		  The system then asks two more riddles (3 in total for each PoI) before
		  indicating another location on the map. The system assigns 5 points for each
		  correct answer, and 0 for each wrong answer. At the end of the treasure hunt,
		  composed of 4 or 5 PoIs, the system sends a message with the final score of the
	    group. The group with the highest score wins.</p>
		<p class="caption"><img src="botturi.figure2.jpg" alt="figure 2" width="259" height="288"/></p>
		<p class="caption">Fig 2: Hint and
	    riddle</p>
		<p>While the design of the game is
		  straightforward, the development of content presented some critical issues.
		  Indeed, content is the key feature that can make the playing experience aligned
		  with the actual learning goals of the field trip. Content is what can make an
		  application like CityTreasure a real informal learning application and not just
	    a funny gadget.</p>
		<p>Content development was carried out within
		  the <i>eLearning Lab </i>of the Master in Technology Enhanced Communication for
		  Cultural Heritage (TEC-CH) at USI, led by the first author of this paper, in
		  collaboration with four primary school teachers. The process followed four
	    steps:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>selecting relevant PoIs. This was done following two criteria:
		    (a) including locations that are usually included in school field trip plans,
		    and (b) including locations with similar relative distance from each other, so
		    that randomly selected paths would have more or less the same length. PoIs
		    included both artistic sites (churches, monuments, etc.) and civil sites (the
		    town hall, important commercial streets, etc.).</li>
		  <li>developing riddles for each PoI. In order to allow diversity and
		    prevent the “spread-the-news” effect among the groups, 5 riddles were developed
		    for each PoI. This was done by TEC-CH students, based on instructional
		    materials that teachers provided. Teachers then revised riddles and answers to
		    ensure alignment with instructional goals.</li>
		  <li>preparing the content for the system. Riddles had to be phrased
		    to stay within the limit of characters allowed by SMS standards, and all
		    possible correct variations for answers (e.g., spelling variants, number vs.
		    text variants, etc.) had to be identified and coded.</li>
		  <li>feeding the content into the application server, which was
		    managed by the technical staff at NewMinE Lab. </li>
	    </ol>
		<p>A group of expert users (i.e., not
		  children) was asked to test the game, and the content was consequently refined based
		  on the feedback collected. Also, a test micro-treasure hunt, with just one
		  riddle, was developed in order to allow new users to test the system before
	    actually starting the game.</p>
		<p>The good thing about teaching is that, as
		  in acting, the script is only part of the show. In the same way, the
		  technological architecture and the content developed only represent the “toy”
	    of CityTreasure. The actual game experience is broader, and includes many
		  non-technological details that can make a difference. Indeed, the best
		  technology itself does not guarantee any positive learning outcome. The
		  CityTreasure team therefore focused on designing the whole experience for the
	    treasure hunt. This included:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li><span style="font:7.0pt &#34;Times New Roman&#34;"></span>The development of a paper-based teacher guide that instructed teachers
		    about preparation for the activity (including setting the right expectations,
		    and providing required previous knowledge and skills, such as being able to
		    read the city map);</li>
		  <li><span style="font:7.0pt &#34;Times New Roman&#34;"></span>The selection of a proper meeting place for the start of the
		    game, and of an adequate ending place with respect to the location of the
		    school (or of the train station, for those coming from out of town);</li>
		  <li><span style="font:7.0pt &#34;Times New Roman&#34;"></span>A 1-hour briefing with involved teachers in
		    order to arrange details for individual cases, and for instructing them on the
		    use of the guide, and on how to involve collaborators (other teachers or
		    parents).</li>
	    </ul>
		<h2>Children Hunting for Treasure In Lugano</h2>
		<p>During May and June 2008, 4 primary school classes (about 20
		  students per class) and 4 secondary school classes (about 20 students per
		  class), for a total of over 150 children, played the treasure hunt with
	    CityTreasure as part of their field trip to Lugano (Figure 3). </p>
		<p>The general learning goals proposed by teachers for the use
		  of CityTreasure were the following: (a) fostering the observation of details in
		  cultural heritage and stimulating meaningful learning; (b) enhancing team-work
		  attitudes and skills; and (c) making the learning of history, geography and
	    fine arts fun and worth remembering in connection with cultural heritage locations.</p>
		<p class="caption"><img src="botturi.figure3.jpg" alt="figure 3" width="465" height="350"/></p>
		<p class="caption">Fig. 3: Children playing CityTreasure</p>
		<p>As already mentioned, teachers involved students in
		  preparation activities before the actual game-playing sessions. Students were
		  therefore aware that they would be playing a game, and had already practised
		  the basic skills required for the game, including map-reading and following general
		  behavior rules for cities (such as street crossing, etc.). Teachers also read
		  the guide that previewed all PoIs, riddles and answers, so that they could
		  provide background information and connect the activity to their program. The
		  same guide (without solutions to riddles, though) was given to other support
		  teachers or parents who helped with the field trip (each of the primary school
	    groups was accompanied by a parent volunteering).</p>
		<p>Classes gathered at the selected starting point, and the
		  game was presented by a staff member of USI. After hearing the basic rules of
		  the game, each group was given a cell phone (private cell phones are prohibited
		  in most schools) and the test 1-riddle treasure hunt was run, in order to test
		  interaction with the system. Groups were also given an info sheet that
		  summarized the rules and clearly indicated the time limit and the final meeting
		  point. The game was then started, and groups dashed away to their first
		  locations (actually, time was not relevant for the game, but this did not
	    prevent children from running as fast as they could from one PoI to the next).</p>
		<p>During the game, two forms of control were put in place in
		  order to ensure both safety and smooth progress. One person was monitoring
		  groups from the interface of the application server. In this way he was able to
		  see their next location, and to see if progress was adequate for the time
		  available. Another staff member rode through the city on a bike, providing
		  support to lost or late groups, and also collecting their first-hand feedback.
		  A staff member was also present at the last PoI (the end place), for collecting
		  cell phones and feedback. Teachers provided a wrap-up and small “prize
	    ceremony”.</p>
		<p>While this was rather structured and resource-consuming
		  organization, it was set up to provide a consistent and carefully controlled
		  experience - paramount in the first field test of the application. It is surely
		  possible to allow more independent use of CityTreasure; however, experience so
		  far indicates that the “context” is key for success – actually, the application
		  can be a catalyst that builds upon, rather than substitutes for, a well-managed
	    field trip.</p>
		<h2>Evaluation</h2>
		<p>The evaluation was both formative, i.e., concerning learning
		  outcomes, and confirmative, i.e., aimed at identifying improvements needed both
		  in the system and in the overall experience. The evaluation was based on three
	    data sources: </p>
		<ul>
		  <li><span class="listwithbullets" style="font-family:Symbol;"><span style="font:7.0pt &#34;Times New Roman&#34;"></span></span>Participant observation by staff members, who reported on
		    activities and took pictures during the experience;</li>
		  <li><span class="listwithbullets" style="font-family:Symbol;"><span style="font:7.0pt &#34;Times New Roman&#34;"></span></span>A survey handed out to all adults (teachers and parents) at the
		    end of the experience. Surveys were collected both for secondary schools (N=7
		    for 4 classes) and primary schools (N=16 for 4 classes) </li>
	      <li>An interview
	        with teachers at the end of the experience</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Added to these was an indirect measure of learning outcomes as
	    reported by teachers. </p>
		<p>The assessment of learning outcomes by teachers was
		  extremely positive: all of them reported that the treasure hunt met their
		  expectations in terms of students gaining knowledge about cultural heritage and
	    other relevant locations. </p>
		<p>The engagement of children, on the other hand, was more than
		  expected. Indeed, the school trip was a memorable adventure and a topic for
		  discussion at home. Engagement is difficult to define, and was pragmatically
		  measured through a set of three correlated indicators from the survey: a
		  measurement of <i>fun </i>as perceived by adults on a likert scale, a similar
		  measurement of <i>interest</i>, and an open field for a single adjective to
		  describe the overall attitude of students during the treasure hunt. This was
		  balanced by another question (also on a likert scale) asking how hard the treasure
		  hunt was for the students: balance was indeed a concern during the design of
		  CityTreasure, an activity that demanded about 45 minutes of walking through the
		  city center. Figure 4 reports the results of the measurement of engagement for
		  primary and secondary school classes (values are on a scale from 1 to 10;
		  please notice that the measurement of <i>hardness</i> used an inverted scale,
		  10 meaning students were <i>not </i>tired). The difference in evaluation
	    between secondary and primary schools will be addressed later.</p>
		<p class="caption"><img src="botturi.figure4.jpg" alt="figure 4" width="500" height="326"/></p>
		<p class="caption">Fig 4: Engagement</p>
		<p>To confirm such high assessment, the most-used adjective for
		  describing students during the treasure hunt was “enthusiastic” (9
		  occurrences), followed by “happy” (3 occurrences), then by “engaged”,
	    “interested”, “satisfied” and “tired” (1 occurrence).</p>
		<p>The survey also aimed at assessing the quality of the
		  system. Survey items asked participants to rate on a likert scale the following
		  features: quality of questions, usefulness, organization (i.e., logistics, time
		  management, etc.), the SMS system, the teacher guide, the accuracy of content.
	    Results are shown in Figure 5.</p>
		<p class="caption"><img src="botturi.figure5.jpg" alt="figure 5" width="500" height="344"/></p>
		<p class="caption">Fig 5: System quality assessment results</p>
		<p>Indeed, all the components of the system received high
		  marks. The lowest mark was assigned to the teacher guide and to the SMS system
		  (which actually suffered from overload at the start of the game, when all
		  groups sent a message simultaneously; also, some children found it difficult to
		  write SMS message with devices different form the ones they were used to). The
		  organization, despite the great effort in preparation, was assessed with marks
		  a little lower than the content. This can be interpreted as the effect of a
		  general loss of control by teachers on the activity – indeed a common effect in
	    game-based learning (Betrus &amp; Botturi, in press).</p>
		<p>The difference in performance between secondary and primary
		  school is evident. Actually, both schools got the same assistance and used the
		  same content (except that secondary schools had 1 additional PoI in their paths).
		  The main difference was in the role that teachers took during the game:
		  secondary school groups were not accompanied by adults, and the students never
		  met adults during the game. This resulted in less focus on the game (some
		  groups stopped for an ice cream…), longer time to the end (about 1.5 times the
		  time spent by primary school children on the same path), and less satisfaction.
		  This confirms the claim that effective game-based experiences require guidance
	    from teachers (Betrus &amp; Botturi, 2008; Squire &amp; Jenkins, 2004)</p>
		<h2>Conclusions &amp; Further Work</h2>
		<p>CityTreasure is a mobile application for supporting location-based
		  game experiences for schools. It is a simple idea and a simple technological
		  application. The fun of it, and its learning power, comes from competition
		  among the groups of students and, of course, from the use of mobile
		  technologies which have deep penetration in that age group and are usually
	    forbidden at school.</p>
		<p>The key points for the success of the application were
		  careful development of content, in association with teachers, and detailed
		  design of the <i>experience</i>, as opposed to the application alone.
		  Evaluation results indicated successful implementation, where differences can
		  be traced back exactly to the care in the details <i>outside</i> the
		  technological application (i.e., the role and presence of adult guidance in the
	    game).</p>
		<p>eTreasure is also developing an on-line community of
		  players. The community will be a place where players of different treasure hunt
	    games can meet on-line and share opinions and pictures of Lugano.</p>
		<p> The major plan regarding the improvement of the treasure
