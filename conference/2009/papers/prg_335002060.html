    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Over the past few years we have witnessed a
        dramatic rise in the number of participatory media <span>technologies which</span><span> museums have employed to
          engage people in new ways under the rubric of Web 2.0. Blogs, wikis, podcasts,
          vodcasts, photo and video sharing, virtual environments, tagging, annotation
          and other authoring tools offer people new opportunities to engage with museum
          processes through co-creation and interactive cultural experiences. Arguably,
          these platforms and tools are creating new relationships between institutions
      and the public.</span></p>
      <p><span>While the uptake of social media in the
        commercial and public spheres has been widely described (Benkler 2006; Tapscott
        and Williams, 2006; Shirky, 2008; Tapscott, 2009), its effects within the
        cultural sector are still yet to be fully examined. The enthusiastic embrace of
        participative media technologies by museums may lead to initiatives which
        assume a ‘build it and they will come’ attitude rather than focusing attention
        on the development of strategic and sustained relationship building that social
        media activities demand. One of the keys to building these relationships – one that
        has received little attention so far - is the question of user motivations and
      rewards for participation (Trant, 2009).</span></p>
      <p>This paper takes as its starting point the view that to
        create sustained participation in social media spaces, museums need to develop
        better understandings of the complexities of user motivations and rewards in
        social media spaces. This also includes a critical reassessment of their
        relationships with the people who use these services. This is in keeping with
        recent research such as Gilmore and Pine (2007) who suggest that in this era of
        multiple experiences, museums must reconstruct the value of their ‘authentic’
        experiences and develop new relationships with what they previously considered
        ‘audiences’. According to John Falk and Beverley Sheppard, at the core of the
        new business models they advocate for museums are, “…the Knowledge Age
        attributes of understanding and relationships, all of which need to be
        personalized to meet the unique and changing needs of all involved…”(Falk and
        Sheppard, 2006: 226). These are the fundamental challenges of social media in a
      museum context.</p>
      <p>In what follows we examine the constructs
        of participation, motivation and reward which are shaping museum applications
        of <i>‘Web 2.0’</i> type, participative,
        social media technologies. We discuss what these constructs might mean
        in a museum Web 2.0 context and suggest ways to design, manage and evaluate
      participative experiences that address both user and organisational needs.</p>
    <h2>Birth of the Participative Web</h2>
  <p>The second generation Web, or the ‘participative Web,’ can
    be dated from shortly after the turn of the millennium, although the term <i>Web 2.0</i>, by which it is also often
    known, was not coined by Tim O’Reilly and Dale Dougherty until 2004.  In 2007, the Organisation for Economic
    Co-operation and Development (OECD) offered the following definition of the
    participative Web as,</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">…characterised by increased
    participation and interaction of Internet users who use it to communicate and
    express themselves. The most prominent concept to describe this evolution which uses the Internet’s inherent capabilities more
    extensively is called “participative web”. It represents an Internet
    increasingly influenced by intelligent web services based on new technologies
    empowering the user to be an increasing contributor to developing, rating,
    collaborating and distributing Internet content and developing and customising
    Internet applications. (<i>OECD, 2007: 8</i>)</p>
  <p>O’Reilly, in an earlier attempt to burn off some of the
    fog around the Web 2.0 term, offered seven principles that described the key
    features of Web 2.0: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Web as platform</li>
    <li>Harnessing collective intelligence</li>
    <li>Data is the next intel inside</li>
    <li>End of the software release cycle</li>
    <li>Lightweight programming models</li>
    <li>Software above the level of a single device</li>
    <li>Rich user experiences <i>(O’Reilly, 2005)</i></li>
  </ul>
  <p>O’Reilly’s list focuses on the conceptual and
    technological building blocks, rather than the social phenomenon of Web 2.0
    which has been  discussed extensively elsewhere. The capabilities described by O’Reilly
    and the programming practices and infrastructure built upon them provided the
    foundations and the impetus for Web 2.0’s ‘architecture of participation’. </p>
  <p>Yet something unexpected emerged when the building began
    in earnest. Between 2003 and 2005, as the wave of Web 2.0 gained momentum with
    the rise of social media stars such as <i>Facebook</i>, <i>MySpace</i>, <i>Second Life</i>, <i>Flickr</i> and <i>YouTube</i>, a paradox surfaced in this
    brave new world of the mass-participation Web. What Usability guru Jakob
    Nielsen observed in these services late in 2006 was the phenomenon of
    “participation inequality”.  </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">All large-scale, multi-user communities and online social
    networks that rely on users to contribute content or build services share one
    property: <em>most users don&#39;t participate</em> very much. Often, they simply <em>lurk</em> in the background. In contrast, a tiny minority of users usually accounts for a
    disproportionately large amount of the content and other system activity. (<i>Nielsen,
      author’s emphasis, 2006)</i></p>
  <p>This lent support to the notion of a ‘90:9:1 rule’ for new
    social media, as described by Nielsen:<strong></strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong></strong><em>90%</em> of users are <em>lurkers</em> (i.e., read or observe, but don&#39;t contribute). </li>
    <li><em>9%</em> of users contribute <em>from time to
      time</em>, but other priorities dominate their time. </li>
    <li><em>1% </em>of users participate a lot and <em>account for most
      contributions</em>: it can seem as if they don&#39;t have lives because they often
      post just minutes after whatever event they&#39;re commenting on occurs. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Nor was this
    phenomenon new. It had been observed in other collaborative on-line
    environments more than a decade previously (Nielsen, 2006). </p>
  <p>Such imbalances
    and the disproportionate efforts of the few may in fact be a common feature of
    social systems. The <i>Pareto principle</i> or ‘80:20 rule’ is an economic formulation that was first described early in
    the twentieth century and popularised in the 1950’s by Joseph Juran. It is often
    used to explain frequently observed imbalances between supply and demand,
    activity and effort, or the distribution of wealth, (i.e. the tendency of a
    small minority to hold the majority of a nation’s wealth). The 80:20 rule is
    sometimes also described as the ‘law’ of the ‘vital few and the useful many’ (Juran,
    1951). While the Pareto principle is a well established construct in social and economic life, the participation inequality observed in
    social media appears to tend to even more extreme imbalances.</p>
  <p>With minor variations, the phenomenon of participation
    inequality holds true for most of the major social media sites. In some cases,
    such as <i>YouTube and Flickr</i>, active
    participation (i.e. creating and uploading videos) has been measured as being
    as low as 0.18% and 0.12% respectively of all visits to these sites (Hitwise,
    2007). Despite the huge traffic to these sites and the media hype about their
    social effects, the opportunities for active participation as
    creators, commentators or editors that these sites provide have not been taken
    up by the overwhelming majority of their users. While the ‘architecture
    of participation’ potentially allows users to upload, comment, tag and blog,
    very few do. This too is in keeping with recent research which suggests that the skills required for participation in the network of
    user-generated content are often beyond those of most users (Russo
    &amp; Watkins 2006). </p>
  <p>One of the most significant mass participation Web
    initiatives, <i>Wikipedia</i>, launched in 2001
    and described by the Pew Internet Project as “one of the poster children” for
    Web 2.0 (Pew, 2006) provides an interesting case in point. Jimmy Wales,
    Wikipedia’s founder, was been quoted as observing that 50% of all Wikipedia
    edits are done by just 0.7% of its users (Swartz: 2006). Just two percent of
    users accounted for more than 73% of all edits. Although the number of unique visitors
    to Wikipedia increased by 181% between 2005 and 2006 alone, this massive use
    did not necessarily equate to mass participation (OECD: 12). The ‘1% rule’ –
    shorthand for Neilsen’s 90:9:1 formulation -  has come to stand for this
    predictable yet still surprising phenomenon of participation inequality in
    popular on-line social media platforms.</p>
  <p>Do these examples put to lie the idea(l)
    of the participative Web? Is mass participation an illusion, with simply a new
    elite of social media amateurs usurping the old professional elites? Or does it
    suggest we need to reconsider our understanding of how participation works?</p>
  <p>Investigating
    wiki-entry editing patterns more closely, Aaron Swartz observed an interesting
    division of labor within the <i>Wikipedia</i> community: </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">…an outsider makes one edit to add
    a chunk of information, then insiders rack up thousands of edits doing things
    like changing the name of a category across a whole site—the kind of thing only
    insiders deeply care about. As a result, insiders account for the vast majority
    of the edits. But it’s the outsiders who provide nearly all the content. (<i>Swartz:
      2006</i>)</p>
  <p>Without comprehensive research, it is difficult to
    establish what proportion of the work in <i>Wikipedia</i> is done by what proportion of its users. Overall,
    it is certainly a tiny minority of users who ‘actively’ participate in on-line
    social media, but the dynamics of their participation are a little more nuanced
    than the 1% rule would suggest. Furthermore, additional research suggests that
    over time, after the initial three years of Wikipedia’s existence, “there was a
    dramatic shift in the distribution of work to the common users with a
    corresponding decline in the influence of the elite” (Kiturr et al, 2007: 7). Clearly,
    as the ‘.0’ in ‘2.0’ is meant to remind us, the
    participative Web is <i>permanently beta</i>,
    always a work in progress.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the best way to understand these findings is as a <i>‘long tail’ of participation</i>; with a
    small minority of participants (the ‘vital few’) shouldering the bulk of the
    creation and organisation work and a much larger and broader group of less
    active participants (‘the useful many’) spending small amounts of time and
    effort. [The Long Tail was originally described
    in <a href="../http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html?pg=3&amp;topic=tail&amp;topic_set=">an article in Wired Magazine</a> in October 2004. At the time, Chris Anderson
    suggested that when dealing with products and services, the ‘tail’ of variety
    available to consumers is far longer than we realize; it is now within reach
    economically; and all those niches, when aggregated, make up a significant
    market.] Like the Pareto principle, this phenomenon demonstrates a
    ‘power law’ at work in on-line participation (Mayfield, 2006). But as Chris
    Anderson has argued in respect of on-line content consumption, the ‘Long Tail’
    phenomenon may have eclipsed the Pareto principle in the Internet age
    (Anderson, 2008: 135). The <i>long tail of
      participation</i> concept might help us better understand the phenomenon of
    participation inequality better than Nielsen’s 90:9:1 rule. </p>
  <p>There are also significant observed differences in
    participation between different demographics. Across a number of reports published
    by the Pew Internet Project (Pew, 2007; 2009), younger users of social media
    have been shown to participate more frequently and more actively in the
    creation and distribution of original and ‘remixed’ content. This has led to
    various generalizations such as Tapscott’s argument that not only do Net
    Generation (or Gen Y, born 1977-1997) use technology differently from previous
    generations, but also Gen Y brains are in fact wired differently from their
    elders because of it (2009:29). </p>
  <p>Other studies, such as Linda Zimmer’s (2007) analysis of
    user participation in <i>Second Life,</i> drew attention to different patterns of activity amongst Baby Boomer,
    Generation X and Generation Y users, applying a framework of participation
    developed by Forrester Research that defines six categories of social media
    participant: <i>Creators; Critics:
      Collectors; Joiners; Spectators and Inactives </i>(Li, 2007). Zimmer found Gen
    Y’ers or ‘milennials’ were more likely to be creators in <i>Second Life</i>. Although Gen X’ers were high joiners, they were more
    likely to be spectators than creators. </p>
  <p>Yet some other recent work from the Pew Internet Project
    raises questions about generational typecasting when it comes to on-line
    behavior. Patterns of use are not always as predictable between generations as
    is sometimes assumed. Gen Y is not the only ‘Internet generation’ (Pew, 2009). Based
    on such evidence, it would appear that there is no longer such a thing as a
    typical user of any technology, as generation, life stage, skill, experience and access to technology increasingly fragment user populations. Nonetheless,
    the temptation to create reductionist user typologies is strong.</p>
  <p>The Forrester framework applied by Zimmer, which was named
    rather grandiosely ‘Social Technographics,’ is represented as a “Ladder of Participation” <a href="../http://blogs.forrester.com/groundswell/2007/04/forresters_new_.html">(http://blogs.forrester.com/ groundswell/2007/04/forresters_new_.html</a>) with participants ranked from <i>Inactives</i> (lowest rung) to <i>Creators</i> (highest). Yet when put to the test with real users in at least one
    instance, the neat categories and segmentation of the Forrester ladder were
    found wanting. Focus group research with Australian Internet users aged 18-30 conducted
    by the Australian Museum demonstrated that the categories defined in
    Forrester’s ‘ladder’ did not fit that user group’s experience and patterns of
    on-line behavior. Instead, people shift between activities and roles, “movi[ng] in and out of categories depending on their age and
    personal/social circumstances, as well as on their levels of comfort with using
    technology” (Kelly &amp; Russo, 2008).</p>
  <p>Another framework for analyzing
    participation in Web 2.0 activities - within a museum context - has been
    proposed by Nina Simon in her <i>Museum
      2.0 blog</i> (<a href="../http://museumtwo.blogspot.com/">http://museumtwo.blogspot.com</a>).
    Simon’s ‘Hierarchy of Social Participation’ suggests an escalating progression comprising
    five levels from passive reception of content to social interaction with
    content (Simon, 2007).</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="russo_Figure1_Russo.png" alt="fig 1" width="400" height="183"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 1: Simon’s Hierarchy of Social Participation<br/> 
    (<a href="../http://museumtwo.blogspot.com/2007/03/hierarchy-of-social-participation.html">http://museumtwo.blogspot.com/2007/03/hierarchy-of-social-participation.html</a><a href="../http://museumtwo.blogspot.com/"></a>)</p>
  <p>This is another attempt to bring order to the messiness of
    Web 2.0 participation. But the participative Web has many parts and many ways
    in which users may take part. Participation cannot be defined in any single or
    simple way. Individual user needs and behavior cannot be understood through demographic
    or ‘technographic’ stereotyping. Designing and sustaining participation in on-line
    environments in all its many forms requires an understanding of the complex
    dynamics of individual motivation, incentive and reward, as well as the
    processes of group dynamics. In the ecology of the participative Web, there are
    many different niches and interactions that sustain the system; many of these
    we are only just beginning to comprehend.</p>
  <p>Linear, lockstep models of participation ‘ladders’ and
    ‘hierarchies’ obscure and discount the complexity of individual and group behavior
    as well as idealising some forms of participation over others.  Such models disregard the myriad
    diversity in how people participate in social media spaces. The ladder and
    hierarchy metaphors also hide the randomised and viral nature of participation
    in networked social spaces. Instead of individuals climbing ladders and
    pyramids, the social media phenomenon relies on the network efforts of joining
    in- in whatever capacity (Benkler, 2006). Simply being part of that crowd
    produces an effect; the crowd both enables and sustains the phenomenon. <i>Google</i> is still perhaps the finest
    example of this ‘wisdom of crowds’ at work in the on-line space (Suriowecki,
    2004). </p>
  <p>Social media give people many ways to shape their own
    experiences and those of others, some through deliberate acts such as
    contribution, commenting, rating or re-mixing, others incidental to their use
    (i.e. through searching, subscribing, being counted toward most visited or
    other recommender systems.) As O’Reilly observes, “One of the key lessons of
    …Web 2.0 is: <i>Users add value</i>. Web 2.0
    companies set inclusive defaults for aggregating data and building value as a
    side effect of ordinary use of the application. [T]hey build systems that get better the more people use them” (O’Reilly, 2005). This
    is another manifestation of what Dan Bricklin described as the ‘cornucopia of
    the commons’- where, “the act of using the database adds value to it” (Bricklin,
    2000; Mayfield 2006). In the Web 2.0 world, to use is to contribute. </p>
  <p>The old dichotomies of active and passive participation
    inherited from the traditional mass broadcasting paradigm are too simplistic to analyse user goals and experiences in
    participative networked systems. Linear ladder or pyramid constructs are
    equally inadequate for the task. </p>
  <p>In any case, we should also always bear in mind that the
    use of social media technologies is evolving rapidly. What was true of 2007, or
    last month, is likely to have changed by the end of the year. It’s difficult to
    pin down a moving target with any accuracy. What we need are explanatory
    methods that are fluid, flexible and multi-dimensional rather than rigid and
    uni-linear.</p>
  <h2>Constructs of Participation </h2>
  <p>The tendency to describe user activity in social media
    spaces within narrow, linear models of participation appears to be the result
    of a conflation of organisational objectives with those of users. Forrester’s
    ladder and Simon’s pyramid suggest that users will gravitate to <i>more</i> or to <i>more intense</i> participation, because that is the hope of the
    organisation: to increase the intensity and benefits of participation to ever
    greater levels amongst ever greater numbers of people. </p>
  <p>From the users’ point of view, it is not that simple.
    Participation is infinitely more flexible and reflects people’s needs and
    purposes at differing times. Modes of behavior are not fixed nor mutually exclusive. Forrester’s overlapping segments recognize this; yet their
    ladder implies something much more rigid. </p>
  <p>While such models reflect a legitimate concern with
    capturing and measuring organisational value from user participation (whether
    financial, promotional, or social - for the public good), their emphasis is on
    pushing more users up the ladder or the pyramid. That may be the organisation’s
    ‘reward’ for a successful on-line strategy or a cool Web 2.0 service but, <i>for the users</i>, motivations and rewards
    are far more complex. We suggest instead that it is essential to separate the
    organisational and user perspectives on participation in any discussion of the
    purpose and achievements of social media. </p>
  <h3>The museum view: from interaction to participation and relationship </h3>
  <p>Museum constructs of audience participation have a long
    and complex history, which predates social media, the Web and computers
    generally. For decades museums have wrestled with the baggage of past
    constructs and conceits about ‘visitors’, ‘users’ and ‘audiences’ and their
    relationship to the museum (McPherson, 2006; Peacock and Brownbill, 2007). Web
    2.0 is simply the latest catalyst to foment those debates and challenge
    established patterns of relating.</p>
  <p>One of the earliest attempts to grapple with the concepts
    of what a more participative Web environment would mean for museums was
    suggested at this conference in 2003. Gail Durbin observed a tendency to
    confuse and conflate terms when describing the experience of new media.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Like &#39;access&#39;, the word interactivity is used loosely. For
    some it means anything in a museum context making use of new media. To me it is
    any use of new media where the user can influence the outcome, although the degree of interactivity may be limited by the programme.
    Participation in a web context is a particular kind of interactivity
    which encourages a sense of involvement. Here outcome is dependent on
    the opportunities individuals have to exercise their imagination and
    creativity. (<i>Durbin, 2003)</i></p>
  <p>‘Interaction design’ has its origins twenty years ago as
    the study of computer programming routines that would interact with human behavior.
    It follows in the tradition of human-computer interaction (HCI) research which
    during its halcyon years from the 1960’s to the 1980’s brought forth such
    crucial inventions as the on-screen manipulation of objects, the mouse, ‘windows’,
    text editing and hypertext (Myers, 1998). In museum spaces, computerised
    ’interactive’ experiences were, first and foremost, closed systems with a fixed
    array of potential pre-scripted outcomes. As Durbin intimates, the idea of
    interaction that the participative Web presents is something different, an
    open-ended one, shaped more by the user than by the program presets.</p>
  <p>Participation, Web 2.0<i> </i>style, has the qualities of emergence and self-organisation common to all
    open-ended, complex systems (Gribbin, 2004). In creating or contributing to
    social media environments, museums can no longer program the outcome of the
    interactions around them or between them and the public. Designing for
    participation means enabling rather than scripting the outcomes.</p>
  <p>‘Participation design’ should not be confused with
    ‘participatory design’ which has a longer history, beginning as a collaborative
    process within workplaces, particularly in Scandinavia in the 1960s (DePaula,
    2004). Participatory design is more of a methodology for ensuring those
    affected by design decisions are able to have input into them. </p>
  <p>Designing for participation is, instead, as much an act of
    faith as a rational planning method. It represents and requires a ‘radical
    trust’ in the fluid, unpredictable and open-ended dynamics of community
    (O’Reilly, 2005; Spadaccini and Chan 2007). And conversely, on-line communities
    that are facilitated or supported by museums must also trust the museum to act
    in good faith. Participation depends on a sustained pact of mutual trust and
    reciprocity, rather than the pre-scripted and didactic communications more
    characteristic of museums. Here participation starts to sound much more about relationships
    than simple interactions.</p>
  <p>While there are a rapidly growing number of museum Web 2.0
    initiatives, the benefits of participation have mainly been discussed from an organisational
    perspective. Seb Chan (2008) has gone some way to providing an insight into
    possible measurements of success. In this analysis, he alludes to four ways in
    which organisations can measure the success of their social media initiatives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Self management: the extent to which the
      community participates in sharing and creating knowledge;</li>
    <li>Ambient presence: the frequency and/or
      consistency of organisational presence on other social networking sites (ie:
      other blogs, <i>Flickr</i>, <i>YouTube</i> etc) and the amount of
      information available on aggregator sites such as <i>Technorati</i>;</li>
    <li>Strategic conversion: mechanisms for tracking
      the convergence and connection between physical and on-line visitation; and</li>
    <li>Citations: the frequency and quality of
      citations in sites such as <i>Wikipedia</i>,
      in academic papers and in commercial settings. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Chan’s analysis provides a useful correlation between organisational
    effort (human resource, budget and timescale) and reward. From this
    perspective, user experience is not nearly as important as the value of the
    venture in organisational terms. The issue here is that should organisations <i>only</i> use measures such as those
    suggested by Chan, they continue to run the risk of creating content and infrastructure which does not meet user needs.</p>
  <p>If we are to shift from an organisation-centric to a
    user-centric view of the Web 2.0 museum experience, we need new methods for
    understanding the user experience and new ways of relating to individuals and
    the on-line ‘crowd’. Richard Lanham, in <i>The
      Economics of Attention</i> (2006) describes the transition of contemporary
    society from an economy of ‘stuff’ to an “attention economy” where information
    is in super abundance and what is in scarce supply is human attention, not
    goods. In Lanham’s view the challenge for organisations is to create and
    sustain compelling ‘attention structures’ (Lanham: 21). If museums are going to
    capture and hold attention with our participative Web initiatives, we need to
    pay a lot more attention to what users think and do.</p>
  <h3>Why participate? The tangle of user motivation and rewards</h3>
  <p>Any discussion of user motivation to participate in social
    media will inevitably trace its roots to the discipline of psychology. Much of
    what we understand and assume about human behavior has been grounded in the
    precepts of behaviorism and its successors. One of the most contentious and
    long-running debates within psychology arises from the attempts within the
    discipline to shrug off the reductionist, mechanical assumptions of behaviorism
    (Kohn, 1993; Reiss, 2004). Breaking away from determinist constructs such as
    Thorndike’s ‘law of effects’ (1898) and Skinner’s focus on ‘operant
    conditioning’ and ‘schedules of reinforcement’, a more complex view of human
    motivation emerged in the 1940s and 50’s (Maslow, 1943; Herzberg, 1959). Instead
    of the belief that people simply respond to the promise of reward in a
    mechanical way as the behaviorists asserted (eg. ‘The Incentive Theory of
    Motivation’ or ‘Expectancy Theory’), the concept of intrinsic motivation took
    shape. Intrinsic motivation is the idea that people choose behaviors to meet
    internal drives or needs. It is typically contrasted with extrinsic motivation,
    which has its source outside the individual; eg. the promise of praise or material reward, or conversely, fear of punishment.</p>
  <p>These concepts are now commonplace, although sometimes
    confused and still much debated by psychologists. People such as Alfie Kohn
    have argued that even the concept of intrinsic motivation is contestable. “What
    appears at first blush an uncomplicated idea reveals itself as a tangle of
    possibilities, all of which have substantive implications for what we counter
    pose to the use of rewards” (Kohn 1993: 276). Kohn and others have also pointed
    to repeated experimental evidence that shows extrinsic rewards appear to
    diminish levels of intrinsic motivation and satisfaction. This, contends Kohn,
    is proof that the ‘carrot and stick’ reward systems which
    predominate in education and management are ineffective and probably
    counterproductive in motivating and satisfying people.</p>
  <p>Reiss (2005) however argues that the bifurcation of
    intrinsic and extrinsic motivation represents a false dichotomy. The tendency
    to divide the recognised reinforcers of human behavior such as play,
    competition, autonomy, food and sex into one or the other category also leads to
    a confusion of means and ends. He argues that “motivation is fundamentally multifaceted and cannot be reduced to just two
    sources” (2005: 7). </p>
  <p>There is also much confusion over pleasure as the
    motivation rather than the reward for a particular behavior. According to Reiss,
    “Enjoyment is rarely intrinsic to behavior; rather, enjoyment almost always depends
    on the satiation of a desire, need, or motive of the individual” (2005: 4). His
    own theory of motivation identifies 16 basic drives motivating human behavior (Reiss,
    2004: 187).  The six most relevant
    as possible motives driving on-line participation are<i> power (mastery)</i>; <i>curiosity</i>; <i>status</i>; <i>social contact</i>; <i>order</i>; and <i>acceptance</i>.</p>
  <p>Museums have long wrestled with the question of motivation
    in seeking to understand on-site visitation. We would argue that the complex
    reasons for engaging with museums are often difficult to define because of our
    ongoing confusion about the nature of motivation. A different perspective on motivation,
    particularly when it is not related to employment conditions or security,
    personal safety and well-being, or family issues,
    might position on-line participation in a social realm more easily explored
    through notions of entertainment and experience (Gilmore and Pine, 2007). </p>
  <p>Ellenbogen et al (2008) have concluded that in respect of
    museum visitation, ‘psychographic variables’; that is, those which describe
    people’s psychological and motivational characteristics, are far more
    predictive than demographic variables (Ellenbogen et al:188).
    They have proposed seven categories of motivation for visiting museums:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Entertainment; </li>
    <li>Social;</li>
    <li>Learning; </li>
    <li>Life Cycle; </li>
    <li>Place; </li>
    <li>Practical; </li>
    <li>Context or content.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These motives too might be classified according to notions
    of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and reward, or within the entertainment
    and experience formulation of Gilmore and Pine, or within Reiss’ framework of
    basic drives.</p>
  <p>As another perspective on motivation in on-line spaces, Lanham
    (2006) offers a three-point ‘motive spectrum’ for human behavior that he uses
    to explain people’s participation in the ‘attention economy’. At one end, labeled
    ‘<i>game’</i>; he describes the competitive
    “struggle to survival and prevail”; in the middle, ‘<i>purpose</i>’, describing the practical motives of everyday life; and at
    the other end, ‘<i>play</i>’, the things
    that people ‘just like’ to do (ibid: 169). The important thing about Lanham’s
    typology is how it allows for the flow of motivation and behavior between these
    three states. Motivation is multi-faceted; a single activity may invoke all
    three states.</p>
  <p>In terms of motivation as it affects on-line
    participation, Waterson (2006) has summarised the findings of five case studies
    examining participant motivation in on-line communities. Those studies
    highlighted ten common motivations for participants in nine different communities which ranged from usenet groups to wiki-based
    communities of practice:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Seeking information for personal benefit;</li>
    <li>Opportunities to exchange ideas and find
      solutions to problems;</li>
    <li>Fun;</li>
    <li>Opportunity for dialogue;</li>
    <li>Opportunity to help others;</li>
    <li>Chance to gain respect and visibility within a
      community;</li>
    <li>Seeking to build social cohesion within a group;</li>
    <li>Shared sense of identity and belonging;</li>
    <li>Raise profile with peers;</li>
    <li>Commitment to shared values and norms.
      (Waterson, 2006: 334)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These observations strongly echo the types of motives
    cited above from Reiss’ list of basic desires. Interestingly
    too, some of the studies analysed by Waterson also observed how motivations
    (and rewards) evolved over time. This makes clear once again the shifting,
    dynamic nature of individual motivation and its interaction with the group
    dynamics of on-line communities.</p>
  <p>Bishop (2007) argues that we need to focus on goal-driven
    rather than need-driven explanations of user motivation and behavior. </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Theories that suggest that individuals are needs-driven and so-called needs are met in the order of a
    hierarchy are not suitable for online communities. It is quite likely that
    community members will desire to do two things at the same time, something that
    needs-based theories do not take into account. Theories that suggest that
    individuals are goal-driven are more appropriate for online communities as
    users will develop and change goals based on their interactions in the online
    community. (<i>Bishop, 2007: 1890</i>).</p>
  <p>Perhaps because of this confusion, we are yet to research
    adequately the possible motivations for participation in museum initiated on-line
    communities. Initial findings from the <i>steve.museum</i> tagging project (<a href="../http://www.steve.museum/">http://www.steve.museum</a>)
    have suggested one apparent motivator that may be particularly relevant for museums,
    that of institutional affiliation. In her analysis of participation in that
    project, Jennifer Trant observes that:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Motivations for tagging are often unclear. While the
    literature of tagging and folksonomy points initially to a selfish motivation for
    personal information management, the members of the steve.museum team have
    posited another, more altruistic motivation for tagging museum collections.
    People may just want to “help out” museums. (<i>Trant, 2009: 37</i>)</p>
  <p>Further research is required to identify and test such
    motivations and to examine their interaction with other factors, both intrinsic
    and extrinsic.</p>
  <p>In looking for theoretical guidance to explain, model and
    evaluate museum Web 2.0 initiatives from a user point of view, we face several
    obstacles and gaps. Traditional media and communications theory struggles to
    accommodate network dynamics in its conceptions of user behavior, as it is
    grounded in a functionalist rather than a social view of technology (Schrock,
    2009). Similarly, the discipline of psychology is caught up in its own
    wrangling over the core constructs of motivation and reward. What is needed to
    explore and explain social media more effectively are new theoretical models of
    user behavior in social media spaces that take account of the social dynamics
    of these spaces and of the motivations and rewards shaping individual behavior.</p>
  <h3>Designing for sustainable Web 2.0 participation </h3>
  <p>One of the most promising models for understanding and
    perhaps designing spaces for participation and collaboration comes from the
    observations of Clay Shirky in his account of the changes enabled by social
    media, <i>Here Comes Everybody: The Power of
      Organizing without Organizations </i>(2008).</p>
  <p>Shirky argues that three elements are needed to make the
    complex blend of social and technological factors that comprise social media
    work. Those instances that flourish, he says, demonstrate</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">a successful fusion of a plausible
    promise, an effective tool and an acceptable bargain with the users. The
    promise is the basic ‘why’ for anyone to join or contribute to a group. The
    tool helps with the ‘how’ – how will the difficulties of co-ordination be
    overcome, or at least be held to manageable levels? And the bargain sets the
    rules of the road: if you are interested in the promise and adopt the tools,
    what can you expect, and what will be expected of you? (<i>Shirky: 260</i>)</p>
  <p>We can see evidence of Shirky’s trio - <i>promise</i>, <i>tool</i> and <i>bargain </i>- at
    work in some current examples of museum Web 2.0 initiatives. </p>
  <p>Promise is “the essential piece, the thing that convinces
    a potential user to become an actual user” (Shirky: 261). Dawson et al (2008)
    describe how the Canadian Science and Technology Museum
    Corporation’s offer of a forum for comments, discussion and uploading images
    through a <i>Facebook</i> presence was
    embraced enthusiastically by its public members. The implicit promise
    here was of greater involvement in the museum and new ways to maximise the
    benefits of membership. </p>
  <p>Direct appeal seems to be effective at conveying a
    promise. In an examination of museum videos on <i>YouTube,</i> Alexander et al (2008) note a higher level of response to
    videos posted when a direct call for submissions has been made.</p>
  <p>Evaluation of the Library of Congress’ (LoC) <i>Flickr</i> Pilot Project which
    led to the launch of the <i>Flickr</i> <i>Commons (</i><a href="../http://www.flickr.com/commons">http://www.flickr.com/commons</a><i>)</i> notes that </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">We appear to have tapped into the Web community’s
    altruistic substratum by asking people for help. Taggers tag for a variety of
    different reasons, and this diversity is part of what makes Flickr photo
    collections valuable to a wide membership base. The original Flickr blog post
    and text announcing the Commons (“This is for the good of humanity, dude!!”)
    struck just the right chord. People wanted to participate and liked being asked
    to contribute. (<i>Springer et al. 2008: 15</i>)</p>
  <p>Similarly, the National Library of Australia’s <i>Flickr</i> initiative, <i>Click and Flick</i>, (<a href="../http://www.pictureaustralia.org/contribute/individual.html">http://www.pictureaustralia.org/contribute/individual.html</a>) which provided
    inspiration for the LoC pilot, promised the opportunity “for individuals to
    help build the nation’s visual record” (Hooton, 2006). As Shirky observes in
    respect of <i>Wikipedia</i>, the promise of
    contributing to something larger than oneself is compelling for many: “if you
    help, this will get better” (Shirky, 278).</p>
  <p>The second of Shirky’s elements, <i>tool</i>, is a little more straight forward.
    Many Web 2.0 platforms provide a standard set of tools; eg. profiles,
    messaging and friending on social networking sites such as <i>Facebook</i> and <i>MySpace</i>. Different
    blogging and wiki tools may vary in terms of the range and complexity of
    features they provide, but they share common core functionality. However the
    availability of open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that typifies Web
    2.0 means many of these platforms and tools can be customized and personalized
    well beyond generic functionality. The <i>ArtShare</i> application (<a href="../http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=7723691927&amp;ref=pr">http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=7723691927&amp;ref=pr</a>)
    designed by the Brooklyn Museum for <i>Facebook</i> users enables people to collect and upload and share artwork from museums and
    their peers. ArtShare aims to give users greater freedom to use museum content,
    allowing them “to display their favorite paintings, photographs, and objects on
    their own terms and in their own spaces” (Bernstein, 2008).</p>
  <p>Similarly, in Australia, the Powerhouse Museum’s OPAC 2.0,
    built on top of the museum’s collection database (<a href="../http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/">http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/</a>) provides tools
    for users to add their own keyword ‘tags’ to collection items. This tool was
    designed to “provide a means to improve serendipitous discovery and enhance the
    ability of users to find related objects and explore deeper into a collection” (Chan,
    2007). Once again, the benefits of such a tool go in three directions: the
    contributing <i>individuals</i> get to share
    their knowledge or just participate; the <i>museum’s</i> store of information is enhanced and the <i>group</i> of users visiting the site benefit from the aggregated results of their and
    others’ contributions. What we don’t yet understand is how these interactions
    and transactions spur and sustain each other.</p>
  <p>The third of Shirky’s keys to success, the idea of the <i>bargain</i>,
    is the one that is most complex and perhaps the one that brings up the most
    issues for museums. This is the place where mutual expectations of the host,
    participant and group are established and enforced. As Shirky notes, on-line
    communities such as <i>Wikipedia</i> have
    evolved sophisticated ‘rules of engagement’ to clarify those expectations. One
    of the foundations of that bargain is the wiki principle “that you can edit
    anyone else’s writing and anyone else can edit yours” (ibid 271).</p>
  <p>In establishing effective ‘bargains’ within social media
    spaces, museums face three key sets of issues which often prove problematic:
    copyright and ownership of posted material (both the museum’s and that of
    contributors); whether to provide a voice of expert authority, and whether or
    how to moderate interactions, especially in the case of publicly funded
    institutions. </p>
  <p>But these issues are not insurmountable. In fact the
    challenge of striking the right bargain may be where the real value of Web 2.0
    is created. <i>Flickr Commons</i> is perhaps
    the best example so far of where the bargain has been made clear and simple and
    in the process, has moved institutions beyond their comfort zones. As the LoC
    evaluation notes, their <i>Flickr</i> pilot
    “resulted in many positive yet unplanned outcomes” (Springer et al: 2).</p>
  <p>What the idea of the bargain does focus attention on is
    the need to fully understand the mutual expectations and boundaries of all
    participants in social media spaces. The bargain aspect is also where
    organisations like museums have to come to grips with what <i>they</i> are willing and able to offer to support and sustain
    participation. As the name ‘bargain’ suggests, it’s all about negotiation.</p>
  <p>Shirky’s three elements are a useful starting point for
    understanding the dynamics of social media systems from a user point of view. However,
    the combination of promise, tool and bargain cannot be used as a simple recipe,
    because the interactions among the different components are too complex (ibid:
    260-1). In fact, it is a substantial balancing act and requires significant
    effort to sustain. “First,” as Shirky says “because getting each of these
    elements right is actually quite challenging, while getting all of them right
    is essential. Second, as groups themselves, the complexity comes not just from
    elements but from their interactions.”  (ibid: 277) Once again, it is clear
    that to be sustainable, participation environments must be designed and managed
    as dynamic systems, not as fixed structures.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: Some Answers, More Questions</h2>
  <p>What Shirky’s model suggests about social media is that we
    should view these spaces as living systems, or what we might call an <i>ecology</i><i> of attention</i>, to rephrase Lanham’s idea
    of attention structures. The challenge for museums therefore is learning to
    support the health of that ecology by maintaining the right level of
    contribution, not seeking to extract too much and working thoughtfully with the
    other processes of that system; namely, individual
    motivation and group dynamics. So far, museums have been overly focused on what
    they themselves might get from social media systems, not on understanding and
    nurturing their dynamics. It is time to examine more carefully the interests,
    motivations and rewards that drive the other parts of these emerging systems.</p>
  <p>In order to advance that understanding, we propose further
    research to address the following questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the stated and implicit assumptions
      about participation in museum Web 2.0 projects?</li>
    <li>What do they offer in terms of rewards for
      participation?</li>
    <li>How are they evaluated from the user point of
      view, if at all?</li>
    <li>Do they cater equally well for the needs of the ‘vital
      few’ and the ‘useful many’?</li>
    <li>Are they leveraging the ‘long tail of
      participation’ effectively by providing for and recognising different types of
      participation?</li>
    <li>What does the evidence show about the links
      between motivation and reward from the user point of view?</li>
    <li>How do individual motivations and rewards
      interact with the social dynamics of groups?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>From this research it should be possible to develop a practical
    framework to inform the planning, design and evaluation of museum social media
    activities from both the organisational and user perspectives. Such a framework
    will support the long-term success of such initiatives, based on a recognition of the subtle and complex interplay of
    motivations and rewards that sustain participation in social media spaces.</p>
