	    <h2 class="PaperTitle">Introduction</h2>
	    Cloud computing is a natural progression in the utility of
  computing. Early computers required that many users shared a single console. The
  advent of personal computing brought the convenience into our homes. More
  recently, the Internet has changed the ways we connect to information and each
  other. Museums provide access to their collections and programs by hosting Web sites
  and applications for the public to use. Many museums manage these servers
  themselves or through vendors which can prove to be expensive and
  time-consuming. Cloud computing now allows us to offload this burden, which in
  turn can save museums time, energy, and money. Though many on-line users may
  not realize it, over half of them are already using cloud resources (Horrigan,
  2008) in some shape or form.
	   <p></p><p>
  Academics have been touting the promise of distributed
    computing models for many years. The complexity and unreliability of these grid
    computing models prevented content providers from hosting production quality
    content on them. In recent years commercial vendors have appeared with
    computing services that offer service level agreements and guaranteed uptime. In
    addition to the requisite reliability needed for production systems, cloud
    computing services now also offer simple interfaces for managing and
    administrating these systems. These commercial solutions also provide far
    cheaper alternatives for museums to host their software systems on (MacManus,
    2009). One might wonder why this is the case. Perhaps we can think of Cloud
    Computing like other utilities we already pay for, such as natural gas or
    electricity: it is far cheaper to pay only for what you use and offload the
    maintenance and reliability issues to the gas or electric company. Likewise,
    many smaller museums do not employ the expertise required to run a server room,
    nor do they have the budget to maintain it. Cloud computing offers a chance for
    even the smallest of museums to take advantage of world class computing
    hardware and IT management infrastructures, while paying for only the resources
    they actually use. 
 </p>
  <h2>Cloud Computing Survey</h2>
  Cloud computing offerings can be loosely assigned to two
    specific categories: Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service
    (PaaS). SaaS systems require users to deploy software according to a particular
    interface in order to host applications. PaaS systems typically allow access to
    virtual hardware devices that do not restrict the software toolsets that can be
    used. Both approaches come with distinct advantages and disadvantages. By
    providing API only access, SaaS implementations can provide features for the developer
    to build upon, scalability being among the most important. Allowing the Cloud
    to control where your data is stored and where your applications are hosted via
    a SaaS system removes a great amount of workload and complexity for the
    developer. These benefits do not come without a price, however. SaaS systems
    can affect the portability of your application, making it difficult to migrate
    between system offerings. Having your application tied to a specific API means
    the cost penalty to move your application to another service becomes quite
    large. PaaS systems do not suffer from this portability issue because they
    offer hardware infrastructure as opposed to API’s. PaaS systems give developers
    and system administrators complete control over the devices which house their
    applications. Moving your application from one service provider to another
    might be as simple as copying your virtual machine image between services.
   <p></p><p>
  Google App Engine (<a href="../http://code.google.com/appengine">http://code.google.com/appengine</a>)
    is a primary example of a SaaS system. It offers developers API access to data
    storage, user authentication, caching, and more. Applications are written using
    Python, the preferred programming language of the system, while the cloud takes
    care of scaling and load balancing issues for you. This easy scalability comes
    at the price of flexibility. Google’s AppEngine restricts the developer to the
    execution of pure Python applications. Developers cannot access local files or
    sockets, and user software can only run in response to a Web request for a few
    seconds. These restrictions prohibit any form of scheduled processing or large
    batch operations. Given its current offering, Google claims that developers can
    provide roughly 5 million page views per month for free. While the price is
    right, portability becomes very difficult. If Google decides App Engine is no
    longer viable to their business model, moving to a different service would
    require a complete rewrite of all application software.
   </p><p>
  Azure Services Platform (<a href="../http://www.microsoft.com/azure/">http://www.microsoft.com/azure/</a>)
    is Microsoft’s offering in the cloud computing space. It is a collection of
    services that aim to ease the transition to the cloud for developers by using
    toolsets they are already familiar with. Using developer tools such as the .NET
    library and Visual Studio, users can utilize on-demand computing and storage
    services. This hybrid approach allows developers to host applications in house,
    while off-loading some resources as cloud services. In addition to these
    resource offerings, Microsoft adds value to these services by providing hosted
    solutions for Exchange, Office, and SharePoint.
   </p><p>
  Amazon Web Services (AWS –
    <a href="../http://aws.amazon.com/">http://aws.amazon.com</a>) is the premier cloud computing platform. It was
    launched in 2002 and offers the use of the same global data centers that Amazon
    uses to host its own Web site. AWS offers everything from traditional
    infrastructure services such as computing and storage to the more
    non-traditional services such as credit card transaction services, a content
    delivery network, and human intelligence processing. All of these services are
    accessed through the Web using SOAP or REST protocols.
   </p><p>
    The infrastructure of Amazon’s Web Services consists primarily
    of the Simple Storage Service (S3), an unlimited data storage facility,
    Cloudfront, a content delivery network for data stored on S3, and the Elastic
    Compute Cloud (EC2), a scalable virtual machine hosting platform. In addition
    to these, there is a database service called SimpleDB, and a primitive queue
    messaging service called the Simple Queue Server (SQS).
   </p><p>
    Real world companies have been using Amazon’s Web Services
    for quite some time to reduce costs and routine maintenance. The Web software
    development firm 37signals uses S3 to store well over 1 terabyte of data
    (Amazon, 2009) for their popular project management system called Basecamp. The
    Indianapolis Motor Speedway uses S3 as well to house a century’s worth of
    digital images (Amazon, 2009). In addition, they use EC2 to host their Web sites,
    stream live events, and drive live scoring applications. Paying for only what
    you use is vital to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway since they see extremely
    large spikes right before and during an event, but otherwise have relatively
    moderate Web traffic.
   </p><p>
    Cloud computing offers advantages and disadvantages for
    museums. The Cloud’s pay-as-you-go model and the embedded costs for energy and
    maintenance of these systems make price a clear advantage. Scalability and ease
    of deployment is perhaps the most enticing benefit of using Cloud Computing
    services. If a physical server were to run out of disk space at your museum, it
    could take days to get new drives shipped. In the cloud, virtually infinite
    amounts of disk space are available at a moment’s notice. Server machines local
    to your museum frequently feature hot-swappable or redundant disk arrays
    (RAID), but these systems are expensive and require staff to maintain them. In
    the rare case that a physical machine went down on Amazon’s EC2, you could
    start a new instance of your machine within minutes using your virtual machine
    image. S3 becomes your redundant backup for not only your data, but also the
    actual configuration and operating system of the machine itself.
   </p><p>
  In addition to the operational advantages of cloud
    computing, the environmental impact of using services in the cloud is another
    compelling reason museums might wish to make the switch. The ability to leverage
    the efforts of data center managers to improve the energy efficiency of their
    systems means that museums can depend on others to help reduce their own energy
    footprints. Google, for instance, has been proactive in designing energy
    efficient data centers (Google, 2009). They monitor their systems rigorously
    and have demonstrated that by using chilling towers; they are already running
    at efficiencies that the EPA deemed optimistic for 2011 (Google, 2009).
    Meanwhile, joint research by Pennsylvania State University and Microsoft has
    explored the impact of application consolidation on energy efficiency
    (Srikantaiah, 2008). This paper describes a simple energy-optimizing algorithm
    for allocating resources in a cloud, but they note a number of complications
    that need to be addressed to handle optimization practically in real data
    centers. Because reducing energy use saves money, it is in the economic and
    social interests of service providers to continue researching and implementing
    new methods to improve efficiency.
 </p><p>
  Museums must also understand some of the disadvantages and
    limitations of cloud computing before making the decision to move some of their
    facilities to the cloud. Data security is always an issue when storing your
    data on machines you don’t control. There are many types of museum data which
    are intended for public consumption. For these types of data security is less
    of a concern than it might be for most businesses. When storing data in the
    cloud, physical security is limited to that of the provider’s server rooms. Data
    will more than likely be stored on shared machines and may be intermixed across
    physical disks with information from other customers. Data transfer in and out
    of the cloud will pass over the Internet and therefore be subject to whatever
    level of secure transfer is used for that. For museum data meant for public
    consumption, many of these risks are moot; however, museums should tread
    carefully when considering moving more sensitive data into the cloud until more
    appropriate tools for data security are developed. The existence of appropriate
    backup solutions is more of a problem for museums wishing to make the jump. It
    is not enough to trust that the service provider will safeguard your data. Museums
    will want to ensure that cloud based data storage is also integrated with a
    larger institutional strategy for data backup and retention. Museums will also
    want to consider the intended use of the Web service with regard to bandwidth. Since
    bandwidth costs are variable with most cloud computing services, applications
    which require frequent data transfer between the cloud and the museum might
    incur significant bandwidth charges. This will need to be considered in
    comparison to other cost savings to determine whether or not a locally hosted
    service may be more cost efficient.
   </p><h2>Case Study: ArtBabble.org</h2>
    During late 2008, the Indianapolis Museum of Art worked
    hard to create an on-line video Web site dedicated to art related content. ArtBabble
    (<a href="../http://www.artbabble.org/">http://www.artbabble.org</a>)
    runs entirely in the cloud and allows streaming of high definition video
    content in a scalable and cost-effective manner. Using services provided by
    Amazon’s Web Services, costs are minimized by only paying for bandwidth and
    storage used monthly. All videos are stored on S3 and most are publicly
    available for download. As displayed in Figure 1, the Web site is hosted on an
    EC2 instance running a virtual machine image of a typical LAMP
    (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) stack using Drupal (<a href="../http://www.drupal.org/">http://www.drupal.org</a>) as a content
    management system.  Video streaming
    is provided by running EC2 instances of images provided by Wowza Media Systems (<a href="../http://www.wowzamedia.com/">http://www.wowzamedia.com</a>).
    Wowza’s servers can stream content directly from S3 to end-users. Scaling is as
    easy as starting and terminating instances according to need. Streaming video
    offers advantages over progressive downloads, since a user can jump anywhere in
    the video immediately, and network usage is optimized. This in turn minimizes
    the bandwidth costs incurred by ArtBabble.

    <p class="caption">Fig 1: Network Layout for ArtBabble</p>
    Amazon’s EC2 offers a variety of instance types that vary
    the amount of memory, local storage, and network and disk I/O performance. In
    order to determine how to get the most performance for the least amount of
    money, we performed a benchmark test for running Drupal on the different
    instance types. The results of this benchmark can be seen in Table 1. Each
    instance was launched with a stock Amazon Machine Image running Fedora 8. Only
    Apache, Mysql, and Drupal were installed. The Drupal module, Devel, was used to
    generate 500 nodes with 10 comments per node. Using the Apache HTTP server
    benchmarking tool, (<a href="../http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html</a>)
    and a separate EC2 instance, 1000 requests with 3 concurrent requests at a time
    were made to the default Drupal front page. Using the results from the
    benchmark we can easily see that the c1.medium instance type gives the greatest
    performance. In addition, the m1.small instance type was found to have
    intermittent performance since it is given lower priority to network resources.
    Sites with moderate traffic should avoid hosting their Web site on this
    instance type.

    <p class="caption">Table 2: Sample Monthly Costs for ArtBabble</p>
    Museums can reduce their costs dramatically by hosting
    their Web sites and applications in the cloud. Most would only require a LAMP
    stack and not have the video storage or streaming needs of ArtBabble. Removing
    the video requirements would drive costs below $150 per month. Amazon Web
    Services has become mature and stable enough to host mission-critical
    applications, and it also provides the portability needed in case a better
    solution comes along.
   <p></p><h1>Conclusion</h1>
    As discussed in this paper, Cloud Computing technologies
    have reached a level of maturity which allows museums to take advantage of some
    significant improvements in many areas as compared to existing practice. The
    utility model of computing and storage provided by a pay-as-you-go business model
    allows museums to recoup costs associated with lightly utilized server
    resources. The environmental impact of moving computing resources into more
    efficient server environments and leveraging the economic incentives for
    service providers to decrease their energy costs allows museums to see positive
    changes concerning their energy footprint by adopting these technologies where
    possible. Advantages in scalability and ease of deployment of server resources
    dramatically simplify the administrative overhead for services which feature
    variable demand, or have very high uptime requirements. The middleware software
    tools provided by some service vendors provide time-saving and robust shortcuts
    for developing enterprise level tool suites for museums.
   <p></p><p>
  Museums will still want to think carefully about migrating
    data and services which require a higher level of physical and information
    security. A suitable long-term data preservation plan will need to be well
    understood, and bandwidth considerations for applications which require
    frequent or intensive data transfer between the museum and the cloud will need
    to be justified. 
 </p><p>
  That being said, there are many classes of applications
    which are good candidates for migration to the cloud. Certainly most museum Web
    sites could benefit from the flexibility that cloud computing provides.
    Considering that the majority of that information is meant for public access,
    issues of information security are not as much of a concern. Cloud-based
    storage solutions coupled with offsite storage strategies could provide a
    robust and cost effective on-line data replication facility for the vast numbers
    of images and multimedia produced in many museums. Applications such as those
    for booking tours, events, classes, and some e-commerce applications (with the
    exception of credit card processing) are also probably good candidates for
    migration. The flexibility of deployment using cloud computing services enables
    us to begin to think about hours within which these systems might be used. It
    would be possible, for instance, to think about a space scheduling application
    which only runs during normal business hours, thereby saving the museum up to
    66% of the cost of running a server for this purpose. Virtualization technologies
    in the machine room will offer some of these same benefits, but still require
    that the hardware and virtualization software be purchased, maintained, licensed,
    and managed by the museum.
 </p><p>
  In short, there are already many ways in which museums can
    take advantage of these tools for improving our practice. The business cases
    presented in the commercial market will continue to push this technology to
    solve some of the inherent problems related to security and backup. As these
    tools continue to mature, museums will certainly be there to take advantage of
    them
