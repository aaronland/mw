        <p class="AbstractText">This paper presents early results from a large,

		    of Minnesota), and the second part is an examination of the impact that Web 2.0
		    technologies have on museum practice (Museum of Life Science in North

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>In the last five years, a revolution has taken place on
		  the Internet with the advent of what has been called “Web 2.0.”Although exemplified
		  by the burgeoning number of wikis, RSS feeds, blogs, and user-driven Web sites,
		  Web 2.0 has come to be understood not only as a set of technological
		  applications but also as a philosophy (see O’Reilly, 2005). That is, Web 2.0
		  applications are said to embody a conceptual shift toward the Web as a platform
		  for sharing “objects” (such as content or information), with user-generated
		  content being just as important as content supplied by institutions. Museums
		  interested in building community and audiences have quickly realized the
		  potential of these new technologies and attitudes. Today most museums have an on-line
		  presence and are planning to experiment with the forms of interactivity that we
		  have now come to characterize as “Web 2.0” interactions. The push for
		  experimentation comes from museum staff as well as museum visitors who “no
		  longer accept being solely consumers of information” but want to contribute
	    their own experiences and interpretations (Barry, 2006, n.p.).</p>
		<p>Our study began with a simple question: amidst the hype
		  and excitement of these new technologies, what is really happening with and
		  through them? The considerable resources expended (including time, finances,
		  and personnel) suggest a clear and strong commitment from museums to pursue new
		  Web-based tools. Furthermore, there is a strong belief within the museum
		  community that this functionality has brought about dramatic changes in the
		  ways knowledge is shared, created, and co-created, as well as in the ways that
		  visitors interact not only with the museum but also with each other. However,
		  museum professionals largely agree that most of these claims are speculative or
	    based on anecdotal data. </p>
		<p>This paper presents early results from a large, multi-year
		  study of the impact of Web 2.0 technologies on museum learning and practice.
		  The larger two-part project closely examines the interactions that take place
		  on one science museum blog, <i>Science Buzz</i>,
		  associated with the Science Museum of Minnesota, while also tracing the impact
		  of Web 2.0 technology on physical museum practice at the Museum of Life and
		  Science in North Carolina. Here we report preliminary findings from our
	    examination of the discursive knowledge building activities that happen on <i>Science Buzz</i>. </p>
		<p>Our results to date suggest that the activity and
		  community that forms <i>Science Buzz</i> are
		  highly complex and variable. Some topics and threads attract a large number of
		  participants with diverse levels of knowledge and perspective who participate
		  from locations both inside and outside the physical museum. Furthermore,
		  argumentative strategies such as making claims are the most common discursive
		  moves on the Buzz blog. These reasoning strategies are the focus of many prior
		  discourse-based studies of concepts like “learning” in group environments. Yet
		  our analysis of the Buzz blog also shows a range of strategies that we
		  associate with constructing individual identities (more common) and group
		  identities (less common). These discourse strategies are often ignored in
		  studies of learning or knowledge construction, but they are clearly integral to
	    any understanding of on-line spaces made available by museums to the public.</p>
		<h2>Learning and Interaction</h2>
		<p>The relationship
		  between interactivity and learning or knowledge-building has been interpreted
		  and researched in several different contexts. Based on specific contextual
		  needs, the interpretation and focus of this research is varied, but research in
		  both science education and museum studies is useful for considering how
		  contributors to science museum blogs like <i>Science Buzz</i> may learn or
	    construct knowledge. </p>
		<p>Research in science
		  education has focused on the role of argumentation as a discourse type central
		  not only to the way that scientific knowledge develops and is articulated, but
		  also to how individuals can best learn about science interactively (e.g,
		  Driver, Newton, &amp; Osborne, 2000; Erduran, Simon &amp; Osborne, 2004;
		  Jiménez-Aleixandre, Rodríguez, &amp; Duschl, 2000). Educators have suggested
		  that learning science involves learning to talk and act like scientists by
		  practising reasoning and argumentation (Duschl et al, 1999). Such active
		  learning necessitates communicating with others in forums that allow for the
		  negotiation of information in open “cultures of inquiry” (p. 253) where “individuals contribute ideas, thinking, and
		  reasoning to a community-based, collaborative knowledge construction process” (Goldman, Duschl,
		    Ellenbogen, Williams &amp; Tzou,
	    2003, p. 254).</p>
		<p>While much research on science, argumentation, and interactive learning
		  has taken place in physical classroom spaces, research in the area of
		  computer-supported collaborative learning environments (CSCL) has drawn
		  attention to the advantages of on-line environments for approaches to
		  argumentation and science learning. These include the creation of archives as a
		  collective memory, the visualization of cognitive processes, the ability to
		  unite groups that are geographically distributed, and the linking of different
		  modes of communication (Andriessen et al, 2003; Zimmerman, 2005). Drawing on
		  these theories about the nature of CSCL learning, researchers have reported on
		  a number of structured on-line systems developed to facilitate individual and
		  group science learning by emphasizing the formation of argumentative discourse
		  through group conversations and writing projects (Scardamalia, 2002; DeVries et
	    al, 2002; Bell, 2000). </p>
		<p>What is lacking from traditional studies of argumentation in formal
		  science learning environments - especially those making use of CSCL tools - is
		  any description of the other kinds of discursive moves that participants make.
		  These studies tend to isolate argumentative discourse from other “social”
		  discourse that strays “off topic” or “off-task.” Research about learning in
		  informal environments like museums, however, shows that informal learners come
		  with very different kinds of commitments, relationships, motivations, and
		  learning tasks in mind. This attitude
		  toward learning relies on the idea that science understanding and learning
		  happens for “personal interest, need and/or curiosity” (Falk, Storksdieck,
		  &amp; Dierking, 2007, p. 455). As Falk, Storksdieck, &amp; Dierking (2007) state, &#34;Rather than framing our
		  efforts in communicating science, we would suggest that we think about offering
		  the public opportunities for engaging with, appreciating and better
		  understanding the science of interest and need to them&#34; (pp. 456-457). That
		  is, individuals learn about science to satisfy short-term personal needs rather
		  than long-term cultural or civic duties. Thus, it can be assumed that contributors to on-line science museum sites may
		  not always stay “on-topic” and that the additional motivations that may
		  accompany participation (e.g., wanting to make friends or join a community; wanting
		  to express oneself) would likely be tied to other kinds of discourse moves or
		  modes of interaction that vary considerably from those that accompany learners
	    in traditional classrooms.</p>
		<p>Existing research
		  within museum studies pays considerable attention to the way in which
		  individuals interact, employing visitor observation in the exhibit space and
		  post-visit surveys to measure the impact of “sociality” on learning (e.g., vom
		  Lehn, Heath, &amp; Hindmarsh, 2001; Hindmarsh, Heath, vom Lehn, &amp; Cleverly,
		  2005; Packer &amp; Ballantyne, 2005). A recent study regarding the effect of
		  interaction within the exhibit space of the Queensland Museum in Brisbane,
		  Australia, focused on the planning steps, engagement level, learning
		  experiences, and sustained memories of museum guests visiting in pairs or
		  alone. Packer and Ballantyne’s (2005) conclusions about the interactions, or “social
		  context,” of visitors in this study revealed that “solitary and shared learning
		  experiences can be equally beneficial, but in different ways” and that “there
		  may be a learning advantage in having access to a social context that is
		  consistent with the learner’s preferred approach” (p. 189). While some visitors
		  prefer experiencing the exhibit through “personal reflection without
		  distraction” (p. 189), others valued “being able to share the experience and
	    discuss ideas with others” (Packer &amp; Ballantyne, 2005, p. 190). </p>
		<p>Though this
		  research has been productive in exploring interaction that occurs in physical
		  exhibit space, the studies did not explore on-line interaction that revolves
		  around museum content and related topics. Researching digital
		  environments has always been extremely challenging due to the virtual and often
		  anonymous nature of the interactions. Recent research on interactive
		  technologies in museums has focused on the ability to expand the scope and
		  reach of the museum (Keene, 1998; Anderson 1999; Parry &amp; Sawyer, 2005),
		  user satisfaction (Goldman &amp; Waldman, 2002; Ockuly, 2003; Bartley &amp;
		  Hancock, 2006), or Web site design principles (accessibility, usability,
		  educational value). New trends in technology experimentation and research are
		  looking at the relationships between museums’ on-line and virtual spaces; learning
		  theories and relationships between learning styles and Web preferences
		  (Schaller, Allison-Bunnell, &amp; Borun, 2005); using technologies to make the
		  walls more permeable between permanent installations; and visitor contributions
		  between virtual experiences and on-site experiences. However, there is a
		  current lack of research that describes the discursive interactions that take
		  place when museums employ Web 2.0 tools for the purposes of learning and
	    knowledge-building.</p>
		<h2>Study Design and Methods</h2>
		<p>The study had two
		  objects of focus, one a technological environment and the other a museum. We
		  focused on <i>Science Buzz</i> as the
		  technological environment because of its value as an exemplar of best practices
		  on Web 2.0. For the museum environment, our focus is the North Carolina Museum
		  of Life and Science (MLS) because of their broad experimentation with a range
		  of technologies and practices which makes them a compelling site for an
	    examination of changes in museum practice.</p>
		<p>We have already
		  shared the simple question that motivated our inquiry: our desire to understand
		  what is really happening with and through new Web-based technologies. Our
		  operational questions maintain this descriptive focus with a particular
	    interest on learning and what we call the “co-construction of knowledge.”</p>
		<ol>
		  <li><b>What is the nature of the
		    community that interacts through <i>Science
		      Buzz</i>?</b> This is a descriptive question intended to develop a community
		    profile based largely on how that community interacts.</li>
		  <li><b>What is the nature of the on-line
		    interaction?</b> This is also a descriptive question intended to identify key
		    forms of interaction. In other words, what are people <b>doing</b> on-line?</li>
		  <li><b>Do these on-line
		    interactions support knowledge building for this user community? </b>The
		    discourse analysis will enable a description of the interactions and knowledge
		    building. </li>
		  <li><b>Do on-line interactions
		    support inquiry, learning, and change within the museum – ie, what is the
		    impact on museum practice? </b>As an institution changes its approach to
		    interactions with the public on-line, how do practices on-site change?</li>
	    </ol>
		<h3>Discourse Analysis</h3>
		<p>Our work with
		  Buzz was structured by our approach to discourse analysis. The key
		  characteristic of most Internet-based interactions - a characteristic that is
		  so common as to be invisible - is that they are written. In fact, the explosion
		  of Internet-based technologies should be credited with driving a renewed
		  interest in writing (as well as reading), although it is clear from public
		  discourse that the arguably radical changes from all this writing (e.g., anyone
		  can blog) are not widely perceived as positive. The essential point, however,
		  is that if one wants to describe, characterize, or understand what is happening
		  with Web 2.0 and other on-line interactions, one must do so via writing (a
		  statement that is particularly true if we take a broad semiotic view of writing
	    as encompassing the use of sound, image, and video). </p>
		<p>The fact of all this writing as the material of on-line
		  interactions means that we need good tools for analyzing the discourse. Discourse
		  analysis provides a structured and systematic way of reading and interpreting
		  the interactions. Discourse analysis is commonly used to characterize and understand
		  communication interactions (Fairclough,
		  1992; Dijk, 1997; Wood &amp; Kroger, 2000; Schiffrin, Tannen, &amp; Hamilton,
		  2001; Bazerman &amp; Prior, 2004; Gee, 2005) and has been used in
		  museums to study conversations as well (vom Lehn et al., 2001; Allen, 2002;
	    Ash, 2003).</p>
		<p>However, to the
		  best of our knowledge, there are no available analytical schemes suited to the
		  problems we are trying to solve in this study and responsive to the theory
		  driving the inquiry. Therefore, one of the primary tasks of this study was to
		  build an analytical tool that was descriptively accurate - that reflected and
		  was responsive to the discourse as people used it on <i>Science Buzz</i> - and
		  that was also theoretically driven by relevant work on the relationships
		  between communication practices and knowledge building. For instance, if we
		  look to work in formal argumentation for guidance and tools to address
		  relationships between argument (as a style of communication) and learning or
		  knowledge construction, most schemes are interested in formalized models of
		  interaction and on “knowledge” as an objective truth (Toulmin, 1958). That is,
		  the desired outcomes are very specific knowledge statements, and the discourse
		  models for arriving at those outcomes are often rule-bound. Very few “live,”
		  real world interactions fit within the boundaries of these interaction models
		  (yet we all still manage to arrive at meaningful understandings of the world
	    around us). </p>
		<p>A second primary
		  task is an attempt to disrupt what we see as a serious problem in how learning
		  is thought to happen in groups. As we have mentioned, there is significant work
		  in education that understands learning to be a function of argumentation. While
		  we agree with this basic premise, we suggest that learning theory takes a
		  narrow view of what counts as “argument” and therefore of what contributes to
		  learning. Argument theory is typically concerned only with what Aristotelian
		  rhetorical theory would understand as “logos” or reasoning; indeed, it is often
		  concerned with formal reasoning (Toulmin, 1958;<b> </b>van Eemeren, 1996; Bex et al, 2003). Clearly, rhetorical theory is
		  essential here, as it is the theoretical ground from which learning theory
		  based on argument has been built. But rhetorical theories of how people reach
		  understanding and agreement are layered and complex and account for issues
		  other than logos or pure reasoning. Rhetorical theory has always been concerned
		  with issues such as social and group norms, affect, and identity. In
		  Aristotelian rhetorical theory - to cite just one example - these issues were
		  attributed to either “ethos” or “pathos” and worked together with “logos” to
		  achieve aims. Our claim, here, is that any tool for analyzing discourse at it
		  really happens in the world (i.e., not in controlled environments) must be able
		  to account for a more complex mode of argumentation, one that accounts for
	    group dynamics and various identity issues. </p>
		<p>Table 1 provides
		  a view of the coding scheme developed for the Take Two project. The sources for
		  the scheme are both conceptual and data driven. Conceptually, we began with two
		  sources that were intellectually relevant to the project, to the practice of
		  discourse analysis, and to a layered rhetorical view of argumentation. We
		  utilized Gee (2005) for his focus on identity and activity in discourse
		  analysis. In an effort to come to a theoretically-driven understanding of
		  “co-construction of knowledge,” we utilized work on argumentation (e.g., Walton,
	    1996). But our primary resource is the work of Scardamalia (2002) and Bereiter (2002). </p>

		<p>The large body of work on argument and learning - and in
		  rhetorical theory - reinforces the importance of discourse acts like making
		  claims and the other issues in our “building an argument” category. Scardamalia
		  and Bereiter’s work on knowledge building provides the foundation for how we
		  operationalized both “learning” and “co-creation of knowledge.” Specifically,
		  we referenced their twelve principles of knowledge building for the practices
		  that we call “exploring new ideas,” but also to identify practices we have
		  listed as important for “community identity” (e.g., invitations and
		  constructing connections). Rhetorical theory provides the conceptual grounds
		  for our focus on individual and community identity as essential, but as will
		  become visible in our discussion of results, the Buzz discourse itself makes
		  obvious the importance of identity performances to any meaningful description
		  of on-line activity there. The content and shape of this coding scheme has been
		  significantly shaped by the data itself. As an understanding of argument that
		  leads to outcomes like “understanding,” “learning,” or “knowledge,” this scheme
	    is innovative and productive.</p>
		<h3>Sampling</h3>
		<p>Because of its size, <i>Science
		  Buzz</i> provided us with a significant sampling problem. The Buzz blog has
		  been running for 3 years and has over 1,500 threads. Coding all of the
		  discourse was not a pragmatic possibility. We made a number of decisions to
		  arrive at a sample. As a first step, we chose to look at threads in which the
		  initial post was followed by 15 or more comments that came from 3 or more
		  unique responders. Isolating threads that met this criteria still left us with
		  thousands of individual posts, and because we coded at the T-Unit level
		  (roughly a sentence), we were left with many thousands of units to
		  characterize. This was still too many for human coders to handle given the time
		  frame of the study, and so we were required to make additional sampling
		  decisions. There is actually very little published consensus for arriving at a
		  coding corpus in situations where a power analysis is not relevant, and so we
	    detail our decision-making here in the interests of scholarly disclosure.</p>
		<p>Collins et al (2007) write, for instance, that “the
		  criteria for sample size in qualitative research are not based on probability
		  computations but represent expert opinion” (p. 6) and go on to write the
	    following:</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">It should be noted that the issue of sample size in
		  qualitative research is a controversial one. However, as noted by Sandelowski
		  (1995), a general rule is that sample sizes in qualitative research should not
		  be too small that it is difficult to obtain data saturation, theoretical saturation,
		  or informational redundancy. At the same time, the sample should not be so
		  large that it is difficult to undertake a deep, case-oriented analysis. Teddlie
		  and Yu (2007) referred to this balancing act in qualitative sampling as the
	    representativeness/ saturation trade-off.</p>
		<p>In the most methodologically detailed studies that we
		  could find, O’Connor (2007) analyzed 10% of a larger sample (roughly 300 of
		  3,000 texts), but no explanation is provided for that 10% decision. In Juzwik et
		  al’s (2006) analysis of some 1,500 articles, her team coded all of them but
		  were only coding abstracts using a scheme that characterized discourse at units
		  larger than the T-Unit, resulting in many fewer units of analysis than in our
		  study. Therefore, in order to achieve “data saturation” and to achieve a
		  situation in which we began seeing “informational redundancy,” or the phenomena
		  of interest represented in its variation, we chose to subject 20% of posts with
		  more than 15 comments and 3 unique responders to coding. We additionally
		  compared this sample to the average number of posts per year on Buzz to ensure
		  that our sample accurately reflected Buzz blog threads from the early, middle,
	    and later stages of Buzz. </p>
		<h2>Results of Discourse Analysis of <i>Science
	    Buzz</i></h2>
		<p>In this section, we provide a general overview of our
		  results, organized in relation to the major headings in the coding scheme. Focusing
		  on the nature of discursive activity within the sample of Buzz blog threads,
		  these results begin to offer answers to the first and second of our analytical
		  questions related to community and activity. The percentages reported here are
		  based on the number of T-Units per blog thread that could be coded. That is,
		  the percentages reflect the number of T-Units with a particular code in the
	    larger sample of T-units.</p>
		<h3>Building an argument</h3>
		<p>The Buzz blog is a site where informal argumentation
		  happens. Lots of it. Perhaps not surprisingly, argumentation through making
		  claims, contributing evidence, calling on authority, and using other argumentative
		  strategies happens more frequently than any other single discursive category
		  for which we coded. Slightly over sixty percent of our total sample was coded
		  as “Building an Argument.” At the same time, however, across threads there is a
		  high degree of variation separating the most argumentative threads from the
		  least argumentative. Although the thread containing the least coded argument
		  units still contains a good deal of argumentative discourse, some threads are
		  obviously more oriented toward traditional argumentation than others are. The
		  least argumentative thread, which was 20.72% argumentative, for example, is a
		  thread about gephyrophobia, or the fear of crossing bridges, which was written
		  not long after the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River Bridge in
		  Minneapolis/St. Paul. The most argumentative thread, in which 96.15% of T-Units
		  were associated with argumentation, discussed whether “Eskimos have a hundred
	    words for Snow.” </p>
		<p>One clear descriptive statement that can be made about the
		  discourse on <i>Science Buzz</i> is that it
		  is highly argumentative, and within the category of argument, claim-driven.
		  Almost half of the time, in fact, writers use the Buzz Blog as a space for
		  making individual claims which we understand as statements of policy, fact, or
		  value. Claims come in a variety of forms on the Buzz Blog, sometimes stating
		  results of recent scientific research, sometimes taking a side in a scientific
		  fact or discovery, sometimes articulating much simpler beliefs that undergird
		  an argument, sometimes speculating about possible future effects of current
		  science problems, sometimes linking events in the past to events in the
		  present. For example, in “The Chicken and the Egg” thread, a thread that at the
		  time of writing contained 568 comments and delved into pretty much all there is
		  too know about chickens and eggs, claims from individuals might be observations
		  about why chickens might not be laying: “Chickens will also stop laying if
		  they’re ‘clucky’” or “Your chicken may be sick!!!” However, participants also provide
		  information as well, such as when one contributor referenced the Migratory Bird
		  Treaty Act in order to respond to another contributor’s question, stating that
		  “The only birds that don’t fall under this act are pigeons, sparrows, and
	    starlings, since these species are not native to the U.S.”</p>
		<p>While claims are a dominant argumentative move, they are
		  not the only move visible. Furthermore, they are not the strongest moves
		  possible: claims absent citations of evidence or nods to authority often make
		  for weak arguments. Buzz writers vary in the extent to which they back up their
		  claims with evidence or citations of authority. One particular sample thread
		  about potential changes to U.S. coins did not contain any direct citations of
		  evidence, while another thread in which commenters detail the lifestyle changes
		  they’ve made to conserve energy contained a full 33% of T-Units citing
		  evidence. Similarly, calls to authority ranged from a low of less than one
		  percent of T-Units coded to a high of 31%. While there is much variation in
		  these traditional strategies of supporting claims, we also used a coding
		  category called “argument-other” to capture argumentative strategies outside
		  more canonical categories (e.g., the use of “rhetorical questions” in a chain
		  of reasoning). The use of our argument-other coding category suggests that
		  writers on the Buzz Blog are using other strategies to develop and support the
		  claims they make. We believe that additional analysis will reveal useful categories
	    of argumentative work on Buzz.</p>
		<h3>Building the writer’s identity</h3>
		<p>The Buzz blog is also a site where writers build and
		  articulate individual identities, with this category being used to describe
		  over one-fourth (25.22%) of the total sample. As previously described, Buzz
		  writers most often built arguments in very direct ways - by positing direct
		  claims about the topic at hand rather than, for example, indirectly citing
		  evidence. However, identity-building moves were more frequently indirect. That
		  is, writers established who they were more often by articulating affect or by
		  using technology than they did by overtly articulating a role that they play,
		  citing their education or values, or by calling on their status or lack of
		  status. Of the 25% of T-Units that were associated with building individual
		  identities, 12.13% of T-Units were labeled as use of affect, 5.67% as using
		  technology, 3.93% as articulating values, and the remaining 3 percent were
	    distributed among articulating a role, status, education, or  place. </p>
		<p>Generally, building identity appears to be more an
		  implicit or indirect result of the site and the interaction that happens within
		  it than something that writers directly attempt to take part in. For example,
		  contributors rarely introduce themselves to conversations within the thread by
		  telling others about their life outside of the Buzz Blog. Instead, identities
		  emerge particularly through infusing their writing with emotion, humor, and
		  other markers of affect, as is particularly notable in threads like, “When you
		  die you become a colossal squid.” Even invocations of status, roles, and
		  education are often indirect and emerge in conventions of this kind of
		  conversation. For example, many identity building moves happen through the
		  signature lines writers use at the ends of posts, as in the case of one
		  particular contributor who declares her education and her expert status by
	    signing off as “University of Minnesota – Poultry Specialist.” </p>
		<p>While the number of direct citations of role, status, or
		  place is relatively infrequent, individuals are more likely to articulate
		  individual roles or experiences than to identify with the roles or experiences
		  that others have articulated. That is, they are more likely to deploy discursive
		  moves that are individual identity performances rather than moves that we
		  understand as “community building” (see below). Notably, it also seems likely
		  that a closer coding and examination of the “other” category may provide us
		  with new categories of individual identity-building that lie outside our current
	    scheme.</p>
		<h3>Exploring New Ideas</h3>
		<p>Based on our coding, we cannot claim that the Buzz blog is
		  a place where writers generally explore new ideas. Only 1.81% of T-Units were assigned
		  to this code. Although the discursive moves that we associate with exploring
		  new ideas are found infrequently in terms of percentage, they are present in
		  all but four sample threads. This code seems to work less to identify a common
		  discursive move across the sample than it does to point us to generative “sweet
		  spots” within each individual thread. It is likewise notable that writers were
		  most likely to explore a new idea by introducing their own individual ideas
		  than by improving on another’s idea or by engaging in the kinds of
		  conversations about definition or issue that constitute rhetorical stasis. For
		  example, phrases coded with the <b>exploring
		    new ideas</b> category often were prompted by genuine questions that the
		  individual contributor had related to the topic, like “Is “Eskimo,” as it is
		  applied to Eskimos (by themselves), a post-contact term?” or they brought a
		  previously unconsidered point of view into the conversation, as was the case
		  with the question, “What’s with health insurance?” that emerged in the thread
		  about whether or not to get a flu shot. From these kinds of examples, writers
		  often explore new ideas as the result of individual questions or ideas that
		  seem to come “out of the blue,” but at the same time invite participation from
		  others. These “exploring” discursive moves seem to promote and energize the
	    conversation that comes after them.</p>
		<h3>Building Community Identity</h3>
		<p>Finally, the Buzz blog is a site where writers engage in
		  building community. All threads contained community identity building moves,
		  and over ten percent of sampled threads (11.36%) were coded as contributing to
		  building community identity. Interestingly, much like in the case of building
		  individual writer’s identities, Buzz writers employed some types of community
		  building strategies much more than others. Specifically, writers constructed
		  community identity much more frequently by inviting participation or by
		  constructing connections to individuals or to prior statements, than they did
		  by articulating shared experiences or roles. When Buzz writers were building
		  community, they most often appeared to be doing it as a direct result of the
		  conversation at hand, not as an overt attempt to establish a relationship with
		  another individual or group within the thread. For example, writers often asked
		  questions that were more than just “rhetorical” argument builders - these
		  questions genuinely invited response from others. In just one thread related to
		  global warming (“Siberia is Warming Up”), community-building invitations ranged
		  from questions like, “What does the melt mean?” to “Will we survive?” to “when
		  will globle [<i>sic</i>] warming start to
	    impact the world ?”</p>
		<p>In sum, community-building moves most prevalent in our
		  sample were generally not moves of articulating group identities or boundaries,
		  claiming relationships, or claiming that the Buzz community constitutes a “we.”
		  Instead, community-identity building happened more frequently in terms of
		  momentary acknowledgments placed in the context of the conversation about the
		  topic or controversy being discussed, as individuals articulated personal
		  questions and esponded to other individuals directly, as well as to the
	    questions and comments that other contributors had previously posted. </p>
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>Our analytical work must be seen as preliminary. Our
		  analysis to date suggests that argumentative strategies such as making claims
		  are most common on the Buzz blog. These forms of reasoning strategies are the
		  focus of much of the discourse-based studies of concepts like “learning” in
		  group environments. Yet what our analysis of the Buzz blog also shows is a
		  range of strategies that we associate with constructing individual identities
		  (more common) and group identities (less common). Although it is preliminary,
		  our work has identified patterns in on-line activity yet to be identified in
		  museum studies. Moreover, we have paid attention to discourse moves that are
		  often ignored in studies of learning in both formal and informal settings. We
		  suggest that the range of identity performances is fundamental to on-line
		  community dynamics and integral to any understanding of activity and any
		  judgments made about the nature and status of the learning or knowledge
	    building in those communities.</p>
		<p>Based on the descriptive data shared above, we continue to
		  contemplate whether and how the co-construction of knowledge takes place on <i>Science Buzz</i>. Based on the
		  aforementioned theories of knowledge construction from Bereiter and
		  Scardamalia, discursive acts related to exploring new ideas and creating a group
		  of people working together are crucial. While these moves were not dominant on <i>Science Buzz</i> in terms of the frequency,
		  they were present across threads. Community building moves, in particular,
		  appear related to the activity of discussing current and past science topics in
		  a forum like <i>Science Buzz. </i>That is,
		  building community was not an end in itself, but rather an activity in
		  conjunction with discussing or debating ideas.<i> </i>Critically, building community in the service of discussing ideas
		  is foundational to any co-constructing activity, and we see the presence of
		  community building moves as an especially positive feature of what is happening
		  as a result of the implementation of Web 2.0 technology in this particular on-line
		  museum site. Because we believe these to be important issues for museums today,
	    our ongoing analytical work will focus on the dynamics described here.</p>
