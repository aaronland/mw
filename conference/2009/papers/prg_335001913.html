<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Smithsonian American Art Museum hosted the Alternate
    Reality Game (ARG) “Ghosts of a Chance” between July 18 and October 25, 2008.
    The project also included a module version of the game, which is run on a
    recurring and ongoing basis in the museum. Alternate Reality Games are
    interactive stories that take place in the real world and in real-time, using
    primarily the Internet but also often including phone, e-mail, and in-person
    interaction. They encourage community involvement as players work together to
    solve puzzles and codes, investigate narratives, interact with in-game
  characters, and coordinate real-life and on-line activities (<a href="../http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game</a>).</p>
<p>We decided to base the ARG in the museum’s Luce Foundation
    Center for American Art, an innovative visible storage and study facility that
    displays around 3,300 objects from the collection (<a href="../http://www.lucefoundationcenter.si.edu/">http://www.LuceFoundationCenter.si.edu</a>).
    Multimedia computer kiosks offer information on every artwork and artist represented
    in the Center, allowing visitors to engage in as much or as little
    interpretation as they choose. A dedicated staff and budget allow us to present
    a variety of low cost, informal public programs that strive to show the
    visitors something new, or encourage them to look at the works in a different
    way. The overarching goal of the Center is discovery. Whether it’s a detail of
    an artwork that you never noticed before, the story of the artist who made the
    work, or new connections made by displaying the artwork with other similar pieces,
    we want you to leave the Center feeling as if you got something out of it. With
    this in mind, when the game designers CityMystery approached us about using the
    Luce Foundation Center as the real world platform for an ARG, we agreed that it
    would be a wonderful use of the facility and the narratives that already exist
  around the collections.</p>
<p>There were some initial concerns, of course, particularly as
    ARGs were a very new and different concept for the museum staff to grasp. How,
    exactly, would we benefit from this venture? Would the museum be at risk from
    thousands of unexpected visitors? Would we compromise the museum’s credibility
    by supporting the fiction of the game? And would the traditionally bureaucratic processes of the
  Smithsonian allow us to keep up with the fast-paced, player-led nature of ARGs?</p>
<p>We concluded that the game would benefit the museum by
    taking our name and our collection to new audiences, particularly those who
    didn’t normally visit art museums but did participate in on-line games. We were
    hopeful that the on-line aspect of the game would become viral, but
    acknowledged that we had no way of controlling or predicting this. We decided
    not to be too concerned about an overload of physical visitors because the Luce
    Foundation Center space is able to accommodate varying sizes of groups, and all
    of the art works are behind glass. Additionally, for us, too many visitors
    would actually be a great problem to have to deal with! We did determine a plan
    to carefully monitor the on-line activity leading up to the live event, so that
    if it looked like thousands of people were going to show up we could put
    appropriate measures in place to secure the collection. The concerns over
    compromising the museum’s credibility were overcome by agreeing to brand
    everything game-related with the game logo. This did not spoil the fiction for
    the players, but allowed us to let everyone know after the game exactly what
  museum-created content was “fake.” </p>

<p>Finally, early support from managers at the Smithsonian,
    both within the American Art Museum and across the entire Institution, allowed
  us to take chances that would not have otherwise been possible.</p>
<h2>Game Overview</h2>
<p>The narrative of the game told the story of two student
    curators, Daisy Fortunis and Daniel Libbe (played by actors), who came to work
    for the American Art Museum. Through late nights spent together in the museum,
    they discovered that they had something in common: they were both haunted by
    restless spirits. Daisy was haunted by a ghost named Blanche, and Daniel by
    McD. Two other spirits, named The Reverend and WhatFor, were also causing
    trouble in the museum. Players initially discovered this through the characters’
    profile pages on Facebook and mySpace. In addition, Daisy and Daniel
    obsessively filmed themselves in and around the museum talking about (and to)
    the spirits, and posted the clips to a variety of sites, including YouTube. Interested
    media outlets agreed to hide clues in articles about the game. For example, ABC.com
    concealed a spooky audio clue in an on-line article, and the Smithsonian
    Magazine included a full-page color photo complete with embedded clue in their
    nationally-distributed print magazine. The challenge for players was to uncover
  the story of the spirits and determine what they could do to help.</p>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>The game-play was not linear and grew to be quite complex.
    For these reasons I am going to break it down into three main sections for the
    purposes of the evaluation: The Pre-Game, which ran from July 18 to September
    8; the Main Game, which ran from September 8 until October 25; and the Ongoing Game,
    which we continue to run. For each, I will give an overview of key game events,
    and then evaluate success based on player feedback, statistics, and the outcome
    compared to our expectations. For the purposes of the evaluation, “hardcore
    players” are defined as those who participated in the on-line ARG discussion
    forum Unfiction (<a href="../http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/">http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/</a>). The term “casual players”
    includes everyone else, whether they actively participated in game tasks, or
  just watched the story unfold.</p>
<h3>Pre-Game (July 18 – September 8, 2008)</h3>
<p class="caption"><img src="goodlander.fig2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="500" height="375"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 2: Bodybuilder Craig Torres Poses at ARGFest-o-con.

<p>The annual event for hardcore ARG players “ARGFest-o-con”
    was scheduled for July 18, 2008. While our game was not scheduled to launch
    until September, we thought it was the perfect opportunity to plant a teaser
    and hopefully start people talking. CityMystery hired the national-level
    bodybuilder Craig Torres, covered his chest and back with elaborate henna
    tattoos, and had him gatecrash the event while flexing his muscles to music.
    Within a couple of hours, a discussion thread had started on Unfiction and
  photos were up on Flickr. </p>
<p>Hidden in the tattoos was an image of an artwork from the
    Luce Foundation Center and the words “Luce’s Lover’s Eye.” When players looked
    this up on Google, they found the Luce object page, in which we embedded a
  hidden link to the Ghosts of a Chance (GOAC) Web site. </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="goodlander.fig3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="500" height="369"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 3: Screen Shot of Pre-Game Web Site (http://ghostsofachance.com/goac_eyes/)</p>
<p>The Web site invited them to e-mail an image of their eye or
    their lover’s eye and call a phone number. The message on the phone included a
    quote from Shakespeare’s Macbeth, mention of September 8<sup>th</sup> (the
    game’s launch) and asked players to record the “Double double toil and trouble”
    incantation. Over the next few weeks we added a couple of clues to the game
  site and secreted another in an ABC.com article (<a href="../http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Story?id=5490189&amp;page=1">http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Story?id=5490189&amp;page=1</a>).</p>
<p>Overall, we were pleased with the results from the pre-game.
    The speed at which players responded to the teaser was overwhelming, and we
    definitely maintained their interest over the next few weeks. Comments on the
  forum included:</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">So uh, this stripper totally bogarted
    the end of Steve Peters&#39; presentation by dancing into the main conference room
    and flexing his henna&#39;d muscles for a while. He had some words written up near
    his left shoulder, so I did a bit of Googling and found something strange at
  this Smithsonian webpage. (Unfiction User: krystyn)</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">You know, in thinking about it, this
    doesn&#39;t make any sense... Why would the <em>Smithsonian</em> send a <i>stripper</i> to a place like ARGFest to get this
    going? I mean, think about it, a borderline government agency sending a
    stripper to a convention in a hotel? That would be front page news on The
  Drudge Report!  (Unfiction User: Nighthawk)</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I&#39;m sending my eye in tonight. It&#39;s
    only taken me this long because my head was still reeling from the body builder
  interrupting our little geek-fest. (Unfiction User: faeryqueen21)</p>
<p>We received over 150 images of eyes and 256 calls in
    response to the initial tasks. Players enjoyed pondering the cryptic nature of
    the information revealed and came up with several very interesting possible
    scenarios. The ongoing on-line buzz after July 18 far exceeded the museum’s
    expectations, as we did not predict so much conversation around the event. Our
    concerns at this point centered on how to maintain this positive attention up
  to and throughout the <em>Main Game.</em></p>
<h3>Main Game</h3>
<h4>Six weeks of Mystery (September 8 – October 25, 2008)</h4>
<p>At 12:01am on September 8, the game Web site changed from
  the eye-collecting site to the official game site.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="goodlander.fig4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="500" height="366"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 4: Screen Shot of Home Page on September 8 (http://ghostsofachance.com/main_site/)</p>
<p>The site included an overview of the story so far, links to
    Daisy’s and Daniel’s social media profiles, and details of the first
    assignment. Players learned that in order to unlock the story of Daisy and
    Daniel and their resident spirits, they had to create a series of artifacts and
    mail them into the museum. The museum would catalog these and ultimately
    display them in an exhibition curated by Daisy and Daniel. Each artifact had
  quite mysterious requirements that were directly connected to the narrative.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="goodlander.fig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="500" height="448"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 5: Screen Shot of Assignment #1.</p>
<p>The fact that we were asking players to create artifacts and
    mail them into the museum was probably the biggest challenge that we faced
    during development of the game. These objects would not be accessioned into the
    collection; we just had to create the illusion that they were for the purposes
  of the story. However, this obviously caused several concerns. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Where would we receive the artifacts? We did not want to have
    them delivered to the museum itself, because the receipt and movement of
    artworks involves far more people and paperwork than should be necessary for
    this project. We worried about confusion when security and facilities staff
    were faced with what might appear to be a collection object. We decided to have
    them mailed to our office building, a block-and-a-half from the museum proper. An
    additional problem was the complexity of the Smithsonian mail system, which
    includes a time-consuming central sorting system. To avoid this, we had to
    request that players use couriers to send the artifacts. But couriers can be
    expensive, so we hoped this would not prohibit people from participating.</li>
  <li>Would the inclusion of these artifacts in our on-line collection
    and in-gallery kiosks confuse visitors who were not playing the game? We added
    a watermark of the game logo to each photograph, and text on the interpretive
    labels associated the artifacts with the game and included a link to the game
    Web site. In addition to addressing the potential confusion, we hoped that this
    solution would draw more people to the game.</li>
  <li>Were we creating unrealistic expectations? We worried that
    participants who submitted artifacts might think that their work was becoming
    part of the Smithsonian. To solve this, we included the following disclaimer in
    the game rules: “Please note that these artifacts will form part of the Ghosts
    of a Chance initiative, but will not become part of the Smithsonian American
    Art Museum&#39;s permanent collection.” We also made sure that similar text was
    included in all official materials about the game.</li>
  <li>What would we do about storage if we received a large number of
    artifacts, or individual artifacts that were huge in scale? As with all museums,
    we never, ever have enough storage space to fulfill our needs. We decided to
    create limits on the size of the submitted artifacts (they had to fit within a
    shoebox) and concluded that to avoid putting pressure on any other department,
    my office would become the storeroom. The game designers also agreed to have an
    alternative plan for storage in place, should we receive more objects than
    could realistically fit in my space.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these discussions complete and concerns addressed, we
    waited to see what would arrive in the mail. The deadlines for the artifacts
    were extremely tight; players had just a few days to come up with an idea, make
    it, and get it to the museum. By monitoring on-line conversations and talking
    to players through e-mail and phone, we knew that the association of the
    Smithsonian brand was putting additional pressure on them, as they wanted to
  make sure their work was of high quality.</p>
<p>Over the six weeks and six assignments, we received
    thirty-three artifacts from fourteen players. While these numbers may initially
    seem small, the quality of the submissions was extremely high, especially considering
    the tight deadlines and somewhat obscure requirements. The need to use a
    courier didn’t seem to put people off (except one player who lived in Hawaii)
    but it did result in a few submissions arriving late, since some players were
    unwilling to pay the fees for 1- or 2-day delivery. Of the people who created
    artifacts, seven were crafters who participated because of the opportunity to
    make something, five were hardcore players, and two were unknowns. (Some hardcore
  players may also be crafters). </p>

<p class="caption">Fig 7: “Sealed Vessel for an Unknown Woman” by Joanna

<p>The feedback from the players about the hands-on aspect of
  the game was very positive:</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">So it&#39;s a combination between a puzzle
  and an art project. This is extremely cool. (Unfiction User: The Mirror)</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">An internet collaborative art display
    in a national museum? Is it me, or is this very frigging cool! (Unfiction
  User: Tenshi Akui)</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I&#39;m so glad the art world is getting
    involved--I&#39;ve been working on some local ARGart of my own. Totally jumping in
  on this one!  (Unfiction User: ETCetera)</p>
<p>We were also pleased with the attention from casual players
    that this element of the game had attracted, and not just from those who had
    contributed artifacts. Visitation to the game Web site and interaction on
    Facebook increased, and we started to hear more from people who were not
  necessarily familiar with ARGs. </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="goodlander.fig8.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="500" height="525"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 8: Screen shot of player-created artifacts in museum’s on-line
  collection</p>
<p>Alongside the progression of the artifacts and the
    narrative, interaction between in-game characters and players was taking place
    in social media spaces. Daisy and Daniel posted regular videos to YouTube,
    Facebook, and mySpace that showed their gradual descent into madness caused by
  the spirits.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="goodlander.fig9.jpg" alt="figure 9" width="500" height="391"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 9: Screen shot of video clip on YouTube</p>
<p>They also interacted with players and real museum staff on
    Facebook. One player (not a staff member!) created a “Ghosts of a Chance” group
    on Flickr, in which players collected artifact images and museum staff posted
  images from the live events.</p>
<p>At this point, we noticed a small reduction in interest from
    the hardcore players, based on our observations of the Unfiction forum. Daisy’s
    and Daniel’s story was detailed and creative, and the videos were wonderfully
    believable, but there didn’t seem to be much player discussion around the
    content. We knew that people were reading the story and watching the videos,
    and some players even interacted with Daisy and Daniel on Facebook, but they
    didn’t seem interested in figuring out the mysteries that we presented. We did
    maintain a solid core of hardcore players that actively followed the game to
    its conclusion, but I was disappointed that we lost a fair amount of the
    original interest. Conversely, the main game succeeded in drawing in a wide
  audience of players who did not have any prior experience of ARGs. </p>
<p>I initially drew two possible explanations for the decrease
    in hardcore interest. One was because we went “official.” The pre-game Web site
    was somewhat haphazard in appearance and wasn’t really designed further than a
    simple header. The eye images were posted in a single column down the page, and
    reshuffled with each refresh. After September 8, the main game Web site was
    elegantly presented and claimed affiliation with the Smithsonian on the front
    page. I speculated that the players who preferred the underground, mysterious
    nature of the pre-game content may have lost interest once it was opened up to
    casual players and became more mainstream. Secondly, the narrative of Daisy,
    Daniel, and the spirits was unlocked by the creation and delivery of artifacts,
    but further than that it did not give the players anything to <i>do</i>. There were subtle connections to be
    made between elements in the story and happenings in the real world, but for
    the most part it was just a case of following along with the story as it
    progressed. It is possible that the lack of tangible tasks led hardcore players
  to move on to other things.</p>
<p>Detailed feedback from hardcore player Scott Myers proved
    one of these theories wrong, supported the other, and presented a couple of
  other valuable insights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Smithsonian name did not
    scare people away. In fact, it did the opposite as people were intrigued
    and surprised by the association. However, Myers speculated that the brand
    was a contributing factor in why we did not receive hundreds of artifacts:<br/>
    <br/>
    <em>“When you are scribbling doodles to write to some abstract
    character in a funny little game no-one will ever see, it’s easy to come up
    with something. But when the SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION (spoken in big impressive
    voice) asks you to submit a portrait or something, it’s a little more
    intimidating.”</em></li>
  <li>Myers agreed that there was
    less for the players to do once the game began, but he emphasized that
    this was not necessarily a bad thing. “A good story is better than a
    hundred bad puzzles.” He also clarified exactly what was taking place in
    Unfiction, which was primarily “Meta conversation,” or conversation <i>about</i> the game itself (who was
    running it, how it would unfold, etc.) rather than what was going on <i>in</i> the game. He noted:<br/>
    <br/>
    <em>“Meta discussions can be useful to gauge interest and
    awareness, but they are by no means an indicator of actual positive enthusiasm,
    levels of interaction, or even the quality of the game.”</em> </li>
  <li>Myers felt that the game did
    not fully succeed in carrying the momentum from the high energy teaser
    through to the game launch. He suggested that an e-mail (or some other
    type of “loud and clear message”) introducing the players to Daisy,
    Daniel, and the ghosts would have been helpful during this time. He also
    noted that the connections between the artifacts and the narrative were a
    little challenging, though he enjoyed the story and thought that the
    artifacts were a “terrific way” to get people involved.<br/>
    <br/>
    <em>“What Ghosts of a Chance did well was invite participants
    to take part in the exhibit – essentially becoming part of the exhibit
    themselves. [...] Sometimes a painting is just a painting. But more often, there
    is a story that is waiting to come out and be told. [...] People should be encouraged
    to discover these relationships, and see exhibits in a new light.”    </em></li>
</ul>
<p>One decision that we did make early on was that it was okay
    to acknowledge this project from the outset as an ARG. Many ARGs follow the
    “This is Not a Game” approach, in which “one of the main goals […] is to deny
    or disguise the fact that it is even a game at all” (<span class="addmd">Szulborski,
    2005).</span> It was clear that the story of Daisy and Daniel was not “real”;
    however, we hoped that we would succeed in blurring the line between the
    reality and the fiction. We did not reveal until the game was complete that the
    two young characters were entirely invented. Daisy and Daniel did not work for
    the museum and they did not actually exist; their real names were Alex
    Cohen-Smith and Scout Seide. I took on an alternate personality for whenever I
    interacted with Daisy and Daniel, and became quite a scary supervisor with
    little patience (something that I hope I’m not!). The museum created fictional
    blog posts, tweets, Facebook content, letters, and a press release (<a href="../http://ghostsofachance.com/main_site/GOAC_press_release.pdf">http://ghostsofachance.com/main_site/ GOAC_press_release.pdf</a>),
    and supported the temporary inclusion of player-created artifacts into the on-line
    collection. We definitely succeeded in maintaining this fiction through to the
    final event on October 25, as several players on the day commented to staff
    members that they hadn’t realized Daisy and Daniel were hired actors. The
    overarching response from participants, both on-site and on-line, was one of
    surprise that an established institution like the Smithsonian had been willing
    to relinquish a little control over its content in order to fabricate the
  story.</p>
<p>In addition to all of the on-line activity, we organized two
    live mini-events for the players during the six weeks of official play. We
    thought it would be interesting to take the game play outside our walls and
    integrate other Washington D.C. sites, providing variety for the players as
    well as taking advantage of some of the other cultural experiences that the
    city has to offer. The first took place on September 20 at the Smithsonian’s
    National Museum of Natural History. Players were treated to a behind-the-scenes
    experience of the anthropology department with Dr. David Hunt. At the end of
  the tour, they were led into a room with seven skeletons. </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="goodlander.fig10.jpg" alt="Figure 10" width="500" height="335"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 10: Dr. David Hunt in the Forensics Lab</p>
<p>Five were identified, and two were not. Dr. Hunt walked the
    group through the process of identifying race, gender, age, and cause of death
    with the five identified remains, and then challenged everyone to investigate
    the two others. He even provided (fake) police forensic reports for each body.
    The story of the two skeletons showed that they belonged to the mysterious
    characters Blanche and McD, the very same entities that were causing Daisy and
  Daniel so much trouble!</p>
<p>The second mini-event took place on October 4 at the
    Congressional Cemetery. Patrick Crowley, Chair of the Board of Directors, took
    players on a fascinating tour around the tombstones that included the history
    of the cemetery as well as a wealth of trivia about the famous people who had
    been buried there. By exploring tombs and crypts, players found a skull, a
    Morse code key, black-out paper, and a flashlight. They soon noticed two
    strange figures in the distance, flashing a light at the group. A small group
    of dedicated players (with a bit of prompting from the game designer) concluded
    that they could use the tools to communicate with the figures. The primary
    participants in this included an artifact-creator, and a couple of casual
    players who had been following the story and were drawn to the cemetery event
    because it was “nearly Halloween.” Through the conversation with the spirits, participants
    learned that they were the characters The Reverend and WhatFor, and that they
  wanted “rest.”</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="goodlander.fig11.jpg" alt="Figure 11" width="500" height="389"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 11: Players at the Congressional Cemetery</p>
<p>The intent of these mini-events was to attract a small
    number of players who would post photos and information to the various sites
    associated with the game. The events met with mixed success. The Museum of
    Natural History requested that we limit the number of people on the tour to
    twenty. To ensure this, we decided to invite players through an Evite, which
    was also publicly accessible. Ten people signed up. The evening before the
    event, however, someone mysteriously hacked into the Evite and sent out a
    series of reminders with the incorrect date and time. <span class="threadtext">We
    don’t know who sabotaged the invitation or why, but w</span>e were only able to
    fix it and send out a new reminder a couple of hours before the event was due
    to begin. This meant that just a handful of people came to the tour, and none
    of them were hardcore players so the content did not get posted on-line. Museum
    staff posted the photos and police reports to Facebook and Flickr, but it
  didn’t really get as much attention as we had hoped.</p>
<p>The Congressional Cemetery tour was more successful, with a
    couple of players posting photos and sharing the story of the ghostly
    encounter. However, fewer people than we had expected commented on the links
  between the mini-events and the narrative.</p>
<p>Over 6,100 people participated on-line during the course of
  the game (pre- and main).</p>
<h4>Final Event (October 25)</h4>
<p>The concluding event on October 25 met our primary goal by
    encouraging discovery and interactivity around the collections. Daisy and
    Daniel established this date as the opening for their exhibition of
    player-created artifacts. Alongside the exhibition, players participated in a massive,
    multimedia, museum-wide scavenger hunt that involved six quests of varying
    difficulty. Each of the quests started with an artwork and was based around one
    of the six characters from the narrative: Daisy, Daniel, Blanche, McD, The
    Reverend, and WhatFor. Solving the quests put the spirits to rest and Daisy and
    Daniel were saved. Players had to send SMS messages, interact with actors, make
  sculptures out of foil, solve codes, find hidden objects, and even eat cake.</p>

<p>The quests were lengthy and complex, even the ones at the
    easy level, so I was very nervous that people would grow frustrated and tired
    and eventually give up. However on this point, I definitely underestimated the
    stamina, talent, and creative thinking of our participants! Altogether, 244
    people played the game, with over 70 people completing all six quests to win a
  T-shirt.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig 14: A winning team</p>
<p>The fastest team took almost three hours to complete the
    quests, and the majority of players spent between three and five hours in the
    museum. Even those who did not finish everything usually completed three or
  four of the quests. We received extremely positive feedback from the players:</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Our favorite part was actually early on in the
    experience when asked to form the piece of aluminum foil into a ghost. That
    sort of interactive project is always enjoyable, and hard to
    find in many large scale museums. […] Looking for the piece that fit the
    puzzle in a specific room (like &#34;the tin man&#39;s daughter&#34;) was a
    fantastic way to examine the collections and pay specific attention to the various
    works of art on display. Overall this was a wonderful way to spend an
  afternoon, and we look forward to another such adventure.  (<i>Player: Paul Gerarden</i>) </p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">My favorite part of GOAC was the atmosphere of excitement
    that the game created. It was very much inspired by DaVinci Code, or something
    -- I loved the clandestine cell phone calls, the sign out the window, the codex
    -- all of those little touches added mystery and suspense. […] The game was SO
    much more than I expected. I thought that we&#39;d come in for an hour or so and
  then get bored. Instead, we completed all six scavenger hunts. (<i>Player: Miguel de Baca</i>) </p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">[I]t was a thoroughly
    enjoyable afternoon, and turned an already interesting museum into an exciting place
    of wonder, where every question led to another new discovery. (Player:
  Ben Buring)</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Even though we were ‘exposed’ to the whole museum, I also
    liked that there were a couple of pieces of art that we actually had to sit and
    ponder. […] I never would have spent the time staring into [a] painting and trying
  to understand it if it weren&#39;t part of a task. (Player: Peter Everett)</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I have spent quite some
    time in art museums and this is probably the first time that it felt like the museum
    was meant to be fun and interactive rather than more somber and pensive. It
    was really refreshing and definitely gave me a sense of community with the people
  who were coordinating the event and the other people participating in it. (Player: Jacquelyn Elder)</p>
<p>We realized that many of the on-line players would not be
    able to attend the final event. Once all the quests were completed and the
    spirits put to rest (and the cake eaten), we posted an epilogue to the Web site
    so that everyone could share the end of the story, whether on site or not. In addition,
    we wanted to involve the hardcore players in the event even if they couldn’t be
    there in person. We e-mailed a handful of players a request to create a code
  for the game, inspired by one of our nineteenth-century quilts. </p>

<p class="caption">Fig 15: Unidentified Artist, <em>Flying Geese</em><em>, about 1840, </em>Smithsonian American Art Museum, Gift of
  Patricia Smith Melton</p>
<p>They rose to the challenge! Players created a new thread on
    Unfiction (<a href="../http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=26918">http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=26918</a>)
    and worked together to produce a code that used the triangles of the quilt as
  letters of the alphabet.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many of the players on October 25 had not
    been following the game on-line. We anticipated this and designed the quests so
    that they would make sense to the uninitiated, while still creating a
  fulfilling experience for those who were familiar with the story.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, the main game had two dimensions. One can be characterized
    by those parts of the game that actually asked people to <i>do</i> something physically: make the artifacts and participate in the
    live events. The other focused on following the mysteries within the narrative
    of the game, from the direct story posted on the game Web site to the content
    produced by in-game characters and museum staff. This two-layer approach was
    not something that we had planned, but it actually proved to be successful in
    that it attracted a wider variety of participants. Players could choose the
    aspects of the game that appealed to them, and still have a satisfying
  experience. </p>
<h2>Ongoing Game (Recurring Module)</h2>
<p>Immediately after the Main Game was complete, we started
    working on a module version. We took the most successful and popular aspects of
    the October 25 event and created a shorter version that could be played by
    groups in the museum in approximately ninety minutes. We wanted to offer this
    game on a regular basis, so we removed a lot of the elements that required staffing
    and replaced them with tasks that revolved around text messages and physical
    props. This version is no longer an ARG as it does not have the same sense of
    narrative or real-time happenings. However, it captures the spirit of the
    Ghosts of the Chance game and the concept of ARGs in general as it creates a
    layer of interactivity over a real world space, and challenges players to solve
  clues and puzzles in order to progress through the game.</p>
<p>The target audience is teenagers and young adults, though
    grown-ups have confessed to enjoying it also! As of January 2009, almost 200
    players have participated in this version of the game. What is particularly
    gratifying for museum staff is that it has not yet needed any promotion. Word
  of mouth around the main game has led to all of our bookings so far.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig 17: Players participating in the Module Game</p>
<p>The ongoing game is not directly educational in that it is
    not tied to any specific curricula. Its purpose is to get people looking and
    thinking about art and art museums in a new way. We want to create a memorable
    experience that will make participants realize that art museums don’t have to
    be quiet, passive experiences; they can be interactive, social and FUN. The
    twenty-first-century audience has an increasingly short attention span,
    extremely high expectations when it comes to finding and engaging with
    information, the ability to communicate with friends and strangers quickly and
    on multiple platforms, and a very open approach to learning. The Ghosts of a
    Chance ongoing game meets the needs of this new visitor group, and opens up an
    important collection to people who might otherwise have left the building with
  a less than satisfying experience.</p>
<p>The feedback that we have received so far shows that the
  activity does offer value:</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Our 10<sup>th</sup> graders were completely engaged in the
    program, and as you know we had to tear them away when our time was up. What
    was most exciting was their conversations afterwards, which were not only about
    the game, but about the art itself. Honestly, if someone had told me about a
    program which would leave 15-year olds discussing art with the same animation
  they show for sports and movie stars, I would not have believed them! (Rabbi Donald A. Weber)</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">“This museum was exhilarating and I never felt like sitting
  or sleeping. I wish someone had been filming us the whole time. <u>Great</u> experience!!”</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">“The scavenger hunt was <i>amazing</i>.
  It got everyone interested in the museum, even people who don’t like art.” </p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">The scavenger hunt challenged the way I see museums.
    It synthesized fun, learning, and technology. The way they used phones was
  extremely innovative and different compared to other scavenger hunts.  (10<sup>th</sup> Grade Players)</p>
<h2>Guidelines and Recommendations</h2>
<p>No two ARGs are alike, so it is difficult to establish set
    guidelines. However, I hope the following recommendations will be useful to
    those hoping to implement an ARG (or any type of interactive activity) in their
  institution. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t attempt to do a similar game to “Ghosts of a Chance”, or to
    follow the same model. The key to the success of our game was that it was new
    and unexpected. A second version along the same lines would not attract
    anywhere near as much attention from the players or the press. </li>
  <li>Definitely ensure upfront that you have full support from the
    decision-makers in your institution. Ghosts of a Chance would not have been
    possible without the support of our Director and Registrar, among others.
    Willingness to take risks is essential.</li>
  <li>Make sure that you understand what departments in your museum
    will be involved and that you have their support. I worked with staff in New
    Media, IT support, Public Affairs, Public Programs, Exhibits, and Registration
    in order to implement all the game-related content and events that were needed
    to support the story. I was careful to ensure that no-one was surprised by any
    requests that came their way, or by any public content issued by the museum.</li>
  <li>Be sure to dedicate significant time and resources to the
    management of the project. We wanted to allow the game designers to be as
    inventive as possible with the narrative, but there were certain museum
    standards and protocols that still had to be followed. Monitoring game
    development and coordinating with various museum departments definitely
    involved more time and attention than we had initially planned.</li>
  <li>Keep people informed! From the beginning, I established a contact
    list of anyone and everyone who was interested in the progression of the game
    and sent out regular updates. This included people within the museum as well as
    museum professionals across the country. By saving these updates, I also had
    the framework for my final report.</li>
  <li>Select an unusual name for your game. By googling “Ghosts of a
    Chance” I was able to immediately find on-line activity around it. Be aware,
    however, that the players may name your game for you! After the bodybuilder teaser
    in Boston, the hardcore players named our game “Luce’s Lover’s Eye,” although
    they did start to use Ghosts of a Chance after a few weeks.</li>
  <li>Don’t be tied to one physical location. A live event at your
    museum can be successful, but we did experience some mumblings from the players
    about the fact that all our live events were in D.C. Think of tasks that the
    players can engage in wherever they are in the world, and ask them to document
    and share their activities. </li>
  <li>Create a game with many possible levels of involvement. Players
    have different interests and available time, and don’t want to feel that they
    have to commit to <em>everything</em> by signing on.</li>
  <li>Don’t attempt to control or seed player activity on-line
    (definitely don’t try to initiate your game in Unfiction – they will find you
    out!), but do be open to interacting with players.</li>
  <li>Give the players something to do. Even if you know the story that
    you want to tell, be sure to include distinct tasks and/or activities to keep
    the audience engaged.</li>
  <li>Tour your institution with game designers. Even if you don’t
    create a large-scale event like Ghosts of a Chance, just seeing the artworks
    through a game designer’s eyes can be extremely revealing.</li>
  <li>Be a part of the game! The most interesting (and sometimes
    confusing) angle for me was the fact that I was a character in the game as well
    as the project manager. Involving museum staff in this way helps build support
    for your initiative and legitimizes the narrative. </li>
</ul>
<h3>And Finally…</h3>
<p>Would the American Art Museum do another ARG? Definitely! It
    was incredibly fun ­– an interesting, challenging, and bizarre project to work
    on, and I enjoyed every minute. The museum received great press around the
    event, both during and after it, our collections reached a wider audience, and
    our staff and visitors saw the museum in a new light. The biggest challenge now
    will be taking it a step further. How can we design an experience that builds
    on the successes of Ghosts of a Chance, but still provides something fresh,
  innovative, and challenging for our audiences? </p>
