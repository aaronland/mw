        <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText">Children between the ages of six and 12 are not a
		    homogenous mass. Both ends of the age range have differing needs, abilities and
		    expectations. When designing a Web site for them, it is crucial to appeal not
		    only to all of them, but also to their ‘gatekeepers&#39; – their parents and
		    teachers, who tend to manage their time online. Taking the new Tate Kids Web
		    site as a case study (<a href="../http://kids.tate.org.uk/">http://kids.tate.org.uk/</a>), this paper will outline a
		    process of designing a Web site that attempts to meet the needs of the three
		    audiences, while embodying the Tate Kids ethos: smart, fun, irreverent,
		    anarchic content with educational value. It will outline the graphic design
		    process, the strategy for user testing, the importance of differentiating
		    content, and the purpose of an adult zone. It will discuss our efforts to
		    alleviate online safety fears and the use of teachers&#39; notes to support the use
	      of the Web site in the classroom. </p>
        <p class="AbstractText">A unique aspect of Tate Kids is My Gallery, a carefully
		    managed online community. Here users create profiles, upload their own art,
		    take work from the Tate Kids Collection (a subset of around 500 works from the
		    online collection) and save work they have created in two new games: Tate Paint
		    and Street Art. This paper will discuss how this functionality was created, and
		    how its audiences are receiving it. This paper will also discuss how Tate Kids
		    will be developed in the future and will also look at the possibility of
	      working in partnership with external companies to share audiences.</p>

	    <h2>Tate Kids – The Context</h2>
	    <p>Prior to the relaunch of Tate Kids in July 2008, Tate Online
		    was receiving at least a million hits a month, but relatively few of these
		    visitors were children – in fact stats from Hitwise suggested that Tate Online
	    was attracting a predominantly older, retired audience.</p>
	    <p>Tate Online sits within Tate Media, a division that also
		    includes Marketing, Communications, Press and Print teams. In January 2007,
		    Will Gompertz, Director of Tate Media, presented a new vision for the division
		    to the Board of Trustees, and it was met with enthusiasm. The proposal included
		    a re-imagining of Tate Online, where audience-focused editorial roles,
		    initially around kids, young people, adult learners, exhibitions and the
		    collection, would be created and led by an over-arching Editor. The Tate Kids
	    Editor post was created soon after and the post filed in September 2007. </p>
	    <p>Tate runs in-gallery programmes at all four sites (Tate
		    Britain, Tate Modern, Tate Liverpool, Tate St. Ives) for children. In a formal
		    educational context, children attend school visits, directed by their teachers
		    with support from Tate, or by an Artist Educator. Informally, the cross-site
		    Families programmes run a range of extensive workshops and events for children
	    - and their parents - at weekends and during school holidays. </p>

	    <p class="caption">Fig 1: The previous incarnation of the Tate Kids homepage</p>
	    <p>Tate Kids existed before July 2008, as a small incoherent
		    collection of games. It was housed within the Tate Learning pages, and the URL
		    included the word ‘learning’, which can be immediately off-putting for some
		    sections of the key intended audience. The HTML design was not created with
		    children in mind; instead, it was inherited from Tate Learning, making the Web
		    site an undesirable place for the audience and an unspecific, confused place
		    for the content.  The Web site was receiving around 580 unique visitors per
	    day, who were spending an average of a minute and half.</p>
	    <p>It was hoped that the redesigned Web site would meet Tate’s
		    mission ‘to increase public knowledge, understanding and appreciation of art’
	      by the creation of a colorful, relevant interactive Web site with engaging
		    content that would both entertain and educate the intended audience of six to
	    12 year olds. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="jacksonfig2.jpg" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="375"/></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 2: A wire frame from the proposed new homepage</p>
	    <h2>Children and the Internet</h2>
	    <p>Tate held two small mixed-gendered focus groups with six to
		    nine-year-olds and 10 to 12-year-olds to get some insight into how and where
		    the Internet is used by Tate Kids’ intended audience, and what content they
	    were engaging with.</p>
	    <p>The results were generally as presumed – all attendees used
		    computers in both home and school. Computer usage in school tended to be off
		    line or directed at specific educational Web sites. The children tended to
		    spend most of their on-line time at home. The focus groups also demonstrated
		    that the needs and expectations of children aged between six and 12 varied at
	    the different ends of the spectrum.</p>
	    <p>In terms of content, Club Penguin (<a href="../http://www.clubpenguin.com/">http://www.clubpenguin.com/</a>), the virtual
		    world where children can chat, play mini-games and explore the world using
		    animated penguins as avatars, was cited as the favorite Web site by both older
	    and younger children.</p>
	    <p>CBBC (<a href="../http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/</a>)
		    and CBeebies (<a href="../http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/</a>)
		    were listed as the most popular sites for the younger age group, whilst the MSN
		    Messenger software, MySpace (<a href="../http://www.myspace.com/">http://www.myspace.com/</a>),
		    Bebo (<a href="../http://www.bebo.com/">http://www.bebo.com/</a>) YouTube (<a href="../http://uk.youtube.com/">http://uk.youtube.com/</a>) Facebook (<a href="../http://www.facebook.com/">http://www.facebook.com/</a>) and
		    Miniclip (<a href="../http://www.miniclip.com/games/en">http://www.miniclip.com/games/en</a>/)were mentioned by the older age
	    group.</p>
	    <p>Although the 10-to-12 year olds were officially too young to
		    access the social networking sites (which tend to have a lower age limit of
		    14), they still did, demonstrating that these users, in addition to looking at
		    art and making their own art on-line, would expect a certain level of
		    interaction with friends and other users. The key issues this raised were those
		    of safety and moderation. On line safety is a key concern of both the target
		    audience, and of their gatekeepers. This logically meant that it was imperative
	    that any social elements or user-generated content had to be pre-moderated. </p>
	    <p>Tate Kids already hosted two instances of user-generated
		    content. Tate Tales and My Imaginary City allow children to submit stories and
		    images, which have to be checked for harmful content before going live. Tate
		    felt that pre-moderation, whist potentially frustrating for older children (who
	    wanted to see their content posted immediately) was the most adequate solution. </p>
	    <p>Tate therefore decided to start with a few, light,
		    characteristics of Web 2.0 (so chat or messaging functionality would be
		    avoided). However this would be reviewed and discussed at a later date, if
		    there was a demand for it. It was also important to consider the amount of time
		    the moderation process would add to the Tate Kids Editor’s workload. It was
		    therefore imperative to make admin screens user-friendly and intuitive to
		    ensure the moderation process was easy and smooth as possible – making the best
	    use of time and meeting the needs of the audience quickly. </p>
	    <h2>The Design Process</h2>
	    <p>Tate had to consider the following challenges when creating
	    the brief for the HTML templates and the Tate Kids logo. The Web site had to:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>appeal to its diverse primary
	        audience in terms of age and gender</li>
	      <li>be relevant and appeal to the
	        primary audience’s gatekeepers</li>
	      <li>understand and complement the
	        Tate brand, whilst looking and feeling unique</li>
	      <li>work within our stringent
	        design specification</li>
	      <li>come in on budget</li>
        </ul>
	    <p>A short project brief was compiled detailing the background
		    of the project, the requirements, and the available budget. It was then
		    circulated to a number of agencies. If interested, they were sent further
		    information and content including the suite of Tate fonts, brand guidelines and
		    a wire frame of the proposed homepage. In return, Tate requested two Tate Kids
		    logos, a mock-up of the Tate Kids homepage and details of relevant past
	    projects. </p>
	    <p>When selecting agencies, Tate and /or the Tate Kids Editor
		    had worked with them in the past, had seen promising examples of their work on-line
	    or, had been recommended to Tate. </p>
	    <p>A number of issues arose. The agencies the Tate Kids Editor
		    had worked with previously within the commercial sector were used to working in
		    a different manner, and resented the fact that they had to submit an official
		    pitch. Another agency felt that there were too many interested parties so
		    pulled out. A number of agencies were unable to provide Tate with the example
		    work requested as they were unable to undertake a ‘creative pitch’ – they were
		    unwilling to provide examples of work for free. Tate fully sympathized with the
		    agencies bound by those rules, as pitching can be an expensive yet fruitless
		    endeavor, especially for small agencies. However, it made it very difficult to
		    imagine a graphics-heavy Web site through verbal descriptions alone. Other
	    agencies found the budget too small, and immediately dismissed the proposal.</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="jacksonfig3.gif" alt="figure 3" width="500" height="350"/></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 3: Article from New Media Age discussing the then
	    forthcoming Web site (13 December 2007).</p>
	    <p>After Tate had received all submissions, two agencies were
		    invited to Tate to meet the Tate Kids Editor and the e-learning Curator. From
		    the meeting it was immediately clear that we would be working with GR/DD (<a href="../http://www.grdd.co.uk/">http://www.grdd.co.uk/</a>), who had
	    fully considered all of the challenges laid out in the brief. </p>
	    <p>GR/DD had provided three design options as part of their
		    pitch. These were user tested in informal contexts - children in the gallery and
		    friends and family in the target age range were canvassed. This research also
		    asked the audience to consider the name ‘Tate Kids’. The Tate Kids Editor felt
		    there was a potential issue with ‘Kids’ as it could be alienating to some of
		    the target audience (especially those aged 10 and over) who may not want to be ‘bunched
		    in’ with younger, immature children or be referred to by that term. Conversely,
		    Tate Kids worked, as it was a clear, self-explanatory name. The concern was
	    that something different might have been too ambiguous.</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="jacksonfig4.jpg" alt="figure 1" width="500"/></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 4: Concept A</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="jacksonfig5.jpg" alt="figure 5" width="500"/></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 5: Concept B</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="jacksonfig6.jpg" alt="figure 6" width="500" height="553"/></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 6: Concept C </p>
	    <p>The research suggested that there were merits to each
		    design, but Concept A was strongly liked by all, with some elements of Concept
		    C incorporated – the photo frames, for example. Tate was wary of including
		    characters (Concept C) and real children (Concept B) – if they didn’t appeal to
		    the audience, this could dissuade them from using the Web site, immediately
		    pre-judging the content. Tate also found that Tate Kids was a satisfactory name
	    for the Web site, which was a relief.</p>
	    <p>Once the concept was amended and signed off, the Tate Kids
		    Editor sent over a complete set of wire frames to GR/DD. Customization was a
		    crucial aspect of the Web site, so functionality was developed to allow the
		    users to choose their own backgrounds from a range on the homepage. GR/DD
		    mocked up laminated, A3 versions of a range of potential backgrounds in
		    addition to the landing pages for the main content areas. These were user
		    tested, again at Tate Britain, and were responded to positively. As most of the
		    background designs (with the exception of one monochromatic design) were liked
		    by different sections of the target audience, Tate decided to use five of them
		    in the Change the Background pallet that is live on the homepage. The original
		    concept involved using out-of-copyright works, but as the backgrounds tested
		    well, they were developed further, incorporating Flash elements. The pallet had
		    room for six backgrounds - the last space was to be filled by a winner of a
		    Design a Background competition to be held post-launch. It was hoped that the
		    competition would aid with press, PR and marketing initiatives for the Web
	    site. </p>
	    <p>After working closely with Tate Online’s Technical Manager
		    to develop Tate Kids specific Design Specifications, GR/DD began coding the
	    flat designs. </p>
	    <h2>Creating Content</h2>
	    <p>Tate Kids currently has seven key content areas, and three
	    supporting areas:</p>

          </ul>
	    <h2>My Gallery</h2>
	    <p>The My Gallery application allows children to upload their
		    own work, alongside the Tate Kids Collection (TKC) – a subset of about 500
		    works from the Tate collection, selected for children, with child-friendly
		    tags. The application was developed internally; children can add works from the
		    TKC to their galleries, alongside works created in the Tate Paint and Street
		    Art games. Simple social networking features are present; namely, the ability
		    to add other users as ‘favorite artists’ (alongside favorite artists from the TKC),
		    to add works uploaded by other users to their gallery, to apply star ratings to
		    works, and to send works by e-mail. Users with particularly interesting
	    galleries can be rewarded with the Gallery of the Month accolade. </p>
	    <p>All of this was to be implemented with a child-friendly,
	    accessible interface.</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="jacksonfig7.jpg" alt="figure 7" width="500" height="422"/></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 7: My Gallery Artists of the Month page</p>
	    <h3>Process</h3>
	    <p>The initial brief incorporated a set of wire frames, giving
		    a clear indication of how the application was expected to work. As the project
		    progressed, these wire frames were refined, and templates were built for each
		    view. Prototyping and user testing provided feedback about the design and
	    navigation, guiding the refinement process. </p>
	    <p>At this stage, My Gallery was entitled <b>Tate Curate</b>, but when the application was user tested, it was
		    evident that users did not know what the name meant or, therefore, how it would
	    work.</p>
	    <p>Undertaking user testing with children highlighted some
		    usability problems but also showed that the children already had some clear
	    expectations of how the application would work. </p>
	    <p>Development was undertaken largely in parallel with the
		    design refinement, with a tight feedback loop between the Tate Kids Editor, the
		    developer and the internal Web designer allocated to the project. This let
	    changes be reviewed and actioned quickly.</p>
	    <p>Underpinning this was the use of a revision control system
		    (Subversion) which ensured old versions could always be retrieved, and a build
		    tool (Maven) which allowed for a near-immediate consistent build of the project
	      – facilitating immediate testing. In addition, a suite of internal tests was
	    developed and run as part of the build process.</p>
	    <p>An issue tracking system (JIRA) was used to track bugs and
	    enhancement requests.</p>
	    <h3>Design</h3>
	    <p>In common with the rest of the site, GR/DD produced the
		    graphic design, implementing the views from the initial brief as a set of
		    templates. Due to the audience, the design was graphic-intensive, presenting
		    challenges with the presentation of arbitrary amounts of information such as
		    varying lengths of text and varying quantities of images. Refinements to the
		    templates were made internally by the developer as needed to support changes to
		    the application. These changes were made using either existing design elements
		    (where appropriate) or ‘plain’ elements (boxes, bullet points etc.). The role
		    of the Web designer then became to ‘design up’ the changes made by the
	    developer.</p>
	    <p>All text had to be suitable for children, and the Tate Kids
		    Editor managed this task. The templates could be edited directly.
		    Application-generated messages were externalized to a ‘properties’ file, again
	    allowing for straightforward editing. </p>
	    <h3>Implementation</h3>
	    <p>A range of technology choices was available.</p>
	    <p>The implementation technology had to:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>be compatible
	      with the deployment environment</li>
      <li>enable an
        efficient architecture (i.e. to allow changes to be made efficiently and
        reliably)</li>
      <li>be familiar to
        the developer</li>
      <li>present no obstacles
        to others on the team</li>
          </ol>
	    <p>The application itself was bespoke – allowing precise
		    control over the design, navigation and workflow – but took advantage of
		    existing open-source libraries, to allow the work to focus on the specific
	    requirements not the general plumbing.</p>
	    <p>The choice of language: Java and PHP are in existing use and
		    were known to be compatible. Java is the primary area of expertise of the
	    developer, along with the libraries.</p>
	    <h3>Libraries: </h3>
	    <ul>
	      <li><b>Hibernate</b> – to handle access to
		      the underlying database, creating/validating the database structure from a
		      declared model, independent of the actual DBMS used. (In this case, MySQL
		      was used, with the InnoDB table engine to support database transactions.)
		      Automatic persistence allowed programming to be done conveniently using
		      Java objects, with Hibernate taking care of all the SQL behind the scenes.
		      Hibernate sessions are wrapped around the processing of each Web request,
	      to allow an as-needed database query approach.</li>
      <li><b>Spring</b> – used to ‘wire up’ and
        configure the various components of the application – and for its
        transaction and ORM support.</li>
      <li><b>RSF</b> – a Spring-based MVC
        (Model-View-Controller) Web application framework with its own template
        system that allows templates to be provided in pure XHTML, using one
        additional XML attribute to peer tags from the template with ‘components’
        in the view-model. These components bind the tags to the application
        model, via bean properties and action methods. This templating feature was
        particularly effective at providing a development process whereby a Web
        designer could work on templates without any concern for the application
        code.</li>
      <li>In addition,
        code from the <b>Apache Commons</b> project was used.</li>
        </ul>
	    <h2>Integration of Tate Kids Games</h2>
	    <p>Two new Tate Kids Games – <b>Street Art</b> and <b>Tate Paint</b> - result in work being produced, stored and published on the Web site.</p>
	    <p>Part of the brief was to allow works from these games to be
		    saved into a user’s on-line gallery. Whilst this function would require the
		    user to have a My Gallery account, there was also a requirement not to force
	    users to sign up just to play the games.</p>
	    <p>Ongoing production of new games is planned.</p>
	    <p>This integration became a major part of the development. The
	    main specific requirements were:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>sending a work
	      to a user’s gallery</li>
      <li>presenting
        works in the user’s gallery</li>
      <li>only showing
        approved works</li>
          </ol>
	    <p>As each game is a separate development, all have their own
		    data storage requirements, and hence their own server-side code and databases.
		    As such, it was important to maintain strict discipline of
		    implementation-independence, via a defined interface. XML and HTTP were chosen
		    as the basis of the protocol, as this allows existing tools to be used for
		    marshalling data, and provides flexibility in hosting the participating games –
        all that is needed is the ability to communicate securely via HTTP.</p>
	    <p><b>My Gallery</b> exposes a Web service and a configuration screen for participating games to be
		    configured. Each game is given a unique reference by the administrator, and
	    provides its own Web service to support its end of the integration protocol.</p>
	    <p>At the <b>My Gallery</b> end, one URL is provided for a game to place a reference to one of its works in
		    a user’s gallery. (This requires the user’s username and password, the game’s
	    registration reference and a unique reference for the work itself.)</p>
	    <p>At the game’s end, the Web service allows access to the work
		    data and to a public presentation of the work, via URLs with the work reference
		    included. These URLs are specified in the game’s entry in <b>My Gallery</b>’s configuration. A placeholder is used in the URL, which
	    is substituted for the work reference on-the-fly.</p>
	    <p>The work data includes a set of URLs for images of different
		    sizes, which <b>My Gallery</b> uses to
		    present the work in different contexts, and metadata – for selection and
		    presentation. Non-approved works are not shown unless they belong to the user
		    currently logged in – and even then, the external application will typically
		    forbid access to the image (it does not have access to the <b>My Gallery</b> login session) – in which case a placeholder is used,
	    with an explanatory note.</p>
	    <p>To date, <b>My Gallery</b> has around 1750 subscribed users, with around 10% of them defined as active:
		    logging during the last 30 days. There are plans to allow users to comment on
		    other users’ works, and these messages will be pre-moderated like the other
	    instances of user-generated content on Tate Kids.</p>
	    <h3>Games</h3>
	    <p>The original budget did not allow Tate Kids to create new
		    games, but due to unspent allocated budgets and yet-to-be-filled posts
		    remaining empty, additional funds were found to create two new games that were
	    compatible with My Gallery.</p>
	    <h4>Tate Paint</h4>
	    <p>Tate Paint (<a href="../http://kids.tate.org.uk/games/paint/">http://kids.tate.org.uk/games/paint/</a>) is an
		    animated drawing tool with three brush sizes and 10 colors. When two or more
		    colors are applied in layers, the resulting color is an accurate mix of the
	    hues.</p>

	    <p class="caption">Fig 8: Tate Kids Tate Paint game with Isle of Wight
	    Festival branding.</p>
	    <p>Users are also able to see a step-by-step animated version
		    of their masterpiece as it develops, add a frame, and hang it in the gallery
		    when they have finished. They also have the option of sending the work to a
	    friend. </p>
	    <p>Tate Online is sponsored by BT, who was also involved with
		    the sponsorship of the 2008 Isle of Wight Festival, along with the Woodland
		    Trust. To help with the promotion of Tate Kids, an Isle of Wight Festival
		    version of the game was created, where users were asked to create a nature
		    scene in the application. In keeping with the other content on the Web site,
		    there were three age categories – five to seven, eight to nine and 10 to 12.The
		    competition ran for a very short time – three weeks, with minimal publicity –
	      so we were pleased to receive over 160 entries, which demonstrated both great
		    effort and ability by the participants. A slideshow featuring all finalists was
	    broadcast on large screens throughout the duration of the three-day Festival.</p>
	    <p>Tate Paint has received just under 40,000 unique views since
		    its launch on the Beta version of Tate Kids in April. It receives around 5,550
		    unique views a month, with users spending around 3 minutes 40 seconds with the
	    interactivity.</p>
	    <h4>Street Art</h4>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="jacksonfig9.jpg" alt="figure 9" width="500" height="315"/></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 9: Example of work created in Tate Kids Street Art game</p>
	    <p>The Street Art (<a href="../http://kids.tate.org.uk/games/street-art/">http://kids.tate.org.uk/games/street-art/</a>)
		    interactivity launched in conjunction with the exhibition at Tate Modern
		    (<a href="../http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/streetart/">http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/streetart/</a>) in May 2008. It is
		    essentially a re-skin or re-imagining of the Tate Paint application with some
		    context setting from the outset to explain what Street Art is and who the major
		    artists are today. This copy was created to demonstrate to some sections of the
		    audience, especially to the gatekeepers, that Street Art does not equal
	    vandalism and is a valid form of art.</p>
	    <p>Since its launch, it has proved to be the most popular
		    section on Tate Kids. This is due to the extra marketing push that opening with
		    an exhibition gave it, the link to the game on the exhibition micro site, the
		    game’s cross-generational appeal, and its irreverent design and concept. To aid
		    internal buy-in of the game, and Tate Kids, an eclectic mix of unsigned bands
	    and musicians at Tate provided the soundtrack. </p>
	    <p>Since May, Street Art has received over 80,000 unique views,
		    around 14,000 unique views a month, with users spending around four minutes 30 seconds
	    on the game.</p>
	    <p>Street Art’s success will hopefully be mirrored in new
		    content produced on the Web site, as it aptly embodies the Tate Kids ethos and
	    spirit – it is humorous, irreverent, anarchic, educational and non-patronizing.</p>
	    <h3>Existing games </h3>
	    <p><b>Tate Tales</b> (<a href="../http://blog.tate.org.uk/tate-tales/">http://blog.tate.org.uk/tate-tales/</a>) was one of the original examples of
		    user-generated content on the Web site. Using a re-skinned WordPress blog,
		    users are invited to respond to and interpret four art works by writing short
		    stories about each piece. The artworks are usually updated with the exhibitions
		    to enhance cross-promotional activity and make the content relevant to the
		    audience, especially teachers using Tate Tales after a visit to one of the
	    galleries. </p>
	    <p>The wide age range of the Web site makes moderating the
		    content often difficult, as a lightly violent story a 10-year-old might
		    cathartically produce will certainly be too strong for a five-year-old. Each
	    entry must be considered individually, and on its own merits.</p>
	    <p>Despite its age and poor graphic design, <b>My Imaginary City</b> (<a href="../http://kids.tate.org.uk/games/my-imaginary-city/">http://kids.tate.org.uk/games/my-imaginary-city/</a>) is a very popular game on
		    Tate Kids, second only to <b>Street Art.</b> Again, this game is very popular with teachers who find the interface easy to
		    use. There were plans to adapt the game to allow content created within it to
		    be saved to My Gallery, but an unreliable contractor who created the Flash
		    files a few years earlier meant this was impossible to do.  The key lessons
		    learned from My Imaginary City is the importance of receiving and retain Flash
		    files from contractors/agencies, so updates can be made relatively smoothly
	    (that is, if the new developer can read the existing code!).</p>
	    <p>Changes have yet to be made to <b>Memento Mori</b> (<a href="../http://kids.tate.org.uk/games/memento-mori/">http://kids.tate.org.uk/games/memento-mori/</a>),
	    but there are plans to review and reduce the amount of text throughout. </p>
	    <h2>Films</h2>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="jacksonfig10.jpg" alt="figure 10" width="500" height="528"/></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 10: Orthus, the main character from the Art Sparks
	    films</p>
	    <p>Tate Kids produced five four-to-five minute films to sit in
		    the Films section of the Web site (that launched in November 2008) in
		    conjunction with the BAFTA-nominated Brothers McLeod (<a href="../http://brothersmcleod.co.uk/">http://brothersmcleod.co.uk/</a>) - a
		    real coup for Tate Kids, considering the small budget. The Brothers McLeod,
		    represented by Aardman (of Wallace and Grommit fame), have also created Pedro
	    and Frankensheep for CBBC, amongst other award-winning projects. </p>
	    <p>The innovative Art Sparks films for Tate are a mix of live
		    action and animation, focusing on one work from the Tate Collection per
		    episode. The two-headed main character Orthus acts as a guide to the art work,
		    with the two sides of his personality having heated debates about the pieces,
		    one head approving, the other head unsure. Once he agrees with himself, the
		    viewer sees real children working on their own pieces of work inspired by work
	    in the Tate Collection.</p>
	    <p>The films are currently being released at the rate of one
		    per month, and Tate is waiting until all films are live before undertaking
		    Press, PR and Marketing. The films currently receive around 400 unique visits a
	    month each. There are plans to also add the films to YouTube. </p>
	    <h2>Tate Create</h2>
	    <p>Tate Create (<a href="../http://kids.tate.org.uk/create/">http://kids.tate.org.uk/create/</a>) is the home of
		    off-line crafts-based activities. It was originally entitled The Zoom Room,
	    when it sat in the learning pages of Tate Online. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="jacksonfig11.jpg" alt="figure 11" width="500" height="422"/></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 11: Tate Create</p>
	    <p>The content was completely rewritten with an educational
		    consultant to appeal to children directly, so, with minimal adult help, they
		    could print the activities and get started. The Colouring Book
		    (<a href="../http://kids.tate.org.uk/create/colouring-book.shtm">http://kids.tate.org.uk/create/colouring-book.shtm</a>) was also created for the
		    final launch in July. Consisting of a series of line drawings of Tate’s out of
		    copyright works, it is aimed at younger or less-able children who should be
	    able to use the activity without difficulty (once downloaded and printed). </p>
	    <p>Tate believed it was imperative to have off-line activities to
		    encourage children to spend some time away from the computer to explore their
		    creativity in a myriad of ways, and also allow teachers, who may struggle with
		    technology through either lack of experience or inadequate equipment at their
	    institutions, to get involved.</p>
	    <h2>e-cards</h2>
	    <p>The e-cards system
		    (<a href="../http://kids.tate.org.uk/ecards/?stage=select">http://kids.tate.org.uk/ecards/?stage=select</a>) launched in late January 2009,
		    and allows users of Tate Kids to send on-line postcards featuring works from
		    the Tate Kids Collection to friends and family. The selection of cards can be
		    changed and updated so seasonal sets can be created for relevant occasions. The
		    e-cards are a good way to circulate the Tate Kids URL, and the delivered card
		    features Orthus and links to the films section. This allows Tate Kids to
	    cross-promote its own content. </p>
	    <h2>Adult Zone</h2>
	    <p>The Adult Zone (<a href="../http://kids.tate.org.uk/adults.shtm">http://kids.tate.org.uk/adults.shtm</a>) allows
		    Tate to directly appeal to gatekeepers. The star rating system is explained
		    honestly here. Each game or activity on the Web site is given a one-, two- or
		    three-star rating depending on the difficulty level of content: one star means
	    it’s suitable for all, and three stars meaning it is most suitable for the over-10s. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="jacksonfig12.jpg" alt="figure 12" width="500" height="425"/></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 12: The Adult Zone</p>
	    <p>In the areas of the Web site aimed directly at the children,
		    such as the games page, each star rating is described as a ‘Level’ to draw
		    parallels with standard video games, rather than ability. Tate was keen not to
		    include age ranges here, as it could be off-putting and alienating for older
		    children to be using content aimed at younger children. Not only might they
		    think it was ‘silly’, but if they were struggling with the game, they also might
	    feel they were ‘under-achieving’. </p>
	    <p>For parents, Tate aims to alleviate any safety fears
		    pertaining to the social network aspects present in My Gallery, and links to
		    the privacy policy. For teachers, we supplied three sample lesson plans
		    demonstrating how elements of the Web site can be used to create a lesson or
		    scheme of work for each relevant UK Key Stage, demonstrating how Tate Kids
		    could fulfill both Art and ICT curricula at KS1, KS2 and early KS3. Tate also
		    explained what age ranges the Key Stages cover, so educators from outside of
		    the UK and around the world could adapt the lesson plans as necessary. There
	    are also links to the Schools and Teacher and Families sites from here.</p>
	    <h2>Latest</h2>
	    <p><b>Latest</b> (<a href="../http://kids.tate.org.uk/news/">http://kids.tate.org.uk/news/</a>) is the news page that informs our users of new
		    content, and competition launches and results. While it is a useful way to
		    broadcast, Tate plans to convert the format into a blog so users can comment,
		    opening up dialogue and debate. This is most likely to be in the form of a
		    re-skinned WordPress blog, like Tate Tales, and will need to be pre-moderated
	    in the same way. </p>
	    <h2>Supporting Content</h2>
	    <p>The Tate Kids Safety Guide (<a href="../http://kids.tate.org.uk/safety_guide.shtm">http://kids.tate.org.uk/safety_guide.shtm</a>)
		    was created to alleviate safety fears for both users and gatekeepers. To make
		    it appeal to the main audience, it was created as an ‘acrostic’ using TATE KIDS
		    as a starting point. For example, the second T in Tate stands for ‘Tell no one
		    your real name’. The format helps keep the points short and easy to remember.
		    If users click the letters, they can find out more about each statement. In
		    case the user does not have Flash installed, there is an HTML version. Links to
		    the Safety Guide appear on the homepage, individual games pages, and the My
	    Gallery sign up screen. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="jacksonfig13.jpg" alt="figure 13" width="500" height="408"/></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 13: The Tate Kids Online Safety Guide</p>
	    <h3>Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy</h3>
	    <p>Tate’s official <b>Terms
		    and Conditions</b> (<a href="../http://kids.tate.org.uk/terms.shtm">http://kids.tate.org.uk/terms.shtm</a>) and <b>Privacy Policy</b> (<a href="../http://kids.tate.org.uk/privacy.shtm">http://kids.tate.org.uk/privacy.shtm</a>) were rewritten so children could understand
		    what we were asking of them. Tate believed it was imperative to do this, as
		    many sites aimed at kids overlook this, and the users are faced with incomprehensible
		    legalese. To ensure the message was still appropriate, the content was checked and
	    signed off by our in house lawyers.</p>
	    <h2>Marketing and Extending the Brand</h2>
	    <p>Retaining and growing our audience is a key objective for
		    Tate Kids, and Tate found it prudent to allocate a proportion of annual budget
		    (however small) for marketing, press and promotion. It was imperative to Tate,
		    due to budget constraints, to think laterally about promotion, and use the
	    positive connotations and popularity of the Tate brand to best use. </p>
	    <p>The Tate Kids marketing has being aimed at our three main
	    audiences – the 6-to-12s, their teachers, and their parents.</p>
	    <h3>Directly to the target audience</h3>
	    <p>Whilst the majority of our communication is via the
		    gatekeepers, we were keen for our audience to shout about Tate Kids in a safe
		    way, if they wanted to. The ‘send to a friend’ functionality in the Tate Paint
		    and Street Art games allowed some sections of the audience to become unofficial
		    advocates, by their positive distribution of user-generated content. The 2008
		    advent calendar and e-cards also work in this way, and Tate ensures that links
		    back to Tate Kids are included in the communication. In My Gallery, the
	    accolade of Gallery of the Month tends to immediately create advocates. </p>
	    <p>Although competitions technically go through gatekeepers,
		    they are an active way for the key audience to engage with Tate Kids and the
		    brand. Tate Kids has run two competitions since launch. The first asked
		    participants to use Tate Paint to create an environmental image for the Isle of
		    Wight Festival. The second, Design the Background, involved children creating a
		    piece of art inspired by the future – whatever that meant to them. The winning
		    work was then converted into an HTML and Flash-based work and became one of the
		    six backgrounds users can choose on the homepage. The competition was heightened
		    by the prize of an iPod nano. Competitions like this are important to Tate
		    Kids, as they further the idea of the site as a collaborative space, where the
		    users can have an effect on the content of Tate Kids, and their opinions heard
	    and acted on as and when necessary. </p>
	    <h3>Through the gatekeepers</h3>
	    <p>A crucial finding of the user testing conducted in Tate
		    Britain illustrated that visitors with families were unaware of the Web site
		    (in its previous incarnation) but were keen to use it once they knew it existed
		    and learned how to access it. Therefore engaging with visitors with families
		    was a key concern, and a number of additional avenues were explored to promote
	    the Web site to parents and teachers.</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="jacksonfig14.jpg" alt="figure 14" width="500" height="332"/></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 14: Tate Kids magnetic photo frames </p>
	    <p>To promote the launch, Tate Kids branded magnetic photo
		    frames were produced, in addition to flyers. These were used because of their
		    increased permanency over throwaway material sand their ability to be
		    customized, mirroring the user-generated elements of the Web site. Crucially,
		    they were around the same cost as flyers to produce. Each gallery was given a
		    number of photo frames to be distributed at Families events and to school
		    groups visiting the gallery. The Tate Kids Editor also uses them to supplement
	    competition prizes. </p>
	    <p>In terms of other off-line promotion, Tate Kids has been
		    advertised in the Guide, Tate’s bi-monthly brochure detailing exhibitions and
		    events at all four galleries. The Tate Kids logo and URL is slowly being added
		    to the portfolio of take-home printed materials used at Families events and
		    in-gallery games, and in conjunction with Marketing, Families, and Tate
		    Catering, Tate Kids will redesign the activity placement given to children who
	    use the refreshment facilities at all four sites. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="jacksonfig15.jpg" alt="figure 15" width="500" height="375"/></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig. 15: Tate Kids cards</p>
	    <p>Together with Tate Enterprises, the commercial arm of Tate
		    that encompasses publishing, catering and retail activities, Tate Kids cards
		    were created. Artists who work closely with Tate created the images, and the
		    Tate Kids logo and URL were added to the front and reverse of the cards. At the
	    moment, three cards are available, but there are plans to extend the range. </p>
	    <p>Tate Kids is cross-promoted on other relevant Tate Online
		    micro sites, including Families (<a href="../http://tate.org.uk/families/">http://tate.org.uk/families/</a>)
		    and Schools and Teachers (<a href="../http://tate.org.uk/schoolsteachers/">http://tate.org.uk/schoolsteachers/</a>),
		    and is regularly mentioned in e-bulletins sent out to subscribers of both of
		    the sites. New content is also featured on the Tate Online homepage as it
	    launches, normally for a week at a time.</p>
	    <p>Tate Kids commissioned an e-mail circular to 19,777 primary
		    schools in the UK (addressed to named art coordinator contacts where possible)
		    in September 2008, with a view to driving traffic to the site by introducing it
		    to teachers and publicizing the Design a Background competition: 25.4% of the e-mails
		    were opened the day they were sent, bringing 1,256 extra unique visitors to the
	    Web site that month. </p>
	    <p>My Imaginary City is listed on Dress Up Games (<a href="../http://www.dressupgames.com/">http://www.dressupgames.com/</a>),
		    a highly popular Icelandic links Web site that brings Tate Kids around 8,000
		    visitors each month. To build upon this, Tate Kids is listed on a range of Web
		    sites, including Show Me (<a href="../http://www.show.me.uk/">http://www.show.me.uk/</a>)
		    and Times Educational Supplement resources pages (<a href="../http://tinyurl.com/c5pyh8">http://tinyurl.com/c5pyh8</a>). Tate
		    Kids was also linked to via a popular Hollywood gossip site, Just Jared (<a href="../http://justjared.buzznet.com/2008/07/08/reese-witherspoon-museum-mommy/">http://justjared.buzznet.com/2008/07/08/reese-witherspoon-museum-mommy/</a>)
		    which blogged about actress Reece Witherspoon using the Web site. This brought
	    an extra 180 visitors that day. </p>
	    <h2>Forging Partnerships</h2>
	    <p>Tate has found that creating relationships with external
		    partners has aided awareness and promotion of Tate Kids. When deciding to work
		    on a joint venture, Tate has found it is imperative for the brand values of
		    both parties to align or complement each other, and the relationship must be
		    mutually beneficial. If not, there is a danger of the work negatively
	    subverting the expectations of both audiences, producing an undesirable experience. </p>
	    <h3>Moshi Monsters and Tate Kids</h3>
	    <p>Moshi Monsters (<a href="../http://www.moshimonsters.com/">http://www.moshimonsters.com/</a>)
		    is a growing virtual world with over one million subscribers, continuing  to
		    grow daily. The Web site attracts children aged between 9 and 11, with 77% of
		    those users being female. They have a thriving community who are very keen on
		    art and creating art, so a relationship between Tate and Moshi Monsters was beneficial
	    to both parties. </p>
	    <p>The partnership began with mutual links – Tate Kids games
		    and My Gallery were mentioned in their community blog every week during
		    November and December 2008, and Tate explained the influx of Moshi works in our
		    galleries to our users through our news pages. The partnership brought an
	    average of 700 extra visitors per day during the period.</p>
	    <p>To further develop the partnership, Tate Kids will be
		    working with Moshi Monsters to create a permanent presence in Monstro City, the
	    hub of the virtual world. This should be available to users from Winter 2009. </p>
	    <h3>Ignition and Tate Kids</h3>
	    <p>Ignition (<a href="../http://www.ignitefutures.org.uk/ignition/">http://www.ignitefutures.org.uk/ignition/</a>)
		    is a three-year programme created to promote STEM (science, technology,
		    engineering and mathematics) subjects through creative approaches, designed to
		    inspire the next generation of scientists, inventors and innovators. Working
		    under the Sci-art fusions strand (<a href="../http://www.ignitefutures.org.uk/ignition/sci-art-fusions/">http://www.ignitefutures.org.uk/ignition/sci-art-fusions/</a>),
		    Tate Kids and Ignition will be working together to create a fun and inspiring
		    interactive game concerned with conservation and restoration techniques and in
	    sync with My Gallery.</p>
	    <h3>Stardust and Tate Kids </h3>
	    <p>Stardust (<a href="../http://www.stardustkids.co.uk/">http://www.stardustkids.co.uk/</a>) is a small but
		    prolific children’s clothing store whose apparel aligns with the Tate Kids
		    brand. From November 2008 until stocks diminished, Stardust sent out a flyer
		    with Tate Kids information and URL in each order dispatched from their
	    warehouse.</p>
	    <h2>Outcomes and the Future</h2>
	    <p>Tate’s mission is ‘to increase public knowledge,
		    understanding and appreciation of art.’ Tate believes that Tate Kids meets this
		    remit by creating relevant, colourful, imaginative content that engages and
		    entertains while educating the intended audience in both formal and informal
	    contexts. </p>
	    <p>The redesigned Tate Kids launched in Beta in April 2008 and
		    final in July 2008, and typically receives 32,000 unique visits per month - a
		    marked increase from the average of 17,000 unique visitors Tate Kids was
		    receiving during the final months of 2007. Since its initial launch, new
		    content areas have been added, including the Films section and the Tate Kids
	    e-cards.</p>
	    <p>Tate Kids has been warmly received by its intended audiences.
		    The objectives for the future is to grow the Web site by 25% per year, with an
	    aim of 70,000 visitors per month late in the financial year 2011-12.</p>
	    <p>Since the Web site is continuing to grow, there are plans to
		    conduct another session of user testing to ensure the site is still meeting the
	    needs of the key audiences.</p>
	    <p>Budget permitting, My Gallery functionality will be updated,
	    and in addition the news page will become more interactive. </p>
	    <p>Following the addition of the URL and logo to greetings
		    cards via Tate Enterprises, Tate Kids is going to investigate the possibility
		    of expanding the brand to appear on merchandise in Tate shops both on- and off-line.
		    Ideally, if and when merchandise is redeveloped or launched, Tate Kids would
		    have the opportunity to share its brand and add the URL on the packaging and
		    product, where applicable. This would significantly drive traffic to Tate Kids
		    while helping to create a consistent and cohesive experience for children
	    visiting and experiencing Tate.</p>
