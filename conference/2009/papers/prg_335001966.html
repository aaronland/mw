          <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
          <p class="AbstractText">To enrich the exhibition <i>Traces du sacré</i> (Centre Pompidou, May 7th - August 11th 2008), a
    new multimedia system has been designed to manage contradiction and debate on a
    controversial theme related to the spiritual dimension in modern and
    contemporary art. The debate was launched through audio interviews with the
    curators and a few contradictors from the intellectual and artistic scene;
    these were  accessible both on the audio guide and on a new type of
    collaborative Web site. In the exhibition, visitors were able to record their
    own comments (vocal and drawings), using the multimedia guide or their mobile
    phone, and afterwards to access them on the Internet, modifying, annotating and
    indexing them, thanks to the software <i>Lignes
    de temps</i>, before sharing, publishing or podcasting them. This paper
    summarizes a 6-month qualitative study performed with different types of public
    (professionals, amateurs, non-amateurs) and consequently different type of
    practices and expectations in an unstable and experimental situation. </p>

      <h2>1. Instruments for the Amateurs</h2>
      
      Beyond <i>user generated
          content</i>, exponential development of social networks brings our attention
        towards social motivation in a new Web 3.0 convergence combining bottom-up
        social innovation with top-down semantic Web technologies. In this context, IRI
        experimentation performed for the exhibition <i>Traces du sacré </i>targeted <i>amateur</i> practices and instruments for critical judgment (using annotation technologies):
        long tail reading/writing tools, metadata production and exchange enriching
        content, and finally, multimodal mobile interfaces. <i>Enthusiasts</i> (White Chapel, April 2005/January 2006), <i>Click!</i> (Brooklyn Museum, August 2008), <i>YOU(ser) </i>at ZKM until August 2009, The<i> Art of participation</i> (SFMOMA, November
        2008/February 2009): there are currently a lot of exhibitions highlighting the
        process of user contribution, involving different figures such as the interactor,
        contributor or amateur. Amateur practices are the central issue of IRI / Centre
        Pompidou research. The status of amateur historically shifted from an
        aristocratic position (in France during 17th and 18<sup>th </sup>century)
        towards a mix between production and consumption in our modern society. Therefore
        with the Centre Pompidou exhibition <i>Traces
          du sacré</i>, we wanted to combine top-down approaches from curators and
        critiques with bottom-up contributions from visitors in order to reach
        collective judgment - which we call at IRI (referring to philosophers Gilbert
        Simondon and Bernard Stiegler), collective individuation or <i>transindividuation</i>. In other words, the
        goal of our experimentations is to enable the emergence of collective
        intelligence through a dialectic process, including consensus and dissensus
        highlighting, particularly in the context of what we like to identify as “tags
        tournament” or “semantic storm”. Issues and problems we tackled in the
        experimentation therefore relate to knowledge engineering problems in addition
        to getting social engineering deeper into dialogue tools. We wanted our product
        to be as stimulating as a guided tour with an expert in a museum can be, where
        there is more space for questions than for answers.
      <h2>2. Traces Du Sacré: Looking After Controversy</h2>
      <p>The first motivation for experimenting with a new
          contribution scheme on <i>Traces du sacré </i>was
          that one of its curators, Jean de Loisy, agreed on the principle of anticipating
          critics and controversies related to the topic of the exhibition itself. We
          first recorded his position across the 30 topics (and rooms) of the exhibition.
          Indeed, the exhibition intended to show how much the sacred (and maybe the
          spiritual) inspired modern and contemporary art. With the notable exception of
          a special issue of <i>Art Press</i> arguing
          against this position and titled “le sacré, voilà l’ennemi” (“the sacred, that
          is the enemy”) in reference to the May 68 slogan and major articles published
          in the last years, the controversy we expected did not develop. This was a
          first major drawback for the experimental use of tools intended for art
          amateurs willing to engage in a debate beyond the traditional “I like, I
          don&#39;t”. Despite this lack of controversy over the exhibition, we invited 6
          artists, critics and intellectuals to express “counterpoints”: Paul Ardenne
          (art historian), Barbara Cassin (philologist), Michel Deguy (writer), Marcel
          Gauchet (philosopher), Youssef Ishaghpour (writer and critique), Jacqueline
          Lichtenstein (philosopher). Their audio recordings served as the first level of
          dialogue with Jean de Loisy, in their entirety(usually 1 hour) on the Web site,
          and through selected excerpts on the audio guides provided by Antenna Audio. We
          tagged all these recordings by room/topic and documented them to allow non-linear
          navigation in <i>Lignes de temps</i> on the Web site through 3 entries: by contributor,
          by clicking on the number related to the room/topic on the map of the
          exhibition, or finally by typing keywords. The developed search engine had the
          capacity to open the corresponding timelines and to highlight where exactly in
      the recording the keyword had been used (see tab2). </p>
      <h2>3. Recording Comments in Mobility</h2>
      <p class="caption"><img src="Puig1.png" alt="figure 1" width="500" height="291"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: Technical set-up of the exhibition</p>
      <p>Long studied in cognitive science and in music (see François
          Pachet, <i>Des machines à sortir de soi</i>,
          in Le design de nos existences, Entretiens du Nouveau Monde Industriel 2007,
          IRI/Centre Pompidou-Mille et une nuits) is a principle that there is a need to
          practice in order to feel. The debate concerning the role of practice in
          artistic critique could be symbolically originated in the disagreement between
          Emmanuel Kant and Konrad Fiedler. According to the first (<i>Critique
            of Pure Reason</i>, 1781), aesthetic experience is a reflexive judgement; that
          is to say, essentially a non-cognitive activity; whereas the second (<i>On the
            origins of artistic activity</i>, 1887), argued one century after the
          Königsberg philosopher that artistic judgement should be conducted from the
          producer’s point of view, and not from the subject’s beauty. This was also
          Goethe’s idea of knowledge when he wrote in his <i>Italian Journey</i> (1786-1788): “What I have not drawn I have never really understood”. The
          Fiedler  perspective is to some extent a theoretical hypothesis from which IRI
          developed its research and experimentation on amateur-dedicated tools. In the
          context of viewers’practice and interactivity, a lot of laboratories are
          exploring interfaces based on new sensor/actuator modalities (voice, gesture,
          eye tracking …). In the museum context, these devices would benefit from being
          put in perspective with the practice of painting copies in Europe during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, in order to exploit graphical tablets, multi-point interfaces or even
          eBooks. But before these alternative interfaces come to market, amateurs started
          to hack existing devices. This is typically the case with amateur films or,
          more recently, with films realized on mobile phones. In the particular case of <i>Traces
            du sacré,</i> we experimented with communication objects in mobility: audio
          guides with recording features from Antenna Audio (these devices allow recording
          short voice messages on each topic/room, in reaction to presented paintings or
          to related comments and counterpoints) and mobile phones using a vocal server
          developed with the help of Kevin Walker using an open source technology called <i>Asterisk,</i> allowing even small museums to
          build their own systems without investment costs. All recorded comments (vocal
          or drawings) were automatically uploaded on the visitors’ private space of the
          exhibition Web site, allowing visitors, after returning home, to build their
          own visit record mixing personal contributions with those of the other
      visitors, and of the curators and invited speakers. </p>
      <h2>4. Navigation / Annotation on Contributions</h2>

      <p class="caption"><i><a href="puig-fig2.html">Fig 2 and 3: Search
      engine for direct access into the AV recordings</a></i></p>
      <p>IRI developed for the exhibition <i>Traces du sacré</i> a collaborative platform where vocal comments
          recorded on audio guides or mobile phones can be edited and mixed in an on-line
          version of <i>Lignes de temps</i> in order to produce a personal visit or to
          ask questions of the curator and other personalities recorded by IRI. <i>Lignes de temps</i> is an audio/video
          annotation tool which uses the full potential of the digital media context.
          Inspired by timelines traditionally used in digital video editing software, <i>Lignes de temps</i> features a graphical
          representation of the audio of video recording, revealing immediately its
          entire segmentation. <i>Lignes de temps</i> brings an alternative view by rendering a graphical score or spatial
          cartography instead of the traditional temporal stream familiar to all video
          viewers. Therefore, by selecting a segment in <i>Lignes de temps,</i> the user can directly describe and analyze, with
      textual, vocal and video comments, images of Web links. </p>
      <p>The new feature we added to <i>Lignes de temps</i> for the
          exhibition is mainly related to a search engine of a new kind based on the
          pre-indexing of the comments which were all related to a given topic/room
          identified by a number (100 to 600). This allowed users to type a keyword
          related to the audio- and video-tagged sequences users wanted to retrieve. Non-linear
          listening is then possible from sequence to sequence in the database of
          recorded comments visible in the form of highlighted markers or sequences
      inside the video timelines. </p>
      <h2>5. Building “My Visit”</h2>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig4" id="fig4"></a><a href="puig-fig4.html"><img src="Puig4.png" alt="figure 4" width="500" height="329"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="puig-fig4.html"><i>Fig 4: Web interface
      for building “my visit”</i></a></p>
      <p>In the personal space available on the exhibition Web site,
          a tool using <i>Lignes de temps</i> was
      developed allowing users</p>
      <ol>
        <li>to select contributions from any of the curator, invited speakers
        and other visitors, </li>
      <li>to build “my visit” with the preferred sequences, </li>
      <li>to publish this visit in the form of a new <i>Lignes de temps</i> (published after Centre Pompidou moderation), </li>
      <li>to podcast “my visit” in audio form. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Finally, we ended up with a complex system in which the Web
          site design and interface were not quite adapted to the data collected and its
      manipulation; for instance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On the audio guides, the access to the tools themselves was quite
            intuitive. However, technical limitations made their use difficult, if not
            impossible. Examples of this were the limitation on the duration of the audio
            recordings, and lack of T9 keyboard for entering comments. However, during the
            experiment, the length of audio recording was augmented. We then found that the
            way the audio guide was perceived had radically changed. Unfortunately, this
        improvement was implemented too late to gather a lot of meaningful data.</li>
      <li>Some visitors had difficulties with entering stop signs numbers
        to find the comments and be allowed to produce annotations. In the future we would
        like to experiment with the introduction of geopositioning (GPS). This could
        leverage the difficulties that some visitors  found in entering the stop
        numbers, and also could help in reducing the coarse level of division offered
        by the existing exhibition stop signs.</li>
      <li>Currently there are no cross-searching possibilities on the Web site,
        but the forthcoming version of the collaborative platform will enable multiple
        logical operations and combinations from lists of keywords and semantic status.
        These improvements will notably take place in the context of a future
        collaboration of IRI with CEA aiming at the development of innovative
        multimedia search and navigation tools.</li>
      <li>Finally, we did not fully explore the interactive aspect of the
        experimentation. Most visitors were frustrated by the fact that they could not
        directly listen to what other visitors had said or written at the same spot. It
        was possible to go on the Web site and listen to some published comments, but
        they were not directly and dynamically available on the mobile device (or on
        the phone server).</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>6. Usage Analysis</h2>
      <p>A study carried out during the exhibition by Cécilia
          Jauniau, Master 2, University Paris 13, has shown different reactions collected
          on a limited focus group of 20 people divided into 3 user profiles: amateurs-experts
          (professionals), self-declared amateurs, and self-declared non-amateurs; conducted
          both in the exhibition (using the audio guide or the phone) and later through the
          Internet for Web site usage analysis. Amateurs are identified by existing
          practices of taking notes and drawings, reading notices and catalogues,
          visiting with other amateurs, visiting the same exhibition several times, and
          usually not asking for an audio guide. Self-declared non-amateurs are identified
          as looking more for emotions, interactive or tactile contact with art, calling
          for mediation and educational materials, remembering the exhibition through
          traditional means such as taking photos or buying postcards, and finally declaring
          a larger interest in audio guides. For this user profile, recording audio
          comments is a most unusual practice, but the ubiquitous status of the mobile
      phone can help overcome the issue.</p>
      <p>The study first highlighted that more attention should be
          paid to human mediation, pedagogical use cases, visits specifically organized
          using the system. Indeed, it is necessary to integrate such systems in the
          exhibition set-up taking into account social, cultural and technological
          constraints. For instance, using telephones is generally prohibited in the
          exhibition space and generates noise in the room and on the recording; a
          specific room like the ones proposed for consulting catalogues should be
          installed in the exhibition. The museum is nowadays considered by many as a
        “sacred” place (even more so when taking about the spiritual dimension in
      Art!),and this brings a lot of inhibitions. </p>
      <p>More precisely, the analysis brought us to a lot of
      interesting conclusions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Leaving traces or comments during the visit is positively
            perceived as much more participative than previous receive-only devices and
            allows better memorization of the pieces. However, all profiles called for more
            freedom on the selected object to be commented on(topic/room in the
            experimentation), and especially comments related to each piece of art. This
            makes the system complex and may produce comments that won’t be recovered by
        other visitors. We could lose the benefit of our pre-indexing set-up.</li>
      <li>Amateurs appreciated the counterpoints and were willing to
        respond at least just by asking questions. A microphone open to two or three
        visitors would have been useful for them. Non-amateurs regret not being able to
        listen to visitors’ comments in the exhibition: they were looking more for
        emotional reactions, funny comments or curious associations.</li>
      <li>The discourse on the art works or on the artists is more familiar
        than a discourse on the exhibition topics (even in the form of counterpoints)
        and could bring more contributions. Amateurs were resistant to segmentation of
        the discourse according to public categories (adults, teenagers, children) but
        suggested different tracks by disciplines (art history, religion, history,
        philosophy …).</li>
      <li>Mediation for teaching why and how to use the system is necessary,
        but beyond that, organizing specific visits involving teachers or grouping
        visitors according to their type of interest would probably also increase
        contributions.</li>
      <li>Enigmas, games, questions, visit scenarios were not used. They
        could fit well with the contribution system.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>7. Cine Lab Project and Future Perspectives</h2>
      <p class="caption">`<a name="fig5" id="fig5"></a><a href="puig-fig5.html"><img src="Puig5.jpg" alt="figure 5" width="500" height="375"/></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="puig-fig5.html"><i>Fig 5: Semantic
      Compass, browsing through polemical dimension</i></a></p>
      <p>Cine Lab is a research project (2007-2009) supported by ANR
          (National Research Agency in France).It aims to push further for a collaborative
          framework in the education domain for large archives, since annotations
          produced and shared by amateurs (including on mobiles) remain independent of
          the content itself. Partners working with IRI / Centre Pompidou are Forum des
          Images (Paris Film Library), LIRIS (CNRS-Lyon I) and Antenna Audio (Discovery
          group). Its goal is to design and experiment with a system for temporal object
          annotation, production of metadata and editorial materials, by using innovative
          tools for audio comments recordings, photo, video catch-up and typed texts, in
          various media, including mobile devices. Annotations remain independent from
          the commented content in order to be freely shared over networks, so that any
          user can get them and synchronize them with the content in its integrity.
          Further developments after Cine Lab include the development in collaboration
          with critics, designers and writers of: improved collaborative annotation
          interfaces; a  direct voice/video recording tool for <i>Lignes de temps</i> on-line; tools for collective management of tags
          (tag fights, multilingual issues); and finally, navigation through polemics (by
          adding polemical typology to the tagging process: pro, cons, questions,
          references) through an interface called the <i>Semantic
      Compass). </i></p>
