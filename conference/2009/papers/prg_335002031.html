      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA) identified the
          institutional Web site as a central tool in building awareness of  not only its
          resources and activities, but also its character and vision. To meet this
          mandate, the user experience of its Web site would need to signify a new
      approach to accessing the content. </p>
      <p>In  past years, the Web has been subject to significant
          changes. Web sites have evolved from static resources to dynamic and
          interactive applications used for a broad range of activities. A major finding
          is the decreasing prominence of backtracking, or the use of the ‘back’ button,
          in Web navigation (Weinreich <i>et al</i>.,
      2008).</p>
      <p>Different browsing metaphors are expanding from navigation
          bars, drop-down menus, and sitemaps. More recent mechanisms such as
          tag-browsing, timelines, calendars, and the presentation of contextualised
          content are being offered to support general purpose browsing (consulting
          sources that likely contain items of interest) as well as serendipitous, or
          purely random browsing. A visitor to YouTube (<a href="../http://www.youtube.com/">http://www.youtube.com</a>), for
          example, is most likely to enter into a loop of endless content consumption as
          related videos are proposed, rather than rely on the limited capabilities
          offered by the site’s main navigation tools. Blogs are another example where
          emphasis is placed on the content of the site at any given moment, rather than
      its navigational structure.</p>
      <p>This paper addresses how these new ways of presenting
          information may apply to the concept and design of the CCA’s new Web site. Is
          there a way the content and overall structure of the site could be explored
          without the use of traditional hierarchical navigation elements? Would users’
        needs still be supported? To address these questions, the case study presented
        here (Section 2) moves from the initial stages of a focused research study on
        the CCA’s target audience, including staff members, to the presentation of the
          results obtained from testing a high fidelity prototype. The results are
          discussed (Section 3) according to how the designed browsing mechanisms support
          identified user needs while simultaneously offering related and perhaps
          unexpected content. The following offers an overview of the evolution of
      certain browsing mechanisms.</p>
      <h3>1.1 Browsing Mechanisms</h3>
      <p>Browsing has been described by Marchionini and Shneiderman
          (1988) as “an exploratory, information-seeking strategy that depends upon serendipity<i>.</i>” Browsing can be characterised by the
          absence of planning; in essence, browsing explores both the structure of the
          information space and its contents (Chen <i>et
      al</i>., 1998).</p>
      <p>In the early days of the Internet, users were limited mainly
          to hypertext browsing services through links between keywords and topics
          embedded in the text. In such a context, problems arise when a user’s mental
          model of the information does not conform to that of the author (Chen <i>et al</i>., 1998; Killam, B., 2001). The use
          of categories or the separation of large bodies of information into subjects
          improves the efficiency of exploring large information spaces (Capra, <i>et al</i>. 2003). Yahoo! was the first
          browsing/searching service to employ this mechanism, in 1995. From this point
          onward,  navigational tools such as navigation bars, drop-down menus, and
      sitemaps have become ubiquitous across the Internet.</p>
      <p>Recent studies, however, have shown that users look directly
          at the content and ignore the navigation areas while scanning a new page
          (Nielsen, 2000). While removing all navigation elements may be too extreme, it
          is considered good practice to reduce the number of navigation items. Related
          links to a page or topic in question have proven to be useful (Porter, 2006)
          and are encouraged in Web site design.  The TED Web site (<a href="../http://www.ted.com/">http://www.ted.com/</a>),
          for example, offers a successful balance of browsing capabilities, placing
          emphasis on content while providing some tools, such as a search engine and the
      ability to browse through themes, speakers, and talks.</p>
      <p>With the evolution of the Internet as a platform, more
          collaborative or participatory systems have emerged. Tagging systems, for
          example, allow users to assign keywords to resources (Jäschke, <i>et al</i>., 2007). Tags are used for
          navigation, finding resources, and serendipitous browsing; they provide an
      immediate reward for users (e.g. <a href="../http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/">http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/</a>).</p>
      <p>Freeing content from format, describing content through
          metadata (information about the data), and building object-oriented system
          architectures have opened multiple opportunities to design creative ways to
          present information. Yahoo! Research labs have developed a prototype showing
          the evolution of Flickr tags over time (<a href="../http://research.yahoo.com/taglines/">http://research.yahoo.com/taglines/</a>).
          Time-based or chronological groupings have emerged as an alternative way to
          organise or display information over subject groupings. Viewzi
          (<a href="../http://www.viewzi.com/">http://www.viewzi.com/</a>) allows users to view any search results along an
          interactive timeline. Plurk (<a href="../http://www.plurk.com/">http://www.plurk.com/</a>) is a micro-blogging service
          that enables users to visualise updates according to when they were posted.
          Calendar applications are also constantly emerging, with options to sort, display,
      and manipulate data according to a user’s preferences (<a href="../http://www.etsy.com/">http://www.etsy.com/</a>).</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, the concept of the Semantic Web is an
          evolving extension of the Web (Berners-Lee, <i>et
            al.</i> 2001).  Current efforts along these lines include services such as
          headup (<a href="../http://www.headup.com/">http://www.headup.com/</a>), where their vision of semantic Web browsing
          can be described as “associative browsing,” an experience that is devoid of any
          dependence on the predefined hypertext link routes that currently map the
      relationships between documents on the Web. </p>
      <p>Recent research efforts have focused on the design of
          adaptive user interfaces (Yen, &amp; Acay, in press), where machine learning
          techniques and rule-based systems are incorporated as part of the intelligence
          of the system. An increasing number of Web sites allow users to personalise or
          customise their visits based on their interests. The term ‘personalisation’
        often refers to changes made based on implicit data, such as items purchased
        on-line or pages viewed; in contrast, the term ‘customisation’ is employed when
          a Web site only uses explicit data, such as ratings or preferences (Wikipedia,
          <a href="../http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization</a>). Amazon (<a href="../http://www.amazon.com/">http://www.amazon.com/</a>)
          is an early adopter of personalisation technology, recommending products to
          customers based upon their previous purchases, and thus making use of
          collaborative filtering technology. Nagino &amp; Yamada (2003) have proposed a
          system that learns a user’s browsing patterns and suggests other Web sites that
      reflect those browsing strategies.</p>
      <p>These emerging browsing mechanisms were identified as the
          best tools to develop a Web site able to reflect the CCA’s character and
          vision. The new Web site is conceived not as a representation of the
          institution, but as its most elaborated and complete presentation. The CCA’s
          diverse resources and activities are seen in a unified image, no longer
          restricted by the divisions and hierarchies among different institutional
          departments and content sources. Browsing mechanisms such as presenting content
          in a contextualised manner rather than according to the CCA’s internal
          structure, as well as advanced calendar and search capabilities were seen as
          ideal tools to meet the project goals while responding to the identified needs
      of the CCA’s target audience.</p>
      <h2>2. CCA Web Site Design Approach: Methodology</h2>
      <p>To take advantage of current and developing browsing tools,
          the design process employed in the development of the new CCA Web site was
          inspired by the user-centred design (UCD) approach, a widely accepted
          methodology for creating usable applications or systems that aim to truly meet
          the needs of users. Fig. 1 gives an overview of this method, described further
      in the following sections.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="boddeker.fig1.png" alt="figure 1" width="500" height="353"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: The design process of the CCA Web site is centred on
      the user </p>
      <p>User-centred design can be defined as multi-stage,
          spanning from the observation and gathering of a user’s requirements to field
      evaluations of new and/or existing products.</p>
      <h3>2.1 Observation: user research </h3>
      <p>One of the most interesting challenges in any design process
          is to understand the user’s needs. The scope of this initial stage in the
      development of the CCA Web site was:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>to develop a clear understanding of existing and desired target
          audiences for the CCA Web site; </li>
        <li>to understand the target audiences’ on-line habits and
          expectations for content and resources on-line; </li>
        <li>to analyse and categorise the main user types of the CCA Web site
          in order to guide the development of the new site’s architecture and
          navigation. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="listwithbullets">Overall,
          this research study involved collecting data from an independent survey of CCA
          visitors and members (approx. 500 participants), and an independent on-line
          survey of CCA Web site users (approx. 200 participants); field studies (Millen,
          2000) with targeted external users; individual working sessions with CCA staff;
          and conversations and observations with members of the public during guided
      tours, public programs, and other on-site activities. </p>
      <p class="listwithbullets">The
          initial quantitative surveys led to the identification of specific members of
          the CCA’s desired target audience which includes a specialised sector of
          architects, design professionals, and scholars. A sample of representative
          individuals who expressed both positive and negative impressions and interests
          in relation to the CCA was selected for a field study. The study involved
          interviews with five university students, an art director, three architects,
          two academics, and ten staff members ranging from exhibitions, collections and
          administrative staff to those in direct contact with the public, such as front
          desk attendants and guides. Three of the external users interviewed were
      identified and approached at CCA public events.</p>
      <p class="listwithbullets">Interactions
          with the field study participants were purposely informal in order to generate
          a certain rapport with them. The interviews, or working sessions (IDEO Human
          factors Team, 2003), were conducted in participants’ familiar environment, such
          as their workplace, home, university, or neighbourhood café. Working sessions
          sought to explore users’ knowledge, experience, and typical form of engagement
          with the CCA, as well as their means of finding information on current events
          and activities. Participants were asked to draw their vision of the CCA on
          paper, and share their favourite on-line tools or Web sites, as well as how
      they keep up to date with the CCA.</p>
      <p class="listwithbullets">From
          the outset of the project, CCA staff members were seen as equal to the external
          audience as end users of the new Web site. Whether researching the Collection,
          accessing information, or creating content, staff members and the public are
          equally considered both potential contributors to and visitors of the Web site.
          A major goal in creating the new Web site was to improve collaboration and
          working processes with both internal and external collaborators, and to create
      a visible reference for a new institutional culture. </p>
      <p class="listwithbullets">Including
          CCA staff members in the field research was thus crucial in this phase of the
          project. Interviews with staff sought to explore interrelationships of their
          daily tasks, the programs organised, the objects in the Collection, as well as
          their interactions with the public. These conversations clarified the working
          processes of staff across different departments, and identified where potential
          content could be generated for the new Web site. They also suggested where new
          on-line tools might facilitate internal work and services offered to the
      public.</p>
      <p class="listwithbullets">The
          combined qualitative, quantitative, internal and external research informed the
          design of the backend and frontend system, and was translated in the subsequent
      phase of the project as a content production strategy.</p>
      <h4>2.1.1 Research findings: user needs </h4>
      <p>Three primary CCA Web site user types, termed Persona, were
          identified: General Public, Professional, and Researcher (Fig. 2). The on-line
          survey identified a significant portion of them as sophisticated Internet users
          familiar with multiple Web functionalities (e-commerce (88%), up/downloading
          (32%), blogging (13%), etc.). Each Persona sought specific and easily
          accessible content by varying means of navigation. All were interested in
          information and resources offered in excess of their initial reasons for
          visiting the Web site; in other words, they were open to exploring and
      discovering new content.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="boddeker.fig2.png" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="363"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 2: This figure demonstrates how target users in the
      three identified Persona typically explore content</p>
      <p>CCA exhibitions as well as films, lectures, and other public
          events form the core of most visitors’ experiences: thus the need for readily
          accessible information and a schedule of programs on-line. Exhibitions have a
          strong reputation with regular and occasional CCA visitors, many of whom stated
          a desire to access more activities on-line, including the content of past
          events. A major problem with the previous version of the CCA Web site, as
          identified by users, was a sparseness of information. It was not so much a lack
          of information – “mostly it is all there” – but the way in which it was
          presented failed to support two major needs: goal-oriented tasks (e.g. direct
          access to a regularly updated schedule of events, information on how to access
      the Collection, etc.), and an exploratory experience of content.</p>
      <p>Objects in the CCA Collection mainly attract a well-defined
          audience of academic researchers. However, the potential to broaden this
          audience was observed through on-line access or previews of such objects.
          Presenting specific aspects of the Collection on-line through the use of
          narrative was seen as a way to promote the richness and diversity of the CCA
          Collection without imposing a massive allocation of resources. In large part,
          public knowledge of the CCA’s holdings was found to have been transmitted by
          word of mouth or by reading about the Collection in other publications – but
      not through the CCA Web site. </p>
      <p>One of the conclusions drawn from this research was that
          many visitors to the CCA have a knowledge of the institution that is confined
          to specific resources or activities. Current visitors may know of certain
          aspects, but do not have a full image of the true scope of the CCA’s resources
          and activities. Yet, as Fig. 2 demonstrates, there is much crossover of interests
          among members of the CCA’s target audience, and much of the research has shown
      that visitors are interested in accessing more content.</p>

      <h3>2.2 Web site concept: addressing user needs </h3>
      <p>The proposed CCA Web site employs a thematic or contextual
          approach to presenting content, a configuration more typically found in Web
          sites for news or social organisations. Content is grouped by thematic
          relationships, rather than according to the internal structure of the
          institution or the source of the content. An individual item of content is
      always accompanied by related material.</p>
      <p>The contextual concept also allows CCA content to be
          presented in any format with a capacity for varying emphasis, both in terms of
          visibility on the Web site and richness of available on-line material. In this
          approach, the user’s experience of the site changes over time and with each
          visit. Related content from different areas of the CCA is presented
          concurrently, offering a selection of material that promotes current and past
      content from all areas of the CCA in a non-hierarchical manner.</p>
      <p>Overall, the concept offers multiple ways to access content
      (mapping the scenarios described in Table 1): </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Contextualised Content Navigation</b>:
          All related items of content (recommended by the system based on editorial
          relationships) are accompanied by headings which link back to the five main
          categories or overview pages: Collection, Exhibitions, Education &amp; Events,
          Study Centre, and CCA Recommends. These categories represent the resources and
          activities of the institution: in this way, the user is presented with
          additional content that is likely of interest while also understanding the
          nature and source of the content. Related content is also tagged with keywords
          by staff and visitors to the Web site.</li>
        <li><b>Calendar</b>: Encompassing
          all date-driven activities and events at the CCA, the calendar tool enables
          users to find and keep track of exhibitions, lectures, films, family
          activities, etc., without having to understand the institution’s internal
          structure (for example, lectures could be found either under Study Centre or
          Education and Events). The user may also refine the calendar to his or her
          needs by toggling on or off activities of interest. While the Web site
          remembers the latest settings in the calendar, special activities can be
          promoted to all users through bypassing the users&#39; preferences or settings. The
          calendar includes an RSS feed and options to subscribe through Google or iCal.</li>
        <li><b>Browse CCA</b>: A
          navigational tool allows users to access and sort all content on the Web site
          according to category, type, date, media, etc. All video content, for example,
          all material available for download, or all Study Centre seminars, may be
          viewed together.</li>
        <li><b>Supersearch</b>: A
          powerful search engine accesses multiple databases at the CCA (Collections
          On-line, Library Catalogue, Archives Finding Aids, Bookstore) as well as content
          on the Web site, and parses information for the user.</li>
        <li><b>Sidebar - CCA Information</b>:
          Permanent links to essential reference information for visitors are visible and
          accessible from each page of the Web site.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The contextual approach provides a great service to both
          internal and external CCA users by establishing otherwise unidentified links
          between content from different areas. This allows users to discover information
      and resources they didn’t know they were looking for.</p>
      <h3>2.3 Interface Design: Translating user needs into a UI </h3>
      <p>A wireframe (Fig. 3) was used in the initial stages as a
          means of communication with the graphic design team. This wireframe gives an
          overview of the user interface (UI), showing essential elements of the site
          that a user would be able to easily and quickly identify, learn, and remember
      in subsequent visits. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="boddeker.fig3.png" alt="figure 3" width="500" height="342"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 3: Wireframe representation of the user interface (UI). </p>
      <p>Moving from a wireframe concept to a functional, simple, and
          graphically treated user interface requires extensive iterations (a cycle of
          prototyping, evaluating, and refining). The concept and interface design studies
          went through multiple iterations. In a user-centred design approach, each
          iteration is subjected to user testing or other evaluation methods designed to
          reveal and eliminate potential usability problems. User testing allows
          designers to take advantage of any insights that emerge from the tests and make
      improvements in subsequent iterations. </p>
      <p>Many iterations were made with the CCA as client, often
          considered the second subset of users (Stone, <i>et al</i>., 2005). Various prototypes from low- to high-end fidelity
          were developed, as explained in the following section. This paper only explores
          the usability testing with external users in detail. The results presented stem
          from testing the November 2008 version of the high fidelity prototype (Figs. 4
      &amp; 5), the most recent at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>While the process of evaluating and refining multiple
          iterations of the interface might seem time-consuming, it was very much in
          keeping with the character of the CCA as both a research institution and a
          museum devoted to architecture. It was essential that the graphic interface and
          functionalities of the new Web site be grounded in well-considered ideas and
          research that was subject to testing, with the potential to push the
          development of new ideas in response to user needs. The process of evaluating
          multiple versions can be seen as a metaphor in parallel to the work of
          architects, where prototypes or physical models are built, modified, and
      rebuilt.</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 4: Example of the user interface based on the original
      wireframe in Fig. 3 </p>
      <h3>2.4 Prototyping: modeling the new CCA Web site </h3>
      <p>Prototypes are representations of a design made before the
          actual product exists. They are considered to be great tools to communicate
          ideas and inform design decisions. Prototypes may be of any sort, from sketches
          on paper (low fidelity) to working modules or systems that mimic the desired
          system at various levels: ‘looks like,’ ‘behaves like,’ and ‘works like’ 
        (Buchenau &amp; Suri. 2000). A prototype can be an efficient mechanism to
          transmit design intent from a system architect to a developer, allow for early
          interaction with users, and provide a platform for analysis and a vehicle to
          validate and evolve system requirements. During the course of developing the
          new CCA on-line, various frontend and backend prototypes were designed and
          tested for the external users and staff. In this process, all required and
          potential fields for entering information into the Web site were elaborated as
          a series of content templates that would translate successfully into the
      desired front end.</p>
      <h3>2.5 User testing: One of many cycles in an iterative approach</h3>
      <p>Usability testing is a technique used to evaluate a product
          in the context of specific real-world tasks along with the users. The overall
          objective is to understand a user’s behaviour while interacting with the
          interface in order to discover errors and potential areas for improvement
          (Barnum, 2001). Usability testing generally involves measuring how well test
          subjects respond in the following areas: efficiency (how long it takes to
          complete a task), accuracy, including whether mistakes are fatal or
      recoverable, and emotional response.</p>
      <p>The tasks and scenarios designed for testing the CCA Web
          site prototype were guided by the initial user research.  The following section
          describes the results of tests conducted with five participants on an
          individual basis, including two international graduate students in fields
          unrelated to architecture; two professionals in the fields of architecture and
          design; and one academic researcher (scholar). The participants were recorded
          (using a Webcam synchronized with Silverback, a usability testing software) and
          encouraged to share their thoughts aloud with the interviewer as they went
      through the exercises. </p>
      <h3>2.6  Results and future work </h3>
      <p>Overall, the usability tests revealed that the proposed
          navigation tools helped users complete their tasks. Nevertheless, some work
          remains to be done in the fine tuning of the graphic interface in order to
          avoid inconsistencies that might lead to confusion. While there are many
          interesting details and aspects to discuss, the main findings in relation to
      the proposed browsing mechanisms are presented here.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Contextualised Content Navigation</b>:
          Users familiar with the CCA had no problem understanding that recommended
          content was also related to categories encompassing the main resources and
          activities of the CCA (Collection, Exhibition, Education and Events, Study
          Centre, CCA Recommends). Immediately after reading the category names
          associated with the content, they understood that this link would bring them to
          an overview page where all recent content from the category would be found. Users
          unfamiliar with the CCA took more time to understand the function and the idea
          behind the related content associated to the main categories. Nevertheless,
          after exploring the homepage and two other internal content pages (e.g. an
          exhibition page), they realised that all content was related and linked back to
          these categories. </li>
        <li><b>Calendar</b>: The Calendar
          was a popular function with the users, especially those in academia. The option
          to filter the selection of events presented was particularly praised. However,
          while all users saw the calendar as a useful asset, when answering the question
          of where to find information about CCA activities and events, their immediate
          reaction was to go to “Browse CCA” and “Education and Events.” Once they had
          been exposed to the Calendar, they kept referring to it for keeping track of
          upcoming activities. </li>
        <li><b>Browse CCA</b>: For some
          users the title ‘Browse CCA’ did not clearly express the function of the tool,
          but once they landed on the Browse page they immediately understood the idea
          behind it: the various ways to sort or access information in terms of
          categories, activities, media type, etc. </li>
        <li><strong>Supersearch</strong>: Users expected the search tool to perform as well as
          Google, in the sense that information of the highest relevance would be listed
          first. Users mentioned that if this were not the case, they would refer back to
          the Browse CCA tool. The researchers in the test group particularly appreciated
          the fact that results are parsed by category, giving them quick access to what
          they were looking for.</li>
        <li><b>Sidebar - CCA Information</b>:
          None of the participants hesitated when asked to find key information about the
          CCA such as the location or the role of the institution. Each page of the
          Sidebar presents the user with related or contextualised links as well as the
          main content categories, so the overall navigation structure of the Web site
          was continually re-enforced, making it easy to learn and remember where
          information could be found.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="caption">Fig 5: Overview of the main browsing pages</p>
      <h2>3. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The new CCA Web site serves as an innovative case study for
          the replacement of a traditional navigation menu in favour of browsing tools
          supported by search and calendar functions. The CCA Web site allows content to
          be presented in multiple formats with varying emphasis depending on the
          selected browsing experience. Content is organised within the system by theme,
          offering users items that are related to the main subject of their viewing.
          These groupings allow users to discover information and resources in an
          exploratory fashion, while various browsing modalities, including the potential
          to sort content according to date or type, an adaptable calendar and advanced
          search capabilities, address users’ needs. The presentation of related content
      in a categorised manner also supports goal-oriented tasks.</p>
      <p>Users are presented with an exciting and diverse on-line
          experience, yet one that is easily navigable through the four navigational
          tools (Contextualised content, Browse CCA, Calendar, Supersearch), accompanied
          by permanent access to essential information (Sidebar). In addition to
          providing users with the primary information they are looking for, the
          contextual approach offers the potential for users to discover new and
      unexpected aspects of the CCA. </p>
      <p>The proposed structure thus meets the project mandate by
        “allowing fluid and integrated access to all CCA activities and resources,” and
          by “eliminating the traditional hierarchies and organisational divisions.” This
          unified presentation allows the new Web site to fully reflect the institution’s
      character and vision.</p>
      <p>Looking into the future, one of the interesting aspects of
          this project is providing CCA staff and external collaborators with the means
          to create new content on-line. This not only helps in the daily work of content
          production, but also expands the possibilities of building an extensive and
          accurate institutional presence on-line. With the concept and tools developed
          for the Web site, the CCA will be able to quickly provide its audience with new
          navigational and visualization tools.  One of the future ideas to implement is
          a dynamic sitemap that will allow users to explore all the content
      relationships in the Web site through an interactive visualization tool.</p>
