      <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="AbstractText">Handheld GPS-triggered location-based devices seem ideal for
      outdoor heritage sites. In this age of economic strain, they may be able to
      attract new audiences and draw existing audiences to return more often. But
      what do we really know about how these devices impact visitor experience and
      learning? Which segments of our audience do they actually appeal to? Can
      heritage institutions with limited financial and human resources develop these
      types of projects sustainably? To find out, between November 2007 and July
      2008, Parks Canada staff developed and launched three handheld GPS-triggered
      tours. The process of developing the tours was monitored closely throughout the
      8-month development period, and feedback gathered from team members and other
      staff. Then during the two-month pilot period, over 1000 visitors used the
      devices; regular feedback was provided by  users, staff and team members, and a formative evaluation was undertaken. </p>
    <p class="AbstractText">The project had many positive outcomes, including
      recommendations for streamlining the development process and product delivery,
      a better understanding of the target audience, and suggestions for improving
      the usability and effectiveness of the devices. </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Parks Canada, an agency of the Canadian federal government,
      is responsible for protecting, managing and interpreting Canada’s nationally
      significant natural and cultural places. The Parks Canada network is vast. It
      spreads throughout Canada, and includes all 42 of Canada’s national parks, 158
      of this country’s national historic sites, and 3 national marine conservation
      areas. Local site staff and field unit staff manage each park and site, and are
      supported by regional service centres and the national office in Gatineau.</p>
    <p>Although Parks Canada is well-regarded in the minds of many
      Canadians, the agency is facing a number of challenges. Overall, sites have
      seen a significant decline in attendance in the past 5 years, with national
      historic sites suffering the largest losses. This decline has been partially
      attributed to a changing Canadian population and diminishing relevance to this
      audience. Perhaps, it has been suggested, as Canadians become more urban and
      live further from national parks and historic sites and as the traditional
      audience ages and shrinks in number, Parks Canada’s sites are no longer meeting
      the needs of Canadians.</p>
    <p>To deal with this challenge, Parks Canada is striving to
      reach new audiences through a renewal of its offerings at sites and parks and
      through a greater emphasis on enhancing visitor experience and learning. The
      New Media Strategies and Investment Unit contributes to this effort by looking
      at emerging technologies that could attract new audiences and appeal to
      existing audiences. </p>
    <h2>Why Handheld Location-Based Technologies at Parks Canada? </h2>
    <p>Handheld location-based technologies seem, on the surface,
      to be a good fit for Parks Canada parks and sites. By combining a portable
      technology with the rich stories that we have to tell at our parks and sites,
      these devices appear to have the potential to attract new audiences while
      enhancing our visitors’ learning and experience. As they rely on satellite
      signals for location sensing, they seem well-suited for our outdoor sites, many
      of which are in remote areas. They don’t require the installation of any
      outdoor infrastructure, saving costs and preserving the integrity of our sites. </p>
    <p>Two research projects provided additional impetus for this
      project. The successful European WebPark project, which took place from
      2001-2005, proved that this technology functions well in remote areas, and
      demonstrated that visitors who used it increased both their time spent and
      awareness of landscape features on the trails where it was used (Dias, 2007).
      In 2007, a Parks Canada-led research project in Banff National Park determined
      that a wide range of visitors was interested in using this technology in
      national parks and national historic sites. Those who tested a prototype
      handheld tour of the Hoodoos Trail felt that it increased their learning about
      the trail and made their experience more enjoyable, and the majority was
      interested in trying similar devices at other Parks Canada locations (Parks
      Canada/ART Mobile Lab, 2007).</p>
    <p>The New Media Unit felt that the best way to learn about the
      technology was to develop and evaluate our own projects. In summer 2007, the New
      Media Unit embarked on the Explora pilot project. This pilot consisted of the
      development and evaluation of handheld tours at two sites to answer two main
      questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Can location-based technologies – using a combination of global
        positioning system technology, handheld computers and multimedia content –
        enhance visitor learning and experience at Parks Canada sites?</li>
      <li>Can projects using this technology be developed in a way that is
        sustainable for Parks Canada sites?</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="caption"><img src="tarasoff.fig1.jpg" alt="figure 1" width="500" height="667"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 1: The Explora pilot project begins</p>
    <h2>Early Decisions Taken</h2>
    <p>If this technology were to be adopted, it would have to be
      sustainable at Parks Canada parks and historic sites. This led to a number of
      initial decisions. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The pilot would use off-the-shelf GPS-enabled PDAs rather than
        proprietary hardware offered by a limited number of suppliers. If this
        technology were to be sustainable, it would have to run on as wide a variety of
        devices as possible, and would have to take advantage of the latest technology
        rather than being locked into a limited number of devices. </li>
      <li>Non-technical site staff, such as interpreters, would be
        responsible for creating and modifying content. Therefore, a user-friendly
        content management system and support for training and use of the CMS was
        required. Our approach would be a compromise between using free or more complex
        applications that could only be used by technical staff, and handing the entire
        production of the projects over to an outside firm. </li>
      <li>Multimedia content would be used, including images, text, audio
        and video.</li>
      <li>Parks Canada staff would be mentored by someone experienced with
        this technology</li>
      <li>We would document all phases and time required and gather
        feedback throughout the development process</li>
      <li>We would develop two pilot projects - one at a national park, and
        one at a national historic site - to determine the challenges and limitations
        for each type of site. This approach would build on the knowledge acquired
        during other similar projects, most of which had been undertaken at natural
        parks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As this paper will demonstrate, all of these decisions were
      good ones and helped us achieve our objectives.</p>
    <h2>The Development Process</h2>
    <p>The pilot project kicked off in November 2007. Explora was
      completed and made available to the public in July 2008. This rapid progress
      was achieved thanks to the selection of appropriate sites, the involvement of
      highly motivated and skilled teams, including an expert mentor, and a tightly
      managed project development process.</p>
    <h3>1. Site selection</h3>
    <p>Of the many national parks and national historic sites that
      were interested in the pilot project, two sites were selected: Kejimkujik
      National Park and National Historic Site in Nova Scotia, and Signal Hill
      National Historic Site in Newfoundland and Labrador. These sites had the most
      important ingredients: physical, including short trails with a variety of
      points of interest, a practical location for handing out and managing the
      devices, and little or no signage on the trails; and human, including staff with
      the necessary skills, time available, and, above all, enthusiasm. They also had
      plenty of photographs, illustrations and other content assets readily
      available.</p>
    <h3>2. Pilot teams</h3>
    <p>Three teams were created: a core team at each site, as well
      as an extended team that oversaw and supported the core teams. Core team
      members included a project manager, content lead and content team, a GIS
      specialist, and IT support. Extended team members, all located at the National
      Office, included a pilot project manager from the New Media Team, a Chief
      Information Office representative, a Visitor Experience representative, and a
      Communications Lead. A final, essential, player joined the project as the
      technology supplier and product development mentor: Camineo, located in France,
      won the contract to provide this role. </p>
    <h3>3. Project phases</h3>
    <p>The project was divided into several key phases, each
      culminating in a milestone. All team members were kept abreast of the schedule
      and expectations for each phase, and the project managers and Camineo worked
      together to ensure deadlines were met. Key stages included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Project Initiation (Nov-Dec. 2007): Teams were created and met
        on-site in early December to be introduced to the project, the technology and
        the development process, and to walk the trails that were being considered. A
        broad group of site staff was brought into these meetings to ensure that there
        was acceptance and familiarity with the project. The meetings were followed up by
        the writing of the Project Initiation Document which articulated the project’s
        goal, objectives, target audience, description, preliminary budget and schedule,
        and project team roles and responsibilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="tarasoff.fig2.jpg" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="375"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 2: Team members and site staff walked potential trails
      in December</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Project Brief (Dec. 2007-Jan. 2008): In
        December and January, team members finalized key messages, created
        cognitive, affective and behavioural objectives for their tours, finalized
        trails, and fleshed out the content for each route by elaborating on key points
        and identifying media. The Parks Canada GIS specialists worked with the team to
        identify geographic data requirements. The team’s ideas were gathered together
        in the Project Brief document for each site.</li>
      <li>Preliminary Interpretive Plan and
        Initial Tour Integration (January-March 2008): Teams finalized points of
        interest, marked final waypoints, wrote text, and identified and acquired or
        created media such as photos and illustrations. During this period, Camineo met
        with the teams for the first time, introduced their software and development
        process, and integrated the first tour’s content into the Camineo Maker content
        management system. GIS specialists created and tested maps, and developed a
        procedure to produce small, accurate maps that are visible on the small screen
        of the device.</li>
      <li>Initial Tour Testing (March-April): In April, teams tested the first tour and immediately noted the changes that
        had to be made. Everyone found this initial testing an eye-opening and useful
        experience. As a group, we decided upon the revisions and refinements we needed
        to make. In addition, team members learned how to use the Camineo Maker software.
        They received a one-day training session with Camineo, and then made regular
        use of ongoing support through a variety of means, including an on-line forum
        with Camineo. </li>
      <li>Final Tour Creation and Testing
        (April-July): For the last three months, teams completed the production
        and refinement of the content. They located and formatted missing images,
        sounds and video, edited and translated text, and frequently tested the tours
        on the trails. As well, they integrated all new content themselves. In early
        July, several team members at each site spent one intense week on the final
        testing of all of the content on the devices. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption"><img src="tarasoff.fig3.jpg" alt="figure 3" width="500" height="375"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 3: July - one-week final testing and validation period
      at each site</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Final delivery to visitors and pilot period (July-September): The
        devices were fully tested and ready for use in time for the launch date. For
        the next 2 months, visitors were invited to use the devices, which were
        available for loan at the Visitor Centre. An evaluator was present at each site
        to administer surveys and do observations. In addition, a logbook was kept at
        each site for visitor comments. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The Explora project resulted in the development, in less
      than 8 months by staff that had no prior experience with this technology, of
      fully-operational, GPS-triggered tours that functioned on three hiking trails.
      The devices were used by over 1000 people of all ages, from the local area and
      beyond, both first-time and repeat visitors. Media interest was considerable,
      with several newspaper articles, radio and television reports about the
      project. Staff members were proud of their achievement and pleased to be able
      to offer this new product. </p>
    <h3>Description of the device and the user experience</h3>
    <p>The Explora device is a handheld PDA that features
      location-specific content, such as bilingual text, photos, illustrations, audio
      and video, that is both ‘pushed’ (automatically triggered by GPS) and ‘pulled’
      (selected) by users. Content was created, sourced and formated by the project
      teams using the user-friendly Camineo Maker content management system. The
      content plays on the device using a program called Camineo Player. </p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="tarasoff.fig4.jpg" alt="figure 4" width="260" height="306"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 4: The Explora device showing a sample of the
      Kejimkujik interface</p>
    <p>Users wore the device on a lanyard around their necks. They
      interacted with the content through the device’s touch screen. After selecting
      their choice of English or French (Figure 5), users watched a tutorial,
      selected a trail, and started their hike along the trail. For the remainder of
      the hike they viewed the device each time they heard the sound trigger, and at
      any time could make selections from the touch screen. </p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="tarasoff.fig5.jpg" alt="figure 5" width="294" height="504"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 5: Users selected their language from the initial
      language selection screen</p>
    <p>Content included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Pushed ‘POIs’ - </b>Each
        trail featured 20-30 automatic ‘pushed’ Points of Interest. These typically
        included text and an image related to the specific location, and often included
        links to a related audio, video or other text.</li>
      <li><b>Navigation Points - </b>These
        pushed points (Figure 6) gave the users simple directions to help them navigate
        their way through the tour.</li>
      <li><b>Quizzes</b><b> - </b>There were several fun quiz
        questions (Figure 7) related to something that could be seen on each trail,
        with a point awarded for each correct answer. At the end of the route, visitors
        could find out their score. These were very popular and were accessed by most
        users.</li>
      <li><b>Maps - </b>Users could always see their location on a
        map. In addition, they could move the map with their finger, and zoom in and
        out of the map. We included three scales: very far out, middle, and very close
        up to show the trail. We also included an aerial photo for each site.</li>
      <li><b>Discover section</b><b> - </b>The Discover section
        (Figure 8) is like a field or reference guide, where users can choose to look
        at content organized by theme. Many of these content items are pushed points,
        and some are More, Audio or Video pages that can be selected from a pushed
        point. Categories included Flora, Fauna, People, The River (for Kejimkujik) and
        The Hill (for Signal Hill). </li>

    <p class="caption">Fig 8: The <b>Discover</b> section functioned like a reference section</p>
    <h3>The device and how it performed</h3>
    <p>The Mio P360 was selected as the platform for this pilot as
      it met our requirements for commercial availability, Windows Mobile Operating
      System, affordability, robustness, a touch screen, sensitive GPS chip,
      multimedia capability, and a long-lasting rechargeable battery. We had 10
      devices available for loan to visitors at each site. They proved durable and
      satisfactory for the pilot. One device had to be exchanged when it stopped
      functioning, while the others were operable throughout the pilot and suffered
      no more than a few small scratches and tiny dents to the casing. </p>
    <h2><span lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">Site and Project Descriptions</span></h2>
    <h3>1. Signal Hill National Historic Site (“Signal Hill”)</h3>
    <p>Signal Hill, located in St John’s, Newfoundland and
      Labrador, is nationally significant for its military and communications
      history. Well-visited by locals and tourists alike, it features historic
      buildings, archeological sites, dramatic hills, spectacular vistas and rocky
      cliffs bordered by the Atlantic Ocean. Two trails were selected for Explora
      tours: the Burma Road to Ladies’ Lookout Trail (2.8 km long) and The North Head
      Trail (3.6 km long). These trails both began and ended at the Visitor Centre,
      and took visitors past many historic structures and sites, up various
      staircases to the summit, and along cliffs that border the ocean. There were
      approximately 30 pushed points of interest on each trail, including an historic
      stone military barracks, a site where military families lived and gardened in
      the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the Cabot Tower, and a place where a military
      hospital once stood. Content included a panorama view of the barracks across
      the narrows, a video explaining how to read markings on British cannon, a photo
      of a cup that was found during an archeological dig, and an historic painting
      of the gates that once stood at the summit of Signal Hill.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="tarasoff.fig9.jpg" alt="figure 9" width="291" height="503"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 9: A sample pushed point of interest from Signal Hill</p>
    <h3>2. Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site (“Kejimkujik”)</h3>
    <p>Kejimkujik is located in mainland Nova Scotia. This inland
      park features lakes and forests and is visited repeatedly by many local
      visitors as well as those from further away. The Beech Grove Trail was selected
      for the Explora tour. It is a 2 km circular trail that starts at the Visitor
      Centre, crosses the Mersey River, winds in a circuit along the river, up a drumlin,
      past endangered plants, back along the river and across the bridge. The theme
      of the route was <b>change,</b> and it
      featured 21 points of interest, including a drumlin, a tree with a hole formed
      by woodpeckers, and the place where an endangered orchid grows. Content
      includes a quiz about dragonflies, a video of brook trout jumping in the river,
      and an audio and slide show describing the lifestyle of the native inhabitants
      of the area before the park was established.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="tarasoff.fig10.jpg" alt="figure 10" width="291"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 10: The Discover menu from Kejimkujik</p>
    <h2>Assessment of Sustainability</h2>
    <p>The pilot provided us with some positive and constructive
      answers to the question, “Can projects using this technology be developed
      in a way that is sustainable for our sites?” Staff successfully developed the
      content and learned to use the Camineo Maker software to integrate and update
      content. A forum and access to the software company enabled staff to pose and
      answer questions that allowed them to overcome challenges and continue their
      work. Site staff also successfully managed the devices throughout the pilot
      period. Several feedback sessions held with staff involved in the pilot
      indicated that staff were satisfied with their involvement and would welcome
      future projects. It was clear that staff skills were transferrable to this
      technology, and that developing content for this device is similar in
      many ways to developing content for other interpretive programs and products. </p>
    <p>The time and costs required to develop the project were
      documented and appear reasonable. However, for this type of project to be truly
      sustainable, sites must consider the technology as a long-term investment with
      time and money allocated annually to maintain and update the equipment and
      content. A six-year life cycle maintenance plan has been drafted and will be
      provided to all Parks Canada sites interested in this technology. </p>
    <h2>User Evaluation </h2>
    <p>Social scientists at Parks Canada oversaw a research
      project to help us answer our main visitor-related questions. We wanted to know
      how visitors used the device, if the experience impacted visitor learning and
      experience positively, and how we could design the experience to maximize
      visitor experience and learning. We also wanted to know if and how much
      visitors would be willing to pay for such a device.</p>
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>We settled on a combination of qualitative and quantitative
      instruments in order to answer our questions. At both pilot sites, tally sheets
      recording basic user information for all users were filled out by visitor
      services staff. In addition, researchers administered a survey to a total of
      272 visitors and performed observations of 65 visitors. Finally, all user
      actions and positions were logged by the devices in the data logs on each device.</p>
    <h3>What did we learn about visitor behavior?</h3>
    <p>The data logs (which recorded the location of all user
      actions as well as the location, date and time every 15 seconds for each user),
      together with the observation diaries, give us a good picture of how visitors
      actually used the devices. The main finding is that use was fairly consistent
      for all users, and followed the pattern we expected and hoped for. Typical use
      of the device included stopping at all ‘pushed’ points of interest (Figure 11),
      reading the text out loud to group members, looking for or pointing at the
      trail features mentioned in the text, and if there was a quiz, answering the
      quiz question. If an audio or video was offered as an option on the first page
      of a pushed point of interest, most visitors would select it. However, if
      content was only provided in the Discover menu, very few visitors selected it,
      and in some cases nobody selected it.</p>
    <p class="caption"><img src="tarasoff.fig11.jpg" alt="figure 11" width="500" height="354"/></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig 11: Kejimkujik data log map </p>
    <p>This map from data logs at Kejimkujik’s Beech Grove Trail
      shows that users stopped at the pushed points of interest. The tiny dots show
      16,621 user log points where the speed is 0 m/s (no speed), and the black
      squares represent the pushed points of interest.</p>
    <h3>What did we learn about visitor learning and satisfaction?</h3>
    <p>The surveys included a range of questions about
      satisfaction and learning. Overall, visitors reported that they learned
      something from their experience and noticed something that they would not have
      noticed without the device. Most could voice a specific theme or subject that
      they learned about, and many identified a specific trail feature that they were
      unaware of before. Most also reported that they found the experience enjoyable.
      Surprisingly for some, there was no significant difference in satisfaction
      between age groups or between males and females. Older users were, in general,
      as satisfied as younger visitors.</p>
    <h3>What did we learn about willingness to pay? </h3>
    <p>Over 75% of visitors were willing to pay. Of all those
      surveyed, 60% were willing to pay between $4 and $6 per half day.</p>
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>We are satisfied with the pilot project, and feel that our
      main questions have now been sufficiently answered. Based on the results, we
      have decided to move from the pilot phase into a phase of facilitating the
      adoption of this technology across the Parks Canada system. Sites are being
      provided with information about the pilot and the technology, including the
      project review report and results of the data analysis. Other actions we are
      taking include the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The technology will be used at the existing sites in summer 2009,
        and one or two new trails will be added at each site, incorporating lessons
        learned from the pilot.</li>
      <li>Toolkit and training development is
        underway to support new sites, and information is being prepared to help sites
        determine whether this technology is in fact a good choice for them. Explora
        team members are writing step-by-step development instructions, fact sheets and other guidelines for new sites. A workshop
        outline is also being developed. We are hoping to develop a community of
        practice so that experienced sites can coach new sites. </li>
      <li>We are investigating ways to secure a technology provider for all
        of Parks Canada by September 2009. We believe that the most efficient solution
        is to have a single technology provider that is available to all sites wishing
        to adopt this technology. Among other benefits, this will facilitate support
        for sites across the system, and will ensure sites can learn from and help each
        other.</li>
      <li>We are looking forward to testing out advances in the technology
        as they are available, such as being able to provide content that is
        downloadable to users’ own devices.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Overall Lessons Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Ensure you get to know your
        various visitor groups and their interests, and cater to them.</b> It is people
        in every age category, not just young people, who will use and enjoy this
        technology.</li>
      <li><b>Put
        your most important information right on the first page of each pushed location</b>. The most visited content was the main pushed content. Everybody
        will read it. The next most visited content was quizzes, audio and video, so
        include fun elements and audiovisual elements. Putting a lot of information
        only in second or third layers of content, such as the Discover field guide, is
        not worth the effort for the general audience – they won’t go there.</li>
      <li><b>Provide
        clear maps. </b>They are accessed frequently
        and need to be accurate and  clearly visible on the small screen of a device.
        GIS expertise and data are needed to create these maps.</li>
      <li><b>Invest
        less in content at the end of a route by spreading points of interest out more sparsely
        and by keeping text short</b>. Some content
        seems to be accessed less at the end of the trail.</li>
      <li><b>To
        develop a project, appropriate sites and enthusiastic teams are essential.</b> You need enthusiastic and multi-skilled team members who aren’t afraid to try
        new things. You also need trails and facilities that meet requirements, such as
        receiving a strong GPS signal, having a visitor centre for device handout, and having
        trails without signage but with many visible points of interest.</li>
      <li><b>To
        ensure sustainability, site staff members need a user-friendly content management
        system and support in its use. </b>Expert technical support for the
        content management and player software and overall project development is
        essential for a first project. This requirement could diminish as sites become
        more experienced using the software and as in-house support (such as a training
        program and a team of in-house experts) is developed. </li>
      <li><b>To
        gain buy-in and build excitement within a site’s staff, provide hands-on opportunities
        with the technology to a wide range of staff.</b> We invited a wide range of site staff, including managers,
        office staff, operations staff and interpreters, to try out the technology
        early on and kept them aware of its development process by holding a number of
        information sessions. We also involved as many as possible in early walks on
        potential trails.</li>
      <li><b>Use
        the  milestone approach to ensure all team members know what is required at
        each stage</b>. Milestone documents
        ensured that all thinking had been done for each phase, and were useful
        reference documents for the team and communications documents for external use.
        In addition, all team members were aware of key milestones and ensured we
        stayed on schedule.</li>
      <li><b>Test
        the devices on the trail early and frequently</b>. The more testing, the better. Read the text out loud and make
        sure it makes sense on location. Listen to the audio; watch the videos. Note
        your changes on the spot, make the changes, and try again. We found this
        iterative process showed us early in the process what worked and what didn’t,
        and ensured our content functioned properly and made sense on launch day.</li>
      <li><b>Depending
        on staff availability and the scale of the project, projects can be created in
        as little as 4 months, or up to just over 1 year</b>. For a new pilot or a major new trail in a new
        area, a suggested timeline is: project initiation in spring; kickoff meeting in
        May; content development in summer; other milestones through fall, winter and
        spring; launch the following summer. For a small trail at a site with an
        existing project, you could initiate in October, do content development through
        fall and winter, and launch in July.</li>
      <li><b>Develop
        a small trail first to develop confidence and skills; then expand to a larger
        trail</b>. This phased-in approach
        allowed our team members to assess their first efforts and collectively see the
        refinements that were required.</li>
      <li><b>Consider costs and
        staff time required over at least 6 years before committing to this technology</b>. Sites need to ensure sufficient staff and
        resources to develop a new project, as well as to maintain and update content
        and devices over at least 6 years. It requires between 120 and 175 staff days
        to develop a first project, and requires one interpreter/content person for 4
        months, a project manager throughout the process, and time from specialists
        such as content experts and GIS Specialists. Funds must be available annually
        for the software license, for replacing equipment, for development and delivery,
        and for content acquisition and development.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The Explora pilot project demonstrated that location-based
      technology can be a valuable addition to the interpretive offerings at Parks
      Canada parks and historic sites. It has broad appeal to existing visitors, and
      could be marketed in an effort to attract new visitors. Staff were able to use
      their skills and knowledge about their site to develop and modify the content,
      and a wide cross-section of visitors enjoyed and learned from the devices. By
      developing and evaluating our own projects, we have learned many lessons that
      will be useful for future projects. We hope that our experience will benefit others.</p>
