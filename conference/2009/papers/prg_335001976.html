<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There is little doubt that technologies such as the Web
    are re-shaping the way that museums reach audiences and deliver content.
    Teachers are one of the key audiences for museum Web resources, as they search
    for digital content to integrate into their lessons and introduce students to
    the valuable sources that museums hold within their collections. It is clear
    that teachers highly value access to objects, documents and artwork to enrich
    their lessons, and that this often proves more useful than complex Flash
    interactives. Despite the importance of this audience, they are often the most
    challenging sector to understand in terms of usage of digital materials. There
    are important design implications for e-learning that can be taken from
    understanding classroom use, ranging from making resources readily adaptable to
  providing appropriate levels of information about the collections. </p>
<p>Although Web site statistics of schools resources
    frequently indicate high numbers of users and visit sessions, they do not
    reveal how these resources are being used in the classroom. Delving deeper into
    an understanding of how teachers adapt and integrate on-line museum resources
    into their pedagogical practice can help museums design resources that will
    better meet the needs of classroom teachers. The Great Fire of London Web site
    was designed specifically to showcase museum and archival collections,
    accompanying a unit of study in primary school as students explore how we know
    about the past. Understanding how the resource would be used in the classroom
    was a central consideration during the design process, particularly as the
  collections assets were integrated into the interactive elements.</p>
<p>This paper draws on multiple sources, including surveys,
    classroom observations and teacher focus groups, to begin building a picture of
  classroom practice.</p>
<h2>Why Understanding Teacher Pedagogy is Important</h2>
<p>Schools are an important and long-served audience of
    museums, and the Web is increasingly being used to extend the role of museums
    into classrooms. Research into classroom technology usage continues to suggest
    that the role of teachers is paramount in the effective implementation of
    Web-based resources. As Owston notes, “the key to promoting improved learning
    with the Web appears to lie in how effectively the medium is exploited in the
    teaching and learning situation” (29). The value of on-line learning
    experiences for students is largely determined by the way the learning
    technology is “orchestrated’” by the teacher, which in turn is determined by
    the conception of learning the teacher holds, rather than any implicit features
    of the technology (Jackson and Anagnostopoulou, 2001). When examining student
    achievement in technologically rich classrooms, Clark (1994) concluded that the
    difference in student achievement is related to the teacher and how he or she
  applies these resources to the students’ learning needs.</p>
<p>In a study examining the implementation of a digital
    cultural heritage program dealing with the formation of European nation-states,
    Di Blas and Poggi (2006) found that technologies can be successfully integrated
    into history classrooms, but they must follow certain criteria. Two of these
    important criteria are that the programs be used in blended educational
    experiences, in which traditional aspects of the pedagogical process occur
    alongside the technology activities, and that the program helps, but does not
    substitute for, the teacher in the pedagogical activity. Again, the role of the
    classroom teacher cannot be dismissed, and it appears that overall
    effectiveness is integrally linked with the teacher and not the independent
  design or quality of the Web resources.</p>
<p>The role of the classroom teacher in the successful
    implementation of Web-based learning tools is undeniable. Yet there is a
    responsibility on the part of those who provide teachers with content for the
    classrooms to understand the wide-ranging issues they face and to find ways to
    support their efforts. Understanding current use, as well as still-untapped
    potential, is important for on-line resource providers if the needs of
  teachers, and ultimately their students, are to be met. </p>
<p>While museums have
    ably served schools through on-site programs, it is less clear if they
    are truly meeting the needs of teachers and students through their on-line
    ventures. Hawkey (2004) believes that the inconsistent quality of digital
    learning resources to date, and their reliance on delivery and deficit models,
    raises concerns. This is not to say that museums have not made strides towards
    creating on-line education offerings that can be effectively integrated into
    classrooms. It is difficult, however, to gauge what may be most effective, as
    there continues to be a scarcity of research into the classroom based use of
  museum Web sites. </p>
<h2>Determining How Teachers Use On-line Resources</h2>
<p>When museums report on Web site usage they typically rely on
    Web site traffic data. Despite the amount of data that can be gleaned from
    these traffic logs, it is difficult to discern what users are doing with the
    resources. Traditional Web site data goes no further than measuring access, and
    when museums consider how resources are used in classrooms, this tracking of
    access has limited value. The value that it does hold is in documenting what
    types of materials are proving popular with teachers. It does not, however,
    indicate how these resources are being used or how well they meet the needs of
  teachers.</p>
<p>There are a number of tools that can be used to paint a picture
    of classroom practice. The table below indicates the strength and weakness of
  various approaches to understanding teacher use of museum Web sites. </p>

<p class="caption">Table 1: Potential
  Tools for Understanding Teacher Pedagogy</p>
<p>No single approach
    outlined above is adequate for examining classroom use of on-line resources. Each
    tool has its own merits, and a combination of these approaches is needed to
  more fully understand teacher pedagogy. </p>
<p>This paper draws on research and projects undertaken in the
    UK, but there are methodological approaches for understanding classroom use of
    Web sites and insights into classroom practice that may be more broadly
    applicable. The data collated for this paper comes from a broad cross-section
  of sources collected from 2006 - 2008, including</p>
<ol>
  <li>a museum and archive Web use survey of eighty-five secondary
    history teachers with subsequent interviews and classroom observations of five
    selected teachers conducted through the Institute of Education</li>
  <li>teacher focus groups for the Museum of London with primary and
    secondary teachers, Thinktank with Key Stages 1 -3 teachers, and Key Stage 1
    science teachers for 2feet2feet.org.uk</li>
  <li>concept testing for Key Stage 2 and A level National Archives
    resources</li>
  <li>classroom user-testing sessions for Museum of London Key Stage 1
    and 2 resources, and The National Archives Key Stage 2 and A level resources</li>
  <li>on-line surveys conducted by the Museum of London, The National
    Archives, and Thinktank. </li>
</ol>
<p>The results of the museum and archive Web site survey, undertaken
    through the Institute of Education (Leftwich, 2007), can be compared with the
    results of The National Archives (Payne, 2006) and Museum of London Web user
    surveys (Sarre, 2007), as similar questions were posed on all three surveys. The
    National Archives survey was conducted in the fall of 2006 and received a total
    of 1,647 responses from teachers across the UK and internationally. The Museum
    of London evaluation of the Learning On-line Web was completed in June, 2007,
    with a total of 342 completed surveys. The sample across these three surveys
    consisted primarily of existing users of on-line museum content, but in the
    case of the secondary history teacher survey, 22% were not currently using
    museum Web sites in their classrooms. The consultation focus groups consisted
    of teachers who were actively participating in on-site museum programs, but may
    not necessarily have been users of the museum Web site. Classroom user-testing
    sessions were conducted throughout the greater London area in a range of
    classrooms, selected based on teacher interest in the resources being
  developed. </p>
<p>A case study is also included in the paper, based on the
    development process of the Museum of London’s Great Fire of London Web site (<a href="../http://www.fireoflondon.org.uk/">http://www.fireoflondon.org.uk</a>).
    This Web site was launched in February 2008, after extensive consultation with
    primary school teachers and user testing in their classrooms. The experience of
    working with teachers, as well as the results of the focus groups and
    observations, will be shared as an example of how understanding classroom
  practice can inform the Web site design process. </p>
<h2>How Are Resources Being Used by Teachers?</h2>
<p>A number of factors
    must be taken into account to answer this question, including teacher
    motivation for accessing the resources, the instructional setting, and the type
    of resource that the teacher chooses to integrate into the lesson. The ways on-line
  resources are used in schools can be broadly divided as follows.</p>
<p><b>Teacher
  use away from classroom </b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Museum/ gallery visit planning </li>
  <li>Lesson preparation – finding images, ideas, material for use with
    students</li>
  <li>Subject knowledge development</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Teacher
  use with whole class on large screen </b></p>
<ol start="4">
  <li>Varies based on resource type (see table below)</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Student
  use without teacher </b></p>
<ol start="5">
  <li>Semi-independently – structured tasks, on computer in corner of
    classroom or in IT suite </li>
  <li>Independently – in IT suite making their own choices about which
    Web sites to use; for example, project research.</li>
</ol>
<p>The museum and archive Web site survey posed a series of
    questions to gauge how teachers choose to use the materials provided by museums
    on-line. The first consideration was whether teachers are using these materials
    for work directly with their students or for their own lesson preparation: 67%
    of the eighty-five history teachers surveyed indicated that they use museum and
    archive Web sites with their students. Similar figures were found in The
    National Archives survey, with 57% stating that they use Learning Curve with
    students more than once a term.  A larger percentage, 80% of the teachers in
    the Institute of Education study and 85% in The National Archives survey, use
  museum Web sites in lesson preparation. </p>
<p>Understanding whether teachers are using resources for
    preparatory work or with students can have a direct impact on how and why these
    resources are designed. As teachers prepare lessons they are looking for
    reference materials and background information, rather than the higher levels
    of interaction and engagement that may be expected from a Web site designed
    with students as the primary audience. A further question about frequency of
    use finds that amongst the history teachers surveyed, they are not only more
    likely to use museum Web sites for planning, but that it is with greater
    frequency than using the sites with their students, with the majority of the
    80% preparatory users using them “1 to 3 times a  month” or “1 or 2 times a
    week.” This may account for such high use of basic ‘fact packs’ found on the
    Museum of London’s Learning On-line which provides narrative text and images
  detailing different eras in the city’s history (Sarre, 2007). </p>
<p>Consistent patterns emerge from across the variety of data
    indicating teacher preference for certain types of on-line resources. The
    following table summarizes the on-line museum resources that teachers are most
    likely to use, starting with the most popular.  (IWB means that they are likely
  to be used on an interactive whiteboard.) </p>

<p class="caption">Table 2: Types of on-line resources likely to be used by
  teachers in the classroom</p>
<p>It is clear that the most valuable on-line assets from
    museums are the collections themselves. This is, perhaps, not a huge surprise
    given that the objects have always been the ‘unique selling point’ of museums. This
    means that teachers are potentially more willing to use a high quality image of
    a Roman pot than an expensive interactive game that contains the same Roman
    pot. Teachers are frequently searching for a primary source that they can adapt
    to fit within a lesson scheme that they already have, rather than a complex
    self-contained Flash interactive. It is important to consider the search
    process when designing teacher resources, as the more straightforward the path
    is to find the sources they are looking, for the more likely they are to use
  the sources. </p>
<p>Interestingly, when history teachers were surveyed through
    the Institute of Education, those who were not current museum and archive Web
    site users when asked what types of resources they would most likely use, they
    overwhelmingly said games and interactives. The teachers who were existing
    users of on-line museum content clearly used collections sources far more
    frequently than games and interactives. The idea of games and interactive is
    perhaps a more appealing idea, but in practice it is collections based sources
  that prove more teacher friendly (Leftwich, 2007). </p>
<h2>Classroom Factors that Influence Use of On-line Resources and Implications
  for Design</h2>
<p>A key question explored by all of the data is the nature of
    the instructional setting and teacher facilitation when using museum Web sites.
    This is where teacher pedagogy is perhaps most important, as teachers decide
    how to integrate the Web site into their lessons and classroom framework. In
    the UK, as indicated above, there are two primary settings where teachers use
    museum Web sites: in a computer lab/suite, and in the classroom with an
    interactive whiteboard or other large screen. The survey of secondary history
    teachers indicated that between use of an interactive whiteboard and an LCD projector,
    almost 40% of the Web sites are being used in a whole class setting. The
    National Archives survey supports this, with 44% using the on-line materials in
    a whole class setting and 49% of the sessions being teacher-led rather than
  explored by students individually. </p>
<p>Teacher consultations and classroom observations both
    provide evidence of the balance between teacher- and student-led use of on-line
    resources. In Museum of London focus groups with Key Stage 1 (ages 5-7) and 2
    (ages 7-11) teachers, the need for teacher facilitation was emphasized. Although
    these focus groups were based on primary classroom practice, the need to have
    resources easy to explore both for a class and individually was equally important
    in the secondary classroom. In all five secondary classroom observations
    (Leftwich, 2007), teachers used the interactive whiteboard for an introductory
  lesson prior to pair or individual work. </p>
<p>Knowing that teachers like opportunities for facilitation
    and are increasing their use of the interactive whiteboard can have substantial
    impact on the design of on-line resources. Creating resources with the IWB in
    mind can lead to a host of different considerations. The following table (Bazley,20)
    illustrates some of the issues that come into play when the lessons of
    classroom observations and conversations with teachers are taken into account in
    the design of materials for use on interactive whiteboards.  As hinted at the
    end of the tips, there is a risk of developing materials as if information will
    simply flow straight out of the whiteboard into students’ minds. Effective
    design requires a concerted effort to produce meaningful interaction for
  students.</p>

<p class="caption">Table 3: Interactive whiteboard resource design tips</p>
<p>Designing with a whole
    class in mind is quite a different exercise from designing for an individual
    student to work with the resource. It is important to consider how to maximize
    the flexibility of on-line resources to meet the needs of the changing
  classroom. </p>
<h2>Understanding Teachers: A Case Study in Design</h2>
<p class="caption"><img src="leftwich_Fig2.jpg" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="369"/></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 2: Sunday: part of the narrative in Museum of London’s
  Great Fire of London Web site <a href="../http://www.fireoflondon.org.uk/">http://www.fireoflondon.org.uk/</a> </p>
<p>When the Museum of London embarked on a partnership Web site
    aimed at Key Stage 1 (ages 5-7) audiences, the first step was teacher
    consultation. From the outset of the project, collaboration with teachers was
    seen as a priority for the success of the Web site. The museums and archives
    that formed the partnership brought experience in conducting successful on-site
    programs about the topic The Great Fire of London, but had little experience
    developing on-line resources for such a young audience. The intended audience
    for the Web site was the Key Stage 1 classroom, rather than a general
    children’s audience, requiring a clear understanding of how the resource would
  potentially be used in the classroom by teachers and students.</p>
<p>Teachers were involved at several different points in the
    design process, beginning with a front-end focus group with teachers who were
    already bringing their classes to programs at the Museum of London. The aim of
    this focus group was to determine what type of on-line resource might be most
    useful in fulfilling the curriculum unit based on the Great Fire. From these
    early stages it was clear that teachers were interested in having direct access
    to museum collections and the development of a game element to engage their
    young students. Teachers ideally wanted a Web site that had interesting
    objects, provided an historical narrative, and provided opportunities for
  students to interact with the objects and story. </p>
<p>The second phase of teacher consultation was carried out
    once the first storyboard for the site was developed. Before the specifics of The
    Great Fire of London Web site were discussed, a portion of the focus group
    questions concentrated on how the teachers use Web sites in their classrooms in
    general. It became clear that they tended to use the interactive whiteboard as
    a whole class rather than dedicated computer suite time. The teachers also
    commented that it was important for the Web site to be flexible enough both for
    the whole class to participate and for students to work individually with the material.
    Creating resources that can fulfill this type of instructionally flexibility
  can be challenging. </p>
<p>Teachers in each stage of consultation stated that they
    preferred to use Web sites that were geared to the children as the audience
    rather than the teacher. Whilst the teachers were eager to use Web sites
    designed for children, they specified that they would like teacher resources to
    help them facilitate usage as a class. Instructionally, teachers felt it
    important that they introduce themes and demonstrate how to use the Web site as
    a class, rather than allow students immediate free access to the site. This
    discussion led the project team to believe that teachers would most likely use
    a site that was aimed at students, but that was flexible enough to be used as a
  whole class activity. </p>
<p>The desire for a basic level of teacher facilitation was
    important when considering integrating natural breaks in the narrative for
    teachers to step in as needed. Initially the narrative had far fewer breaks, as
    it was envisioned that students would explore the story elements on their own,
    but classroom user testing proved that teachers wanted to have space for their
    own comments and instructions when using the Web site with the class. It was
    important for teachers to have a way to control the narrative during teaching. Ideally,
    a pause function could have been introduced, but it was felt that this would
    only complicate the Web site when individual students were using it. This
    became a classic case of having to decide which audience took precedence, and
    considering whether the potential instructional gain outweighed individual use
    of the Web site.  The compromise was made to keep the navigation very simple
    for student use, but to break the content into very small chunks to allow for
  teacher interjections. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most useful tool used to inform the design
    process was classroom-based user testing sessions. These were conducted with
    the first working version of the Web site in three classrooms with teachers
    that agreed to design a “typical” lesson using the Web site. It is important to
    note that teachers were not given a lesson plan and that museum staff had no
    instructional role, as it was hoped to observe the use of the Web site in the
    most authentic environment possible. Challenges, such as difficulty using the
    drag and drop elements and small image size on the whiteboard, were clear to
    see. Observing how teachers managed their students when using the Web site also
  provided the basis for some of the teaching activity suggestions.</p>
<p>Each piece of work with teachers informed the design of the
    Great Fire of London Web site. There were, of course, teacher ideas and
    additions based on observation that were not implemented due to time and budget
    constraints. Examples of how teacher practice did influence the design of the
  Web site are explored in Table 4.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Teachers are an important, if often elusive, audience of
    museum Web sites. It is important to use a combination of approaches to gather
    data about teacher use of on-line resources produced by museums. Classroom
    observations with teacher debriefing provide the richest and most valuable
    insights into both general practice and specific resources. It would be unwise
    to act on conclusions drawn from quantitative data gathering tools such as
    on-line surveys and Web statistics alone unless they are informed by such
  classroom insights. </p>
<p>The research collated for this paper suggests that teachers
    value the collections that make museums and archives unique sources of
  information. </p>
<p>Teachers are more likely to use images and collections
  databases than complex interactives. </p>
<p>Use is also dictated by how flexible the resource is for
    adapting it into existing lessons and instructional formats, as teachers have
    acknowledged in focus groups that they are unlikely to use any content that is
  too prescribed. </p>
<p>The use of the interactive whiteboard is greatly influencing the
  type of resources that teachers are selecting for use, as they tend to teach in
  larger class groups than dedicating time to individual ICT suites. </p>
<p>These findings might seem disheartening for museum
    e-Learning professionals wishing to push back the boundaries and create new and
    more exciting on-line experiences for teachers. Certainly it is true to say
    that the large sums of money and effort so often expended in creating highly
    interactive games and other more esoteric content are not always justified,
    when viewed in purely pragmatic terms. On the other hand, it is important to
    keep challenging teachers to do more with the valuable digital assets that
    museums provide, and sometimes this does pay off. A summative evaluation of a
    game introduced to the Museum of London’s Learning On-line Web site concluded
    with a teacher admitting that using the game helped change her perception of
    her own teaching and encouraged her to take new approaches in her classroom (Moussouri
  and Fakatseli, 2008). </p>
<p>Museums should continue to create on-line resources that meet
    the basic needs of their teacher audiences, and develop strong relationships
    with them, whilst at the same time experimenting with new and meaningful ways
    for teachers to share the delights and possibilities of museum and archive
  collections with their students. </p>
