  <h3 class="PaperTitle">Introduction</h3>
  <p>Traditional image-licensing models in key cultural
    institutions are usually developed around the principles of conventional print
    publishing and seem outdated with current on-line technologies.  Over a decade
    ago Trant identified a rapid need to exchange information quickly and globally
    through online technologies (Trant, 1996) and that traditional licensing models
    were no longer sufficient.  Will traditional image-licensing models see museums
    into the future and if not, how will organisations change policy with the need
    for fast and efficient dissemination of content? </p>
  <p>Collecting institutions in New South Wales charge for the
    right to use an image for educational and commercial applications in a variety
    of ways.  There may be a reproduction fee applied to an image that is out of
    copyright, particularly for commercial applications while others may waive the
    reproduction fee but charge an equivalent in an access fee.  There is not a
    standard model across collecting institutions for the licensing of images
    possibly due to the many complications with copyright, creators, income
    requirements and access priorities.</p>
  <p>Photo libraries provide a great resource to enable
    learning and the museum sector is in a position to support the education sector
    by allowing images to be used in an educational manner without additional cost,
    yet our business models currently don’t support this to the level that is
    required by such communities.  The education sector is a great source of
    potential innovation and creation using high value, authoritative and trusted
    content that exists in museums yet the fees for access and reproduction are too
    high for the majority of educational use.  There are few traditional forms of
    licensing models that actively support open access whilst also allowing for
    income generation. </p>
  <p>A problem with traditional models is that open access to
    museum content is not typically an accepted form of policy.  Under resourced
    and poorly funded institutions also rely on some form of additional income that
    is generated towards the expensive activity of maintaining a collection and the
    staff to catalogue and document it.  Very few institutional models have been
    developed to allow content to be accessible for the education sector
    (Pantalony, 2007). </p>
  <p>Institutional photo libraries can be set up with a
    commercial structure to follow as a priority for licensing image content which
    seems to be in opposition to institutional mission statements of providing
    access, promoting the collection and educating the public that ultimately fund
    the organisation.  The commercial factor may not be the intended prime driver
    as Tanner revealed in a study about the cost and policy models of 100 art
    museums across the United States that resulted in the primary reason
    institutions deliver and manage image services is to serve the public through
    educational use of content (Tanner 2004).  This primary aim may sometimes be
    skewed through income often being deemed essential within funding shortages. A
    recommendation of the study was that institutions review their imaging and
    rights priorities to clearly represent the mission of the museum.</p>
  <h2>The Current Powerhouse Museum Image Licensing Business Model</h2>
  <p>The Powerhouse Museum has an extensive collection of
    images in its Photo Library that are licensed for use in publications,
    exhibitions, educational papers, online, in documentaries, for DVDs, for
    commercial applications and scholarly use.  It holds hundreds of thousands of
    reproduction quality images of the collection as well as stock library material
    that has been photographed for use in publications, events, exhibitions and
    behind the scenes of the Museum.  Powerhouse Museum images are licensed to a
    variety of clients including students, academics, cultural institutions and
    publishers and are reproduced in a variety of ways.  There is currently a ‘one
    size fits all’ approach to charging for the use of these images with the
    exception of a 20% discount offered for educational use.  There exists a small
    amount of content created by the Museum photographers available on the Web site
    that is licensed under Creative Commons.  The annual income generated from
    accessing and reproducing the images is relatively low compared with other
    income streams in the organisation.  This low income should remain a key factor
    in reviewing the public’s interest to have access to the content we collect and
    create.  The resource cost of making this content available will never equate
    to a profit status.  Providing better access through a new business model will
    enhance and promote the brand and collection whilst allowing the education
    sector a much-needed source for learning.  So how does this model change?</p>
  <h3>Change is required</h3>
  <p>Australian collecting institutions are at a critical point
    where traditional licensing models need to change in order to support and reap
    the benefits that open access to our content will provide with particular
    emphasis being on the education sector (Pappalardo, Fitzgerald and Austin,
    2008).  The Commons project is an example of change that has provided the
    Museum with the measures to highlight benefits that can occur when collections
    are accessible and available to use with no restrictions.  This project has the
    added benefit of cross-collection search that enables the public to have better
    access to a variety of content that leads to a more informed level of research
    and discovery.  The question is how do we take the findings from this level of
    access and let other communities gain a similar experience through the learning
    and sharing of other collections.</p>
  <h2>Why Do Open Access</h2>
  <p>The principle of open access, similar to the objective of
    the Commons on Flickr, has not been key practice in cultural collecting
    institutions in Australia and can be difficult to persuade certain divisions
    within institutions of the benefits (Kelly, Ellis &amp; Gardler, 2008).  Open
    Access has gained significant attention internationally in recent years yet
    there is still a greater need for cultural institutions to take this on board
    and make some policy changes to realise the benefits that come from allowing
    the public to have better access to content.  There is global benefit for the
    public to have access to all our collections to enable rich research and
    encourage innovation, something experienced in the Commons project. </p>
  <p>There are a number of Australian universities that have
    adopted open access policies but very few cultural institutions have joined the
    ranks.  Some of the university policies are still being developed but provide a
    good record of how these principles are being applied to the education sector
    (Pappalardo et al., 2007).  When a museum is a trusted source for its content
    and provides access freely for educational purposes there is generally a return
    in exposure and promotion of the collection that can improve the institutions
    position for partnerships and funding (Browne, 2008).  Partnerships can provide
    a critical component for potential funding initiatives that can help towards
    the high cost of digitisation whilst also assist to form on-going collaborative
    projects.  Hudson and Kenyon have identified that museums, libraries and
    galleries undertake the digitisation of their collections for a range of
    reasons including preservation, documentation and most importantly to provide
    ongoing access to this content for the future (Hudson and Kenyon, 2007).  But
    if this material is not accessible then what is the future for this content? </p>
  <h3>Currently we pay for access</h3>
  <p>The Australian education sector has to pay for the right
    to copy material under the Statutory License part VB of the Australian
    Copyright Act 1968.  In Australia copyright fees in the education sector are
    escalating and in 2006 the cost under part VB Statutory License in Australian
    Schools was $50,000,000.  It jumped up $10,000,000 from 2005 to 2006 (Browne,
    2008).  This is an example of the escalating fees paid by the education sector
    to use content for educational purposes.  Copyright Agency Limited (CAL) is a
    collecting institution that monitors and pays creators for the use of
    copyrighted material.  The education sector pays a fee to CAL for the right to
    copy and distribute material, based on student numbers or reports, for material
    that is produced by publicly funded universities, libraries and collecting
    institutions such as the Powerhouse Museum.  These licenses can be restrictive
    and complicated for teachers and tutors to understand and have not been
    reviewed for some time (Greenleaf, 2007).  Greenleaf raises the question:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote"> Are collecting societies providing reasonable means by
    which creators can choose to use open content licensing? If they are not, then
    as with the creation of greater certainty for public domain dedications and
    commons licences, the question needs to be asked whether the Copyright Act (or
    the code of conduct of the collecting society) should both create a right to do
    so (where one is needed) and to specify an appropriate formality by which it
    may be exercised (Greenleaf, 2007). </p>
  <p>With the increase for the demand of high value digital
    content the sector needs some alternative licensing models that are going to
    alleviate some of the escalating costs to accessing content.  However the need
    to comply with copyright is one of the most problematic areas for a museum to
    manage in a digitisation project that can ultimately influence the type of content
    that is selected.  “Copyright has had a significant impact on digitisation
    practices to date, including in the selection of material to digitise and the
    circumstances in which it is made publicly available” (Hudson &amp; Kenyon,
    2007).  This can mean that content free of copyright or with less complications
    ends up being a priority and may not reflect the overall collection of the
    institution.</p>
  <h3>The complications: creators, collections and copyright</h3>
  <p>There are complications to licensing images, particularly
    surrounding copyright and multi-layered rights, that make it difficult to
    provide access to content and this is a significant challenge for the adoption
    of new business models supporting open access initiatives.  Trant has stated
    “By their nature, imaging systems require a complex balancing of the interests
    of numerous rights holders in protecting their intellectual property and the
    desires of image users to use images in their study, teaching, and research”
    (Trant, 1996).  These strategies vary across institutions and collections
    making it difficult to adopt a standard model for all.</p>
  <p>In Australia the copyright act doesn’t have a general
    “fair use” defense like it does in US copyright law.  The act does allow for
    “fair dealing” for certain purposes if only a small portion of the work is used
    or if it falls under satire and parody (Australian Copyright Council, 2008).
    “Given that fair dealing is also limited, cultural institutions have relied on
    other strategies in their public digitisation activities” (Hudson &amp; Kenyon,
    2007).  Images can be used under part VB of the copyright act for educational
    purposes only if an institution is defined by the act as educational and is
    covered by a remuneration notice with CAL. </p>
  <h3>Recent changes to the Australian Copyright Act 1968</h3>
  <p>An amendment to the Copyright Act, section 200AB,
    specifically for collecting institutions such as libraries, galleries and
    museums (Australian Copyright Council, 2008), came into effect on 1st December
    2006.  The reported aim of this amendment is to allow flexible exceptions when
    using copyright material for specific purposes.  This new amendment may hold
    possibilities and provide flexible exceptions for collecting institutions to
    allow some form of “fair dealing” in consideration of licensing content under
    statutory dealings and for problematic orphan works.  However it has not been
    utilised by institutions to change policy or licensing business models, being
    that it is relatively new and not fully understood.  There is a strong need to
    “establish easy to implement generic non discriminatory protocols for access to
    and reutilising or reusing of content – a process of “licensing out”.  Make it
    easier to negotiate out or access copyright material (Fitzgerald, 2006)”.  
    Australian cultural institutions need to seek collective advice on the new
    provisions in the Copyright Act that may provide a solution to allowing better
    access to digital content. “Institutions could develop policies that clarify
    which material and which uses they believe are covered by the new flexible
    exception” (Hudson &amp; Kenyon, 2007).</p>
  <h2>One Size Fits All Does Not Work</h2>
  <p>The on-line environment has dramatically changed the need
    for more efficient and fast delivery of digital content.  Traditional requests
    for the right to reproduce an image can take a minimum of a few days to
    turnaround.  Firstly the content has to be located, may need to be scanned,
    copyright cleared, payment made and then a digital file can be released.  The
    slow ‘one size fits all’ approach to providing images is not being reviewed
    with the current demand for fast return on authoritative digital content.  The
    costs to administer content generally aren’t equivalent to revenue and not
    factored into income projections.  If institutions aren’t digitising for supply
    and demand then the question needs to be answered of whether we really know
    what the audience wants.  Do we know what our audience want if there is a gap
    between the services we supply and the markets need for efficient and fast
    content (Wall, 2003).  The gap between market and supply can become wider over
    time when there is no form of linking the two without tracking methodologies. 
    It is difficult for the sector to renew and adopt new business models when
    additional funding is an essential element for digitisation particularly when
    the general global economy is down.</p>
  <h3>Alternative models and licences</h3>
  <p>The Art Museum Image Consortium (AMICO) that existed
    between 1997 and 2004 supplied images of various resolutions to educational
    (primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions) under educational licenses.
    This model was established after the experimental Museum Educational Site
    Licensing Project (MESL) explored ways to address the lack of resources
    available for educational use, manage complicated rights and licensing and address
    the need for infrastructure that could collate and deliver materials.  This
    project, one of the first to address the need for digital content to be
    accessible via a group of works under a standard license, made a significant
    contribution towards the need for educational use of digital museum content,
    and brought to light the issues surrounding complex rights and delivery needs
    (Bearman and Trant 1998).   The MESL project, along with 40 representatives
    from North American art museums, contributed to the formation of the not-for
    profit and independent membership organisation AMICO.</p>
  <p>The primary aim of AMICO was to collate and distribute
    digital material for educational use; it was a not-for-profit and was not a
    commercial model.  It provided an opportunity for the contributors to discuss
    issues together and openly whilst also recommending metadata standards for
    multi-media files.  This model was an example of aggregated museum content
    being made accessible for the primary benefit of educational use.  This
    organisation managed to start with 22 museums across the United States and
    Canada and within the first two years drew 120 college and university
    subscriptions with around one million students having access to the collections
    (Trant, Richmond &amp; Bearman 2002).  The benefit of this scheme was to
    provide a central repository for museum collections and a new way of delivering
    content (Pantalony, 2007). AMICO however dissolved in 2005 even though it was
    self supporting and had no debt at the time of its demise.  To date the
    collections that this organisation helped to create are still being distributed
    albeit not under AMICO.</p>
  <p>Similar to AMICO’s aim is the digital library Artstor that
    houses over 100,000 images and is a resource set up for research and academic purposes
    for a variety of educational institutions.  Universities, schools, museums,
    libraries and colleges access this resource and images can be downloaded and
    used by individuals from each participating institution (Artstor, 2009).  This
    model is very interesting for the museum sector with particular reference to
    its goal of disseminating collection content and information, something that
    AMICO was initially set up for.  Museums get to provide their content whilst
    also utilizing the collections from other institutions.  Artstor is
    experimenting with new models such as the Images for Academic Publishing (IAP)
    licensing terms and conditions set up in conjunction with The Metropolitan
    Museum of Art.  This is a scheme that aims to reduce the costs of publishing
    images to the academic community by allowing free high-resolution images to be
    used for scholarly purposes whilst also linking each record to the
    participating institutions rights and permissions page of their Web site so the
    potential for commercial applications is available.   This scheme has
    influenced the Victoria and Albert Museum to utilise aspects of this approach
    to licensing images for their scholarly initiative.</p>
  <p>In 2006, the Victoria and Albert Museum, previously an
    AMICO member, announced that it would drop fees for reproduction and
    distribution of its images to the education sector for scholarly use (Lewis,
    2006).  Utilising core principals of AMICO’s scholarly license, the distinction
    between commercial and academic, community based publications was highlighted
    effectively.  Scholars can download high-resolution content to be used in an
    educational application under a range of fair conditions for free.  The
    decision was based on a need for the wider dissemination and attribution of the
    Museums collection with over 25,000 objects made available on the Web site for
    this purpose.  The previous income generated from the reproduction fees was
    reported to be approximately £250,000 a year but the costs to maintain this
    brought the figure down immensely (Pantalony, 2007).  The decision to allow
    better access was not based on a commercial business practice rather to gain in
    reputation, brand, positioning and promotion with the premise of effectively
    supporting the educational community.</p>
  <p>The high cost of purchasing images with the previous model
    was seen to be a barrier in the distribution of knowledge (Jones in Lewis,
    2006) particularly for the disadvantaged community that required more support. 
    Not only was this move in order to support this community but also provided the
    opportunity for the Museum to reap the promotional benefits of a good business
    decision.  Whilst offering free images for scholarly purposes the V&amp;A also
    promote their online print production service that caters to the commercial market
    providing an effective income stream (Victoria and Albert Museum, 2009).  The
    divide between commercial and educational use has been clearly defined.</p>
  <p>The Tate Gallery in London has also adopted a similar
    business model by providing images free for educational use whilst also
    maintaining the traditional method of licensing images for reproduction to the
    commercial market.  The gallery has been able to attract a major partnership in
    the telecommunications giant British Telecom due to its on-line presence through
    programming and initiatives such as its licensing model (Pantalony, 2007).  It
    has an international on-line presence in which the image bank has been a major
    contributor.  British Telecom has assisted with the financial help required to
    provide more image content to make available for education and public outreach.</p>
  <p>The implementation of Creative Commons licensing has been
    extremely important in the dissemination of content and to enhance knowledge,
    which has been a crucial development in the digital age and for open access. 
    An Australian version of Creative Commons licensing has existed since January
    2005.  This is a flexible tool for creators to provide conditions on their work
    to allow others to share, apply and modify work providing it is properly attributed.
    Creators can specifically chose a non-commercial license so that work may be
    used for educational purposes.  This model has been crucial in the acceleration
    of disseminating content leading to innovation (Fitzgerald, 2006) something
    that the Museum has experienced with the images in the Commons project. </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">The development of this form of licensing comes at a time
    when at a policy level the Commonwealth is also concerned to see that the
    results of publicly funded research are available in a more open and generally
    accessible way than they have been to date, particularly where research outputs
    are the subject of monopoly approaches to the assignment of copyright in
    publishing (Fitzgerald, 2006).</p>
  <h2>The Commons on Flickr</h2>
  <p>On April 8th 2008 the Museum loaded 200, high value images
    from the Tyrrell photographic collection onto the Commons project on Flickr. 
    These were images that we sold digital copies of since they were acquired by
    the Museum in the 1980s.  The collection consists of 7903 glass plate negatives
    from the studios of Charles Kerry and Henry King who had two of Sydney&#39;s
    principal photographic studios in the late 1800s and early 1900s.  The 200
    images released to the Commons had been on the Museums Web site for many years
    receiving steady visitation and inquiries to purchase for reproduction.  This
    collection was rarely exhibited and no major publication had been produced on
    the Sydney-centric content.  The Powerhouse Museum is not known for exhibiting
    two-dimensional works, there is no dedicated gallery space and photography and
    photographic works in the collection have rarely been promoted prior to this
    project.  Being the first museum to join the Commons project drew reservation
    from some parts of the organisation because there were no measures or
    statistics and no other project of this scale or access was previously
    implemented.  The effect this was to have on images sales was not quantifiable
    yet it was an ‘experiment’ that was eventually approved bearing in mind there
    may be a drop in income.  Nearly a year into this project there are over 1000
    images in the Commons, there are measures, statistics, collaborative projects,
    a steady interest in image inquiries and sales and knowledge the Museum holds
    photographic works but critically the realisation that a new business model for
    licensing images is essential. </p>
  <p>The aim of the Commons is to allow members of the public
    to add tags, comments, use, share, discuss and generally make publicly held
    photographic collections richer and accessible (Flickr, 2008).  It is a place
    where the Flickr community can share and learn about the historical content
    from the various institutions collections that may never have been accessed via
    their own Web sites.  An objective of the Commons is to make collections richer
    through the various comments and tags provided by the wider community on Flickr
    that in turn can be re-ingested back into the institutions Web sites.  This
    increases the awareness of the collection and can also lead to the knowledge of
    other collections that the institutions posses.  The institution gains an
    understanding of the type of content that is being used and can learn from this
    engagement whilst also benefiting from the additional information about the
    historical collections provided by this community (Springer et al., 2008).</p>
  <h3>Relinquish control</h3>
  <p>The Commons project has been one of the first examples of
    Powerhouse Museum content being freely accessible on-line.  The images from the
    Tyrrell photographic collection loaded to Flickr had been available on the
    Museums Web site for a number of years albeit not downloadable.  The
    traditional method of accessing this content was through the photo library
    after a fee was paid for the right to access the digital files and prints.  
    This provided a level of control for the Museum in relation to reproduction,
    something that had to be discarded through open access on Flickr.</p>
  <p>Giving up control of the knowledge about reproduction is
    not an easy undertaking for a collecting institution especially with the policy
    of ‘pay for access’ that enables this control.  The knowledge about how Museum
    content is utilised is an important asset to the organisation and a measure
    often hard to track in open access initiatives.  There also exists the
    complexity of allowing access to historical images that lack documentation and
    cataloguing that will always be problematic for collecting institutions as
    percentages of content catalogued is usually low.  Participants of the Commons
    undertake a level of cataloguing through the tagging, additional notes,
    comments and research that may never be completed in the traditional method of
    museum registration.  Using the ‘not-fully catalogued’ Tyrrell collection meant
    that we could gain an understanding of the type of user-generated cataloguing that
    would exist with this type of access.  This is a significant change in policy
    that can be used as a measure for future applications.  The extent to which we
    acknowledge the benefit of community contributions to enhance original,
    institutional content should have an affect on the type of business model
    implemented (Stacey, 2007).</p>
  <h3>Does increased visitation encourage sales</h3>
  <p>Allowing the Tyrrell collection to reach this wider
    community has meant a four-fold increase in visitation that has been beneficial
    to our new global audience but also to the Museum in terms of promotion.  The
    project has provided a springboard for discussions on the effects of releasing
    material so openly and how it impacts on the traditional business model of
    income produced from the reproductions (Bernstein in Graf, 2009).  This is an
    important decision for an institution to consider when allowing open access to
    content that provides a form of income.  Based on the statistics we have on
    Tyrrell image sales and inquiries so far, there has been no detrimental affect
    on income produced from the sale of Tyrrell images since joining the Commons on
    Flickr.  Our figures over the first year show that there has been a similar
    interest to previous years for requesting reproductions and prints.  This is a
    critical measure for the Museum in terms of applying an open access initiative
    for the future.  If sales can remain the same then the question of income
    generation needs to be addressed as either neutral or potentially beneficial. 
    Is the increase in visitation equal to an increase in promotion, which fuels a
    desire to purchase a file or print?  These early statistics highlight a
    much-needed form of documentation that may influence policy change perhaps
    cross-institution. </p>

  <p class="caption">Fig 1: Sales and Inquiries of Tyrrell reproductions from
    2005-2008.</p>
  <h3>What is the value of promotion</h3>
  <p>The access the public has had to the photographic
    collection, and the exposure, has never been greater than in the Commons.  In
    the first day there were over five thousand views and the first five weeks was
    equivalent to all of 2007 of the same images on the Museums Web site (Chan,
    2008).  The Flickr community is informed about this collection and that the
    Museum has other photographic collections in its possession, an important outcome
    for the institution not known for photographic collection content.  This is now
    projected as twenty times more views in the last twelve months.  How do we
    measure the value of the increased visitation and promotion of the collection
    and equate this back into the Museums reputation?</p>
  <p>The Commons project has provided collecting institutions
    with the statistics required to discuss the risks and benefits of allowing
    content to be made freely available.  This much needed data can be utilised to
    rethink other methods of allowing collections to be used in similar
    circumstances.  The promotional return from the attribution of collections and
    the integrity of providing content to the public in an open access initiative
    should outweigh any small fee gained from the traditional method of licensing
    images.  The value of promotion of the brand and reputation of the Museum
    through the vast increase in views, participation, engagement and knowledge
    about the Museums photographic collections should be considered as a significant
    measure to evolve from the Commons.</p>
  <h2>Is It Ultimately About Income Or Connection</h2>
  <p>So what has been discovered since joining the Commons
    leading us to rethink the traditional image-licensing model?  The question has
    been raised about whether to base our image-licensing models on projected
    income or better access?  The projects, collaborations, comments, tags and
    research that the Museum, and our audience, has gained possess great value that
    it is hard to measure this against traditional, image sale statistics and
    income.  Three months after the Commons project was initiated there were
    statistics and a good indication of audience participation and connection
    (Chan, 2008).  Visitation was much higher, tagging and comments were of value
    with these being re-ingested back to the Museums Web site to enhance further
    search capabilities.  Innovation, research, community engagement and
    discoveries were being made and these are important indicators for the need to
    review the traditional model.</p>
  <p>A significant outcome for the Museum has been the
    development of a partnership with ABC Innovation through the Sydney Sidetracks
    project.  This is an on-line and mobile application for downloading historical
    content to explore locations around Sydney using images, audio and videos from
    cultural collections (ABC, 2009).  The ABC, situated down the road from the
    Museum, has been utilising images from the Museums photostream on the Commons
    to augment the experience of revisiting historical areas around Sydney.  This
    has led to an important partnership for future cross-institution collaboration.
    This is a critical measure for the Musuem to have established a partnership
    through allowing content to be used for projects developed outside of the
    organisation.</p>

  <p class="caption">Fig 2: Screenshot of ABC Sydney Sidetracks project (ABC,
    2009).</p>
  <p>The Commons project has lead to a range of important
    discoveries and innovation such as the Powerhouse street view mash up by Paul
    Hagon (2008) where he has utilised the geo-coded images and matched them with
    Google Street View for a great example of ‘then and now’ comparisons.</p>

  <p class="caption">Fig 3: Screenshot of Powerhouse street view mashup (Hagon,
    2008).</p>
  <p>There is the on-going social media connection made through
    a member locating the ‘Mosman Bay Falls’ image that has been a qualitative
    finding leading the Museum to learn from a users perspective about what it
    means to have access to this content.   Meade highlights his view about
    accessing content that has ‘no known copyright restrictions’ whilst recognising
    the institutional need for income.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">I regard it as my heritage and everybody else who&#39;s here. 
    And also it should be available for research from overseas as well.  So yeah, I
    think it&#39;s my right to use it . . .  But I also understand that there are
    financial constraints involved in the mere act of trying to release them.  It
    costs money to do that. (Meade in Chan, 2008).</p>
  <p>This social media connection has also led to findings
    about on-line visitation with a connection to visiting the gallery space (Chan,
    2008), something that is difficult to quantify in traditional statistics.</p>
  <p>With the development of partnerships, innovative projects,
    user-generated research and connection with the Flickr community the Museum
    will be reviewing the image-licensing business model that has been utilised for
    many years without review.</p>
  <h2>Future plans</h2>
  <p>The Powerhouse Museum will be investigating the new
    provision in the Copyright Act to determine what exceptions are ‘fair dealing’
    for cultural institutions such as libraries, galleries and museums.  Their will
    be a review of our acquisition license agreements with copyright owners to
    permit holders to allow for options when signing rights to the Museum so that
    content can be delivered on-line and free for educational use.  This may take
    the form of a Creative Commons license similar to the choices provided by
    Flickr members to change the default of the automated copyright symbol to a
    flexible option (Greenleaf, 2007) provided there is correct attribution.</p>
  <p>The Museums aim is to provide downloading options for the
    specific purpose of research and study for scholarly and community applications
    using tracking methodologies.  This will enable the sector to freely use
    Powerhouse Museum content as a trusted, authoritative source without having to
    pay reproduction fees and the escalating statutory licensing fees.  There will
    be statistics on the use of the images for the first time and an indication of
    the type of content required by this sector that can influence further
    digitisation projects.</p>
  <p>With the global problem of the economic downturn and in
    general, institutions require different methods of producing income to fund the
    multitude of expenses necessary to house, maintain and digitise their
    collections.  With the relinquishing of some income from reproduction fees we will
    be exploring fine art printing options that can cater for commercial
    applications and one-off use, similar to the way the Victoria and Albert Museum
    in London has achieved with its V&amp;A prints on-line service.   This should
    have been implemented at the time the Commons project went live and is seen as
    a downfall and a missed opportunity due to a lack of resources.  It is these
    potential opportunities that need to be acknowledged when planning future
    image-based projects.</p>
  <p>We will explore creator remuneration from the sale of any
    prints with current copyright owners of works in our collection and copyright
    budgets will be negotiated at the onset of new digitisation projects.  It is
    important for the museum sector to develop nurturing relationships with creators
    and share the benefits of any income gained from their work, which in-turn may
    encourage free-for-education use.  With the documented benefits from the
    Commons project and our wish to assist the education sector a report and
    recommendations for a new business model will be presented for approval.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>There are complexities in making any new business model
    work particularly when the on-line environment is rapidly changing.  The
    challenge for museums is to make adjustments and change with the fast pace of
    technology to ensure that business models that are adopted reflect the current
    need the public requires for fast and efficient access to government funded
    collection content.  There are questions that need to be answered in relation
    to traditional image-licensing business models for accessing content.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Will
      we see a change in traditional image-licensing business models cross-government
      that will support the education sector to reduce the over burdening statutory
      licensing fees?</li>
    <li>Will
      these new models be flexible to allow for commercial applications in an
      environment short of funding?</li>
    <li>Will
      we have creator remuneration schemes that nurture relations with creators and
      collectors?</li>
    <li>Will
      institutions have resolution on the complicated provision in the Copyright Act
      1968 that may provide some answers to the problematic issues surrounding
      copyright in Australia?</li>
    <li>What
      happens to content if traditional licensing models don’t change?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Powerhouse Museum will be changing its traditional
    image-licensing model, utilising some of the key principles and outcomes of the
    Commons project as a measure, to develop a new business model for better access
    to digital content.   The aim is to benefit the public and the education
    sector, whilst also experimenting with income streams.  The Commons project has
    allowed us to evaluate how we can utilise on-line communities so that our
    collections can reach a far greater audience and therefore has set a benchmark
    with documented successes to allow the Museum to think differently about how we
    engage with our audiences and improve access to our content for future
    applications.</p>
