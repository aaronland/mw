		      Mural Arts Program, have used GIS to expand their on-line presence and
		    reach wider audiences with collections of historic photos and information on
	      public art.</p>
		  <p class="AbstractText">This paper focuses on how the geographic approach has spurred the growth of
		    these sites into valuable assets for collections management and beloved sites
		    for users. It explores how geographic technologies can be applied to both

		  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Place matters. When poet-farmer Wendell Berry said, “If
    you don’t know where you are, you don’t know who you are,” he spoke to the deep
    importance of place in making meanings. Where an event happened, an object was
    created, or a photo was taken can have significant impact on how that item,
    object, or photo is understood. </p>
  <h3>Philadelphia City Archives</h3>
  <p>Philadelphia’s City Archives, managed by the Department of
    Records (DOR), contains an estimated 2 million photographs, some dating to the
    1860s. Photographers assigned to City departments such as the Departments of
    Streets, City Transit, and Public Works originally took these photographs in
    order to document public works projects.  </p>
  <p>Facing several challenges, including a rapidly aging
    collection, limited public access, and an ever-tightening budget, DOR partnered
    with Avencia Incorporated, a local software company, to develop <i>Philly</i>History.org. <i>Philly</i>History.org was established in 2005 as a means of preserving
    and organizing the Philadelphia City Archives’ collection of historic
    photographs. The project encompasses a mass digitization and preservation
    effort as well as the development of the <i>Philly</i>History.org
    Web site (<a href="../http://www.phillyhistory.org/">www.phillyhistory.org</a>). <i>Philly</i>History.org
    serves as a Web-based digital asset management system, enabling both management
    of metadata about the images and public search of the collections based on
    location, address, time period, and keyword. An interactive map shows the
    locations of all available photos near an address, intersection, or
    neighborhood, helping users to identify photos and understand historic settings
    in their current contexts. </p>
  <h3>Mural Arts
    Program</h3>
  <p>The walls of Philadelphia are covered in murals – more
    than 2,800 of them. Established in 1984, Philadelphia’s Mural Arts Program’s
    (MAP) mission is to engage in art education and community public arts
    collaborations, and to increase public access to art. The reach of these
    services, however, is limited to local residents, and the opportunities are
    restricted by organizational capacity. To overcome these limitations, MAP
    developed an on-line catalogue of its murals, organized by location. Muralfarm.org
    enables users to find murals based on their location in the city and to access photographs
    and information about them. MAP’s murals are designed using a collaborative,
    community-driven process, such that each mural is the product not just of the
    artist or artists who drew the final design, but also of the community whose
    wall (or walls) it graces. GIS offered MAP a way to display and share their
    murals in their community context, painting a richer picture than might
    otherwise have been possible.</p>
  <h2>Evolution of the Technology</h2>
  <p><i>Philly</i>History.org
    and MuralFarm.org both rely on the Sajara software framework developed by Avencia
    Incorporated, which has evolved over time to meet the needs and expand the
    functionality available to the projects. <i>Philly</i>History.org
    was the first to be developed and originally consisted of collection management
    features, simple public search options, and an e-commerce system. Public users
    of the system could search the collection based on an address, a neighborhood,
    keywords, and dates. A small portion of the images was unable to be
    georeferenced, and an additional search option included images that did not
    have a location.</p>
  <p>    Very early in the project, several challenges presented themselves. One of the
    most significant was developing the system to geocode the images (i.e.,
    assigning a geographic location on a map to each photo). Most images are not
    indexed to a specific address, but rather have a description along the lines of
    “east of X Street looking towards Y”. This was addressed through the
    development of a parser that would read through the descriptions, picking out
    addresses based on common configurations. Geocoding was further complicated
    through changes in street names over time. Street name changes are accommodated
    through the use of street aliasing based on information maintained by the
    Philadelphia Department of Streets. However, we knew that the resulting system
    would not be perfect, so the project team implemented a feature that enables
    site users to provide corrections when they have knowledge of an image that has
    been geocoded to the wrong location.  <i>Philly</i>History.org
    has developed a small but dedicated subset of users who regularly provide location
    corrections for photos. These corrections are often connected to rivers,
    bridges, and railroad lines, locations that can be notoriously difficult to
    geocode but that many users often have personal knowledge of and  can assist with accurate geocoding.</p>
  <p>As digitization of the Archives photograph collections
    continued, questions began to arise about the potentially controversial nature
    of some images. With the Web site available to the public, images from the
    medical collection, for example, were deemed inappropriate for display. As the
    project was also about preservation of the negatives, though, it was important
    that these photos be included on the management side, and the ability was added
    to turn the public view of an image on or off to accommodate this. Other
    images, though potentially troubling, such as a 1928 theater marquee depicting Al
    Jolson in blackface were seen as being important historic records. To address
    potential concerns over these images, a blog was created to provide additional
    context for these images (though blog entries are not limited to controversial
    topics).</p>
  <p>From its conception, <i>Philly</i>History.org
    was also seen as a potential source of revenue for the Department of Records,
    and an e-commerce component was built to enable members of the public to
    purchase prints from the collection. This has proven quite successful, and even
    at the relatively low cost of $10 and $20 per 5x7 or 8x10 print, the project
    has generated $36,870 in revenue, with additional income from the sale of
    high-resolution digital images and large framed prints from an art exhibit. Purchase
    options are limited due to orders being fulfilled in-house, and we feel there
    is potential to increase revenue considerably beyond this by offering
    additional services. A project is currently underway to enable third-party
    order fulfillment by a vendor that would provide many additional product
    offerings.</p>
  <h3>Adaptations and updates</h3>
  <p>Over time, the system has continued to change. The search
    user interface has been updated several times to incorporate feedback from users
    and new interaction technologies such as AJAX. One example is the location of
    the address search dialogue. In the earliest versions of <i>Philly</i>History.org, the address and neighborhood searches were both
    coupled with the map interface and only visible when the appropriate menu was
    clicked on. It seemed an appropriate choice to keep the location parameters
    together. But watching public users navigate the search page quickly revealed
    that this had not been the right decision. Many people were typing addresses to
    begin their searches, but they were typing them into the keyword dialogue,
    which was at the top of the page. Based on this observation, the search page
    was reconfigured with the address dialogue always visible at the top of the
    page.</p>
  <p>Additional updates have revolved around users’ ability to
    interact with the collections. Users can save images to a ‘favorites’
    collection and assign custom tags, e-mail an image to a friend, save searches,
    and subscribe to search RSS feeds for updates as new images are added to the
    system. As Web-based geographic technologies have continued to improve and
    become more familiar to the public, additional features have been added to the
    site, including the ability to view search results (or the entire collection)
    in Google Earth and to view RSS feeds in GoogleMaps using GeoRSS. </p>
  <p>The Mural Arts Program began work on Muralfarm.org in 2007,
    introducing a new set of challenges. Chief among these was that the nature of
    the assets was quite different. With <i>Philly</i>History.org,
    each photo represented an individual asset. For the Mural Arts Program, the
    assets are murals, each of which might have several associated images. Because
    the system was expected to work for MAP for database management as well as public
    outreach, it was important that each photo have its own metadata separate from
    the metadata of the mural itself. The database and asset management interface
    had to be redesigned to accommodate this difference.</p>
  <p>Not all attempts to incorporate new features have been
    equally successful. Mural Arts also experimented with Google Streetview as a
    means of enabling users to view existing murals in their larger context. While
    it was an interesting idea and compelling feature in theory, the reality left
    quite a bit to be desired. The difficulty was that Streetview would be
    configured based on the address to which the mural had been geocoded. Unfortunately,
    we were not able to configure the system to ensure that the Streetview popup
    would actually point directly to the murals, which we found were often around
    the corner from the view provided, and in some instances no amount of
    navigation would bring them into view. Mural Arts toyed with the idea of
    turning off the feature altogether, but in the end settled on adding a
    disclaimer indicating that users may have to move around a bit to see the
    mural. (Note: Another take on using Google Streetview to add context to photos
    was described by Paul Hagon (2008) who built a mashup using geotagged images
    from the Powerhouse Museum available via Flickr Commons.)</p>
  <h2>The Impact of Geography</h2>
  <p>For both the Department of Records and the Mural Arts
    Program, the ability to manage assets based on geography has been a valuable
    aspect of the projects, due in part to the nature of the assets. The DOR’s
    photos are valuable in providing a historic record of a specific place. For the
    Mural Arts Program, location is just as much a part of the mural as the actual
    image. For site users, the ability to search assets by location is central to
    their experience of the Web sites.</p>
  <p>Since all searches have a geographic component based on
    map extent, it can be difficult to quantify the instances where geography was
    intentionally incorporated versus when the default city-wide map was used. However,
    nearly 40% of searches in <i>Philly</i>History
    are performed based either on an address or on a neighborhood, clearly
    demonstrating that users are relying on location as a significant component of
    their use of the site. Muralfarm.org is scheduled for public release at the end
    of January 2009, as this article is being written, so similar statistics are
    not available at this time.</p>
  <p>While we see GIS as having a very important role to play
    for these two applications, it may not be the most appropriate approach for
    every collection. Location might not be as vital a component for collections
    such as portraits or media that reference fictional lands. By contrast, the
    incorporation of location may be particularly valuable for cultural heritage
    collections. Research by the Dutch government indicated that the public’s main
    interest in on-line cultural heritage is family and local history (Liberge
    &amp; Gerlings 2008), and our experience with <i>Philly</i>History.org has certainly supported this. </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>When <i>Philly</i>History
    rolled out, we were surprised by the comments we started getting from site
    visitors. As public use of the system has increased, we have been amazed
    by both the range of users and the depth of personal reactions users are
    expressing through the site. In addition to historians, genealogists,
    librarians and researchers, the site has been used by apartment rental
    companies looking for historic images of their properties to decorate their new
    buildings, authors researching settings for their historical novels and
    screenplays, as well as curious members of the general public. Visitors can submit
    comments through the site, and many describe how they started their visit by
    searching the neighborhoods where they or their parents or grandparents grew
    up. They are sharing very personal reactions to the images, illustrating the
    stories of places that are very dear to them and that anchor them to their city
    and community’s history.  “You
    helped me remember my past,” wrote one site visitor. “I see parts of the city as
    I was growing up and think of how things have changed. Thank you.” “It feels
    like I found jewels,” wrote another. A visitor wrote, “It was so great to see
    how things were and looked so many years ago in a city that many people who
    grew up here cannot let go of after so many years” – illustrating the deep
    connection people feel to the City of Philadelphia and the places depicted in
    the photos. And while we haven’t actually put him to the test, we were quite
    thrilled when the former editor of the Philadelphia City Paper actually wrote,
    “This is the best use of taxpayer money I’ve heard of in a long time. I’d even
    be willing to pay <i>more</i> taxes, if it
    would speed up the image uploads.” </p>
