    <p class="AbstractText">Museum Victoria is Australia&#39;s largest public museums
		  organisation and, as the State Museum for Victoria, it is responsible for the
		  care of the State&#39;s collections, conducting research, and providing public
		  access and community engagement for all Victorians. The Museum has a proud 150
		  year history of scientific and cultural research and collection development. In
		  a relatively large museum organisation like Museum Victoria, you need to ensure
		  you have a common internal sense of purpose before you can entice the world to
		  your on-line experiences. In order to succeed we realised, after some false
		  starts, that we had to lead an extensive consultation process across many
		  levels of the organisation. Outcomes included structural changes, where we
		  consolidated the on-line team , created an on-line steering committee, and created
		  on-line strategic documents endorsed by the Executive Management Team and the
		  Board. This paper will present the challenges we faced in managing the creation
		  of a common on-line strategy and framework at Museum Victoria. We will share
		  the struggles we faced and the compromises we made to create institutional
	    change in a major museum.</p>

    <h2>Implementing an On-line Framework</h2>
    <h3>The problem</h3>
    <p class="MsoBodyText">Museum Victoria consists of three
		  museums, Melbourne Museum (which includes the Melbourne IMAX), Scienceworks,
		  and the Immigration Museum. A recent full rebranding of the museums also
		  established the importance of the Museum Victoria brand which is really only
		  meaningful on the Web. Visitation to the Museums totals over one and a half million
	    each year, and on-line visitation is approximately five million.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText">Museum Victoria is a highly successful
		  organisation with excellent attendance numbers and high quality exhibitions
		  which are regularly reviewed and refreshed. We are particularly proud of our
		  achievements in the education sphere where we have over a quarter of a million
		  annual education visitors. Behind the scenes of all this success, we have
		  extremely reliable and stable ICT and Multimedia infrastructure which maintains
	    effective operation 99.9% of the time.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText">Unfortunately, these days, this isn’t
		  enough. A public organisation like ours which is trying to actively engage with
		  the public simply cannot succeed unless it has a significant on-line presence.
		  More than that – we need to have a “comprehensive, engaging and
		  innovative” on-line presence which is both consistently reliable and also able
		  to provide valuable services – internal and external. While, for many
		  years, we have had an effective Web site with up-to-date visitor information
		  and valuable well-constructed content, this is only the first step to an
	    effective and engaging on-line presence.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText">This paper presents the challenges we
		  faced in managing the creation of a common on-line strategy and framework at
		  Museum Victoria. We will share the struggles we faced, the various compromises
		  and the numerous mistakes we made in our journey to create institutional change
	    in a major museum.</p>
    <h3>Starting to find a solution</h3>
    <p>First, a little background. The structure
		  of our organisation of 500 effective full-time employees (FTE) includes four
		  divisions – Collections Research and Exhibitions, Museum Operations,
		  Information Multimedia, and Technology and Corporate Services. We recently
		  reviewed our strategic plan and have consequently aligned around six strategic
	    planning priorities which support our vision: <i>Exploring Victoria; Discovering the World</i>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Great Places and Spaces</li>
      <li>Research and Collections : Knowledge and
		    Connections</li>
      <li>Inspiring Experiences: Engagement and Learning</li>
      <li>Innovative People, Creative Museum</li>
      <li>Visibility and Reputation</li>
      <li>Environmental Responsibility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have also adopted a network approach
		  (Greene, 2005) in our organisation: this has resulted in less reliance on the
		  standard hierarchy and greater emphasis on collaboration and consultation
	    between departments as an essential component of all decision making.</p>
    <p>Increasingly throughout 2006/7 it became
		  clear that to achieve an integrated and successful on-line presence required
		  active engagement across Museum Victoria. The rebranding exercise conducted by
		  our own staff with some external assistance identified the Web as a key area to
		  develop and standardise. We had also begun to develop a Web site strategy
		  around the same time. However, we didn’t feel we had a blueprint to follow. We
		  had significant experience in creating strategies – particularly ICT
		  Strategies – but this was something quite different. With ICT Strategies,
		  the main challenge is to achieve deep engagement with a small group of key
		  internal stakeholders; with the on-line strategy, it was something else. While
		  many internal stakeholders have a view about the service levels, perhaps the
		  cool gadgets, or, say, the reports they’d like – most people thought it
	    was ICT’s job to create the strategy.</p>
    <p>We needed to develop an On-line Strategy, quite
		  different from other strategies. The On-line Strategy needed to cut across
		  everything significant we were doing and get us to a position where we could
		  take advantage of the opportunities presented by the on-line world. The On-line
		  Strategy needed to be aspirational, providing a sense of destination, while at
		  the same time quite prescriptive to outline exactly what changes were required
		  to achieve our objectives as an organisation. A key outcome of the On-line
		  Strategy was to make museum staff conscious of the opportunities afforded by a
	    more effective On-line presence for the museum.</p>
    <p>ICT staff were not the only drivers of
		  On-line change at the museum. Indeed, at some key points along our journey the
		  prodding has most definitely come from outside of ICT. We like strategies at
		  Museum Victoria - in addition to the overall Museum Victoria Strategic Plan, we
		  have a Commercial Strategy, Research Strategy, Collections Strategy, Community
		  Engagement Strategy, Knowledge Management Strategy, Information Strategy and a
		  whole lot of others including, of course, an ICT Strategy. So there was
		  significant internal pressure for us to create an On-line Strategy. The only
		  trouble was we weren’t too sure how to go about creating something that so many
		  people in the organisation were focused on, for which there was no clear
		  precedent. Indeed, we did not fully appreciate the extent of the investment
	    until we started to draft a document!</p>
    <p>Sometimes we wonder if it is a little like
		  the field of writing. All educated souls – especially if they have
		  reached the giddy heights of management – think they are expert at
		  writing. If you were foolish enough to get all the staff in a room to settle the
		  best way to express something (and how it should be achieved), you would be in
		  for much debate and chest beating. Writing is something we all do, and it’s not
	    something that most of us are willing to outsource to the experts.</p>
    <p>In many ways the on-line world has entered
		  into this space. Increasingly, we all know what we like in the on-line world. Many
		  of us believe that we know best what feels good and looks right in the on-line
		  world, and we don’t want to outsource that judgement to others. Quite right
		  too!  It’s great that we increasingly all feel ownership of our on-line
		  representation (neither of us would want it to be any other way), but the
		  authors of this paper did not sufficiently take into account the impact this
		  feeling of ownership would have on our internal stakeholders when it came to
	    creating an on-line strategy. Everyone wanted a piece of it!</p>
    <p>Following a particularly embarrassing
		  series of exchanges at our annual leadership planning workshops at the end of
		  2006, the museum finally realised it must change in response to on-line
		  demands. We were participating in a facilitated workshop and discussing
		  upcoming key strategic impacts on the museum. Several leadership team members
		  simultaneously identified the Web as an area that was underperforming.
		  Individuals also expressed frustration with a lack of process around the
		  development of Web site projects and assets. We were witnessing a fundamental
		  shift in the organisation; people who only a year earlier would not have
		  thought of the Web were now actively pushing for more and better access to the museum’s
		  Web development resources. The leadership team members “responsible” for the Web
		  site were isolated and subjected to a “Spanish Inquisition of sorts”. We were
		  accused of basically failing the organisation with an inadequate Web presence,
		  lack of planning, lack of responsiveness, and failure to deliver what were now
		  seen as key Museum-wide outcomes. Fair cop at some level, although the
		  underlying message was that we needed to change not just the Web developers’
	    role and their management but the entire museum. On reflection we could see a
		  storm brewing but found we just couldn’t respond quickly enough on our own. The
		  frustrations expressed by the organisation became the catalyst for
	    organisational change.</p>
    <p>Museum Victoria had been an early adopter
		  on the Web – Australian Museums On-line had grown from a pilot project at
		  Museum Victoria in the mid 90’s. We had a full-time Web team of three-four
		  people and active programs – but the penny finally dropped and all those
		  years of us dragging the museum on to the Web ended in those difficult
		  workshops. No longer was it left up to the techies to do that Web stuff –
	    the organisation was finally on board, something we had all worked towards for
		  ten years. We weren’t ready or prepared for the demands the organisation wanted
	    to make of us!</p>
    <p>And we didn’t sufficiently recognise the
		  need for shared ownership when we started to create our On-line Strategy. The
		  process of writing the document was commenced following a session with only a
		  handful of executive staff, including our CEO, Patrick Greene, three (out of
		  four) of the divisional directors, and four senior managers. A methodology in
		  favour with the Victorian Government in Australia called an Investment Logic
		  Map was used to come to a consensus as to the key Drivers, Objectives,
		  Benefits, Changes and Enablers in order to achieve our on-line aims. While the
		  outcome of this Investment Logic Map session was valuable (see the output of
		  this Investment Logic Map (ILM) session attached in Appendix One) and certainly
		  achieved an increased understanding and consensus within the Museum Victoria
		  executive, this was only a small step in achieving a consensus across the
		  organisation. Key senior managers were not present at the Investment Logic Map
		  session, and we found that their absence was one of our misjudgements: we needed
		  to include a wide cross-section of Museum staff in the original consultation
	    process. </p>
    <h3>On-line strategy</h3>
    <p>So we created an On-line Strategy based on
		  the Investment Logic Map session and consequently articulated five key
	    strategic directions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Grow
		    new, targeted on-line audiences</li>
      <li>Implement
		    innovative on-line initiatives </li>
      <li>Establish
		    a consistent on-line approach to knowledge capture</li>
      <li>Provide
		    and support on-line access to Museum Victoria’s collection and associated
		    cultural assets</li>
      <li>Integrate
		    an on-line culture within Museum Victoria’s business practices</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But that was still only the start of the beginning.
		  While the On-line Strategy was a useful launching pad to success in the on-line
		  space, we had a long way to go to achieve a consensus across the organisation
	    or a shared commitment to what we wanted and needed to achieve.</p>
    <p>We needed to change the structure, the
	    processes,  and people’s thinking.</p>
    <h3>Structural changes</h3>
    <p>First, we restructured the ICT/Technical
	    group. </p>
    <p>Previously, we had a Web team, a team who
		  looked after our business applications, and a team within ICT who looked after
		  our collection management system. These three teams were classic silos –
	    they saw everything from the perspective of what was right from the point of
		  view of the applications/systems they were responsible for. So, from the Web
		  team’s perspective, everything revolved around the Content Management System
	    – a service could only work and be supported if it was part of the CMS. From
		  the business systems team, everything revolved around the particular
		  requirements of each system they supported, and from the collection systems
		  team, all that mattered was maintaining the collection. Despite extremely
		  clever and dedicated individuals, it was very difficult to develop a strategic
		  approach capable of producing innovative yet consistent on-line services which
	    met needs recognised across the whole organisation.</p>
    <p>Our new structure is pretty simple. We have
		  a Service Desk, some infrastructure folk, and the rest are either in On-line
		  Systems or On-line Development. So the On-line Development team develop content
		  on-line and the On-line Systems team provide support. Another way to view our
		  structure is to consider it as really one single On-line Team – one part
		  with more emphasis on maintaining infrastructure and the other with more
	    emphasis on developing new experiences. </p>
    <h3>A few words on the term On-line</h3>
    <p>We chose On-line Strategy rather than Web
		  site Strategy to make it clear we are talking about more than the Web site: we
		  are including public programming within the museums which use the Web, Business
		  Systems/ internal and external, Exhibition programs, multimedia installations
	    that are also on the Web, our social media programs, etc.</p>
    <p>Gradually we realised that nearly
		  everything important in ICT was “on-line”. While we have previously used the
		  term “business applications” to define a series of applications that support
		  specific systems of the business (including HR and Finance, ticketing, retail,
		  events, membership, inventory and request management), what was, in fact, most
	    interesting about these applications was the <b>way</b> we used them on-line. </p>
    <p>So we thought it made a lot of sense to
		  create an On-line Team which focused primarily on developing and supporting
		  everything that is on-line: that is, content which is accessible from a
	    browser.</p>
    <p>And of course, our new approach to on-line
		  achievement did not impact just the ICT folk. Increasingly, roles are being
		  redefined to place more emphasis on “on-line work” becoming a central component
		  of position descriptions. This change process is currently only incremental but
		  will inevitably gain momentum and may well, require further significant
	    organisational restructuring.</p>
    <h3>On-line planning group</h3>
    <p>The other crucial structural change was the
		  establishment of the On-line Planning Group. This committee meets monthly, is
	    made up of the key departmental managers, and has the following brief:</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">“... to provide guidance and governance to Museum Victoria for
	    prioritisation of on-line initiatives and projects.”</p>
    <p>This committee therefore provides a
		  powerful forum for key internal stakeholders to influence Museum Victoria’s on-line
		  presence and, of course, it also provides an official forum for debate –
	    which is vital if we are to change people’s minds and steer the ship in a
	    different direction.</p>
    <p>We have realised that, in terms of
		  developing processes to produce significant on-line content which has
		  significant ownership across the organisation, there is a lot to learn from
		  established procedures. At Museum Victoria, we have mature established
		  processes around the development of exhibitions. We’ve been doing it a long
		  time and put a lot of effort into ensuring that we can deliver quality
		  exhibitions on time within defined budgets. It therefore seemed logical that we
		  follow these established processes for on-line development. For instance, there
		  is an Exhibition Planning Group, made up of key departmental managers, which
		  oversees all exhibitions to make sure there are appropriate resources,
		  management and prioritisation. The On-line Planning Group follows a very
		  similar model, while also recognising that on-line experiences are more
	    transitory and iterative in nature. </p>
    <h3>On-line framework</h3>
    <p>The final component of our approach to
		  changing direction was to create a document called the On-line Framework. It defined
		  the on-line work we needed to do and the processes we needed to put in place to
		  be successful; it should be read in conjunction with the On-line Strategy. Indeed,
		  in practical terms, the On-line Framework is a far more useful document. First,
		  it was created by a truly representative body, the On-line Planning Group,
		  which over a period of eight months, achieved a far greater shared
		  understanding of what we wanted to achieve and how we could achieve it. The
		  Manager Visitor Advocacy at Museum Victoria, Carolyn Meehan, provided
		  invaluable inspiration and substance to the On-line Framework. It is an
		  important lesson that someone from a non-technical background with great
		  understanding of marketing as well as museum organisational values and
		  processes was a key person in the creation of the central on-line strategic
	    document.</p>
    <p>In content, the On-line Framework outlines how
		  Museum Victoria understands the on-line environment; works in the on-line
		  environment; scopes and manages on-line projects; and measures the success of
	    its on-line presence. (note: the On-line Framework is available on request.)</p>
    <p>A key component of the On-line Framework is
		  the conceptual model (Appendix Two) which we created as a way of categorising
		  the on-line experiences we create while also providing direction to what we
		  need to achieve. The conceptual model categorises on-line experiences into
		  three areas: Information, Participation, and Relationship. Within each of these
	    categories the on-line experience becomes more sophisticated. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the <i>Information</i> category, an example is simple on-line text stating museum opening hours and giving
		    directions. The same “information” can also be made available on-line with
		    complicated multimedia with video and sound in MP3 format which can be
		    downloaded on to a local iPod. </li>
      <li>In the <i>Participation</i> category, the on-line user is encouraged to provide information, feedback,
		    comments, ratings, etc. Again, this user-generated content might be simple
		    text, in the form of comments, or clicks on rating stars, but it might be more
		    complex media such as self-created video stories or visitor experiences.</li>
      <li>Finally, in the <i>Relationship</i> category, the on-line data truly becomes “owned” by
		    the general Internet community ,and the museum necessarily starts losing
		    control of how that data may be used. Once more, this data can be in the form
		    of text blogs, where the content is not necessarily owned or controlled by the
		    museum institution, or it may be sound or video which appears on other Web
		    sites as mash-ups with, for instance, scientific geographic data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In general, our museum wants on-line
		  experiences ranging in sophistication across all three of the above categories.
		  The most challenging is the Relationship category as this raises the
		  threatening question of who owns the on-line content. However the creation of
		  the On-line Framework at Museum Victoria provides us with a clear mandate and with
		  organisational support to provide experiences which can truly develop an on-line
	    community.</p>
    <p>A particular example of where
		  organisational change has impacted our approach to our on-line output is Museum
		  Victoria’s journey towards making our collections available on-line. This is an
		  area where there is, not surprisingly, a bit of an internal “clash of culture”.
		  In today’s on-line world, there is an expectation that content be  created
		  relatively quickly – rather than a long internal project followed by a
		  discrete release of the “final Web site”, there are iterative launches with
		  evolutionary on-line improvements. However, this process clashes with much of
		  the culture at a museum, where there is an expectation of a final, completed
		  product at launch. These two alternative approaches have previously hindered
		  progress in making our collections available on-line. The structure of the On-line
		  Planning Group and the creation of the On-line Framework have been critical in
		  helping us understand the different approaches across the museum and have led
	    to effective cross-departmental project teams.</p>
    <p>Using the conceptual model with the example
		  of on-line collections is helpful in ensuring we provide the most engaging on-line
		  experience across all three categories. We want <i>Information</i> about our collections to be accessible and accurate;
		  but we also want on-line users to <i>Participate</i>,
		  perhaps by posting a question or comment about a particular collection item or
		  even rating our museum content; and, finally, we also want to try to build a <i>Relationship</i> with an on-line community
		  so other institutions, organisations, groups of interest use our data to create
	    more complex and richer on-line experiences (and vice versa).</p>
    <h2>Final Words </h2>
    <p>So that’s an outline of the journey we have
	    commenced here at Museum Victoria. </p>
    <p>The fundamental role of the On-line
		  Strategy and the On-line Framework is to lead a change process across the
		  Museum. The demands and opportunities for a large museum organisation of ‘Going
		  On-line Collectively’ as a group rather than individually through a series of
	    ‘maverick” actions has been a challenge. The first ten years of Web development
		  and innovation happened through maverick action; the thought of actually having
	    to engage the organisation head-on was daunting.</p>
    <p>We can now say that two years into the
		  process we have been surprised by the incredible changes that have occurred and
		  the quite dramatic changes that individuals and work groups have made in their
		  attitudes and work practices. New initiatives are now springing up all over the
		  organisation, and we now have the processes and ability to take them on or not,
	    depending on established criteria and solid discussion and decision making.</p>
    <p>After some shuddering and even a couple of
		  wrong turns, we have now made significant progress in steering a significant
		  museum institution toward a common on-line destination. The structural changes
		  of consolidating an on-line resource team, integrated it into ICT, as well as
		  the creation of a steering group composed of key managers across the museum,
		  were crucial in setting us on the right path. Also essential was the development
		  of an On-line Strategy and an On-line Framework, both of which have been
		  central to ensuring the right discussions and the achievement of a far greater
	    sense of common purpose. </p>
    <p>While we fully expect that different museum
		  institutions will take quite different paths, we think there are valuable
		  lessons in our particular adventure. We hope that this paper has provided some
		  insight for other Web folk who are trying to grapple with a strategic path
	    towards achieving great things in the on-line world.</p>
