	    <h2>Introduction</h2>
	    <p>The enormous popularity of computer and videogames (Lenhard
		      et al., 2008), and the inherent pedagogical qualities of such games (Gee, 2003,
		      Squire et al., 2003) has inspired many efforts to create games that
		      successfully fuse compelling gameplay with learning goals. While most of these
		      efforts focus on formal education, a growing number of museums, zoos and
		      aquariums have undertaken game-based learning projects, as indicated by the
		      addition of a &#34;Games&#34; category in 2007 to the American Association of
		      Museum&#39;s MUSE Awards. Yet evidence of the effectiveness of game-based learning,
        especially in free choice settings, has been elusive. </p>
	    <p>This session examines one such effort. <i>WolfQuest</i> is a 3D wildlife simulation game developed by Eduweb and the Minnesota Zoo, and
		      distributed on-line as a free download for Mac and Windows computers. Funded by
		      the National Science Foundation, <i>WolfQuest</i> was designed to bring the
		      immersive, emotionally compelling qualities of commercial videogames to
		      informal science learning. In this paper, we will present results from our
		      summative evaluation of learning outcomes that the game produced, discuss the
		      theory behind the project, and reflect on our experiences developing the game:
        what went as we expected and what surprised us along the way. </p>
	    <h2>WolfQuest and Game-based Learning</h2>
	    <p>From the start, we envisioned <i>WolfQuest</i> as a pilot test for recent research and thinking about
		      games and educational psychology. While this field had been drawing interest
		      from scholars for many years, it received a jump start with the 2003
		      publication of James Paul Gee&#39;s book, <i>What Video Games Have To Teach Us
		        About Learning and Literacy</i> (2003). In many ways, we were
		      directly inspired by Gee&#39;s ideas in the design of <i>WolfQuest</i>. Gee
		      articulated 36 learning principles exhibited by good games. Many of these
		      clearly derive from learning theories by Piaget, Vgotsky, and others (Quintana,
        2005). Here are several examples (all principles from Gee, 2003):</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li><i>Active, Critical Learning
	        Principle: All aspects of the learning environment are set up to encourage
	        active and critical, not passive, learning.</i> In <i>WolfQuest</i>, the
	        3D environment (an accurate model of four square kilometers of Yellowstone
	        National Park) features elk, grizzly bears, stranger wolves, and small mammals,
	        all of which interact with players in different ways, requiring active
	        exploration and experimentation.</li>
	      <li><i>“Regime of Competence”
          Principle: The learner gets ample opportunity to operate within, but at the
	        outer edge of, his or her resources, so that at those points things are felt as
	        challenging but not “Undoable.”</i> Survival in <i>WolfQuest</i> is
	        challenging (killing a single elk can take ten or more minutes of persistent
	        work) but achievable, with the difficulty increasing as the player progresses
	        through the game. </li>
	      <li><i>Probing Principle: Learning
	        is a cycle of probing the world; reflecting in and on this action and, on this
	        basis, forming a hypothesis; reprobing the world to test this hypothesis; and
	        then accepting or rethinking the hypothesis.</i> In <i>WolfQuest</i>,
	        players interact with stranger wolves through a turn-based dialog system, where
	        they can see the results of different messages (displayed in English but
	        conveyed in-game through wolf postures and vocalizations), learning through
	        experimentation about wolf social hierarchies.</li>
	      <li><i>Dispersed Principle:
	        Meaning/knowledge is dispersed in the sense that the learner shares it with
	        others outside the domain/game, some of whom the learner may rarely or never
	        see face-to-face.</i> Players share experiences, strategies, and goals in on-line
	        multiplayer games and the discussion forums.</li>
	      <li><i>Affinity Group Principle:
	        Learners constitute an &#34;affinity group,&#34; that is, a group that is
	        bonded primarily through shared endeavors, goals, and practices and not shared
	        race, gender, nation, ethnicity, or culture.</i> <i>WolfQuest</i>&#39;s affinity
	        group began to form even before the game launched and has far exceeded our
	        hopes in making both multiplayer and discussion forums into vital components of
	        the project.</li>
        </ul>
	    <p>Gee&#39;s work focuses on high-budget commercial video games,
		      which bear limited resemblance to the simple games and game-like quizzes,
		      puzzles, and other interactives most often developed by museums. Indeed, this
		      was another of our goals for <i>WolfQuest</i>: to develop a game complex
		      and sophisticated enough to incorporate Gee&#39;s learning principles. In doing so,
		      we hoped it would also be sufficiently sophisticated (functionally and visually)
		      to compete with commercial games for the attention of our primary audience of
        ‘tween and teenage gamers. </p>
	    <h3><i>WolfQuest</i>: Game, Community, and Network</h3>
	    <p><i>WolfQuest</i> has three components that work
		      together to reach and engage our primary audience of 9-15 year old game-playing
        youth. </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li><b>Game</b>: In an immersive
	        3D game environment, players take on the role of a lone dispersal wolf in
	        Yellowstone National Park trying to find a mate, or in multiplayer mode, join a
	        wolf pack made up of friends or other players.  Through trial and error,
	        instinct, and experience, players must learn how to hunt elk, cooperate with
	        packmates, interact with stranger wolves, and compete with scavengers. Gameplay
	        is designed to encourage players to exercise critical thinking and inquiry
	        skills as they develop successful strategies, and develop a strong emotional
	        connection with wolves, influencing their attitudes toward wolves and habitat
	        conservation in the real world. </li>
	      <li><b>On-line Community</b>:
	        The <i>WolfQuest</i> game serves as a catalyst for a self-sustaining
	        community of learners. Discussion forums (a standard feature of videogame
	        sites) foster social learning amongst players as they share their experiences
	        with wolves and nature inside and outside of the game, strategies and tips for
	        playing the game, game-inspired art and stories, and tangential discussions
	        typical of any affinity group. The discussion forums also connect players with
	        wolf experts, allowing for exchange of information and questions outside of the
	        game. The <i>WolfQuest </i>Web site also offers background
	        information about wolf ecology and conservation, and educational materials for
	        classroom use. </li>
	      <li><b>National Network</b>: <i>WolfQuest</i>&#39;s
	        impact is greatly expanded by a network of zoos and similar institutions
	        involved in wolf education and conservation. All of these promote the game on
	        their Web sites and in local marketing efforts to extend the reach of the
	        project. Each also offers on-site wolf-related programming to entice players to
	        visit and experience wolves in the real world. </li>
        </ul>

	    <p class="caption">Fig 1: Screenshot from <i>WolfQuest</i> game</p>
	    <h3>Topic-centric, not institution-centric</h3>
	    <p>Unlike most on-line museum projects, we intended the game to
		      have its own identity, with its own domain name, rather than branding it within
		      the Minnesota Zoo&#39;s identity. Our rationale was partly hubristic (thinking we
		      could create a game worthy of its own brand) and partly altruistic: we wanted
		      to share the game with zoos around the country. By letting them feature the
		      game on their own Web sites and market the game to their regions, they might
		      then attract game-players to their own on-site wolf programming. Each partner
		      institution has its own branded URL (e.g. <a href="../http://nationalzoo.wolfquest.org/">nationalzoo.wolfquest.org</a>) that
		      features information about its own wolf exhibits and programming along with the
		      regular sections about the game, wolf ecology, and the on-line community. As a
		      result, <i>WolfQuest</i> has a much weaker association with the
		      Minnesota Zoo than the typical on-line museum project, and zoo visitation that
		      directly results from the game is likely too small to measure. (In fact, we
		      haven&#39;t even tried to measure it.) The project is topic-centric rather than
		      institution-centric, since our goal is for players to extend their learning
        beyond the game in any type of wolf- or nature-related experiences.</p>
	    <h2>Audience Impact</h2>
	    <p>The first measure of success of a learning game is: Does
		      anyone want to play it? <i>WolfQuest </i>has succeeded on that level. The
		      game launched on December 21, 2007 to an unexpectedly attentive audience. About
		      4,000 users downloaded the game in the first few hours after launch, bringing
		      down the server and requiring a midnight switch to a dedicated server to handle
		      the load. In the 14 months since the game launched, over 250,000 people have
		      downloaded the game.  Players initiate or join over 30,000 multiplayer
		      game sessions per month. The game’s on-line community has over 37,000
		      registered members who have made nearly 600,000 posts to the forum, with a
		      current average of 1,200 posts daily. Players have even created their own
		      gameplay videos and posted them on YouTube (over 350 to date). The game
        has definitely found, and retained, an audience.</p>
	    <p>Of course, the ultimate measure of success is: Do players
		      learn anything close to what the developers intended them to learn? <i>WolfQuest</i> ambitiously promised not only to fuse the real world of wolf biology with
		      addictive gameplay, but to teach players something substantive about wolves as
		      well, to inspire players to think about larger issues of wolf and wildlife
		      conservation, and ultimately to engage in real-world conservation behaviors
		      like visiting a zoo or nature center. Our summative evaluation finds that those
        things are indeed occurring.</p>
	    <p>In a summative evaluation of on-line resources, sampling is
		      always a concern.  For this evaluation, we took a mixed-methods approach,
		      employing three different methodologies:  a large-scale Web-based survey,
		      telephone interviews of players, and content analysis of the forum
		      discussions.  The vast majority of the data presented in this paper is
		      from the Web-based survey.  Our main evaluation goal was to determine
        whether playing <i>WolfQuest</i>, and visiting the Web site and/or forum:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>increased knowledge of, and interest and attitudes towards
	        wolves;</li>
	      <li>increased intended or actual wolf-related conservation behaviors;
	        and</li>
	      <li>supported or reinforced scientific habits of mind.</li>
        </ul>
	    <h3>Evaluation Sample</h3>
	    <p>Web survey participants were recruited through invitations
		      posted on the <i>WolfQuest</i> Web site and community forum, and in the
		      17,000-subscriber <i>WolfQuest</i> newsletter. While the Web site and
		      forum links bias the sample to current and devoted players, the newsletter
		      reached youth who may not have played the game for many months, and helped
		      balance the sample toward a broader range of players. There were 964 valid responses
		      received to the on-line survey, representing players from every state in the
		      union and 48 other countries.  (The US and Canada accounted for just over
		      75% of the survey respondents; 63% of all <i>WolfQuest</i> players reside in
		      the US and Canada.)  The game successfully reached the target audience, as
		      67.2% of the participants were ages 9-15, and another 17.4% were 16-18.  A
		      total of 85.6% of the respondents were age 18 or under.  Median age was 14
        years old.</p>
	    <p>Respondents were daily video game players, including 51.3%
		      of the target 9-15- year-olds who were daily computer or video game
		      players.  According to the Pew Internet and the American Life Project, 50%
		      of American teens age 12-17 and 21% of adults over age 18 play computer or
        video games daily. (Lenhard et al., 2008, MacGill, 2008)</p>

	    <p>There is a significant literature emerging on the appeal of
		      gaming and the different types of game players (see the Bartle
		      Test: <a href="../http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_Test">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_Test</a>). While not central to the
		      evaluation itself, we were curious to see how <i>WolfQuest</i> players would be
		      defined within established typologies of game players. Using Bartle’s taxonomy
		      of game-players (1996), we asked participants to pick a statement, based on
		      Bartle’s work, which best matched how they play computer or video games. Each
		      of these statements links with a type of player, as can be seen in Table 3
		      below. While Bartle recognizes that these traits are “stereotypes” and that any
		      individual player may embody multiple traits in multiple settings, it is
		      revealing that overwhelmingly <i>WolfQuest</i> players described themselves as
		      Explorers. Intuitively, it makes sense that <i>WolfQuest</i> would appeal
		      to this type of gamer; it is not a first-person shooter, and while there are
		      goals to achieve, it is not a game with a significant emphasis on levels or points.
		      This is an important point for institutions that are concerned that today’s
        youth only respond to first-person shooter games.</p>

	    <h3>Knowledge Increase</h3>
	    <p>In monitoring the <i>WolfQuest</i> forums, it was clear that the game had a following of individuals who were
		      passionately devoted to wolves. While it is possible to change the knowledge,
		      attitudes and behaviors of those who were already wolf devotees, we wanted to
		      find out how the game affected players with less initial interest in wolves. In
		      the Web survey, we asked individuals to self-rate their knowledge of wolves,
		      their behaviors, and their habitats prior to playing <i>WolfQuest.</i> A significant number of individuals (42%) rated their
		      wolf knowledge as experienced or expert, but as a whole, the rating for
        pre-knowledge fell along a rough normal curve.</p>

	    <p>To see whether these claims of higher knowledge were true,
		      we asked participants a variety of questions about wolves, including what specifically
		      they had learned about wolves from the game. Participants provided a range of
		      up to five responses related to habitats, hunting behaviors, territories and
		      threats to wolf survival, social behaviors, and other wolf facts related to the
		      anatomy and species of wolves. Out of a representative subsample of individuals
		      who took the survey (n=280), 198 individuals responded to this open-ended
		      question. Only 3% of those respondents indicated that they did not learn
        anything new from playing the game. Sample responses to this question include:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"><i> &#34;</i>Hunting is actually quite difficult. Wolves have
        to contend with other predators. Wolves don&#39;t always eat their entire kill.”</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">“Aggressive behavior varies from pack to pack. Taking down an elk alone
		      is hard. Grizzly bears are a big threat to wolves. Howling can call your mate to
        you. Wolves are good jumpers.”</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">“Wolves are very social. They need large hunting grounds.”</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> “Wolves have to eat alot in order to live. Look for weak prey. Don&#39;t
		      mess with Grizzlies. Wolves must travel far to survive. A wolf can survive on an
        elk for days.”</p>
	    <p><i>WolfQuest</i> had an impact on the learning of the
		      majority of players (n=182 of this subsample of 280), with evidence found by
        both specific and general recall of facts and knowledge (See Table 6).</p>

	    <p>Players also reported a stronger emotional attachment to

		      felt the game made them more emotionally connected to wolves. Emotional
		      connection had a statistically significant negative correlation with incoming
		      self-ranked knowledge, so that individuals who ranked themselves as experienced
		      or expert were less likely to report that <i>WolfQuest</i> increased their connection to wolves. This is an expected finding, as these
		      individuals were likely to feel highly connected to wolves prior to playing the
        game.</p>

	    <p>One ten-year-old, self-ranked as previously a novice, said
		      when asked why  s/he felt more connected to wolves, “I know more about them, I
		      used to think wolves were mean and ugly from movies, but now I know what they
        are like and I feel more like I can help them to survive in this world.”</p>
	    <h3>Scientific Habits of Mind</h3>
	    <p>One of the key evaluation questions regarding <i>WolfQuest</i> is about the use of critical thinking skills throughout the game. As mentioned
		      earlier in this paper, James Gee and others have discussed the skills involved
		      in and supported by good gameplay. Steinkuehler and Duncan (2008) have applied
		      the concept of scientific habits of mind (including, for example, model-based
		      testing, social construction of knowledge, and use of evidence) to the
		      commercial game <i>World of Warcraft</i>. Their analysis was based on forum
		      postings within the game. While we are currently analyzing <i>WolfQuest</i> forum posts using a version of the Steinkuehler and Duncan coding categories,
		      we also directly asked participants what sort of challenges they faced within
		      the game and how they overcame those challenges.  Though this data is
		      preliminary, respondents showed clear evidence of scientific habits of mind
		      throughout their responses. They made predictions about what hunting and
		      mate-finding strategies might work, tested those predictions, analyzed the
		      results, using observation and note-taking skills, and collaborated with others
		      to devise new techniques. All of these responses support the extensive,
		      systematic use of scientific habits of mind throughout the playing of <i>WolfQuest</i>.
        Participants responded with statements such as:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"><i>“</i>Well, at first, I was a very terrible hunter. I mean. I was pitiful. I couldn&#39;t
		      even take down the weakest elk in the herd, even WHEN I had a mate! It was a very
		      sad sight to see. Well, to overcome such a problem, I just kinda practiced. And
		      watched a few videos that people had made. And... Well, I made a few observations
		      myself. And you know what... it worked! I kinda just practiced, watched my status
        bars and stuff, took notes.”</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">“I had to overcome speed, and the trouble with the social behavior. I also
		      had to keep up with hunting, and trying not to die. Survival of the fittest. I tested
		      being dominant over the stranger wolves, and how to save energy for hunting. Once
        I found a mate, everything got easier and more easier.”</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> “To use the right body language to kill/ make friends with other wolves.
		      Knowing which reply to make is important–never give the other wolf a chance to attack.
		      Hunting elk–never run full charge willy-nilly at the whole herd. Wait until one
        is separate. Try different things and record what data worked best.”</p>
	    <p><i> </i>Some players used the multiplayer mode
        specifically to address game challenges. </p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"><i> “</i>Well, I also took a bunch of information and
		      tips from my friends. I watched them hunt the elk, and saw their strategies.
		      And combined them, along with what I saw on the videos and from my own observations,
        together to make my own awesome strategy to hunt.”</p>
	    <h3>Wolf-Related Behavior change</h3>
	    <p>Within the scope of the Web survey, we asked players what
		      sort of activities and behavior they engaged in as a result of their <i>WolfQuest </i>experience.
		      Behavior change is a notoriously difficult outcome to achieve for many
		      projects, so we designed our survey to solicit both actual activities and the
		      intention to do those activities, with follow-up currently underway to parse
        the difference and distinguish any overreporting (Friedman, 2008).</p>
	    <p>Overall, large percentages of players showed intentions of
		      doing other wolf-related activities, including such further explorations of
        wolves on the Internet, in books and on television.</p>

	    <p>These percentages are high enough to raise concerns about
		      overstating the impact of the game, yet the commentary from the players when
		      asked to list any other activities they had done due to <i>WolfQuest</i> demonstrates
		      their deep connection to the game. It is enormously difficult to represent the
		      variety of answers in just a few quotes; Table 9 below shows some of their
		      responses (and includes age and incoming self-rated knowledge level). The
		      variation in incoming knowledge level shows that even those individuals who
		      considered themselves to be “beginners” in terms of wolf knowledge before
		      playing the game aspired to, or had already engaged in, significant activities
        and expressions of values about wolves as a result of the game.</p>
	    <p>In addition, the more that individuals played the game, the more likely they were to report
		      doing or intending to do the above behaviors. Only two activities - creating a
		      wildlife friendly backyard garden and visiting a nature center, state park, or
		      wilderness area to see wildlife - did not show statistically significant
		      differences between casual players and those that played <i>WolfQuest</i> more

        <p class="captionTable">Table 9:  What Other Wolf Activities Have You Done Due
        to Playing WolfQuest? </p>
	    <h2>Learning from <i>WolfQuest</i></h2>
	    <p>While the evaluation is still underway, these initial
		      results show that <i>WolfQuest</i> has been highly successful in all three
		      areas under review - increasing knowledge of, and interest and attitudes
		      towards wolves, increasing intended or actual wolf-related conservation
		      behaviors, and supporting or reinforcing scientific habits of mind. These
		      results should allay fears and skepticism (encountered during <i>WolfQuest</i> development) of some environmental educators over the use of a videogame as a
		      tool for science learning. In our experience, other professionals within the
		      field have articulated concerns that young players do not, as a rule,
		      significantly engage with a game if the game has a clear educational agenda.
        These fears can also be laid to rest. </p>
	    <p>While we recognized the above fears and concerns, we did not
		      share them. Instead, we had an entirely different set of concerns and
		      expectations as we began development in 2006. Some of these were based on
		      our prior experience, while others drew on work by Gee and other researchers.
		      As always, actual experience bore out some of our expectations while taking us
        by surprise in other ways. </p>
	    <h3>Some Expectations Confirmed...</h3>
	    <ul>
	      <li><span class="Heading3Char"><b>Wolves
	        are a good match for action gameplay</b>.</span> Not every topic of importance
	        to a museum, zoo, or aquarium is suitable for a game. Because games employ an
	        underlying system of rules, subject domains in science and history (which
	        follow the rules of nature and society) generally present more natural topics
	        for game design than art, with its emphasis on expression and
	        interpretation. We expected wolves to be an ideal subject for a game. In
	        fact, we chose wolves for that very reason. Wolves live the lives of action
	        heroes - exploring and defending territories, attacking elk, skirmishing with
	        grizzly bears, and sneaking onto cattle ranches. While the actual game design
	        required a great deal of work to balance game mechanics and content accuracy,
	        the overall outline of the game came easily and meshed well with established
	        audience expectations for gameplay. </li>
	      <li><span class="Heading3Char"><b>Modern
	        software allows small teams to produce compelling, commercial-grade games.</b></span> Our original plan was to use Shockwave 3D for a browser-based game, but by the
	        time the National Science Foundation awarded us the grant, we had upgraded our
	        plan and ambitions by adopting Unity, a powerful new software authoring and
	        publishing tool for game development. With Unity, a small team can produce a
	        sophisticated and gorgeous game. Our core development team (project director,
	        coordinator, game producer, game designer, programmer, visual designer, and of
	        these only the coordinator was full-time on the project), plus outsourced 3D
	        artists, was large enough to produce several hours of high-quality gameplay and
	        visual assets.</li>
	      <li><span class="Heading3Char"><b>Go
	        where the kids are</b>. </span>Having defined our audience as
	        &#34;game-playing youth age 9-15,&#34; we deliberately avoided traditional
	        museum outreach channels to youth, such as teachers. Instead, we wanted to plant
	        our flag directly in youth-centric digital culture. The game itself is the most
	        obvious product of this approach. To attract players, we used both traditional
	        and viral marketing. By far the most successful marketing happened virally,
	        entirely outside of our control. Our two-minute teaser video, developed for
	        fundraising and put on the <i>WolfQuest </i>Web site long before the game
	        launch, caught the attention of several gaming Web sites, and was soon featured
	        (albeit with some mockery) on the popular cable TV program &#34;Attack of the
	        Show.&#34; Nearly overnight, our site traffic skyrocketed, jumping from
	        500,000 hits in July 2007 (mainly from our active forum members) to nearly 10
	        million the following month - still five months before the game
	        launched. Clearly, we had succeeded in reaching youth on their home
	        territory.</li>
	      <li><span class="Heading3Char"><b>Ancillary
	        activities are essential elements in the game-based learning process</b>. </span>Many
	        of Gee&#39;s principles involve activities outside of the game itself, most notably
	        in discussion forums where players share knowledge and experiences with their
	        affinity group. The game mechanics allow a variety of hunting and survival
	        strategies, few of which are explained in the official documentation so as to
	        encourage on-line discussions about them. While we were certainly lucky to have
	        an enthusiastic community form spontaneously around the game, we actively
	        focused their discussions on both gameplay and larger issues of wolves in the
	        wild. This soon made the forum into the most effective pedagogical component of
	        the entire project. Along with discussions about wolves and the game, the
	        forum allows users to explore wolves in other ways, such as by sharing original
	        artworks (over 450 pieces submitted) and stories about wolves.</li>
	      <li><span class="Heading3Char"><b>Games
	        can influence subsequent behavior</b>. </span>Behavioral impacts are
	        notoriously difficult to achieve, but we believed that a good game can be
	        compelling enough to affect subsequent behavior. Initially these goals were
	        modest: we hoped players would learn more about wolves from the Web, books, TV
	        programs, and by visiting their local zoo. During development, we made
	        behavioral outcomes a primary goal and developed a list of conservation
	        behaviors based on current research in the field. We expected only a small
	        percentage of players to exhibit these behavioral outcomes, but our initial
	        summative results indicate the game and community do influence the behavior of
	        some players in exciting ways. </li>
        </ul>
	    <h3>...And Some Surprises</h3>
	    <p>The unexpected is inevitable in a project of this scope and
        complexity. What surprised us most during development?</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li><span class="Heading3Char"><b>3D
	        games are very, very hard to make.</b></span> Despite a decade of experience
	        developing digital learning games and interactives, we recognized from the
	        start that <i>WolfQuest</i> would be more challenging than any previous
	        project. Yet we still underestimated the difficulty. While we had dabbled in 3D
	        previously, creating a fully-realized 3D world was a crash course in polygons,
	        textures, shaders, and the myriad graphics capabilities of computers, all of
	        which require mastery in order to create a 3D world that runs on the majority
	        of home computers. Furthermore, designing and programming a robust ecological
	        simulation, complete with artificial intelligence and gameplay code to
	        accommodate untold combinations of user choices, requires a level of software
	        architecture and design that we had not previously produced. And finally,
	        shifting from Shockwave to Unity tempted us into a dramatic upgrade in
	        production values, well beyond what we had designed our budget to accommodate.
	        For all these reasons, by the time we launched the final game update in July
	        2008, we had gone 40% over our $275,000 game development budget. Not only was
	        this painful financially, but it also constrained our ability to further polish
	        and support the game.</li>
	      <li><span class="Heading3Char"><b>Suspension
	        of disbelief is a fragile thing</b>. </span>We designed the 3D game world and
	        ecological simulation, both visually and behaviorally, to create a suspension
	        of disbelief in the player. This was a departure from our 2D Flash games, which
	        have a sufficient level of abstraction to allow many shortcuts, from iconic
	        representations of real-world entities to popup windows that explain what is
	        too difficult, time consuming, or just plain expensive to show. We had few such
	        shortcuts available in our 3D world. If an elk did not react naturalistically
	        to an approaching wolf, we could not distract the user with a popup window. If
	        the foreground grass did not blend seamlessly to the surrounding skybox, we
	        could not cover it up with a convenient graphic design element. Suspension of
	        disbelief, a basic expectation of players in a 3D game world, is laboriously
	        created, yet easily fractured, and it took hundreds of hours of fine-tuning to
	        achieve a reasonably believable world. </li>
          <li><span class="Heading3Char"><b>On-line
	        communities are waiting to form around some topics</b>.</span> Perhaps the most
	        astonishing aspect of <i>WolfQuest</i> has been the audience response, which
	        surpassed our highest hopes. We knew that wolves, as charismatic megafauna,
	        held a strong appeal for our audience, but we did not expect an affinity group
	        to come knocking even before launch. This group formed when a few teenagers saw
	        an early press release from the Minnesota Zoo and posted links to our site on <i>Zoo
	          Tycoon</i> and <i>My Little Pony</i> game forums. By July 2007, five months
	        before our scheduled launch, we had lively discussions on our developer&#39;s blog
	        (<a href="../http://www.wolfquest.org/wordpress">http://www.wolfquest.org/wordpress</a>). One blog post, about our struggle to
	        balance fantasy and reality in the game design, prompted 347 comments. Given
	        this response, we launched the <i>WolfQuest </i> discussion forum ahead of
	        schedule. It quickly became a true on-line community, with users around the
	        world befriending each other, encouraging each other, and discussing subjects
	        of shared interest. In the 20 months since its launch, users (primarily between
	        ages 10 and 17) have made nearly 600,000 posts on 15,000 threads. <br/>
            <br/>
            Despite this success, we recognize the challenges of creating a thriving
	        on-line community on many topics. We have worked on many projects that sought but
	        failed to create such a community. We believe it is essential to identify and
	        attract an existing affinity group, rather than attempt to create one from
	        scratch. With <i>WolfQuest</i>, such a group had materialized in the forums of
	        other animal-centric games, but <i>WolfQuest</i> gave them a new place to call
	        home. Such groups, especially among youth, do not exist for many subjects of
	        importance to museums. Thus, a compelling game becomes even more important as
	        an attractor and catalyst for an on-line community. </li>
	      <li><span class="Heading3Char"><b>On-line
		      communities require substantial care and feeding</b>.</span> While our
		      community formed spontaneously and is in some ways self-sustaining, it would
		      not be a successful community of <i>learning</i> without the countless hours
		      our project coordinator has spent guiding on-line discussions, posting
		      provocative research findings on wolf ecology and conservation, and ensuring
		      that discussions remain healthy and safe for our youth audience. Managing
		      this community takes 15-20 hours a week. In addition to facilitating productive
		      discussions, she also must approve new users, discipline and expel users acting
		      inappropriately or &#34;trolling,&#34; and manage the team of 18 volunteer
		      moderators recruited to handle the forums during the remaining 140 hours a
		      week. Without this constant effort, the forum would drift off-topic into
		      discussions of videogame releases, favorite science fiction novels and the
		      like. Our project coordinator has also been forced into the role of teen
		      counselor, mediating on-line disputes between users and handling two cases of
		      users with announced suicidal intentions. The importance of this job was never
		      clearer than in the fall of 2008, when our first coordinator left for
		      another job. In the two-month interim until we hired a new coordinator, when
		      the forum was lightly moderated, the quality and educational value of the
        on-line discussions noticeably declined. </li>
	      <li><span class="Heading3Char"><b>Real
		      gameplay encourages replay</b>.</span> Many educational &#34;games&#34;
	      (including many of our projects) would more accurately be called
	      &#34;game-like content delivery interactives.&#34; As such, they do not
		      encourage replay, since the experience will be nearly identical each time. <i>WolfQuest</i> offers true gameplay: players interact with a dynamic system that responds to
		      their actions based on an underlying ruleset. As such, each game session is
		      different, encouraging replay. With our budget restrictions, we were able to
		      create only a two- or three-hour game arc. Naturally, this limits the game’s
		      replay value, since there are not <i>that</i> many different things that a
		      player can do. And yet, to our surprise, our summative evaluation found that
		      two-thirds of non-first-time players report playing the game more than ten
		      times. More importantly, the evaluation also found that replay positively
		      correlates to learning outcomes, making replay an indicator not just of a
        successful game, but of an effective learning game. </li>
	      <li><span class="Heading3Char"><b>Devotion
		      cuts both ways</b>.</span> It&#39;s extremely gratifying to have a core of
		      dedicated players, but their devotion has unexpectedly produced more work on
		      our end, particularly for our project coordinator. These players assume that
		      they have a significant voice in the project. On the forum, they make long
		      lists of new gameplay and content requests and foment rumors to the
		      point of raising unrealistic expectations. Managing their enthusiasm requires a
		      delicate balance of encouragement and reality checks. And many players’
	      enthusiasm exceeded their computer skills or the quality of their computer
	      hardware. Thus a significant number of project resources was devoted to
	      technical support that was not strictly part of the learning mandate of the
	      project, but which was required to keep players happy. And, in spite of the
	      fact that the game was free, because of the quality of the visual assets and
	      gameplay, users did in fact compare it to commercial games that cost ten or
	      twenty times our budget. In the event of technical problems, this
		      comparison was seldom favorable, although we were also surprised at the number
		      of players with underpowered computers who were willing to endure extremely poor
        game performance in order to play the game at all.</li>
	      <li><span class="Heading3Char"><b>Games
		      know no borders</b>.</span> Our hope during development was to reach a
		      nationwide audience. We took geography into account when recruiting our
		      National Network of zoos, ensuring that we had partners in every region of the
		      country. This effort succeeded: the top states for game downloads are
		      California, Minnesota, Texas, Florida, and New York. But we gave no real
		      thought to the audience beyond the United States, so we were surprised to see
		      that nearly half - 44% - of all players lived outside the US. For the most
		      part, this is simply proof of the global appeal of both games and wolves, but
		      it also demonstrates the potential to further expand this global audience
		      through localization (the software industry&#39;s term for language and cultural
        translations). </li>
	      <li><span class="Heading3Char"><b>It&#39;s
		      the players&#39; game, we only created it.</b> </span>The passionate response to
		      the game reveals an existing desire for a wolf role-playing game. During
		      development, we had on-line discussions with players about the balance between
		      fantasy and reality, to make clear our intent with the game. Many players came
		      to appreciate and value scientific accuracy in the gameplay, but many others
		      simply decided to use the game in their own ways in their multiplayer role-play
		      sessions (role-playing being a particular kind of open-ended gameplay that
		      is more narrative in orientation than the strict simulation we have enforced
		      with <i>WolfQuest</i>&#39;s design). Since the game’s wolf characters are
		      limited to actual wolf behaviors, most of the interaction in these sessions is
		      through the in-game chat system. These players spin fantastic tales of their
		      wolf-lives and adventures far beyond the scope of either the game or biological
		      realism. We accept this usage (since we can&#39;t prevent it), hoping that it
		      deepens players&#39; connection to wolves. Of course, this behavior is hardly
		      unique to <i>WolfQuest</i>. Turning digital and social media to one&#39;s own
		      purposes is typical human behavior. But museums must realize that a game, like
		      anything else they make available, is &#34;theirs&#34; only until they
		      release it on the world. At that point, people will take ownership of it,
        making it theirs in ways that the developers never foresaw or intended. </li>
	    </ul>
	    <h2>Whither <i>WolfQuest</i>?</h2>
	    <p>We released the final update to <i>WolfQuest Episode 1:
		      Amethyst Mountain Deluxe,</i> in July 2008. We had always planned on at least
		      one more episode, and finally obtained sufficient private funding for it in
		      fall 2008. <i>Episode 2: Slough Creek</i>, which will feature the most popular
		      player request - pups, is currently in development, to launch in summer 2009.
		      We are also completing the summative evaluation, conducting telephone
		      interviews with players and doing content analysis of forum discussions, to
		      better understand the project&#39;s learning outcomes. Our funding provides for a
		      half-time project coordinator through the summer of 2010, to keep the forum
        healthy and focused for a full year after release of Episode 2. </p>
	    <p>At that point, WolfQuest will have had a good run and we
		      developers may be ready to retire the project. But our community will likely
		      think otherwise. Thus, part of our challenge this year is to develop a
		      sustainability plan. Can we train teenaged moderators to manage the forum into
		      the future? Some commercial games, abandoned by their makers, have been adopted
		      by an on-line community and sustained for many years, but our &#39;tween and
		      teenaged audience makes this option problematic. (For example, one of many
		      things that our coordinator does is review faxed parental permission forms for
		      forum registration, to comply with COPPA). Can we find inexpensive hosting for
		      the site? (The forum traffic alone requires a dedicated server, costing $1,000
		      annually.) Or do we simply shut down the on-line forum - perhaps the most
		      effective pedagogical component of the project - and convert to a static site
        where new players can only read about wolves and download the game? </p>
	    <p>Whatever its ultimate fate, <i>WolfQuest</i> has already
		      given us a glimpse of the potential for free choice game-based learning. By
		      engaging youth in their leisure time and inspiring them to continue their
		      learning beyond the game, it demonstrates one way to employ popular media
		      genres and technology to further our educational goals. Not every project will
		      be as well-suited to game-based learning, or have as dramatic outcomes, but it
		      is clear that it is possible to create a credible, real-world game that can
        successfully compete in the entertainment media landscape.</p>
