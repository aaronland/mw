        <p class="AbstractText">This case study examines
    the establishment of a wiki for The Quilt Index, a public and scholarly
    resource on quilts built through participation of contributors, including
    museums and libraries that hold quilts, quilt documentation records, and other
    quilt related materials in their collections. The paper presents the results of
    project planning, technical installation and customization, pilot set up and
    initial content population; also finding an information structure that works
    for audience needs, networking with community individuals and organizations, identifying
    the learning curve and providing training for the userbase, launch and
    response. This case study of a wiki addition to an on-line collection will be
    valuable to any museum professional in the process of or interested in
    launching a wiki on an institution’s Web site. </p>

  <h2>About <i>The Quilt Index</i></h2>
  <p><i>The Quilt Index</i> (<a href="../http://www.quiltindex.org/">http://www.quiltindex.org</a>) is a partnership project of The Alliance for
    American Quilts (AAQ), MATRIX: The Center for Humane Arts, Letters, and Social
    Sciences Online (MATRIX) and Michigan State University Museum (MSU Museum). It is providing unprecedented access to extensive
    documentation on quilts and quiltmaking that now exists in a variety of
    locations and media: in museums and archives, in public and private
    collections, on paper survey forms, and in varied electronic formats. Utilizing
    the benefits of a distributed repository system and a comprehensive controlled
    vocabulary for descriptive metadata, <i>The
      Quilt Index</i> is a pioneering digital repository addressing the need to
    balance centralized information access with preservation of local variation. In
    particular, <i>The Quilt Index</i> provides
    wide access to information geographically dispersed and, in many cases,
    inaccessible due to location or fragility. The raw material of a significant
    portion of the database is not the objects themselves, but the <i>information about quilts and images of
      quilts </i>found in public quilt collections, private collections, and the
    myriad of state and regional quilt documentation projects. </p>

    Quilt Index</i> (<a href="../http://www.quiltindex.org/">http://www.quiltindex.org</a>)</p>
  <p>Developed with major funding from the National Endowment
    for the Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Quilt
    Index will, by the end of 2010, have documentation for over 50,000 quilts and
    thousands of quilt-related ephemera drawn from over 27 public and private
    collections. Through <i>the Quilt Index</i> it is becoming possible to locate, reference, and search quilt materials
    easily, thus creating a significant resource for users. The project management
    team is now dedicated to the continued expansion of digital content and the
    development of a rich array of secondary user tools that will substantially
    increase the effectiveness of on-line museum and library resources for
    research, teaching and learning. Specifically, we are enriching the content of
    the Quilt Index digital repository by</p>
  <ul>
    <li>introducing innovative tools to work with the objects in the
      repository, </li>
    <li>training scholars and
      educators who are building on-line exhibits, multimedia presentations, lesson
      plans, and other resources that will become a part of the public Web site, and </li>
    <li>building a rich array
      of social networking features around the Index to enrich and augment its
      usefulness for individuals and groups of users.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><i>The Quilt Index</i> collections form the seed of what is growing into an extensive network of
    digital documentation, images, and aggregate information, as well as K-12
    curricula materials, on-line exhibits, and forums for scholarly exchange. It is
    also beginning to serve as a national leadership model for on-line access to
    material-specific collections. We have, in fact, already been
    contacted by other groups, interested in indexing dolls, baskets, and
    embroidered samplers, who have used the Index’s extensive documentation to
    develop their own projects. We have also been contacted by and have
    consulted with organizations and individual researchers who have wanted to use
    the Quilt Index comprehensive fields at the initiation of their research and data
    cataloguing projects.</p>
  <h2><i>The
    Quilt Index</i> Community of
    Users</h2>
  <p>A recent study reveals that more than 25 million
    individuals in the United States are considered part of the quilt world. Around
    the globe there are significant collections of quilts and a growing number of
    quiltmakers, quilt documentation projects, and exhibitions. This quilt world
    includes makers, collectors and owners of quilts, producers and marketers of quilt fabric and quiltmaking tools, artists,
    educators, scholars, curators, and collection managers. <i>The Quilt Index</i>, for the first time, makes it possible for
    researchers, students, quilt makers, genealogists, and a wide public audience
    to easily locate, reference, and search quilt documentation data. Scholars from
    a variety of fields, including art history and criticism; women’s studies;
    cultural studies; folklife studies; material culture studies; textile history;
    racial and ethnic studies; political and religious history; American social
    history; and state, regional, national, and international studies are able to
    use this information as primary, documentary source materials. With the
    establishment of a critical mass of content data and a growing roster of tools
    and resources on the Index, the resource has been attracting users from around
    the world who are drawing upon the Index for a range of scholarly, creative,
    and educational purposes across many professional disciplines. Analysis of user
    data statistics indicates an extensive international audience, especially in
    Europe (Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands) and Australia, as well as
    significant traffic from other cultures; in one month traffic from Italy dwarfed use from the US. There is even regular,
    considerable, access by the US military (Cohen, 2008).</p>
  <h2>Opening <i>The Quilt Index</i> to a Community of Users: Social Networking</h2>
  <p>Based on internal
    analysis and feedback from user surveys, <i>The
      Quilt Index</i> management team knew that it needed to implement existing and
    new tools to engage both target and unexpected audiences to foster meaningful
    use and new contributions. <i>The
      Quilt Index</i> aims to be inclusive of the broad quilt community, yet the
    content control previous to this project had remained with <i>The Quilt Index</i> staff and with formal contributors who are content-providing partners with
    editorial control of their contributed records. Already the team had regularly posted information on <i>The Quilt Index</i> on listservs that had
    the highest known relevant audiences and had created a MySpace and Facebook presence
    for <i>The Quilt Index</i>. Yet while we
    knew that we were building audience awareness about the resources and that <i>The Quilt Index</i> was providing a space for people to gain unprecedented access to information, we also wanted to make
    a shift to empower users with the tools to contribute to that knowledge base.
    We understood that the success of social networking tools is based on the
    ability of users to contribute their own information to a topic area, the ease
    of their use, and the ability of users to access the thinking of other users
    with similar interests. It is this ability to create user-generated context
    around traditional repository materials and to support a multitude of
    perspectives about these topics that makes social networks a powerful application
    to strengthen the already vibrant network formed by the quilt community. </p>
  <p>This diverse and
    dispersed audience with passion for the content and with no centralized
    platform to share resources provides an ideal environment for community-based
    resource development using Web 2.0. As a first step, we created a <i>Quilt Index</i> wiki that we hoped would
    harness the commitment, knowledge, and grassroots spirit of the quilt research
    community into a public listing and sharing space for groups conducting quilt
    documentation. We envisioned a wiki that would allow members of the community
    to define quilt-related terms, people, or issues over time; would have terms
    that could be approached from multiple perspectives; and would become a
    valuable resource to the larger quilt community. However, there was also some
    hesitation. </p>
  <h2>Technical Information</h2>
  <p>Already <i>The Quilt Index</i> management team members were
    effectively using a wiki for internal project management. MATRIX technical
    staff created an opensource Mediawiki (<a href="../http://www.mediawiki.org/">http://www.mediawiki.org/</a>)
    powered site for organization-wide communication and a TRAC project management
    system (<a href="../http://trac.edgewall.org/">http://trac.edgewall.org</a>) integrated with
    Subversion for project-specific Web site development and staff communication
    about project needs. The internal <i>Quilt
      Index</i> staff use the TRAC site for tracking progress on each contributor and
    partner. However, the TRAC application and user permissions model is very
    specific for software development and Web site project management. Even among
    institutions that are contributing images and data to <i>the Quilt Index</i>, there is no need for detailed access to such technical and 
    administrative discussions.</p>
  <p>After reviewing a number of wiki applications for use on <i>The Quilt Index</i>, MediaWiki stood out as
    the best option. The basic framework is recognizable because it is so widely used
    (e.g., <i>Wikipedia</i>); the software is
    open source and freely available; the technical installation and set-up are
    very straightforward; and MATRIX is already using it in another context. After
    installing an instance of MediaWiki, all that needed to be
    done was to use CSS to style the wiki, which included the Quilt Index
    header and navigation. Technically the wiki is on a separate server, but
    practically for users moving between the wiki and the other <i>Quilt Index</i> site features, it is
    seamless through the navigation. </p>
  <h2>Information Organization and
    Populating Content: <i>The Quilt Index Wiki</i></h2>
  <p>Facing the installed and blank wiki, we had to determine
    how to organize information on it to serve our audience needs, provide a
    valuable resource, and utilize the potential for social networking and
    user-generated content. We worked as a staff team to
    identify several sets of resources both that we could initially use to populate
    the wiki and that would be immediately valuable to the user community. We also
    identified a staff member to serve as the “champion” or wiki-master, whose role
    would be to populate the first pages, communicate with potential
    wiki-contributors, and investigate uses of the wiki. </p>
  <p>The initial plan for structuring information in <i>The</i> <i>Quilt
    Index Wiki</i> included two pilot sets of resources: geographically-defined
    quilt documentation projects, and quilt-related oral histories. These two areas
    were identified gaps in available resources and were of general interest to
    researchers, to <i>The Quilt Index</i> management
    team and to those individuals and organizations that had led or contributed
    data to the documentation projects. Inquiries about quilt documentation
    projects frequently appeared on listserv discussions, at conference and
    professional meetings, and in communications to <i><span>The Quilt Index</span></i> staff: this indicated the need for
    centralized, up-to-date information on quilt documentation. However, we quickly
    realized that we should add a section on museums which had quilts in their collections, because this was also a frequent inquiry and
    discussion topic. This section would encompass one existing user group (i.e.
    the museums who were already contributors to the <i>Index</i>) as well as museums the management team had already
    identified as potential new contributing partners to the <i>Index</i>. For each section, we developed a template for the base page
    of information that would fit the information needs of users and would be easy for
    users to update. We populated the list with an initial set of information and
    developed a standard letter of invitation to send to <i>The Quilt Index’s</i> existing contributors to expand or
    update their listings. Then project team staff began sending out the letter to
    museums known to have quilt collections. This list of museums with base
    listings in the wiki continued to grow as <i>Quilt
      Index</i> staff came across references to additional quilt collections. Over
    130 invitations were sent out to institutions. In addition, announcements of
    the <i>Quilt Index</i> wiki were made on
    several listservs. This process not
    only added to the richness of the wiki, but also provided a means to expand
    links with other museum organizations and identify future partners. </p>
  <p>Almost immediately upon publicly launching the wiki, the
    administrative team began to make changes in the structure of the first set of
    categories and began proposing additional resources and sections for the wiki.
    Each suggested change was discussed within the administrative team and
    reflected the team’s collective knowledge about the quiltmaking and museum
    communities, current management needs of <i>The Quilt Index</i>, proposed future <i>Quilt Index</i> expansion priorities and
    possibilities, and in-house expertise about working with digital information
    and management of collection data. Some ideas - such as adding lists of
    curriculum materials, media projects and exhibitions or all quilt-related
    periodicals and publications - we put on hold for later inclusion or we
    determined might invite too much public editing and, hence, too much
    administrative oversight.</p>
  <p>At first we created one section titled Museums with
    Collections to encompass lists and information about quilt-holding institutions;
    we then added sections titled Libraries, Historical Societies, and Archives for
    additional institutions that held quilts or quilt-related ephemera. Our
    rationale for that organization was that most users would be seeking out
    sources that had more quilts than documentation, museums would be places more
    likely to host quilt exhibitions, and there would be fewer users interested in
    institutions holding just documentation. </p>
  <p>Again, we quickly embarked on an animated staff discussion
    on how all four types of institutions - historical societies, libraries,
    museums, and archives - may hold quilts and quilt-related ephemera and may also
    host exhibitions. Under the initial structure we realized that an institution
    might have to be listed under several categories – a task that would be
    frustrating for the contributor and the user of the information. We then
    discussed recasting the categories in terms of the contents, not the
    institution that holds them, and thus came up with the section headings now
    used. Before we made the change, however, we consulted with a digital archivist
    and digital librarian; both agreed that “simple is good” and “either structure
    would work, but that we should choose one structure and stick to it.” We
    decided on three main sections: Quilt Documentation Projects; Oral Histories;
    and a section first called museums, libraries, archives, historical societies, but
    then renamed Quilt Collections that encompassed all types of collection-holding
    institutions. Even though we realized that some collection holding institutions
    would have oral history collections or the records of quilt documentation
    projects, we decided to keep them in separate categories. We wanted to be able
    to see at a glance the full scope of the documentation projects, some of which
    were still in the hands of private individuals and/or the project teams. In
    many cases, quilt documentation projects are still active entities, not just archived
    material; thus, maintaining the quilt documentation projects as its own
    category within the wiki allows those who are interested in documenting quilts
    in their possession to determine who to contact. The oral histories were a
    targeted area of further <i>Quilt Index</i> project development, and it benefited <i>The</i> <i>Quilt Index</i> team to see information
    on them aggregated in one place. Under the Quilt Collections section, all
    collection-holding institutions were listed in alphabetical order.</p>
  <p>We toyed with the idea of having large institutions,
    institutions with major collections, or institutions that contributed to the
    Quilt Index be listed first in alphabetical order, and then smaller
    institutions listed second, again in alphabetical order, but we decided against
    this, wanting <i>The Quilt Index</i> wiki
    to give small institutions equal opportunity. After all, the wiki is a very
    democratic technology. </p>
  <p>This broad Quilt Collections category was a very good
    solution at first, but as the number of institutions grew, and especially as
    more and more institutions from outside the United States were added, it became
    very unwieldy; by October 2008, there were links to over 100 institutions from
    at least six countries on a single page. To address this, we rearranged the
    Quilt Collections and Quilt Documentation Projects pages to list institutions and
    projects by country, with all institutions from each country listed in
    alphabetical order under the country heading. This greatly improved the
    ‘contents’ navigation at the top of each page, giving users a much smaller, and
    arguably more useful, table of contents. In addition, this organization
    coincided with other important social and professional clusters of information
    by state. Tourists and quilt researchers could plan trips according to
    geographic region. Museums, for instance, have state associations, and it would
    be easy to see which museums in a state had like collections and might serve as
    a springboard for collective actions such as opportunities for economic
    development through cultural tourism. </p>
  <h2>Expansion of <i>The Quilt Index</i> Wiki
    Information Structure</h2>
  <p>One of <i>the Quilt
    Index</i> expansion ideas has been to do an in-depth project on one state or
    region in order  to answer the question: <i>Is there such a thing as a distinctively regional quilt?</i> A
    productive meeting with the executive director of the Michigan Museums
    Association in early December 2008 revealed that we could use <i>The Quilt Index</i> wiki to prepare for such
    a project;  simultaneously, it prompted a rethinking of our method
    of organizing information. We added an in-depth page listing Michigan quilt
    collections (museums, libraries and historical societies) to the wiki linked to
    ‘M’ on the ‘Quilt Collections in the U.S. The Michigan State University Museum
    was kept on that main ‘museums, libraries, archives, historical societies’ page,
    as well as added to the ‘Michigan quilt collections’ page because of its major
    institutional role in <i>The Quilt Index</i>,
    the Great Lakes Quilt Center and its extensive and important quilt collections.
    The Michigan quilt collections were originally arranged alphabetically, but
    because we knew that in Michigan information was accessed more frequently
    according to county designation, the change to county was accordingly made. Thus
    the wiki demonstrated the flexibility it has within its structure to
    accommodate local variation.</p>
  <p>Additional changes that were made included changing the
    navigation bard from the default setting, removing ‘Donations,’ populating
    ‘Help’ with content from the main page’s ‘Getting Started’ section, and adding
    links to ‘New Pages,’ ‘All Pages,’ and ‘Popular Pages’ as additional ways for
    users to navigate the growing amount of content on the wiki. An Email
    Discussion Lists section lists some of the primary listservs that are used by
    the growing international quilt community.</p>
  <p>Inspired by the positive change made by the
    re-organization of Michigan quilt collections page by county, we considered
    listing all of the institutions on the Quilt Collections page by state, rather
    than alphabetically. The argument for was that it might increase usability and
    potentially facilitate cultural tourism, a concern of museums
    as was pointed out by the director of the Michigan Museums Association.
    A counter-argument was that many users would not know in which state a
    particular institution is located - <i>e.g.,</i> where is the Kalona Quilt Museum, exactly? - and therefore we should preserve the alphabetical architecture. Listing by state
    would also have created the problem of where to put the growing number of
    international institutions. The differing perspectives were resolved by the
    creation of two sections with identical content about quilt collections in
    museums, libraries, archives, and historical societies, but different
    organizations: “Quilt Collections in the United States: by state” <i>and</i> “Quilt Collections in the United
    States: alphabetical.” The lists were revised placing the international quilt
    collections on a new International Quilt Collections list of the wiki, easily
    accessible from the main page. This solution has worked well and is the method
    of organizing information that is currently in place on the wiki. Almost
    exactly four months after population began, we finally had what will be for the
    foreseeable future, a stable and user-friendly way of structuring the growing
    body of information on the Quilt Index wiki.</p>
  <h2>Cultivating a Creative Community of Users</h2>
  <p>Once the population of the wiki content was well underway,
    we turned our attention to ways to use the wiki to build a creative community
    of users. One strategy was to use Mediawiki’s Community Portal to foster the
    development of collaborative exhibitions, possibly to show in the Quilt Index
    exhibit hall space. A trial project was launched to use the page to curate
    collectively an exhibit of crazy quilts from <i>The Quilt Index </i>in conjunction with the Alliance for American
    Quilt’s 2009 crazy-quilt themed annual contest. However, the community portal
    remains a very under-utilized space. We are currently investigating ways to
    increase utilization. During a <i>Quilt
      Index</i> training session with Michigan State University faculty, a discussion
    of potential class use of the community portal occurred. The potential of using
    the community portal as a place that classes can cultivate and present research
    projects, including virtual exhibits, utilizing the resources of <i>the Quilt Index</i> was raised. This potential
    use corresponds with Bowen’s suggestion that within a wiki there “can by any
    number of community and educational uses, such as the incremental accretion of
    knowledge by a group, or production of collaboratively edited materials”
    (Bowen, 2008).</p>
  <h2>Usability Issues</h2>
  <p>Much of <i>The Quilt Index’ </i>base of users is a lay, but knowledgeable, user community of quilters
    and quilt historians of various ages and levels of comfort with Web 2.0
    technologies such as wikis. Thus, usability has been a major concern from the
    beginning. As a guide to new users, the wiki includes a “getting started”
    section to guide new users through the process of contributing to the wiki. The
    wiki has 50 active users contributing to its pages. </p>
  <p>Any individual or
    institution with knowledge of quilt history, collections, documentation, or
    oral histories may create an account and contribute. We have come across a
    number of use challenges. One issue is the wide range of technical capacity in
    our user base. In response to the letter of invitation, some organizations
    almost immediately responded and edited their organization’s page. Others,
    however, were confused that we were inviting them to make their entire
    collections public, basically to become a contributing partner in <i>the Quilt Index</i>. We suspect this wide
    variation in responses underscores the variation in understanding Web
    technology generally and wiki technology in particular. This difference within
    Quilt Index users is highly correlated with previous experience using Web
    technologies.  </p>
  <p>There are some
    common problems with wikis that need to be monitored. For sites, like ours,
    that allow visitors to create usernames and add content, wiki-masters need to
    be vigilant for spam entries. This is easily monitored by
    viewing the recent changes on a daily basis. In addition, it is very
    easy for inexperienced users to create orphan pages by editing what appears to
    be the phrasing of a title heading. The wiki champion developed a regular site
    review that includes checking for orphaned pages.</p>
  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
  <p>Using the Quilt
    Index wiki as a case study, we believe we have learned some lessons that should
    prove valuable to museum professionals who are contemplating or actively
    planning a wiki. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather
      stakeholders to discuss initial organization of the wiki, but the staff must be
      prepared to be flexible and responsive to users. The site architecture will
      change as content is developed; however, the wiki environment of Mediawiki
      makes these changes easy to do and manage. </li>
    <li>Seed
      the site with valuable information that focuses on users and gaps in
      information that users can access.  </li>
    <li>Contact
      directly those interest groups that can help to populate the site. </li>
    <li>Perhaps
      most important, provide a wiki champion (or champions) to regularly monitor the
      site, help to facilitate its growth, and assist users during its initial
      development. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Much that we have
    learned in the creation, testing and implementation of this wiki is applicable
    for any museum Web site, whether the museum is large or small, and regardless
    of the type(s) of collections the museum holds.</p>
