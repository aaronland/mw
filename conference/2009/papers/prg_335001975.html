        <p class="AbstractText">In the fall of 2006, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts
    and Walker Art Center embarked on a large-scale redesign of their highly
    acclaimed Web site, ArtsConnectEd. Since its launch in 1998, ArtsConnectEd had
    become a core resource for K-12 educators and their students, serving well over
    a million users per year. </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">Despite its accomplishments, museum educators eventually
    wanted better tools for adding new content, creating links between assets, and
    managing their relationships with ArtsConnectEd’s audiences. Coupled with new
    opportunities provided by Web 2.0 technologies, the redesign project aimed to
    redefine how on-line educational resources are developed and managed. The new
    site, internally referred to as ArtsConnectEd2, is an open source, highly
    flexible environment with audience-specific toolsets for building, sharing, and
    managing internal and external user-generated content.</p>
  <p class="AbstractText">This paper will provide an overview of the research,
    design, and development strategies employed in the creation of ArtsConnectEd2,
    particularly focusing on the roles and products of the internal,
    cross-institutional, and external collaborative teams.  Extensive project
    research generated a unique set of requirements which illuminate new
    expectations for museums, staff roles, and technology, all applicable to any
    museum interested in developing a similar resource.</p>

  <h2>1. Beginnings</h2>
  <p>ArtsConnnectEd (<a href="../http://www.artsconnected.org/">http://www.artsconnected.org</a>) first
    launched in the fall of 1998 as a collaborative project between the Minneapolis
    Institute of Arts and Walker Art Center. The objective of the site was to
    combine the collections, educational resources, and archives of both
    institutions specifically for the use of K-12 teachers and students. The
    long-term goal was to more effectively serve a state-wide educational community
    while reducing the production and distribution of physical materials (slide
    sets, reproductions, newsletters, etc.). While the institutions are
    significantly different, the education departments offer many similar programs,
    resources, and services. Over the previous decade, the education departments
    had begun to collaborate on their marketing to reduce cost and teacher
    confusion (Wetterlund, 2009). ArtsConnectEd was designed as an extension of
    this idea, providing “one-stop shopping” for Minnesota teachers using the
    museums’ joint educational resources.</p>
  <p>The impetus for ArtsConnectEd came from the institutions’
    new media departments rather than their education departments. The departments
    had already been collaborating on one on-line education project, ArtsNet
    Minnesota, (Bridges, 1998) and were looking for another in order to take
    advantage of new state funding for technology projects. Both museums were
    seeking the financial resources to kick-start digitization of their own vast
    collections for contribution to the Art Museum Image Consortium (AMICO) (Trant, Bearman &amp; Richmond, 2000) and their own Web sites. It
    was through ArtsConnectEd and its predecessor, the Integrated Arts Information
    Access project (Dowden, Sayre, &amp; Dietz, 2000), that these separate goals
    were brought together.</p>
  <p>At the time, the site and the philosophy behind it were
    quite experimental. Museums were just starting to put their collections on-line
    and very few, if any, had begun to integrate other resources (library records,
    audio, video, texts, educational interactives, etc.), particularly those
    dedicated to a K-12 audience. The technical and intellectual groundwork was in
    many ways unwritten. After months of data mapping, standards research, and
    collaborative development, the first version of ArtsConnectEd launched in 1998
    - the same year as Google - with a front page containing a single form field
    that simultaneously searched all resources across the two institutions. The new
    media groups were pleased with their achievement, as were their colleagues: the
    project won Museums and the Web’s Best Educational Site and the American
    Association of Museum’s MUSE award for Best Educational Program. Unfortunately,
    these kudos proved to be premature when the project went to the first usability
    lab in late 1999. There, they found that few members of the target audience
    could effectively use the site, or worse, even understood its purpose. The team
    returned to the drawing board and redesigned the user interface, moving away
    from a sole reliance on queries to a more menu-based approach, which tested
    much better in a second, follow-up lab. </p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="sayre.fig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="500" height="372"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 1: Homepage for first ArtsConnectEd site design pre
    usability testing 1998</p>
  <p>The resulting ArtsConnectEd grew in popularity with its
    teacher and student end-users as well as the larger museum community.
    Eventually it was held up as a model: a number of other educational Web
    resources were developed following ArtsConnectEd’s lead. These sites include
    the North Carolina Museum of Art’s ArtNC (http://www.ncartmuseum.org/artnc),
    the Art Institute of Chicago’s Art Explorer (http://www.artic.edu/artexplorer),
    the Virtual Museum of Canada’s CollectionX (http://www.collectionx.museum), the Whitney Museum of American Art’s <a href="mailto:Learning@Whitney">Learning@Whitney</a> (<a href="../http://whitney.org/learning">http://whitney.org/learning</a>), and
    the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston’s MFA Educators Online
    (http://educators.mfa.org). While none of these
    resources are stand-alone sites or integrate the collections of multiple
    institutions like ArtsConnectEd, they all provide toolsets and resources
    designed to meet the needs of teachers and students. </p>
  <h2>2. The Community</h2>
  <p>Despite the original site’s awards and its substantial
    funding for development and marketing, early use was quite limited. Museum
    educators and teachers often did not understand the purpose of the resource,
    let alone how to successfully integrate ArtsConnectEd into their day-to-day
    work. To address this issue, the museums secured additional funding to develop
    and implement a state-wide “Train the Trainer” program (Sayre &amp; Wetterlund,
    2002). This program provided laptops and extensive on-site training to a
    contracted group of twenty-four teacher-trainers distributed throughout
    Minnesota, a state with over five million residents, covering over 84,000
    square miles (217,736, sq. km.). After
    completing the training, the teachers returned to their communities and were
    contracted to train a minimum of sixty teachers in their region over the next
    two years. By the end of 2002, over fourteen hundred teachers statewide had
    been trained to use ArtsConnectEd. </p>
  <p>Beyond this initial program, over half of the trainers
    stayed in close touch with ArtsConnectEd and the museums. Some continued to
    offer training in both off-line and on-line settings. At the same time, the MIA
    created a position for a full-time educational technology specialist whose
    responsibilities included organizing and conducting ArtsConnectEd training for
    both in-service and pre-service teachers (college students). The training
    program and marketing eventually paid off, with annual user sessions peaking at
    over two million as of this writing (<a href="../http://www.artsmia.org/stats">http://www.artsmia.org/stats</a>).</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="sayre.fig2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="500" height="415"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 2: Homepage for first ArtsConnectEd site after
    usability testing redesign 2000</p>
  <h2>3. A Need for Change</h2>
  <p>The MIA and Walker educators were only peripherally
    involved with the initial development of ArtsConnectEd, since the new media
    departments had secured the original funding and led the Web site development.
    This, combined with the involvement of externally contracted trainers, had
    helped expedite the site’s development, but had not engaged the museum
    educators. The education directors of both institutions were on the project’s
    steering committee, and other education staff had participated in the teacher
    training. Nevertheless, the internal “clients” for the project were
    disconnected from it. Museum educators were initially unsure how ArtsConnectEd
    would fit into their ever-expanding workload. It was not until job descriptions
    and internal work processes were formally changed that the site was fully
    embraced by these primary stakeholders. </p>
  <p>In the same way they moved from the telephone to e-mail,
    museum educators began to use ArtsConnectEd in place of hardcopy materials.
    ArtsConnectEd had many advantages over print-based resources, but it began to
    pose some significant obstacles. The primary issue was the museum educators’
    lack of ability to modify the site’s content. Neither museum had secured funds
    beyond the initial development funding, nor had they developed a process to
    continue expansion of the site. Museum educators had to put in work requests to
    their new media departments to change anything on the site. Consequently, educators
    had a difficult time efficiently responding to the needs of their audiences.</p>
  <h2>4. Birth of a New Idea</h2>
  <p>Close to a decade after the site’s initial launch,
    ArtsConnectEd was starting to show its age. Increasingly poor response times,
    out of date content, and rising expectations as a result of Web 2.0 technologies
    called into question the site’s relevance. In search of a solution, MIA and
    Walker educators worked to obtain the resources to redesign the site and
    develop a long-term strategy for its future growth. After numerous meetings
    with members of the original project team and current new media staff, the
    group came up with a new approach: the site would take its cues from
    social-networking applications and empower end-users, as well as museum
    educators, to contribute to and manage the content within the site. </p>
  <p>One of the most popular components of the original site
    was an early Web 2.0 tool called Art Collector. This unique tool, similar to an
    on-line version of PowerPoint™, allowed users to assemble, annotate, save, and
    present collections of works of art. This versatility inspired the team to move
    ArtsConnectEd from impenetrable barrier to highly interactive hub.
    ArtsConnectEd2 was to provide a new Web 2.0 toolset to meet the needs of museum
    educators on one hand, and teachers and students on the other. Both groups
    would be able to share content in the form of Art Collector sets, and museum
    educators would have a mechanism to approve and distribute contributed
    resources back through ArtsConnectEd itself. A formal proposal was crafted, and
    in the fall of 2006, funding was secured through an Institute of Museum and
    Library Service’s (IMLS) National Leadership Grant. </p>
  <h2>5. Reconstructing the Collaborative Teams</h2>
  <p>The original ArtsConnectEd project was managed by four
    committees, each made up of members from both institutions: a steering
    committee, a technology committee, a marketing committee, and an education
    committee. As the project had matured, active technical support waned, and so
    too did the committees. Between staff turnover and new priorities, management
    of the site had dwindled down to occasional institutional meetings and informal
    meetings between the individual partners. With the development of the redesign
    proposal and its eventual funding, many of the original team returned, even
    though a few of them no longer worked at either institution. </p>
  <p>With the launch of the redesign project, new collaborative
    committees were formed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Technology Committee – composed of new media developers,
      designers, and directors; responsible for the site’s design and development
      (seven people)</li>
    <li>Education Committee – composed of museum educators; responsible
      for the repurposing and development of new content and providing design input
      (fifteen people)</li>
    <li>Management Committee – composed of museum project directors and
      external contracted project managers; responsible for coordinating the
      priorities and workflow between the groups (four people) </li>
    <li>Steering Committee – composed of education directors, new media
      directors, project directors, and project managers; responsible for setting
      policy and making executive decisions (eight people)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition, a new group was formed. Called the “power
    users,” this group of a dozen highly experienced end-users was invited to
    participate as paid volunteers. Many of them were from the first ArtsConnectEd
    teacher-trainer group. </p>
  <p>Shortly after the project received funding, the technical
    team launched a simple project site (http://ace2.artsconnected.org) to serve as
    a communication hub. The site had three objectives: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>to communicate the project’s scope, progress, and research to the
      public and museum community,</li>
    <li>to collect and share information from the power user group, and </li>
    <li>to organize and archive communication documents from the internal
      collaborative committees. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>One of the first efforts was to create a comprehensive
    list of ArtsConnectEd-like sites, as well as non-museum Web 2.0 tools and
    design approaches that could inform the new site design. These link lists were
    organized and publicly posted on the project site. Prior to the needs
    assessment, the museum educator committee and the power users were asked to
    formally review and rate these sites and tools
    (<a href="../http://ace2.artsconnected.org/index.php?option=com_bookmarks">http://ace2.artsconnected.org/index.php?option=com_bookmarks</a>). It was hoped
    that this process would familiarize all of the committee members with the
    current state of on-line tools and resources, and potentially stimulate new
    ideas for features and functionality.</p>
  <h2>6. Needs Assessment and Consensus Building </h2>
  <p>ArtsConnectEd2 benefited from the perspective of the many
    returning team members, but also from the tremendous amount of assessment data
    that had been collected. A wide range of statistical data on site usage, search
    terminology, and tool usage had been collected since the original site’s
    launch. The museums also had results from multiple teacher focus groups and the
    two usability labs, in addition to evaluation data from the teacher-trainers.
    The project managers used this data as a foundation for a larger needs
    assessment to inform the development of ArtsConnectEd2. They held dozens of
    meetings to survey museum educators and power users. One-on-one interviews were
    conducted with museum educators from both institutions. A daylong focus group
    was conducted with the power users. The goals were to better understand the
    usage of ArtsConnectEd and other on-line tools, discover any perceived
    limitations of the site, and identify new applications and desired
    functionalities for the redesign.</p>
  <p class="caption"><br/>
    <img src="sayre.fig3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="500" height="311"/></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 3: ArtsConnectEd2 Power User group meeting 2008</p>
  <p>The collected data was then consolidated, ordered by
    stakeholder group, and ranked by the number of times each suggestion occurred.
    The resulting list was organized into three categories: 1) general site
    functionality, additions, and improvements; 2) Art Collector improvements; and
    3) content additions. This needs assessment summary document was then reviewed
    by the technology committee, who added their recommendations of potentially
    useful tools and functionality. Finally, the document was vetted by the
    steering committee, which made the first round of executive decisions on which
    requested features would be seriously considered. A compendium of all findings
    was posted on the project site (<a href="../http://ace2.artsconnected.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=25">http://ace2.artsconnected.org/index.php? option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=25</a>).</p>
  <p>Items were cut for various reasons, both technical and
    practical. Integrating relevant educational products into search returns as a
    source of revenue was deemed too logistically challenging, and a number of
    proposed visualizations (timelines and geographic mapping, etc.) would be
    difficult due to the data limitations of the over eighty thousand object
    records. One area of significant concern for the education directors was the
    impact different two-way communication functionalities would have on staff
    time. To address this concern, submission criteria were developed and the
    number of interactions that required immediate or guaranteed responses from
    staff was limited.</p>
  <p>After the steering committee had approved and edited this
    “major feature” list, it was presented to the power user and education
    committees. Both groups were extremely enthusiastic about the extent to which
    the proposed features addressed their expressed needs. Because much of the
    redesign focused on greatly expanding the functionality of the Art Collector
    tool, a number of users expressed concern about losing their personal Art
    Collector sets in the transition from the old site to the new. Some of the power
    users had created over fifty personalized sets that they used in their
    classrooms on a regular basis. The technical committee assured them that their
    data would be transferred to the new site.</p>
  <h2>7. Use Case Scenarios and Specifications</h2>
  <p>The ArtsConnectEd2 software specification
    development was envisioned as a series of documents:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>User
      Scenarios (needs described by type of user and the tasks and processes they are
      likely to perform)</li>
    <li>Information
      Architecture (diagrams of each page and/or process addressing the needs
      identified in the User Scenarios)</li>
    <li>Definitions
      Document (major components and functional definitions including working
      terminology)</li>
    <li>Specification
      Document (technical requirements by section and function) </li>
  </ol>
  <p>A linear process for developing the
    specification was outlined - each document to be written in the order listed - and
    initiated by the technology committee. Documents drafted by the technology
    committee were reviewed and then approved by the project directors with input
    from the steering committee as needed. In theory, developers and designers
    would proceed with the production phase of the project after the complete
    specification was written. In practice, because of time constraints and a
    desire to start prototyping, only the first two of the four documents were
    written.</p>
  <p>The prioritized list of features and
    functionality that grew out of the needs assessment in the research phase set
    the stage for the definition of user types and development of user scenarios.
    User tasks (e.g., register) were listed by user type (museum educator, power
    user, outside educator, general public, and unregistered user). User scenarios
    were recast as use cases that described step by step how the application or a
    particular process was expected to work. Over forty use cases were developed in
    the general categories of: 1) search, browse, and item records; 2) creating
    content; 3) help; 4) user account maintenance; and 5) site administrator
    functions. A sample use case is provided in Appendix A.</p>
  <p>Considerable time and effort was invested
    in the creation of the use cases and the wireframes (information architecture)
    that were made in response to them. As previously noted, the definitions and
    specification documents were never generated. Instead, developers started
    building the application, applying Agile software development principles and
    Trac project management software to develop a roadmap.</p>
  <h2>8. New Content Development</h2>
  <p>As the technology committee began development, the museum
    educators identified what new content was to be added to the site. Both
    institutions had historically produced hundreds of physical resources that
    could potentially be re-purposed for delivery through ArtsConnectEd2. The
    education committee set upon creating a comprehensive inventory of these items,
    which ranged from typed worksheets to multi-component slide/tape programs. Each
    institution logged its resources based on format, content, and audience. </p>
  <p>The collected resources were then divided up for review
    amongst the educators. A resource evaluation tool was developed to assist the
    museum educators in their assessment of each resource. The tool assisted the
    educators in assigning each resource a numeric rating of its “repurposability,”
    weighted by a variety of factors including: a) quality and relevance of
    content; b) availability of preexisting digital assets; c) copyright
    limitations; and d) opportunities for digital enhancement. The tool also
    assisted the reviewer in determining what the best format for repurposing would
    be: text page, PDF, or museum-educator-built Art Collector set. A summary of
    the selection criteria and evaluation tools was posted on the project Web site
    (<a href="../http://ace2.artsconnected.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=29">http://ace2.artsconnected.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory &amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=29</a>).</p>
  <p>After assessing all of the resources within the inventory,
    the museum educators gathered and separated the resources into categories: a)
    easy and worthwhile to convert, b) worthwhile but challenging (due to copyright
    issues, digitization requirements, rewriting, etc.), and c) not worthwhile. This
    process was extremely useful, not only to ArtsConnectEd2, but also as a larger
    institutional assessment of all educational resources.  Upon the
    completion of this process, the museum educators began the process of
    gathering, organizing, and digitizing all easily repurposed assets.  A
    temporary server space was set up for the educators to upload and organize the
    assets until ArtsConnectEd2 was ready for the final uploading. The review,
    gathering and uploading process will continue until all repurposable resources
    have been converted.</p>

  <p class="caption">Fig 4: ArtsConnectEd2 in the usability testing lab 2008</p>
  <h2>9. New Tools for User Empowerment</h2>
  <p>At the core of the new ArtsConnectEd are two functions:
    finding things (Art Finder) and managing collections or sets of things (Art
    Collector). The thematic sections of the original site - Art Gallery, Library
    &amp; Archives, For Your Classroom, Playground, and Search All - have been
    abandoned for a less hierarchical interface focused on actions and toolsets to
    facilitate user-generated content. As previously described, the drafting of use
    case scenarios and diagrams of the architecture preceded programming. Once the
    developers started building the site, individual components and features were
    routinely and iteratively tested by internal team members and contracted power
    users, reflecting the Agile software development principles the project strove
    to implement. In the fall of 2008, Art Finder and Art Collector were formally
    tested in Target Corporation’s usability lab. The original ArtsConnectEd Web
    site had benefited from this same lab in the mid-1990s (Dowden, Sayre &amp;
    Dietz, 2000) and once again, the rigor of the lab environment was key to
    identifying and resolving issues.</p>
  <h3>Asset Retrieval</h3>
  <p>Of the site’s features, none has been more scrutinized
    than Art Finder, the combined search and browse solution. Tabs divide assets by
    kind - works of art, audio/video, texts, interactive resources, Art Collector
    sets, events, or “all” - and form fields and drop down lists within the tabs
    are used to filter results.  In a tabbed section, the first row of filters
    applies to all assets. A second row provides filters specific to the asset,
    like “culture” in works of art and “type” in texts (e.g., article, artist
    statement, or bibliography). </p>
  <p>From the beginning, the project’s technologists were
    interested in an orientation that began with a result set - an approach that
    made the breadth of resources in ArtsConnectEd visible immediately. The use
    cases reflected a fairly conventional strategy: search and browse were defined
    as discrete features, the distinction being whether the user started a session
    with nothing (search) or all items (browse).  Early sketches showed search as
    part of the global navigation, allowing users to initiate a search from
    anywhere in the site. In subsequent versions, the search field was moved to Art
    Finder only, first outside of the asset tabs and ultimately within them. Search
    was posited as just another kind of filter, not a separate function in its own
    right, and testing demonstrated that collapsing the functions could yield
    interesting results as long as other modifications were made to the interface.</p>
  <p>A major point of contention among team members was giving
    users the option to hide or show filters. Hiding filters simplified the
    interface, but usability lab testing demonstrated that out of sight was truly
    out of mind: users quickly forgot that hidden filter settings were affecting
    their results. The usability lab also demonstrated that starting a session in
    the “all” tab was a mistake. Some assumed that showing a variety of results was
    important to communicating the breadth of the repository, yet users were often
    confused by it. Today, Art Finder opens with works of art as the active tab,
    limited to showing records that have an image. </p>
  <h3>User Enhancement of Records</h3>
  <p>All assets within ArtsConnectEd2 can be enhanced with
    user-generated content.  Registered users can tag, rate and comment on the
    utility of everything from works of art to interactive resources and Art
    Collector sets.  Museum educators have an extended set of capabilities,
    including the ability to link assets to one another and endorse specific
    assets.</p>
  <h3>Two-way User Created Content</h3>
  <p>The central tool within ArtsConnectEd is still Art
    Collector. It is much more robust than the original version: users of Art
    Collector can build sets mixing MIA and Walker assets from any category (works
    of art, audio/video, texts, interactive resources, and other Art Collector
    sets) with external resources (e.g., Flickr images or YouTube videos). The tool
    is rich with features that allow sets and their contents to be easily
    manipulated and presented using templates that support everything from
    comparison slides, various combinations of text and media, links to information
    outside the presentation, and much more. The range of features reflects the
    dual audience for which Art Collector was written: museum educators as well as
    teachers and students. There is no separate suite of tools for our internal
    educators; the same interface serves external audiences, and the actions
    available in a particular context vary according to the administrative
    privileges granted to an account type. By collapsing this aspect of the
    authoring tool into a single set of screens, the site provides one community - outside
    teachers - with far more than requirements analysis suggested they needed.
    While usability testing forced the technology committee to rethink the
    complexity surrounding Art Collector’s editing functions, it remains to be seen
    how users take advantage of the expanded functionality.</p>
  <p>These ArtsConnectEd2 toolsets also permit internal and
    external users to add their Art Collector sets to ArtsConnectEd. Internal users
    can directly publish their sets on the site, while external users use a
    submission function. Their set is then internally reviewed and approved for
    publication. This reviewed publishing process was adopted by the steering
    committee after they weighed the pros and cons of immediate publication. It was
    felt that the perceived formality of the submission process would improve the
    quality of the submitted material. It was also decided that the only real
    criterion for publishing submitted sets would be that they not contain any
    legally problematic material. Qualitative assessment would come from user
    ratings and the museum educator’s ability to mark a resource as “ArtsConnectEd
    endorsed.”</p>
  <h3>Two-way Communication</h3>
  <p>Another part of breaking down ArtsConnectEd’s barriers was
    developing mechanisms for communication between the museum educators and the
    publics they serve. A new news-oriented homepage design and an Ask the Educator
    section were designed to facilitate this. The new homepage contains a variety
    of features controlled by museum educators, permitting them to customize
    articles, post announcements, and highlight content. The Ask An Educator
    section is a blog-like toolset allowing museum educators to publish short
    articles as well as to respond to questions and comments submitted by external
    users.  All of this content is indexed as text assets for potential retrieval
    within Art Finder.</p>
  <h3>Administration</h3>
  <p>Museum educators also have a number of new administrative
    tools to empower them to control the new site.  Administrative functions
    include tools for managing user accounts and privileges, uploading and cataloguing
    non-art assets (text, audio, video, interactive resources, etc,), and more.  It
    is hoped that these tools will reduce the museum educators’ reliance on the new
    media departments as well as greatly increase the quality and quantity of new
    content.</p>

  <h2>10. Tools and Standards</h2>
  <p>From the beginning, the technology-based collaborative
    efforts of the Walker and MIA have emphasized the importance of standards in
    the storage, sharing, and dissemination of digital materials. Under the
    umbrella of the Integrated Arts Information Access project (ArtConnectEd’s
    predecessor), the two institutions participated in the Computerized Interchange
    of Museum Information (CIMI) Dublin Core initiative and used AMICO’s data
    definitions for the descriptions of works of art in the combined ArtsConnectEd
    catalogue. While these early consortiums were important to ArtsConnectEd’s original
    development, it took the redesign of the software for the promise of these
    endeavors - standards-based sharing and integration - to truly come to
    fruition. </p>
  <p>XML schemas and aggregation formats like RSS were
    identified in the IMLS proposal as the means by which the new site’s data would
    be imported. In part this reflected the Walker’s Web strategy, which emphasizes
    open standard technologies and content reuse. Ultimately, a more robust range
    of standards and protocols was selected, including the Categories for the
    Description of Works of Art (CDWA) Lite XML schema to describe the Walker and
    MIA’s collections; Qualified Dublin Core for audio/video and text records;
    iCalendar for the transfer of event data; and custom RSS feeds for audio and
    video podcasts, specifically the Walker’s Art on Call audio guide
    (http://newmedia.walkerart.org/aoc) and Walker Channel archives
    (<a href="../http://channel.walkerart.org/">http://channel.walkerart.org</a>). The Open Archive Information Protocol for
    Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) was used to populate the repository, making
    future expansion - such as including other institutions’ holdings - possible,
    as well as supporting the option that either collection, or the ArtsConnectEd
    repository as a whole, could be contributed to another union catalogue. This
    harvesting model stands in stark contrast to the previous institution-specific,
    custom approach to moving data from the Walker and MIA. </p>
  <p>For the MIA, which had moved to Gallery Systems TMS
    collections management system since ArtsConnectEd was first developed, implementing
    a CDWA Lite export using OAI-PMH was a particular challenge. With the help of
    OCLC’s Museum Data Exchange Project
    (<a href="../http://www.oclc.org/programs/ourwork/collectivecoll/sharecoll/museumdata.htm">http://www.oclc.org/programs/ourwork/collectivecoll/sharecoll/museumdata.htm</a>),
    the project was able to get an early copy of an export utility developed by
    Cogapp as part of their COBOAT publishing system. Using this aspect of the OCLC
    project supports ArtsConnectEd2’s investment in open standards, ensuring the
    repository’s relevance and future growth. </p>
  <p>Similar objectives informed the selection of the
    technologies used to develop the software itself. Here too, the emphasis on
    open software solutions was a departure from the proprietary tools used in the
    first implementation (Adobe’s Cold Fusion, Microsoft’s IIS and SQL Server, and
    Live Picture’s FlashPix). As the master list of system requirements and
    functionality was defined, the need for a development framework and a
    “pluggable” software design methodology was articulated. Symfony was selected
    as the framework, and a wide range of existing tools to develop the new site’s
    functionality were incorporated, from media players (JW Media Player) and
    presentation tools (Slidy), to image zooming (IIPImage), rating features, and
    much more. Over the course of the software development, this approach fostered
    rapid prototyping of feature sets and permitted late changes, even in decisions
    as fundamental as choice of Web server (from Apache to Lighttpd) and search
    engine (Lucene to Solr). For a complete list of the software used, see the
    development section of the project site, <a href="../http://ace2.artsconnected.org/">http://ace2.artsconnected.org</a>.</p>
  <p>One API the project planned to
    use and did not was the steve.museum tagger. Having selected Symfony as the
    framework to build ArtsConnectEd2, it was
    believed that implementing the steve API - which only tags works of art - would
    separate the museum objects and their operations from the benefits of the
    framework. ArtsConnectEd2 implements tagging
    across all assets, and the steve tagger presented search integration issues
    that added a level of complexity at odds with the software development effort. </p>
  <p>Another unrealized opportunity
    was the integration of the Getty Vocabularies. They were licensed, but will not
    be included when the redesign is publicly launched. Eventually, ArtsConnectEd2
    hopes to implement the vocabularies as a means of search expansion and to
    provide more context about an artist. </p>
  <p>Beyond the tools needed to build
    the application, ArtsConnectEd2 adopted a suite of tools to manage
    software development and project communications. Joomla was chosen for the
    project dashboard and configured with a public and private side for making
    information available to staff and project teams, as well as the larger
    community. Selected for its ease of use and range of plug-in components,
    which include blog-like publishing, calendars, and forums, as well as bookmark
    and file management, Joomla’s toolset was not robust enough to meet the demands
    of the technology committee. While still used for group communications and
    final reports, the technology committee turned to the newly-released Google
    Docs for document sharing, and Trac to manage the software development effort.
    ArtsConnectEd2 used Trac for issue tracking, roadmap administration, and
    browsing source revisions maintained by SVN.  </p>
  <h2>11. Collaborative Challenges</h2>
  <p>In the decade since ArtsConnectEd was first launched it
    has become a model for museum K-12 on-line resources. The importance of the
    project has been acknowledged on a number of levels, including as an
    outstanding example of institutional collaboration. The strength of the
    partnership is due in part to early efforts to define common goals and
    motivations. A 1998 White Paper declared a set of shared assumptions about
    technology and communication, the nature and value of museum information, and
    the role that museums play in the modern world (<a href="../http://outreach.lib.uic.edu/www/issues/issue5_6/dowden/">Dowden,
    Sayre &amp; Dietz, 2000</a>). Despite
    this long history and strong partnership, the challenges to complete
    ArtsConnectEd2 were considerable. </p>
  <h3>Team Dynamics</h3>
  <p>If managing team dynamics is a delicate process within one
    institution, it is even more challenging across multiple institutions. The
    initial design of the ArtsConnectEd2 technology committee was based on an equal
    distribution of work between like positions in both institutions (two
    developers, two designers, two managers). On paper, this approach seemed
    sensible, but in reality the model posed challenges. One issue was fairly
    balancing the workload through the life of the project. Each technologist came
    to the table with a unique skill set, a different approach to work, and a
    different set of institutional  time constraints beyond ArtsConnectEd2. These
    differences led to the Walker taking a leadership role in the development of
    the software. Shifts in responsibilities, along with a six-month extension of
    the project timeline, caused significant tension and affected all team members.
    In a single institution, personnel strengths and different working styles can
    be managed much more easily than in a partnership, where team members reside in
    vastly different institutional cultures. Throughout the project, the external
    project manager and the new media directors worked to resolve these tensions by
    redistributing the work and making staff changes. </p>
  <p>Another team-related challenge was collaboration in areas
    where the institutions had different standards and aesthetics. While the
    partners’ shared values helped navigate these issues at a macro-administrative
    level, the thousands of micro-decisions (design, grammar, etc.) required the
    staff “in the trenches” to compromise with their colleagues at the partner
    institution. </p>
  <h3>Mixed Expertise</h3>
  <p>In hindsight, many felt the first ArtsConnectEd site was
    compromised by the limited involvement of the education staff. Almost a decade
    later, the impetus for developing ArtsConnectEd2 came from the museum
    educators. More than a Web site, ArtsConnectEd had become a core component of
    the Walker and MIA’s school programs. When it came to the development of
    ArtsConnectEd2, the challenge was to balance the new media staff’s desire to
    innovate with the museum educators’ needs. A formal assessment conducted early
    in the ArtsConnectEd2 project showed that the education committee had a strong
    interest in Web 2.0 tools, but had the least experience using them. In
    contrast, the technology committee was steeped in researching, using, and
    developing these tools, but had limited understanding of the work of museum
    educators and the audiences they serve. Needs assessment and use case scenarios
    certainly helped, but managing each group’s assumptions - particularly
    regarding functionality versus practicality - was an area of continual
    negotiation.</p>
  <h3>Commitment</h3>
  <p>Collaborations like ArtsConnectEd can be very much like
    marriages, and each challenge tests the relationship and partners’ commitment.
    Because ArtsConnectEd2 was not the sole project of either institution,
    competing institutional demands could easily threaten or compromise a project’s
    success. The ArtsConnectEd2 development project absorbed nearly all of the
    technology committee’s time for over a year and half. Beyond the dedication of
    the designers and developers themselves, the directors of these departments
    were instrumental in seeing the project to completion while working hard to
    satisfy other commitments.</p>
  <h2>12. Conclusions</h2>
  <p>ArtsConnectEd2 is redefining how museum educators and K-12
    teachers work on-line. The redesign project attempted to tear down the walls
    between museum educators and their customers as well as the internal divisions
    that separate education from new media. The project’s importance to its
    developers and the expectations of its internal and external users set a very
    high bar for everyone involved and tested the strength and potential of the
    collaboration at every level. These expectations and the expansive product
    illustrate the potential and the challenges faced in user-driven software
    redesign.</p>
  <p>ArtsConnectEd2 is the most ambitious software development
    effort ever undertaken by the two museums, individually or together.  While
    there was general recognition of the scope of our aspirations going into the
    project, the demands that would be placed on developers and management were not
    entirely understood or anticipated. When finally completed, the project was six
    months over schedule, a consequence of the complex frameworks, staffing
    resources, and software development process. An unanswered question is whether
    the non-existent program specifications and requirements documents affected the
    overall project. It is possible that more detailed requirements may have
    shortened the development cycle, but it is also likely that the iterative
    nature of the work - responding to user-feedback over following a plan - led to
    a better product.  Regardless of all the testing, the answer remains, as
    always, in the real-world experience of our end-users.</p>
