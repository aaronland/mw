		<p class="AbstractText">The benefits of Web 2.0 in a museum context are now being
    increasingly accepted, with papers at recent Museums and the Web conferences
    having highlighted a range of ways in which services such as Flickr and YouTube
    and technologies such as blogs and wikis can be used.</p>
  <p class="AbstractText">But what of the associated risks? What of the various concerns
    that the sector is beginning to address: concerns that the services may not be
    sustainable; institutional data may be locked into external services; services
    may infringe accessibility guidelines and associated legislation; users may
    lose interest in the services; inappropriate user-generated content may be
    published on the service; data created or stored on the services may not be
    preserved; etc.?</p>
  <p class="AbstractText">In a paper on &#34;Web

    <h2>Revisiting Web 2.0</h2>
      <p>The Web 2.0 term has now been widely accepted as a
        description of a new pattern of ways the Web is being used. We have progressed
        from the publishing paradigm which characterised what is now sometimes referred
        to as Web 1.0, in which small numbers of content creators made use of tools
        ranging from desktop HTML authoring tools through to enterprise Content
        Management Systems and corresponding editorial and quality assurance processes
        to produce content for passive consumption by end users. In a Web 2.0
        environment, large numbers of users are creating content using a seemingly
        ever-increasing variety of tools and devices with such content being made
      available via a wide variety of commercial Web 2.0 services.</p>
      <p>The characteristics of Web 2.0
        were described by O’Reilly (2005). The key areas relevant to this paper
      include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Application areas, including blogs and wikis, social sharing
        services and social networking services;</li>
      <li>The ease of reuse of content elsewhere through syndication
        formats such as RSS and Atom and other embedding technologies;</li>
      <li>A culture of openness and sharing which has been helped through
        the development of copyright licences such as Creative Commons;</li>
      <li>The concept of the ‘network as the platform’ by which services
        are hosted on externally-hosted services and accessible over the network,
        rather than a managed service within the organisation.</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Although the value of the Web 2.0 term has been questioned
        by some, it does provide a useful way of defining a new phase in the evolution
      of the Web.</p>
      <h2>Use of Web 2.0 by Museums</h2>
      <h3>Use of Web 2.0 at Brooklyn Museum</h3>
      <p>Caruth &amp; Berstein (2007) provided insight into the ways
        an early adopter made use of a variety of social networking services. The paper
        described how Brooklyn Museum used services <i>“</i>involving
        but not limited to Blogger, Flickr, MySpace, Facebook, Blip.tv, YouTube, Cell
        Phone Audio Tours, and podcasts/mp3 downloads” to support the aims of their
      museum.</p>
      <p>A follow-up paper (Bernstein, 2008) described further
        developments at Brooklyn Museum, including further project work and
        development. This work included the development of the Artshare Facebook
        application which allows Facebook users to select from the Brooklyn Museum
        collection works of art which they can shuffle on their personal profiles. This
        application was subsequently developed further to allow other museums to use it
        to share works in their own collections, allowing artists on Facebook to upload
      their own artwork to share with friends.</p>
      <h3>The Museum Blogosphere</h3>
      <p>Chan &amp; Spadaccini (2007) have documented the growth of
        use of blogs in museums: “as 2006 began, there were less than thirty known
        museum blogs; since then, that number has more than doubled”. The paper went on
        to state that in 2007 “there are well over 100 blogs exploring museum issues,
        from a range of institutions and individuals across the globe”. <strong>Museum
          Blogs</strong> (<a href="../http://www.museumblogs.org/">http://www.museumblogs.org/</a>) is a directory of
        museum and museum-related blogs and aggregators which aims to raise awareness
        and increase the authority of sites focusing on museum issues. In January 2009
      the directory contained a total of 286 museum-related blogs.</p>
      <h3>Use of Twitter by museums</h3>
      <p>A small number of early adopters at the Museums and the Web
        2007 conference were using the Twitter micro-blogging service. By the following
        year, Twitter usage had grown across this sector, with the Onetag service
        providing an aggregation of Twitter posts (tweets) related to the conference
      (Ellis, 2008). </p>
      <p>We are now seeing larger numbers of institutions (as opposed
        to individuals) using Twitter, including Brooklyn Museum (<a href="../http://twitter.com/brooklynmuseum">http://twitter.com/brooklynmuseum</a>),
        the Getty Museum (<a href="../http://twitter.com/GettyMuseum">http://twitter.com/GettyMuseum</a>)
        and the Science Museum (<a href="../http://twitter.com/sciencemuseum">http://twitter.com/sciencemuseum</a>).
        Promotion of the use of Twitter by museums appears to have started in 2007,
        with a blog post on “What is Twitter, Really? And Can It Do Anything For
      Museums?” published in April 2007 (Simon, 2008a). </p>
      <p>Following the initial take-up of Twitter we are now seeing
        advice which seeks to explain the potential benefits and best practices in its
        usage. The “An Open letter To Museums on Twitter” blog post (Simon, 2008b),
        for example, provides a list of suggestions; such as, “Don&#39;t use Twitter to
        spam me about visiting”, “It&#39;s okay if you start by just following,” “Once you
        decide to tweet, make it interesting,” and “Tell me something I can&#39;t find on
      your homepage”.</p>
      <p>We can see a trend in which new services are initially used
        by individuals who are willing to make use of such innovations. Such services
        may then start to be used in an organisational context by the early adopters,
        helped by the advocacy activities of the users who like to share their
        experiences with their peers. We then start to see the development of advice on
        best practices. The next stage is likely to be the provision of directories –
        and here we find that a Twitter group of museum Twitter feeds has already been
      established (Twittergroups, nd).</p>
      <h3>Acceptance of the relevance of Web 2.0</h3>
      <p>There is no real need to expand further on the variety of
        ways museums have started to exploit the potential of Web 2.0. Case studies on
        the use of wikis, video services, podcasts, etc. have been widely published.
        For now, we should acknowledge that Web 2.0 is becoming mainstream in the
        sector. The challenge now is to revisit some of the concerns which were raised
        by skeptics, to explore whether such concerns are legitimate and, where they
      are, to develop approaches for addressing such concerns.</p>
      <h2>The Concerns</h2>
      <h3>Identifying the concerns</h3>
      <p>UKOLN has delivered a series of workshops which aim to
        provide an understanding of the potential of Web 2.0 and also identify
        potential barriers to the effective deployment and use of such services and
        explore ways in which such barriers can be addressed. Feedback is available
        from several of these workshops (UKOLN, 2008a; UKOLN, 2008b). This
        information, provided by practitioners within the sector, has informed the
      ideas described in this paper.</p>
      <h3>Sustainability issues</h3>
      <p>Adie (2008) has pointed out that Web 2.0 services which rely
        on a global scale in terms of numbers of users and/or on social networks will
        become decreasingly useful if the number of users drops. Essentially, the
        network effect works both ways. He also referred to the University of Edinburgh <i>Guidelines for Using External Web 2.0
          Services</i> (Edinburgh, 2007) and described the risks involved in the
        institution’s use of remote Web 2.0 services, especially in terms of compliance
      with the Data Protection Act. </p>
      <p>Failures in the services provided by Web 2.0 companies are
        happening. Kelly (2008a) has described a personal example of this with the
        Squirl service for managing small collections. The service’s interface to
        Amazon seemed to fail, with no Amazon book record being retrieved from the
        service. Further investigation revealed, worryingly, that the service’s data
        export function was also broken, meaning that the data could not be easily
        exported from the service. In addition, Squirl’s fault-reporting e-mail address
      is no longer functional.</p>
      <p>Such considerations need not, however, mean that
        organisations need to shy away from use of third-party services. If this were
        the case, then we would not entrust our savings to banks, but would keep the
        cash hidden under our mattresses. Rather, there is a need to evaluate the risks
        and to develop risk management strategies. Let us now explore some other types
      of risk. </p>
      <h3>Digital preservation </h3>
      <p>Are we in danger of living in the digital dark ages, as some
        have suggested, with Web-based resources disappearing as organisational
      policies and priorities change and technologies change? </p>
      <p>A project on the Preservation of Web Resources (JISC PoWR)
        was funded by the JISC in order to explore more deeply the challenges faced by
        institutions and to provide recommendations and develop advice on best
        practices. The project made use of a blog (JIISC PoWR, 2008a) which highlighted
      various challenges of preservation in a Web 2.0 environment.</p>
      <h3>The Human Factors </h3>
      <p>It would be a mistake to regard the risks in providing
        services based on use of externally-hosted services as only concerned with the
        sustainability of the services themselves. There is a need to appreciate the
        risks associated with the human element. This might include the initial
        adopters and enthusiasts losing interest in services such as blogs and wikis,
        resulting in blogs no longer regularly updated, wikis not maintained, and
        inappropriate comments or automated comment spam not removed from services. The
        Museums Wiki (<a href="../http://museums.wikia.com/">http://museums.wikia.com/</a>), for example, was established in 2006
        to provide a space for sharing resources and ideas about museums. However,
        based on pages on forthcoming events, changed pages, etc. it would appear that
      the service has not gained the momentum which was hoped for. </p>
      <h3>Accessibility issues </h3>
      <p>Many public sector organisations around the world will have
        both legal and ethical requirements to ensure that their resources and services
        can be accessed by people with disabilities. In the UK the DDA (Disability
        Discrimination Act) requires organisations to take reasonable measures to
        ensure that people with disabilities aren’t discriminated against unfairly. The
        Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) developed by the W3C Web
        Accessibility Initiative (WAI) play an important role in documenting approaches
        which can help to ensure that Web resources can be rendered by Web browsers and
      assistive technologies for users with a range of disabilities. </p>
      <p>It is sometimes felt that all Web resources must conform to
        WCAG guidelines, and that this requirement will rule out the deployment of many
        Web 2.0 services which may be dependent on technologies which are deprecated in
        the WAI guidelines. However, as Sloan (2006) describes, the WCAG 1.0 guidelines
        have significant limitations, including their reliance on browsers which
        conform to User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) and authoring tools which
      conform with Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG). </p>
      <h2>Exploiting the Potential of Web 2.0</h2>
      <p>We have reviewed some of the ways in which Web 2.0 services
        have grown in popularity over the past couple of years.  We have also looked at
        examples of the concerns associated with such approaches. In this section we
        summarize some of the broad approaches which can help to ensure that
      institutions maximize the potential dividends which Web 2.0 seeks to provide.</p>
      <h3>Advocacy</h3>
      <p>Although awareness of Web 2.0 is widespread in many circles,
        there is still a need for advocacy of the benefits to be gained, especially with
        senior managers and organisations which may traditionally be resistant to
        change. Research interests and the need to engage with young people often help
        to ensure that higher education institutions are early adopters of innovations.
        However, in other sectors such drivers will be missing, and even in higher
        education there may be resistance to changes especially if the benefits of
      change to existing working practices are not obvious.</p>
      <p>Within the UK, UKOLN has taken a high profile in promoting
        the benefits of Web 2.0 to a variety of communities, including higher education
        and the cultural heritage sector. Such advocacy activities have included
        presentations at national and regional events aimed at the cultural heritage
      sector (UKOLN, 2008c; UKOLN, 2008d ;UKOLN, 2008e; Kelly, 2008b).</p>
      <h3>Listening</h3>
      <p>Advocacy activities need to be complemented by listening
        activities which help to provide a better understanding of both specific
        requirements within organisations and the various concerns which may be
      expressed. </p>
      <p>UKOLN has delivered a series of workshops aimed at museums,
        libraries and archives; they have used wikis as a mechanism both for gaining
        feedback on potential use of Web 2.0 services and for documenting concerns and
        barriers encountered or expected by practitioners in the sector. The UK Web
        Focus blog (<a href="../http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/">http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/</a>) provides both a dissemination and
        communications forum for discussion and debate on best practices of use of Web
      2.0 services.</p>
      <h2>Case study: Amplified Conferences</h2>
      <p>This example of an ‘amplified conference’ (Wikipedia, 2008)
        reflects a growing trend at IT and e-learning conferences. We are also seeing
        awareness that the main challenges are not necessarily the technical ones but
        the human issues, including understanding the purposes the technologies are
        being used for, addressing the potential distractions that such technologies
        may cause, and facing the legal and ethical challenges related to issues such
      as data protection, privacy and social inclusion.</p>
      <p>A debate on the potential distractions caused by use of
        networked technologies in a conference environment has been featured on the Ed
        Techie (Weller, 2008) and UK Web Focus blogs (Kelly, 2008c). The debate has
        parallels with discussions on changes in the physical space, from a quiet
        environment for individual reading to a social space for community activities.
        We are seeing developments of approaches which seek to address the concerns of
        the two camps, ranging from use of the physical space, with separate areas for
        those who wish to use their PCs and those who prefer a quieter environment,
        through to, perhaps, the development of hardware solutions which minimize noise
      made when typing. </p>
      <p>The issues of data protection and privacy may be more
        complex to address. Many people are happy to be included in photographs and
        videos, and for these to be made available on-line. However, as Andy Powell has
        described (Powell, 2007), sometimes individuals may object to this, with the result
        thatsuch images are removed from public Web sites, and the effort of any
        associated processing of the resources has to be written off. It may be argued
        that an approach to addressing such matters may be based on human sensitivities
        to such issues and flexibility rather than blanket bans. However, the need for
      Acceptable Use Policies in such cases has been described (Kelly, 2005).</p>
      <h3>Preservation in a Web 2.0 environment</h3>
      <p>The JISC PoWR project published guidelines on advice for Web
        preservation, and  included advice on use of Web 2.0 services. As described in the
        project’s final report (JISC PoWR, 2008b), a variety of approaches can be taken
        to address preservation challenges, including use of syndication technologies
      to replicate content at multiple locations. </p>
      <p>The ease of content creation and the huge diversity of ways
        Web 2.0 services are being used can mean that the disposition of resources is
        more relevant than it was in an environment where the creation of digital data
        was a time-consuming and resource-intensive task. Organisations may well decide
        that the preservation of digital resources such as Twitter posts or Skype
      telephone calls and instant message chats is not required.</p>
      <h3>A culture
        of openness</h3>
      
      The provision of training and staff development courses is supported
        by the availability of resources with Creative Common licences which allow for
        their reuse, perhaps for non-commercial use. There is a likelihood that Web 2.0
        advocates will have embraced a culture of openness and have a willingness to
      allow their resources to be reused by others.
      <p>UKOLN has recently released a number of briefing documents
        covering a variety of Web 2.0 areas which are available with a Creative Commons
        licence (UKOLN, 2008f) provided the aim is  to maximize the organisation’s
        impact within the higher and further education and cultural heritage sectors.
        This decision also reflects an organizational culture of openness where slides
        used in many presentations have made use of Creative Commons licences, and
        access to the resources is maximised through use of popular sharing services
      such as Slideshare. </p>
      <h2>Risk Assessment and Risk Management</h2>
      <h3>Risk assessment to support events</h3>
      <p>A risk assessment approach was developed at UKOLN, initially
        to support use of externally-hosted Web 2.0 services at a high profile annual
        UKOLN event, first in 2005 and more recently in 2008 (UKOLN, 2008g). The
        approach required a description of why the service is being used, a statement of
        the perceived risks, and details of how such risks are to be addressed, as summarized
      below:</p>
      <p><strong>Support
        UKOLN&#39;s Role:</strong> An important role is to keep abreast
        of emerging new technologies in order to provide advice on best practices to
      its stakeholder communities.</p>
      <p><strong>Advise Our
        Communities:</strong> Many institutions have an interest in
        Web 2.0, including technologies which provide social networking services and
        integration of content from diverse sources. Making use of such technologies
      allows us to provide effective advice, based on experience gained.</p>
      <p><strong>Provide
        Richer Experiences To Our Users</strong>: The hosted
        services aim to provide useful services to the target audience - participants
      at the event.</p>
      <p><strong>Minimise
        Resource Efforts</strong>: In order to minimise the use of scarce
      software development expertise, we use services which are freely available. </p>
      <p><strong>Provide A Test
        Bed:</strong> We seek to host appropriate services after the
        workshop in order to monitor changes to the services, such as withdrawal of or
      changes to the licence conditions, enhancements to the services, etc.</p>
      <p><strong>Gain
        Experience Prior To Service Deployment:</strong> Evaluation
        of the services can provide feedback on the merits of the services which will
      be valuable if the services are deployed more widely.</p>
      <p><strong>Maximise
        Impact</strong>: If the technologies prove significant,
        demonstration at the event provides an opportunity to maximise impact by
      exposure to 170 delegates.</p>
      <p>Examples of possible risks and
      the risk assessment and risk management strategies taken were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use
          of a 3<sup>rd</sup> party usage statistics service: a well-established service
          was used, with data being provided in any case on the Web service.</li>
        <li>Use
          of a video blog: there were risks that the data might not be extractable from
          the service. However, as the video related directly to specific aspects of the
          event, long-term management of the content was not deemed necessary.</li>
        <li>Use
          of del.icio.us to bookmark resources: del.icio.us is a well-established
          service. In case of problems it should be possible to make use of del.icio.us
          APIs to migrate the content to another service.</li>
        <li>Use
          of Google search facility: Google is a well-established and profitable service,
          and its search facility is central to its service.</li>
        <li>Use
          of the Eventbrite on-line booking service: although further information about
          this company is not available, as it was used for informal purposes, its loss
          would not have been significant.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Applying A Risk Assessment Approach in an a Time of Economic Trouble</h3>
      <p>How should institutions respond in their uses of Web 2.0
        services at a time of a global recession? Let us consider the economic risks to
        various stakeholder communities which may undermine the services provided by heritage
      organisations:</p>
      <p><strong>Externally-hosted
        Web 2.0 providers</strong>: What if the services provided by Google, Yahoo, etc.
        prove uneconomic and the services are shut down or the terms and conditions
      changed, with perhaps free-to-use services becoming subscription services?</p>
      <p><strong>Our institutions</strong>:
        What if the economic downturn affects the sustainability of the IT services
      provided within our institutions?</p>
      <p><strong>Our national
        services</strong>: What if the national services provided for our communities are
        similarly adversely affected, with users preferring the services provided by
      global services?</p>
      <p><strong>Our information
        providers</strong>: What if the services provided by individuals who use Slideshare,
        Flickr, etc. aren’t sustainable because the individuals face redundancy, early
      retirement, etc.?</p>
      <p><strong>Our funding
        organisations</strong>: What if our funding bodies have less money available, and
        are forced to stop or reduce the level of funding provided to national or
      institutional services?</p>
      <p><strong>Our user communities</strong>: What if our users’ expectations or interests
      change?</p>
      <p>It should be clear that to dismiss externally-hosted
        services at a time of economic turmoil would be too simplistic an approach. 
        Rather, there is a need to develop risk assessment and risk management
      approaches across a wide range of scenarios.</p>
      <h3>Risk assessment and accessibility</h3>
      <p>A holistic framework for Web accessibility is described by
        Kelly (2007) in which accessibility guidelines are treated as guidelines to be
        used when appropriate, and not as formal standards whose use is mandated.
        Further work (Kelly, 2008d) describes how this approach is particularly suited
        to a Web 2.0 environment in which content may be surfaced in a variety of
        environments (use of syndication technologies such as RSS, JavaScript widgets,
        etc.). This approach is based on the belief that universal accessibility is a
        false goal, as accessibility is dependent on complex issues such as the context
        and intended purpose of use, and not just the technical aspects of the Web
        resource itself. Rather than seeking universal access, the view is based on
      widening participation and social inclusion and seeking to ensure that the <i>purpose</i> of a service can be provided to the target audience. </p>
      <h2>More Answers: Shaping the Curve</h2>
      <p>The Gartner hype curve, a modified version of which is shown
        in Figure 1, provides a useful mechanism for understanding how new technologies
        may be perceived. This can help us to develop generic strategies which are
      appropriate at particular points on the curve when dealing with new technologies.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="kelly_figure-1.png" alt="figure 1" width="362" height="252"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: Gartner Hype Curve (modified)</p>
      <p><i>Early adopters</i> are
        the people who are technically savvy and are prepared to make do with (in fact,
        relish) beta versions which may be buggy, incomplete or inadequate in other
        ways. As the technology becomes more widespread, often with increased media
        coverage, it moves up the curve, before peaking at a point called the <i>Peak of Inflated Expectations</i>. Here
        media hype has expanded and extended the original reach of the technology to
        realms often way beyond those which are actually possible. Typically here we
      see the technology presented as somehow being a panacea. </p>
      <p>At around this time, or earlier, voices of dissent begin to
        be heard. The technology isn’t as good as the hype. Shortly afterwards, the
      technology begins an inevitable descent into the <i>trough of despair</i> – before leveling out to the <i>service plateau</i>. </p>
      <p>The technology <i>chasm</i> which is shown on the graph is often a critical time for any new technology.
        Given widespread understanding of how hype ebbs and flows, it is often during
        the rising phase that technology is at the highest risk of failing to gain a
        foothold in the mainstream. During this time, the challenges to organisations
      are at their most acute.</p>
      <p>In order to avoid potentially useful technologies’ failure
        to bridge this chasm, and also to reduce the time it takes for useful
        technologies to move from use by early adopters to more widespread use, there is
        a need to adopt an appropriate set of strategies. Expectations as to the
        capabilities of a particular technology or the difficulties which may be
        experienced need to be realistic. Similarly there is a need to minimise the
        &#39;trough of despair&#39; and to ease the transition to a stable service plateau –
      until, of course, the next disruptive technology arrives.</p>
      <h3>Avoiding the chasm</h3>
      <p>The following approaches may help to shape the Gartner hype
      in a Web 2.0 environment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Advocacy: </strong>It is not
          always true that IT innovation should be deployed in response to clearly
          articulated user requirements. The take-up of the Web in the early-to-mid 1990s
          was due to the potential which organisations identified once they had seen the
          Web and identified its potential to support current business requirements and
          to provide new services which hadn&#39;t been considered previously.</li>
        <li><strong>Listening to and
          addressing concerns</strong>: Advocacy of the potential benefits should be followed
          up by a period of listening to concerns and addressing issues raised. There
          need not, however, be a clearly identified solution to all of the concerns.
          Solutions may emerge as more experience is gained. Alternatively, concerns may
          not be as significant as initially thought.</li>
        <li><strong>Supporting enthusiasts</strong>:
          It is probably naive to expect everyone to be willing to accept a major new
          technological development. Rather than waiting to gain general acceptance, an
          alternative approach is to support those who are enthusiastic and who may still
          have concerns but would be willing to experiment.</li>
        <li><strong>Refining approaches</strong>:
          It is important to ensure that the experiences (positive and negative) gained
          by the initial adopters are noted, and refinements to a final service
          deployment are developed.</li>
        <li><strong>Doing a risk assessment</strong>:
          It may be a mistake to expect innovation to be completely risk free. Rather,
          any potential risks should be identified and assessed. There will be a balance
          between the risks associated with deploying an innovative service and the risks
          in doing nothing. The latter, for example, could be that one&#39;s competitors take
          the risks,  and your organisation is marginalised.</li>
        <li><strong>Managing expectations</strong>:
          The need to promote potential benefits in order to overcome inertia needs to be
          balanced against the need to avoid overselling the benefits of a technology or
          the effort needed to ensure that the technology is sustainable.<strong> </strong></li>
        <li><strong>Sharing experiences and
          expertise</strong>: Conferences and events (such as the <i>Museums and the Web</i> and the <i>Museums
            and the Web UK</i> conferences), mailing lists (such as the MCG JISCMail list)
          and resources (such as the UKOLN’s briefing documents) (<a href="../http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/qa-focus/documents/briefings/">UKOLN,</a> 2008a) can help managers, policy makers developers and practitioners in
          learning about innovations and sharing implementation experiences.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Avoiding the Trough</h3>
      <p>Once technologies become over-hyped there is a danger that
        disillusionment will set in when the technologies fail to live up to
      expectations. The &#39;trough of despair&#39; can be avoided by: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Low risk and low cost
          solutions</strong>: In a Web 2.0 environment in particular, there may be low risk
          solutions which can be deployed for little cost. Hosted services such as
          Bloggers provide resilient, flexible, and most important, free means to build
          Web 2.0 platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible business cases</strong>:
          At these early stages it can be useful to examine existing business models and
          reflect on the opportunities which new technologies may provide. For example,
          providing RSS feeds about the museum can allow third party aggregators to
          expose this information to their user community – which may result in visits to
          your physical museum from groups who might otherwise have proved difficult to
          reach.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality assurance</strong>:
          There will be a need to develop and deploy quality assurance procedures which
          document both policies for the service and systematic procedures to ensure that
          the policies are being correctly implemented.</li>
        <li><strong>Managed transition into a
          service environment</strong>: The enthusiasm innovators and early adopters may have
          is not likely to be sustainable when the innovation is deployed in a service
          environment. There will be a need to manage this transitional stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Migration</strong>: The
          planning stage for the deployment of a new service should also be the time when
          plans are made for the migration of the service to a new environment. This
          should include the export of data held in the system as well as testing
          processes for importing the data into alternative services.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk management</strong>:
          Migration of data is one aspect of a risk management strategy. A risk
          management strategy should also include aspects such as planning for server
          unavailability, dealing with performance problems, etc. </li>
        <li><strong>Openness and Transparency</strong>:
          A simple technique for minimizing possible risks associated with innovation is
          to be open with one’s user community. If a new service is being trialed, inform
          the users of this, and be honest about possible dangers. You may find that users
          appreciate being informed and involved in the experimentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional development</strong>:
          Ensure that those who are involved in the development work have suitable
          training. Also, ensure that other members of the organisation understand how
          Web 2.0 is being used and how possible risks are being managed.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>A Framework for Exploiting The Benefits Of Web 2.0</h2>
      <h3>The need for a framework</h3>
      <p>This paper has described various examples of best practices
        which seek to address the tensions between the benefits which Web 2.0 services
        may provide and associated risks and dangers. However, there is a need to
        describe a generic framework which can be used to assist the decision-making
      processes for a range of innovative Web 2.0 services.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="kelly_figure-2.png" alt="figure 2" width="284" height="357"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 2: Framework for Exploiting Web 2.0</p>
      <p>The framework is illustrated in Figure 2. It is based on
        seeking to reconcile possible tensions between the two main stakeholders: the
      institution and the user. </p>
      <p>The following components for the framework are used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Benefits</strong>: A description of the benefits for
          the organisation and for the user.</li>
        <li><strong>Risks</strong>: A description of the risks for the organisation and for the
          user.</li>
        <li><strong>Missed opportunities</strong>: A description of the missed opportunities and
          benefits for the organisation and for the user if the service is not used.</li>
        <li><strong>Costs</strong>: A description of the costs and resource implications
          associated with use of the organisation and for the user. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition,  define the particular <strong>use cases</strong> or <strong>intended
        purposes</strong> which are envisaged for the service. This is to acknowledge that
        there will be personal and organisational <strong>biases</strong> and <strong>other subjective factors</strong> when
      using the framework.</p>
      <h3>Applying The Framework 1: Use of Twitter</h3>
      <p>Let us explore how this framework can be used by applying it
        in a number of different contexts. The first example considers the factors an
        institution needs to consider when considering making use of the Twitter
      micro-blogging service.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Intended purpose:</strong> Marketing
          of museum events and other activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Benefits (institution):</strong> There are no licensing costs. Content
          creation costs will be low due to limited size of content. Will be able to see
          ‘followers’ and potentially contact them directly. In US/Canada content can be
          delivered for free via SMS. </li>
        <li><strong>Benefits (user):</strong> The end user (recipient) will be able to receive
          brief snippets of news from the museum without having to establish a ‘friend’
          relationship as is the case in many social networking services. In US/Canada,
          content can be received for free via SMS. </li>
        <li><strong>Risks (institution):</strong> The Twitter service is known to be unreliable,
          with content not always delivered in a timely fashion. The longer-term
          sustainability model for Twitter is uncertain. Not everyone will use or wish to
          use Twitter. </li>
        <li><strong>Risks (user):</strong> There would appear to be little risk for the end user,
          but if the user relies on delivery of Twitter messages, this may cause problems
          if the quality of the service deteriorates.</li>
        <li><strong>Missed opportunities (institution):</strong> Examination of uses made by
          various other museums illustrates possible benefits. Twitter may also provide a
          simple mechanism for providing content for delivery to mobile devices (e.g.
          iPhones) without having to initiative development work.  There may also be
          dangers that a Twitter ID associated with an institution is claimed by others.</li>
        <li><strong>Missed opportunities (user):</strong> The end users would miss out on the
          opportunity to receive information from institutions they may wish to develop
          links with.</li>
        <li><strong>Costs (institution):</strong> Low cost for
          simple usage. More effort may be needed if backend systems are needed to
          automate production and archiving of Twitter posts, although such additional
          development work tends not to be the norm currently.</li>
        <li><strong>Costs (user):</strong> As the numbers of Twitter users increases, the
          usefulness of the service may deteriorate.</li>
        <li><strong>Biases &amp; other subjective issues:</strong> Some Twitter users regard
          Twitter as primarily for building communities and connections, not marketing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let us now look at a second potential use of Twitter.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Intended purpose: </strong>To support community building and link with other
          museum professionals outside the institution.</li>
        <li><strong>Benefits (institution):</strong> The institution can gain from better
          informed staff.</li>
        <li><strong>Benefits (user)</strong>: One of Twitter’s key areas of usage is by early
          adopters in the development community. Providing a supportive framework which
          encourages developers to explore the potential of Twitter for engagement with
          peers may result in productivity gains and support professional development.</li>
        <li><strong>Risks (institution):</strong> Inappropriate Twitter posts could reflect
          badly on the organisation. The organisation may wish to keep close control over
          the management of its reputation. There may be dangers that time spent in using
          Twitter fails to deliver an adequate return on investment.</li>
        <li><strong>Risks (user):</strong> Use of Twitter may not be suited to everyone. Staff
          may feel alienated if they feel forced into use of Twitter.</li>
        <li><strong>Missed opportunities (institution):</strong> Not particularly applicable.</li>
        <li><strong>Missed opportunities (user):</strong> The user who may be prevented from
          using Twitter as a mechanism for collaboration and community support may lose
          these benefits and feel resentment. The user who chooses not to use the tool
          may miss out on a potentially useful tool.</li>
        <li><strong>Costs (institution):</strong> Costs in staff time. </li>
        <li><strong>Costs (user):</strong> As the numbers of Twitter users increases, the
          usefulness of the service may deteriorate.</li>
        <li><strong>Biases &amp; other subjective issues:</strong> Use of Twitter may not
          reflect a user’s preferred style of working. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It should be noted that to avoid the dangers of conflating
        several different intended purposes, which may have conflicting benefits and
      risks, the framework is applied for each distinct use case.</p>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>This paper has argued that the museum community needs to complement
        its initial experimentation with Web 2.0 with the development of approaches
        which identify potential risks and seek to manage (rather than eliminate) such
        risks. A framework being developed to support the management of such approaches
        has been described.  Chances of its success will be increased by input from
        practitioners across the museum sector. We welcome feedback and comments and
        invite readers to give their comments on UKOLN’s blog for the cultural heritage
      sector (<a href="../http://blogs.ukoln.ac.uk/cultural-heritage/)">http://blogs.ukoln.ac.uk/cultural-heritage/)</a>.</p>
