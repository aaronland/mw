      <h1>MoMo: A Hybrid Museum Infrastructure</h1>
      <h2>Javier Jaén, Vicente Bosch, Jose M. Esteve and Jose A. Mocholí, Polytechnic 
        University of Valencia, Spain</h2>
      <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">Museums are playing active roles in 
        modern societies beyond preserving a society's cultural heritage. They 
        have become an important learning environment, and some of them even are 
        tourist attractions. But traditional storytelling aids for museums consisting 
        of texts and labels may not be personalized to fit each individual personal 
        taste and are static sources of information. This paper explores the notion 
        of Hybrid Museum (HM) in which wireless personal digital assistants (PDAs) 
        are used to tailor content to the visitor to enrich both the learning 
        and entertainment experience. The customization and personalization of 
        the displayed contents is achieved by implementing a modified Partial 
        Prediction Matching algorithm and a distributed Ant Colony System algorithm 
        to find optimal itineraries within the museum, even with constrained time.</p>

        .NET</p>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>In the last few years, museum technology has experienced a revolution 
        with the arrival of handheld devices capable of enhancing visitors' experiences 
        by introducing multimedia content. This issue has been the focus of a 
        great number of studies and projects: iTour (Manning, 2004), the Multimedia 
        Tour (Wilson, 2004), GettyGuide (Marshak, 2003), MultiMuseum (Monaci &amp; 
        Cigliano, 2003), and Renwick (Larkin, 2004), among others. All these projects 
        have evolved from the traditional storytelling for adults to other types 
        of visits targeting audiences like children, teenagers, and art specialists. 
        However, despite these efforts, there is still a lot of work to be done 
        to obtain both dynamic, highly customizable, visits and simple mechanisms 
        to explore large collections of related data. </p>
      <p>In this paper we present the MoMo project, an example of a Hybrid Museum 
        (Jaen, 2003). The MoMo project includes a mechanism for browsing large 
        collections of explanatory items on PDAs and two different techniques 
        to obtain dynamic and customizable itineraries. The first is a technique 
        to analyze the behaviour of users when visiting different collections 
        and to build stochastic predictors that may populate art collections according 
        to their taste. The second is a natural algorithm (based on the behaviour 
        of ant colonies) to build itineraries that are time constrained and maximize 
        the number of popular artworks. These two proposed algorithmic approaches 
        prove that we can obtain dynamic itineraries that better fit any visitor's 
        taste and available time and increase the overall satisfaction of the 
        visitor using a Personal Digital Assistant in the museum.</p>
      <h1>Exploring Very Large Data Sets on PDAs</h1>
      <p>By definition, the User Interface is the meeting point between the user 
        and the program. Its design must take into account numerous elements which 
        contribute to the general goal of making it useful. Our aim is to design 
        the user interface for a multimedia navigation client on the PocketPC 
        platform. Generically, a navigation client must be able to guide the user 
        while browsing a vast amount of information, yet not overwhelm the user. 
        Therefore, the fundamental issue to be faced is <strong>how</strong> information 
        must be displayed so that it will be perceived and assimilated by the 
        user in the most effective way. Three main requirements that have to be 
        fulfilled by a multimedia content browser are functionality, simplicity, 
        and generality with flexibility.</p>
      <h2>Functionality</h2>
      <p>Usefulness should be the main goal at every moment. Graphic designers 
        should minimize their interface's learning curves, avoiding artificial 
        approximations which may not be intuitive for the users. By doing so, 
        we ease users' efforts when interacting with a software system and make 
        their experience more gratifying.</p>
      <h2>Simplicity</h2>
      <p>The information provided to the user must be synthesized and, if possible, 
        multimedia in nature. Multimedia information is very familiar to human 
        perception and, consequently, very attractive. We must take into consideration 
        that, although we may potentially navigate large amounts of information, 
        this process should be transparent to the user. Users are not able to 
        process large volumes of information simultaneously, and information will 
        generally be ignored if we overlook this fact. Thus, it becomes necessary 
        to rank or categorize information by applying criteria related to its 
        inherent semantics. It would not be beneficial, however, to go completely 
        in the opposite direction, and build an extremely compact and cryptic 
        interface. In summary, in this kind of application, the solution that 
        is designed must be intuitive enough so that every person is able to use 
        it, regardless of their background knowledge.</p>
      <h2>Generality and Flexibility</h2>
      <p>Our solution must be versatile enough that it will be able to adapt itself 
        to the range of domains in which it might potentially be used: museums, 
        monuments, conferences, etc. Moreover, it is desirable to include enough 
        flexibility to allow some degree of customization and information re-arrangement, 
        given the limited screen size of PDAs.</p>
      <p>Having these requirements in mind, we find current PocketPC application 
        design is still excessively poor. The particular characteristics of the 
        destination platform are usually disregarded in favour of portability 
        criteria. Actually most PocketPC applications are designed simply as reduced 
        versions of their equivalent desktop ones. </p>
      <p>Moving into our field, today it is still difficult to find good solutions 
        for Museums running on mobile devices. We have found the few existing 
        ones to be excessively based on PC solutions. Form-based interfaces are 
        usually chosen and, as a result, information appears to be compressed 
        into insufficient space. In the best case, we find Web-based designs that 
        instead of improving considerably the appearance of the austere interfaces 
        we have just mentioned, forget completely about supplying an easy and 
        useful navigation mechanism. We attribute this to two reasons: first, 
        the amount of information that can be displayed on a Web page is much 
        greater, and second, it is common practice to follow the design criterion 
        of minimizing the number of mouse clicks that must be performed to reach 
        every point of the Web. However, we must not forget that those design 
        criteria are suitable only for PCs. </p>
      <p>Therefore, applications that base their browsing mechanisms on a pure 
        image dump, saturating the available space, are more than questionable 
        in terms of usefulness. Even if we limit the number of visible elements 
        and provide graphical mechanisms such as sliders, we are only helping 
        with the management of a reduced number of elements. These approaches 
        force the user to perform a linear search on the contents, and effectiveness 
        is severely limited given the volume of information that has to be managed 
        in a museum. In our opinion, assuming that some sort of classification 
        is needed, this must not be just limited to a physical arrangement of 
        files, but extended to cope with more complex classification schemes so 
        that associations may be expressed in several ways, as in databases.</p>
      <p>Another important factor related to interface design for PDAs is that 
        pen-based interactions are much faster than their mouse-based equivalents 
        on desktops. Hence, we have to reformulate some of the design criteria, 
        like having a lower density of options in the screen to improve clarity 
        at the expense of requiring one or two additional pen clicks. Those concepts 
        have been applied in Museum-oriented solutions such as Sun Microsystems' 
        <em>Getty </em>project. But the usefulness of their PC solution is not 
        captured in the PocketPC equivalent. While information arrangement is 
        accomplished, we find two serious limitations. First, the nature of the 
        information is static, and therefore less attractive for the user. It 
        would be improved by seasoning the contents with interactive explanations 
        of what it is being presented. Second, by only including a <strong>Next</strong> 
        button for navigation, users are forced to perform a linear search, as 
        we commented previously, without the possibility of letting them explore 
        as they please.</p>
      <p>Even though it is necessary to provide enough versatility, we should 
        not forget that we are designing a content navigation tool and, therefore, 
        the main issue is the content itself. If we create a too complicated or 
        badly designed interface, the user would be excessively distracted by 
        the need to pay attention to the interface, getting disoriented rather 
        than concentrating on the displayed contents. We believe it is possible 
        to design complete solutions by extensively using hierarchical content 
        navigation, setting a clear way for the user to know how information is 
        organized. In our case, our approach can be described along several dimensions.</p>
      <h1>Information's Nature And Organization</h1>
      <p>One of our fundamental original requisites was that, for the best visiting 
        experience, multimedia data had to be provided to users. The information 
        that is supported in the current version consists of Macromedia Flash 
        movies and any other multimedia format supported by Microsoft Windows 
        Media Player, including video movies. As well, all these formats must 
        be totally integrated within the application interface such that it becomes 
        transparent to the user. In terms of organization of the information, 
        we used a graph topology so that it is possible to establish relationships 
        between any two arbitrary elements. The terminology we used in our project 
        calls the basic data packet<em> dissemination</em>. Disseminations are 
        associated by using ranked relationships called <em>collections</em> (Figure 
        1). This kind of associative arrangement allows different clustering levels 
        of information that the user may navigate. It is even possible to classify 
        the existing contents in accordance with the person's characteristics 
        (age, level of knowledge, preferences, etc). Our final goal is to give 
        the users just the information they may be interested in, adapting the 
        navigation to their characteristics without limiting the ways they may 
        want explore. Later in this paper we will discuss other mechanisms, besides 
        clustering, to personalize information for the end users.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="jaenfig1.jpg" width="400" height="222" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Clustered graph-like organization of information"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: Clustered graph-like organization of information</p>
      <h1>Content Navigation</h1>
      <p>In order to support content navigation, a hybrid scheme supporting both 
        fully guided visits and free navigation was created (Figure 2).</p>
      <p>The user may navigate in a fully guided manner by sequentially exploring 
        a set of proposed disseminations (<em>Horizontal Navigation</em>). These 
        sequential disseminations may either be statically preset or dynamically 
        generated, as we will present later, by some type of intelligent infrastructure.</p>
      <p>At any time during the visit, a user who wants to know more about a particular 
        <em>dissemination</em> may invoke the Navigation Browser. This browser 
        is populated by clustering information in terms of collections and analysing 
        the graph of available associations for the particular dissemination currently 
        being observed. In our current implementation, the potential visited collections 
        are <strong><em>Details about the artwork</em></strong>, <strong><em>Same</em></strong><strong><em> 
        historical context</em></strong><em> <strong>artworks</strong></em>, <strong>Previous 
        artworks</strong> (which inspired the present one), and <strong>Miscellany</strong>. 
        Entering a specific collection to know more about a particular dissemination 
        triggers a different mode of navigation known as <em>Depth Navigation</em>.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a><img src="jaenfig2.jpg" width="400" height="323" alt="Screen Shot: Types of Navigation"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 2: Types of Navigation</p>
      <p>Depth Navigation allows the user to explore associations between disseminations 
        at any level of nesting. Therefore, the user is not limited to following 
        the initial, fully guided, sequential disseminations, but rather can browse 
        the graph in a straightforward manner because information is clustered 
        in terms of collections. Internally, depth navigation is supported by 
        a navigation tree which stores the necessary data to allow the user to 
        step back to the previous dissemination (<strong>Previous</strong>), or 
        return to the dissemination from which Depth Navigation began (<strong>Home</strong>), 
        emulating this way a functionality offered in most Web browsers that are 
        familiar to average users. Moreover, there exists the possibility of performing 
        a completely random navigation by using a special pad to enter a random 
        artwork reference number. Once a user is located randomly at a given dissemination, 
        Depth Navigation is also available to explore other related disseminations.</p>
      <h1>The Interface and the Navigation Browser </h1>
      <p>Because of usability issues discussed earlier in this section, we have 
        tried to minimize the number of necessary navigation controls. We designed 
        a small navigation bar located in the bottom left corner of the PDA screen 
        to support Horizontal Navigation. The content is displayed in the central 
        part of the interface, with its own a playback controller. Moreover, in 
        the case of Flash movies, the client area responds to dragging and zooming, 
        controlled by the PocketPC stick, enabling the user to pay attention to 
        any especially interesting details.</p>
      <p>The Navigation Browser handles the Depth Navigation (Figure 3). The design 
        of this control was especially important; the main goal was to create 
        a versatile enough control that could be reused in any arbitrary PocketPC 
        application. Using an appropriate skin, the Navigation Browser is also 
        used in the Social Interaction module of our application, to display additional 
        functionalities. The control is formed by a central element which comprises 
        an image representing the current dissemination. Surrounding it, the icons 
        corresponding to the available associated collections are arranged in 
        radial disposition. Only a subset of the available options is shown simultaneously: 
        the user can navigate these options by rotating them around the central 
        element. There is also a <strong>fast scroll</strong> control designed 
        to help accelerate the search. (This is normally not necessary due to 
        the degree of hierarchy in the information.) The benefits of using this 
        control are immediate: the high degree of reusability accelerates the 
        learning curve for new users who just need to learn <strong>one</strong> 
        control.  Reuse also results in less coding, better program modularization, 
        and easier <strong>Look&amp;Feel</strong> updating. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig3" id="Fig3"></a><img src="jaenfig3.jpg" width="400" height="239" border="0" alt="Anatomy of Collections Browser"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig. 3: Anatomy of Collections Browser</p>
      <p>The browser implementation was, nonetheless, not trivial, since the current 
        version of the .NET compact framework does not natively support transparencies. 
        Hence, we created, by using low level calls, a new Windows control class 
        for the browser. This class supports animation and transparency features 
        over any kind of background, a feature that is currently not present on 
        any other PocketPC application.</p>
      <p>To summarize, the problems identified earlier have been solved in our 
        application by organizing information as a clustered graph which allows 
        the establishment of any kind of associations among disseminations. Content 
        is no longer limited to still images or text, but comprises all the multimedia 
        range supported by both Macromedia Flash and Windows Media Player. The 
        interface design is based on collection classification, supported by the 
        Navigation Browser and some intelligent components that provide users 
        with just the information they may be interested in, and finally, there 
        is an attractive and easy-to-use interface supported by new featured controls 
        not seen before on PocketPCs.</p>
      <h1>Predicting Visitors' Behaviour with Markov Models</h1>
      <p>Any PDA-based guidance application in museums of medium to large size 
        has the challenge of presenting user-relevant information from huge quantities 
        of data which in some cases might not be needed or wanted by the user, 
        e.g. a user might not care about the historical context in which an artwork 
        was made but might be interested in the painting process or in knowing 
        about other related previous pieces of artwork of the same creator. Therefore, 
        assuming that the explanatory items to be displayed in an itinerary are 
        categorized in clusters such as <strong>(history, details, previous artworks</strong> 
        ) it would be interesting to interpret how the user feels about these 
        categories so that only the information most likely wanted is provided. 
      </p>
      <p>To achieve this goal, we have implemented and tested a stochastic prediction 
        model which is based on high order Markov models. Prediction is performed 
        by partial matching (PPM) algorithms to provide with a guess as to the 
        user-preferred contents. This technique has also been used for data compression 
        and Web pre-fetching (Chen, 2003) but there are two major problems with 
        the algorithms that are applied in these contexts (see algorithm below).</p>
      <p>First, the Model is updated each time a "session" ends, and so it is 
        only helpful for the next session started by the same user. However, in 
        the museum setting users often use the prediction system once (during 
        a visit to a museum) and might never use it again.</p>
      <p>Secondly, a prediction is made by taking into account several m-order 
        Markov models (<em>contexts</em>). The effect of a particular context 
        in a prediction depends on its <em>goodness</em>, i.e., how well it performed 
        for past predictions. In typical settings, the goodness is determined 
        empirically by the creator so as to give out the best performance. However, 
        in our type of application we may eventually encounter many types of users, 
        and the goodness of contexts must be recalculated for each user. Consequently, 
        given that a visitor may change mood/mind while using the system, it is 
        clear that an adaptive run-time algorithm has to be defined to be able 
        to change the prediction parameters dynamically, and not statically as 
        is done in existing PPM algorithms.</p>
      <p>By finding solutions to these problems we have developed a highly adaptive 
        model that changes dynamically throughout the visit and does not need 
        to be initialized with information about past uses of the system by the 
        visitor. Initially, when we do not have information about the user, our 
        algorithm gets the first predictions from a system predictor that contains 
        the preferences of all the past users and, as the system acquires more 
        information about the user, it dynamically gives more importance to the 
        user model. </p>
      <p>The first problem stated earlier may be easily solved by updating the 
        context array incrementally each time a new event occurs (an artwork is 
        visited). This is done by adding the new event accordingly in the update 
        algorithm and also by modifying the confidence levels accordingly, as 
        we will discuss later. By doing this we have partitioned the updating 
        loop over time so predictions will be always made over the most recent 
        model. If the Model has "m" contexts and there are "n" possible events, 
        then the asymptotic cost of updating the model is O(m*n) . </p>
      <p>To solve the second problem, we associate a confidence level to each 
        possible event that can be reached from any other event; that is, the 
        confidence that event "x" having occurred at time "t", the event at time 
        "t+1" could be "y". The confidence levels are of course in the range [0,1] 
        and are initialized at 0.5. These confidence levels are updated each time 
        a new event arrives at the model. Knowing the latest predictions that 
        were made and observing the event that actually takes place the algorithm 
        may apply a corrective measure to the confidence levels of all participating 
        Markov contexts. Contexts that made accurate predictions increase their 
        confidence levels, whereas contexts that were wrong are penalized.</p>
      <p>To corroborate the correctness of our method, we will show a trace that 
        demonstrates how the predictions adapt over time to different patterns 
        of preferences. The trace has been performed with models of order 5, i.e. 
        using five Markov contexts that are updated after events of four types 
        of categories occur, and no system model has been used to obtain combined 
        predictions to appreciate in a short time scale the dynamic evolution 
        of the predictors.</p>
      <p>The graph in (Figure 4) shows how probabilities assigned to each category 
        evolve with a visit pattern of the form "1111222233334444" where each 
        number represents a different category of explanatory items. As long as 
        a user remains in a given category, the system massively populates this 
        category; the exploration of a different category in a greedy manner makes 
        a prediction that a new category is being explored thoroughly.</p>

      <h1>Planning Visits with Ant Colony Systems </h1>
      <p>In our application we also want to find the best subset of artworks to 
        be seen at the museum while not exceeding a time limit set by the visitor. 
        Each artwork takes a given amount of time to see, and there is also a 
        given amount of time spent for moving from one artwork to another. This 
        problem is known as the <em>orienteering problem</em>, where one needs 
        to find a subset of nodes in a weighted graph, with each node having a 
        value and weight, maximizing the sum of values while not exceeding a given 
        weight. In our case the nodes in the graph represent rooms in the museum; 
        the value of each node is the popularity of each room (based on feedback 
        from users); and the weight is the time it takes to visit a room.</p>
      <p>In order to solve this problem we have followed an Ant Colony System 
        approach (Liang, 2001). This approach is based on the fact that the behavior 
        of many species of ants is determined by indirect communication mediated 
        by pheromones. While searching for food, ants leave pheromones on the 
        ground forming a trail. It has been shown in many experiments, such as 
        the double bridge experiment (Deneubourg, 1989), that ants follow in a 
        probabilistic manner the paths with stronger concentrations of pheromones 
        which correspond to paths with shorter distances to food places. This 
        natural behavior has been formalized with a simple stochastic model by 
        (Deneubourg, 1989). This model has been the base for solving some minimum 
        cost or graph related problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem 
        (TSP) or the Orienteering Problem (OP) discussed here. </p>
      <p>The ACS is relatively easy to parallelize, in that each node can have 
        a number of ants running independently. At certain synchronization points, 
        the ants exchange information about their pheromone matrices to communicate 
        the results so far.</p>
      <p>There has been some previous work in adapting the ACS algorithm for the 
        orienteering problem (Liang, 2001), as well as a parallel approach of 
        the ACS for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) (Randall, 2002). 
        We here present an implementation combining these approaches in a parallel 
        implementation of the ACS for the orienteering problem.</p>
      <p>In the basic serial algorithm, each ant starts at the given start node, 
        and then selects a new node using one of two transition rules: exploitation 
        or exploration. In the first case the neighbouring node with the highest 
        attractiveness, determined by its distance, weight, score and pheromone 
        trail, is selected. If doing exploration, a random neighbor is chosen, 
        with higher probability given to nodes with higher attractiveness. This 
        process is repeated at each new node until either the new node is the 
        ending node or the available weight limit is exceeded, in which case the 
        ant returns to the ending node. This completes a tour.</p>
      <p>An on-line pheromone update rule is applied to each generated tour which 
        evaporates some pheromone to encourage exploration. In addition, after 
        all ants have completed a tour, the best tour is selected and pheromone 
        is added to the edges of this trail, while other edges have some pheromone 
        evaporate. The process is then restarted from the beginning in a new iteration 
        with the updated pheromone matrix.</p>
      <p>In our architecture, each node can have one or several ants running, 
        and several nodes can work in parallel. After receiving the starting and 
        ending locations, as well as the time (cost) limit, each node runs the 
        basic serial algorithm locally. After each node has completed a set number 
        of iterations, the best solution is picked and sent to the server for 
        comparison. The server picks the best solution of all the nodes and sends 
        this solution back. Each node applies the offline pheromone update using 
        this globally best solution. The nodes then return to executing the serial 
        version with the updated pheromone matrix. This process repeats until 
        the available execution time is exceeded or a set number of iterations 
        are completed.</p>
      <p>We ran a simulation of the algorithm on a standard PC for convenience; 
        this does not affect the results. Figure 5 shows the score obtained after 
        a set number of iterations using a randomly generated graph with 20 nodes, 
        and scores, costs and node distances in the range [0, 100]. We used several 
        runs and averaged the score to obtain the results. It can be observed 
        that increasing the number of ants in the colony (running a fixed number 
        of iterations) contributes to obtaining better solutions (solutions in 
        which the aggregated popularity of the visited artworks increases). Figure 
        6 shows another run: this time the number of iterations required to find 
        a solution with a minimum given score. A limit of 50 iterations was used 
        to avoid using excessive amounts of time on solutions which had converged 
        to a local optimum. In this case we observe that increasing the number 
        of ants reduces the iterations needed to reach the specified satisfaction 
        level (objective function). This is an important result if we consider 
        a multi-colony implementation where ants can be borrowed from remote nests 
        for a limited amount of time. </p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 5: Quality of the solution with varying size of ants</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="jaenfig6.jpg" width="415" height="277" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Effectiveness with varying size of ants"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 6: Effectiveness with varying size of ants</p>
      <p>In addition to these simulation results, our algorithm has also been 
        used with real museums with underlying graphs having more than 100 nodes 
        obtaining results within seconds. In Figure 7 we show a solution obtained 
        for El Prado museum (the biggest museum in Spain, consisting of three 
        floors). In this picture, popular rooms hosting painters like Velazquez, 
        Goya, Rubens, and others have been marked as red, less popular ones as 
        orange, and very unpopular ones as blue. It can be seen that with the 
        appropriate amount of visiting time the algorithm finds an optimal visiting 
        path in the museum that guarantees that all popular rooms are visited 
        and some less popular ones are also introduced. Therefore, visitors experience 
        a highly rich visit. It is important to note that in the current implementation 
        <strong>popularity</strong> (obtained by an e-voting system) is the only 
        variable that is used for optimization. In future versions of our algorithm, 
        other weighed metadata associated to artworks could be used. Finally, 
        it is interesting that solutions initially given to the user do not remain 
        static because the user may get ahead or behind schedule during a visit 
        to the museum. To equate visits calculated by ants to the changing timing 
        conditions, we have developed a mechanism of recalculation that is automatically 
        triggered whenever the system detects that the visitor is not following 
        the plan. This is done by measuring the actual time spent between requests 
        to the server and inferring from this information whether the user is 
        extending his visit or not. </p>

      <h1>Conclusions and Future Research</h1>
      <p>In this paper we have described MoMo, a Hybrid Museum infrastructure 
        that presents and enhances exhibits using Personal Digital Assistants. 
        We have claimed that existing infrastructures already exist but lack the 
        flexibility to accommodate content to the visitor's taste, do not cope 
        well with large collections of explanatory items, and do not take into 
        account the time available to visitors. Our approach stores the preferences 
        of the user in a stochastic prediction model which is based on high order 
        Markov models. Prediction is performed by partial matching (PPM) algorithms 
        to provide a guess as to the user's preferred contents. Additionally, 
        we also find the best subset of artworks to be seen while not exceeding 
        a time limit. This has been achieved by implementing a distributed Ant 
        Colony System running on PocketPCs, proving that utility computing infrastructures 
        may also be built into mobile devices. Our future research will include 
        the use of our infrastructure in other domains; and the implementation 
        of a generic multi-colony infrastructure for arbitrary mobile devices 
        that takes into account not only <strong>artwork's popularity</strong> 
        as the optimization variable, but also any other factors that could be 
        relevant in arbitrary domains. This generic infrastructure could be used 
        to solve many optimization problems by using spare computing cycles on 
        mobile devices in a grid-like fashion.</p>
