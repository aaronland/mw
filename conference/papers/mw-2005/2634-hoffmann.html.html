        <h1>Attraction by Interaction: Wiki Webs As A Way To Increase The Attractiveness 
          Of Museums' Web Sites</h1>
        <h2>Peter Hoffmann and Michael Herczeg,  Institute 
          for Multimedia and Interactive Systems, University of Luebeck, Germany</h2>
        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p id="abstract">Classical Internet Web sites are passive: visitors can 
          only read the information presented. There are several possibilities 
          to integrate interaction in Web sites with the goal of making visitors 
          feel more comfortable and letting them spend a longer time on the Web 
          site. Typical possibilities like trivia quizzes, interactive simulation 
          applets and more lack any creative potential. Some forms of modern communication 
          technology offer a wider range of interaction, but remain relatively 
          unknown and thus unused. Such  interaction is often more social. One 
          example is Wiki Webs, which are tools for collaborative work: the user 
          is part of a community and can add content to a Web site or edit existing 
          content. For museums, both virtual and real, Wiki Web technology can 
          be interesting because visitors are able to change the information content 
          of the exhibition in several ways, and thus leave their own individual 
          traces in the exhibition. The <em>Wikiseum of Bad Movies</em>, which 
          is introduced in this paper, is a virtual exhibition which uses the 
          interactive potential of Wiki Webs. It supports both a static exhibition, 
          where the visitor is really just visitor, and an interactive exhibition, 
          where the visitor can be active and interactively create the exhibition.</p>
        <p id="keywords">Keywords: interactive Web, social interaction, 
          Wiki Web, communities, collaboration</p>
        <h1>1   Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Internet is a passive medium. Internet users can only read the 
          information presented. Much research has shown, for example, that the 
          Internet user generally does not take the time to read longer texts. 
          If a way is found to give the visitor some possibilities of interaction, 
          the time spent on the Web site is easily extended (Nielson, 2000).</p>
        <p>There are several possibilities for interaction. Those which are typically 
          used give the visitors a chance to change parameters, e.g. to clarify 
          the laws of physics like the "interactive journey through modern physics", 
          created at the University of Colorado, Boulder (<a href="http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/index.pl" target="_blank">http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/index.pl</a>) 
          or the Web site of the "Phanomenta"-Exhibition in Luedenscheid, Germany 
          (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.phaenomenta.com/">http://www.phaenomenta.com</a>). 
          Another often used possibility, not only for younger users, is trivia 
          quizzes like the "Egg trivia Q's and A's" of the Provincial Museum of 
          Alberta (<a href="http://www.pma.edmonton.ab.ca/vexhibit/eggs/vexhome/ques1.htm" target="_blank">http://www.pma.edmonton.ab.ca/vexhibit/eggs/vexhome/ques1.htm</a>) 
          or the quizzes at the Web site of the Moneymuseum in Hadlaub, Switzerland 
          (<a href="http://mm3.moneymuseum.com/quiz/index.jsp?lang=en" target="_blank">http://mm3.moneymuseum.com/quiz/index.jsp?lang=en</a>).</p>
        <p>These possibilities look good but lack any real creative potential. 
          If the interaction on the site is merely answering questions in a quiz 
          or operating sliders, this activity is not creative. Some possibilities 
          for users to interact in a creative fashion were presented at the workshop 
          <em>Fresh and Interesting Features for any Budget</em> at Museums and 
          the Web 2004 (Drake 2004).</p>
        <p>Another way to  allow interaction  by visitors to a Web site is to 
          let them feel part of a community. In that community they can show their 
          knowledge on a topic, let others know about it, and even discuss things 
          presented by specialists. This way of interaction motivates visitors 
          in a very special way: it minimizes the barrier between the specialists 
          (here: the experts at museums) and the interested visitor.</p>
        <h2>1.1  Wiki Webs</h2>
        <p>Wiki Webs are interactive tools used as applications at the front end 
          of the Internet. As Bo Leuf and Ward Cunningham say (Leuf, Cunningham, 
          2001), Wiki Webs are "a freely expandable collection of interlinked 
          Web pages, a hypertext system for storing and modifying information 
          - a database, where each page is easily editable by any user with a 
          forms-capable web browser client." </p>
        <p>Ward Cunningham was the inventor of the Wiki Web idea and the developer 
          of the first usable Wiki Web software. With his software he started 
          in the year 1995 the primary Wiki Web which is named "WikiWikiWeb". 
          In Cunningham's own words (Cunningham 1995), the software was created 
          "for the Portland Pattern Repository. It is home to an Informal History 
          Of Programming Ideas, as well as a large volume of related discourse 
          and collaboration between its readers." It is still active up to this 
          day as a community for software developers and is used by interested 
          developers as a discussion platform throughout software engineering, 
          programming and all kinds of related subjects. </p>
        <p>Originally Cunningham developed the software in Perl. Since then,, 
          Wiki Web engines have become available in nearly every common programming 
          language and script language.</p>
        <p>The most popular project based on the Wiki Web idea is <em>Wikipedia</em> 
          with all corresponding sub projects like <em>Wikibooks</em>, <em>Wiktionary</em> 
          or the latest one, <em>Wikinews</em>, which is planned to be a free 
          and open news reader. The <em>Wikipedia</em> is a free-content encyclopedia 
          which is editable by anyone. The English version was started in 2001 
          and comprises currently more than 450,000 articles (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">http://www.wikipedia.org</a>); 
          besides the English version, there are versions in more than 100 languages, 
          with more than one million articles by September 2004. The project's 
          ambitious goal is to create a free and reputable encyclopedia. The project 
          is managed by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization which 
          is also responsible for the sub projects mentioned above. The people 
          who work on the platform and its content call themselves, proudly, Wikipedians. 
          It is a huge community of thousands of people, and it is still growing. 
          There are two possible ways to be a part of this community: anonymous 
          access or access with a registered account (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">http://www.wikipedia.org</a>).</p>
        <p>Generally, anyone who is able to edit a Web page, perhaps assisted 
          by the Wikipedia project's internal help pages, and has encyclopedic 
          knowledge to share, can work on the content. So it is not necessary 
          to register. What makes it expedient to register is its reputation, 
          especially for the quality work in the Wikipedia project. The users 
          of the Wikipedia trust entries from registered writers more than entries 
          from the unregistered because it is possible to see other entries edited 
          by that registered Wikipedian. This can lead to a positive and confident 
          use of the entry. Furthermore, it is more convenient to collaborate 
          with known people than with anonymous users. Without registration it 
          is harder to contact the person who has written an entry, to discuss 
          it. Anyone can create a user name and become a member in the Wikipedia 
          project. Even registered, the user remains anonymous because it is not 
          necessary to enter the real name or an email address.</p>
        <p>The Wikipedia and all of the surrounding sub-projects run GPL-ed free 
          software with the name MediaWiki. It is written in PHP, especially adjusted 
          for the project and its goals.</p>
        <h2>1.2  Weblogs vs. Wikis</h2>
        <p>For the public,  Internet Wiki Webs stand a little bit in the shadow 
          of a different but related technique, the weblog or blog. The differences 
          between weblogs and Wiki Webs centre around three basic points. </p>
        <p>A weblog is mainly administered by only one person, called a <em>blogger</em>. 
          This person is the only one who creates, edits, and changes items on 
          the weblog page. In the weblog page the blogger presents a selective 
          list of commented Web links. These comments on the links can vary from 
          just a single rating word to a whole comprehensive article. Sometimes 
          visitors have the chance to comment on the links and the bloggers' comments. 
          In general the weblog is a subjective view on the Internet, because 
          there is only one topic in the blog: the blogger himself, what he is 
          looking at and thinking about.</p>
        <p>In comparison with weblogs, Wiki Webs are, as a general rule, started 
          around a topic. The content of the Wiki Web is edited not just by one 
          single person but by a distributed group of editors and authors. Any 
          visitor can be a user, editor or author; anyone can introduce his own 
          knowledge to the Wiki Web. If there is at least a minimum number of 
          active users in the special Wiki Web community, the outcome is an objective 
          view of the topic. </p>
        <p>In Wiki Webs, users have not just the possibility of commenting on 
          links and comments. They have also the opportunity to change whole text 
          passages, to add texts to the existing one, and even to delete text 
          passages. For all that, they do not have to have any knowledge of HTML 
          programming. </p>
        <h2>1.3  Wiki Web Technology and Wiki Web Functionality</h2>
        <p>The technology used for Wiki Webs is a well known technology which 
          runs behind most dynamic Internet applications. It is based on basic 
          HTML elements and functionalities like forms, automatic word wrapping 
          and textual rendering. The HTML-Pages are generated by applications 
          running on the servers. The Wiki Web environment is an open authoring 
          system which can be used all over the world wherever there is Internet 
          access. The Wiki Web engine can be implemented in any programming language 
          able to handle dynamic content (i.e. a connection to a database or internal 
          data handling).</p>
        <p>Typically Wiki Webs have a number of common features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           Text formatting without HTML knowledge. 
            This includes as well the generation of links to pages in the Wiki 
            Web and links to images.</li>
        <li> 
           Automatic creation of new Wiki Web pages 
            by clicking a link.</li>
        <li>The <strong>BackLink</strong> function shows the list of all Wiki 
          Web pages which are linked  to the actual Wiki Web page.</li>
        <li> 
           The <strong>RecentChanges</strong> function 
            shows a chronological list of the last modifications on the actual 
            Wiki Web page.</li>
        <li>The <strong>full-text search</strong> offers a comfortable search 
          possibility in the content of the whole Wiki Web.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>These features are often adapted and supplemented to reach a special 
          goal of the single Wiki Web, as  MediaWiki does for the Wikipedia. Some 
          additional features are, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           Automatic archiving of all edited versions 
            of a single Wiki Web page.</li>
        <li>Some Wiki Webs offer the user more detailed possibilities to format 
          entries.</li>
        <li>Other Wiki Webs constrain certain users' read and write permissions.</li>
        <li> 
           Again, other Wiki Webs' <strong>RecentChanges</strong> 
            function is adapted so that simple modifications like typo corrections 
            and the like can be done without being archived.</li>
        <li>Some seldom-used Wiki Webs can be used for data storage by an upload 
          function for files.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>The demands for adaptation and extension of the technical possibilities 
          and functionalities of a Wiki Web come from the requirements of the 
          community which uses this special Wiki Web. As the topics Wiki Webs 
          are used for can vary widely, the user groups are very different too, 
          so the requirements of how to work with the Wiki Web can  vary very 
          much.</p>
        <h3>1.3.1 Actual Possibilities of Interaction in Wikis</h3>
        <p>The predominant content of most Wiki Webs is text. However, in many 
          Wiki Webs it is possible to inserts images and files as attachments 
          to single Wiki Web pages. So the set of offered interaction possibilities 
          is of course a mixture of known interaction in word processing environments 
          and web applications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The use of a button, e.g. for editing or to click on a link which 
          has not been used so far, opens an on-line editor for a Wiki Web page. 
          Often this is nothing more than a text area, such as standard HTML offers 
          for editing forms.</li>
        <li> 
           In the editor the user writes text; this 
            can be designed in very strict margins by including HTML and commands 
            offered by the Wiki Web in the respective syntax.</li>
        <li>Some Wiki Webs give the opportunity to include images with the text; 
          therefore a link to the image in the special syntax has to be included 
          with the text.</li>
        <li>The modifications are stored by using a <strong>Submit</strong> or 
          <strong>Process</strong> button.</li>
        <li> 
           As mentioned above, some Wiki Webs offer 
            the possibility of attaching images or files to the edited Wiki Web 
            page. This is normally not done in the text area, but by an external 
            upload button and dialogue.</li>
        <li>After submitting the modifications and uploads, the new and modified 
          Wiki Web page is generated and shown.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The workflow does not accord to WYSIWYG interaction. Even if the HTML 
          form text area itself supports WYSIWYG based text editing interaction, 
          (probably only in a simplified way),  the operational procedure is not 
          really WYSIWYG (Herczeg 1994). Not before the <strong>Submit</strong> 
        button is used can the author see the modifications he has made. Not 
        before that moment can the author spot possible errors like typos, incorrect 
        formatting and the like in the final context of the single Wiki Web 
        page. To correct the entry in the Wiki Web page, the author then has 
        to repeat the procedure mentioned above until the modification accords 
        to his notions.</p>
      <p>Targeted search for information within a Wiki Web is navigation in 
          the Wiki Web content. The interaction Wiki Webs maintain, therefore, 
          follows the normal interaction principles of browsing the Internet by 
          using links. The navigation and the support to prevent users from getting 
          lost in the Wiki Web content is in most Wiki Webs realized in at least 
        two ways.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The most important way is to give the user a known and secure point 
          from where he can restart again if he gets lost while exploring the 
          Wiki Web content. In the Wiki Webs this is a short but general list 
          of links to important Wiki Web pages: like a start page, a help page, 
          and so on. </li>
        <li>The second way is to show the user a history of the pages he has recently 
          visited, with at least the last three or four entries.</li>
        <li> 
          The interaction in a Wiki Web is a social kind 
            of interaction. Wiki webs offer the possibility to interact with a 
            community; they allow communication and collaborative work in this 
            community. Every entry in the Wiki Web is a contribution to the community 
            and enhances the integration of an individual into the community. 
            This furthermore increases motivation to visit the Wiki Web and the 
            community frequently.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <h3>1.3.2 The Data-Storage in Wiki Webs</h3>
        <p>Every Wiki Web page, even every version of a Wiki Web page and every 
          image and file attached to a Wiki Web page, has to be stored somewhere. 
          Only two ways are usable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           the entries, pages and files are stored 
            as plain ascii text files within the Wiki Web file system,   OR</li>
        <li>the entries, pages and files are stored in external databases like 
          MySQL, Oracle or the like.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>Importing  files into a Wiki Web which uses a database is easier than 
          importing into those Wiki Webs which do not. Importing data from one 
          Wiki Web to another Wiki Web can easily be done by the backup of the 
          database or by merging both databases. Therefore it is only necessary 
          that there be an adequate porting function or porting filter in at least 
          one of the two Wiki Web engines.  Then not even the Wiki Web engines 
          themselves have to be the same. Data which derives from a pure database 
          and which  will be imported into a Wiki Web is to be processed and prepared 
          in an appropriate way. This could be automatically done with the help 
          of specially developed software.</p>
        <p>If the data is stored within the file system of the Wiki Web, the importing 
          is more complicated. All files have to be converted to text files; images 
          have to be copied into the corresponding folder and then have to be 
          linked manually. For a big database, this means an immense effort.</p>
        <h1>2   The Wikiseum &#8211; Wiki Web Technology for (Virtual) Museums</h1>
        <p>Nearly every institution like a museum has a more or less large Web 
          presence. This is used for publishing the profile of the institution: 
          it gives an overview of the institution's research domains and an introduction 
          to available collections. Many of the Web presences choose to combine 
          both points by creating a virtual exhibit as a part of the Web presence, 
          where digitized exhibits are shown and explained. The offered interactivity 
          on those virtual exhibitions is the same as in all usual Web pages too:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           Links are the tools for the visitor to 
            navigate through the exhibition and of course through the whole Web 
            presence. The virtual exhibits can be linked in several relationships 
            the visitor may follow.</li>
        <li> 
           Some links offer an implicit <strong>Zoom</strong> 
            function when an image is opened on a new page or in a new window 
            in larger size. This function is sometimes combined with the use of 
            HTML image maps, so that only parts of the image are zoomed or commented 
            on.</li>
        <li>Some links refer to time-based media and the players for that media. 
          The further interaction then is to start or stop the player or close 
          it at the end.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>Even if it is well known and accepted that interactivity can enhance 
          a Web presence in a way which motivates visitors to stay longer on the 
          Web, it seems to be difficult to find appropriate forms for the use 
          of interactivity in serious Web sites. Interactivity related to Web 
          presences is in most cases separated from the presentation of the content 
          and considered as a gimmick or just a gadget. Very often the idea of 
          interactivity is reduced to games, even oftener for younger visitors. 
          Only in some circumstances are games really related to the topic of 
          the virtual collection; this is mainly when technical or scientific 
          aspects are the collection domain and the games explain, for example, 
          the laws of gravity or the like (Fiesser 2001).</p>
        <p>Beside the possibilities games of all kind offer, there is another 
          alternative to give the visitors the chance of getting involved and 
          motivating them to explore the Web site: it is to give them the chance 
          to get creative and to show personal knowledge, and so to let them become 
          part of an "expert" community where they can discuss things and where 
          they even can show creativity. This is what technologies like the Wiki 
          Web technology provide.. The combination of the usual Web presence and 
          classical virtual exhibits with highly interactive Wiki Web-based parts 
          could be called a <em>Wikiseum</em>.</p>
        <p>A Wiki Web context could give visitors to an institution's or a museum's 
          Web site the feeling that they are not just simple visitors. In fact, 
          they can become part of the museum's community and so get closer to 
          the experts and researchers. They can share and discuss their  knowledge, 
          with the possibility of publishing this knowledge in the museum's Wiki 
          Web, and furthermore, with the possibility of attaching files, probably 
          media files, and designing parts of the Wiki Web page, as far as the 
          Wiki Web allows that.</p>
        <p>All those possible activities may boost the visitors' motivation to 
          stay longer and dig more deeply  into the Web site. They may be more 
          curious and look more closely at the exhibits and the whole exhibition. 
          Finally, this may lead to more curiosity about the real exhibits and 
          a higher readiness to visit the museum in reality.</p>
        <h2>2.1  Users' Roles</h2>
        <p>The Web presence of an institution or a museum is an administered project. 
          The content of the Web site has to be accurately selected, processed 
          and designed and must not be changed by <em>simple</em> visitors. This 
          stands in contradiction to the idea of the Wiki Web where everyone can 
          change everything.</p>
        <p>In the Wikiseum this conflict is resolved by providing different kinds 
          of users with different levels of permitted interaction possibilities: 
          not every user may do everything. In addition, the Wikiseum supports 
          these user roles during both aspects, the editing and the visiting. 
          During the editing, only the kind of interaction and design possibilities 
          are provided which accord to the specific user role. If a page of the 
          Wikiseum is visited, it reveals  which class of user edited the page 
          and made the single entries. So it is easily possible to identify if 
          an article derives from an administrator or a visitor, and this makes 
          the differences transparent.</p>
        <h3>2.1.1 The Administrator</h3>
        <p>The administrator is allowed to do everything. He is the one who plans 
          and arranges the virtual exhibition and designs it as well. This includes 
          decisions about what virtual exhibits are shown, how the virtual exhibits 
          are arranged and commented on, and to which other virtual exhibits or 
          parts of the Wikiseum they are linked. So the administrator offers a 
          fixed and at  that  level not changeable exhibition as a start for the 
          Wikiseum community. The contents  and the comments have at least a minimum 
          level of expert knowledge with a maximum reputation, because the administrator 
          of course is an expert in that context. </p>
        <p>The linking, done by the administrator, has amongst other things, the 
          task of marking a main guided path through the virtual exhibition: it 
          leads to the most important articles. So it is an aid for navigating 
          through the content of the Wikiseum. Without these links a visitor might  
          get lost.</p>
        <p>Everything an administrator does, regarding design as well as uploads, 
          endures until  another user of the administrator class edits or deletes 
          the article. Besides the influence on the content, the administrator 
          is permitted to manage as many kinds of users as there are visitors, 
          moderators and further administrators. The role of the administrator 
          includes the functionality of all other user roles.</p>
        <h3>2.1.2 The Moderator</h3>
        <p>The moderator is allowed to do nearly everything. He has no influence 
          on the content and the design of the virtual exhibit, but he has to 
          supervise it. His work can be seen as a kind of quality management. 
          This includes also questions about the legality of the articles and 
          the uploaded attachments. The moderator takes a look at edited and new 
          articles and releases them if they meet the demands of the Wikiseum  
          in substance as well as in style. Furthermore, he has the power to mark 
          the articles, and edits regarding durability with a flag, controlling 
          whether they shall be archived or not. This influences how long an entry 
          is  seen on the Wikiseum page and whether the entry will be stored in 
          a user archive when the exhibit has reached its maximum durability.</p>
        <p>To rate and handle the entries of the users and visitors in an adequate 
          way, the moderator has to have expert knowledge in the field of the 
          virtual exhibit. Furthermore, the moderator manages visitor registrations. 
          The role of the moderator includes the functionality of all other user 
          roles of the lower levels.</p>
        <h3>2.1.3 The Visitors</h3>
        <p>Administrators and moderators are user roles with official functions 
          and the power of  actions with large-scale influence. </p>
        <p>Visitors can be any users surfing the net and stopping at the Wikiseum. 
          This group is a heterogeneous one; it is impossible to say what kind 
          of visitor is about to visit the Wikiseum. But visitors can be divided 
          into two classes. The goal is to be able to  differentiate between the 
          casual and transient public and the more interested who are  visiting 
          the Wikiseum more frequently and maybe with greater previous knowledge.  
          This division can be seen as another kind of  basic quality management 
          of the entries done by the visitors.</p>
        <p>The entries of both visitor groups differ from each other and furthermore 
          from those of the administrators and the moderators. So it is easily 
          recognizable from which class of user an entry derives.</p>
        <h4>2.1.3.1     Registered Visitors</h4>
        <p>The registered visitor is allowed to do many things, and what he does 
          may endure for a long time. Possibly an entry may be assumed into the 
          permanent virtual exhibition; if this happens, it will be marked in 
          a way that it is still identifiable as a visitor entry.</p>
        <p>Registered visitors are frequent guests on the Wikiseum and visit it 
          regularly. They are very interested in the domain of the Wikiseum and 
          have adequate knowledge or want to improve it. They are more or less 
          able to discuss things in the context on a higher level with the experts, 
          as the moderators or administrators are.. For that reason they choose 
          to register by name, nickname, an email address and a password. This 
          gives them the opportunity to be seen and to feel  part of the community, 
          as each entry  is signed. </p>
        <p>With small differences, the interaction possibilities of the registered 
          visitors are the same as those  of the unregistered visitors. By discarding 
          anonymity, the registered visitors acquire permission to insert links 
          which may lead to URLs outside of the Wikiseum and to insert attachments 
          like media files to their entries. These are both sensitive interaction 
          possibilities with perhaps legal effects; e.g. on copyrights, citations, 
          critical content on other Web sites and so on. This should only be possible 
          for visitors who are known by name and at least email address. </p>
        <p>A less sensitive possibility offered to the registered visitors is 
          to create and publish their own guided tours beside the tours offered 
          by the administrator. With that opportunity the registered visitors 
          show other visitors a set of exhibits in a special sequence, and other 
          visitors may follow these tours and see these special collections.</p>
        <h4>2.1.3.2     Unregistered Visitors</h4>
        <p>Unregistered visitors are allowed to do few things, and everything 
          expires after a short time. They can be seen as casual visitors or visitors 
          with less concern about the domain of the Wikiseum; otherwise they would 
          register. With less interest, it is assumed that their knowledge is 
          not very detailed. So the relevance of their entries is not as high 
          as that of the registered visitor. Analogous to the registered visitor, 
          there is the chance that a moderator rates the unregistered visitor's 
          entry as good and expands the durability or even accommodates it in 
          the permanent virtual exhibition.</p>
        <p>Because of  legal aspects, the unregistered visitor is not allowed 
          to insert external links and attachments like media files to his entries. 
          The unregistered visitor stays anonymous; his entries are not signed 
          with his name. He is only a guest and not really a part of the community.</p>
        <h2>2.2  Interaction in the Wikiseum</h2>
        <p>The interaction possibilities can roughly be divided into two classes: 
          interaction for managing the Wikiseum, which also includes the generation 
          of whole new exhibitions, and interaction for handling, generating and 
          designing the content of the Wikiseum. The first is aimed to the operators 
          and does not have any effect for the visitors.</p>
        <p>The visitors' interaction possibilities are all party to the second 
          group mentioned above and mainly known from other Wiki Webs. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           Visitors may write textual comments on 
            explanations to exhibits as well as on other visitors' comments. </li>
        <li> 
           In a very elementary manner it is possible 
            to format the written text: only line breaking and highlighting parts 
            of entries can be influenced. </li>
        <li>Into the comments links can be inserted: unregistered visitors are 
          only allowed to insert internal ones, while registered users may also 
          insert external links.
          Any link leads to another exhibit which stands in a certain relation 
          to the commented one. The virtual exhibition can be influenced in such 
          a way that existing tours are changed, extended or shortened.
          Registered visitors are able not only to expand a tour, but also to 
          expand the whole virtual exhibition by inserting links to external exhibits 
          which were not part of the exhibit thus far. To emphasize the externality, 
          those links are always opened in a new window.</li>
        <li>Registered users can insert attachments like media files to their 
          comments.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>Not every Wiki Web engine offers all kinds of interaction possibilities 
          as shown in section 1.3. For the realization of the Wikiseum, a Wiki 
          Web engine was chosen which is in the offered functionality as close 
          as possible to the desires of the Wikiseum. Furthermore, the source 
          code is free and open to expansion and to adapt the Wiki Web engine. 
        </p>
        <p>The chosen engine is the JSPWiki (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.jspwiki.org/">http://www.jspwiki.org</a>), 
          a Wiki Web engine written in Java using Java Server Pages, so it is 
          easy to adapt existing functions and to expand with some new ones. The 
          main technical work was  done on the following points.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           The skill to label articles and entries 
            due to the user class was integrated.</li>
        <li>A registration tool was integrated to manage the visitor registrations 
          in a secure way.</li>
        <li> 
           The possibility was integrated to choose 
            what articles and entries are shown. So it is possible to get only 
            articles and entries of administrators or selected other visitors 
            presented. There is also the possibility of hiding or presenting all 
            articles and entries of a whole user class.</li>
        <li> 
           Selected Articles can be watched. If such 
            an article is edited, interested registered visitors are informed 
            about it with an email.</li>
        <li>The possibility not only to insert images but also to add audio and 
          video attachments was integrated.</li>
        <li>The possibility to insert image maps from standard HTML was integrated.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <h2>2.3  Expected Advantages of the Wikiseum</h2>
        <p>Another new feature is to be integrated into the Wikiseum engine. It 
          is a tool for logging the visitors' actions and paths for an evaluation, 
          seeing how the visitors behave and how long they visit the Wikiseum 
          and the single Wikiseum pages. For the evaluation of the visits, a short 
          Web-based questionnaire is be drafted and installed.</p>
        <p>It is expected that visitors browse a longer time through the Wikiseum 
          using its functions. The offered possibility to become creative ought 
          to lead to increased motivation to explore the virtual exhibit more 
          precisely. The chance to show individual knowledge should furthermore 
          lead to many entries or even to discussions between visitors and maybe 
          experts. Both changing something in a creative way and showing what 
          you have learned is more fun and entertaining than simply consuming 
          static Web pages. All points together of course should, last but not 
          least, arouse curiosity for a visit to the real museum and exhibition.</p>
        <h1>3   The Wikiseum of Bad Movies     </h1>
        <p>To have a first Wikiseum for testing the developed Wiki Web engine 
          and for the evaluation of the visitors' behaviour later on, a domain 
          was needed where an exhibition could be created without very specialized 
          knowledge as, for example, in the arts or the like;  the virtual exhibition 
          should be created without the explicit help of any museum. The advantage 
          of this is that the virtual exhibition is easy to adapt, if necessary, 
          because it is local, and no external administrator has to be incorporated.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="hoffmann.fig1.thumb.jpg" width="400" height="400" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: The Wikiseum of Bad Movies"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig. 1 The Wikiseum of Bad Movies</p>
        <p>The domain chosen is  bad movies: the Wikiseum of 
          Bad Movies. This topic has the advantage that personal interest and 
          knowledge of the movies, and especially bad movies, could flow into 
          the creation of the Wikiseum.  Also, it is easy to find multimedia elements 
          for that topic. But most important, movies and especially bad movies 
          give nearly everyone the possibility to have something to say. So it 
          should be easy to reach a sufficient number of visitors for later evaluation.</p>
        <p>The virtual exhibition of the Wikiseum of Bad Movies. The "Foyer" is 
          the entry and exit page; from here every part can be reached - all guided 
          tours start from here:          </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The Razzie path</li>
          <li>The Monster path</li>
          <li>The Goofs path</li>
          <li>The Ed-Wood 
                    path</li>
          <li>The Short Highlights path</li>
          <li>The Behind the Curtain Path.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The visitor enters through the Foyer page. Here general information 
          about the Wikiseum and the exhibition is offered, and all parts of the 
          virtual exhibition are reachable. Also, all guided paths of the administrator 
          start here</p>
        <p class="listwithbullets">The paths through all of the several parts: 
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <strong>Monster </strong>path, where the Japanese movie monster 
          Godzilla and all of his fellows are shown, as well as information about 
          the films and the film studios who produced those movies,</li>
        <li>
           the <strong>Goof'</strong>s path, where 
            really good movies are shown, but with all the mistakes taking place 
            in the movie, </li>
        <li> 
           the <strong>Ed Wood</strong> path, which 
            introduces a man and his obsession,</li>
        <li> 
           the <strong>Razzie</strong> path, with 
            some examples of movies awarded the "Golden Raspberry". </li>
        <li> 
           The <strong>Short Highlights</strong> 
            path is a guided tour through some selected highlights of all parts 
            of the Wikiseum.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Path-Behind-the-Curtain</strong> introduces the idea and 
          the technique of the Wikiseum.</li>
      </ul>
      
        <p>If visitors leave the Foyer of the Wikiseum through the Foyer, feedback 
          forms are offered to them, so that they are interviewed and can rate 
          the Wikiseum and the virtual exhibit. This feedback form, together with 
          the logged behaviour, is the basis for the later evaluation.</p>

        <p class="caption">Fig. 2: Different content can be inserted by visitors and administrators and 
          can also be combined by inserted links to guided paths.</p>
        <h1>4   Future Work</h1>
        <p>With the realization of the Wikiseum engine and the publishing of the 
          Wikiseum of Bad Movies, the first part of the project is done, and the 
          second part starts. This is the evaluation phase, during which the feedback 
          of the visitors is analyzed to improve both the technique of the Wikiseum 
          engine and the content and composition of the virtual exhibition. The 
          duration of this phase depends on the number of visitors.</p>
        <p>With an improved Wikiseum engine and interpreted evaluation, another 
          Wikiseum is planned, this time in one of Luebeck's &quot;real&quot; 
          museums. Parallel to it, the Wikiseum of Bad Movies will still exist 
          and be evaluated throughout a longer time in terms of user behaviour 
          and acceptance.</p>
