        <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Examine the Mona Lisa up-close while listening to professional commentary. 
    View an old movie of Ansel Adams climbing up to the "Diving Board". Flip through 
    pages of the Gutenberg Bible and listen to music of the period.</p>
  <p>The power of experiencing history, art and music in such multimedia expressions 
    is undeniable, and yet creating such a rich experience from scratch is extremely 
    labor intensive. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art faced just that challenge 
    in the creation of its <em>Making Sense of Modern Art</em> exhibit. Their solution 
    was to create an authoring tool to facilitate the assembly of media-rich on-line 
    exhibitions. Thus was <em>Pachyderm 1.0</em> born.</p>
  <p>Pachyderm became very successful within SFMOMA and was used to generate more 
    than 10 extensive on-line multi-media presentations. As is commonly the case 
    with successful prototypes, its users found it indispensable, while at the 
    same time it was running into the limitations of its quick design and development. 
    Users inside and outside of SFMOMA loved Pachyderm, but they wanted more than 
    it could deliver. It was time to take the prototype and build a carefully 
    architected, extensible system within which future features could be more 
    easily developed.</p>
  <p><em>Pachyderm 2.0,</em> based on the SFMOMA's original, is well underway now 
    as part of a partnership led by the New Media Consortium and SFMOMA and funded 
    by the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The project brings 
    software development teams and digital library experts from six NMC universities 
    together with counterparts from five major museums throughout North America 
    to build a tool well suited to both the museum and the university environments. 
  </p>
  <h1>Interface Design</h1>
  <p>The first version of the Pachyderm authoring system was built to maximize 
    the quality of the finished presentation, not to optimize the author's experience 
    while creating the presentation. Its user base was very small; SFMOMA authors 
    became so familiar with the quirks and inefficiencies of the authoring system 
    interface that they hardly noticed them anymore. Early user tests proved however 
    that this would not be the case for the larger audience. A goal of the Pachyderm 
    2.0 Project was to retain the power and potential of SFMOMA's original Pachyderm 
    authoring system, with a simplified interface to enable a wide variety of 
    users to create strong presentations.</p>
  <p>In order to facilitate the easy creation of presentations in Pachyderm, the 
    team has employed a few standard, proven methods of design. According to designer 
    and educator Philip B. Meggs (1992), the design process is a sequence of events 
    that begins when the designer receives an assignment and continues until the 
    problem is solved and the solution is accepted and implemented. The process 
    includes defining the problem, gathering information, searching for effective 
    ideas, deciding on a solution and finally implementing.</p>
  <p>Design of the new authoring screens was based on the existing tool in use 
    by SFMOMA and on the results of many discussions with the main user groups 
    of the software; namely, museum curators and university faculty. In addition, 
    the need to implement new features and functionality required redesigning 
    portions of the authoring process.</p>
  <p>The first goal of the design effort was to define the authoring workflow. 
    Working with a variety of tools that ranged from iChat and Breeze screen-shares 
    to markers on butcher paper, the development team worked through iterations 
    of the flow of authoring, determining the easiest and quickest succession 
    of screen interactions. The team created a flowchart document for various 
    users with boxes, lines and arrows based on target user groups and scenarios 
    of how certain people would use Pachyderm. By using such a graphical representation 
    of author workflows, the team was able to ascertain the best order for all 
    the interlinking screens, getting a user from the left side of the flowchart 
    to the right using the fewest number of boxes, or tasks.</p>
  <p>In this stage of the design came the first major departure from Pachyderm 
    1.0. The SFMOMA workflow had authors creating individual presentation screens 
    first, linking them to each other, and then finally grouping them together 
    as a presentation. The development team decided to reverse the process. First 
    an author creates a presentation, with a title and description and then they 
    create screens within the presentation. This ordering better reflects the 
    project-based approach of the target audience.</p>
  <p>Once the workflow was established, the team began to sketch out the individual 
    interface screens in the interest of creating a basic graphical system with 
    attention to all the elements that needed to be on the screen, such as navigation 
    and software controls like <strong>save</strong> and <strong>delete.</strong> </p>
  <p>Special attention was paid to the interface for creating and editing presentation 
    screens since authors spend considerable time on this task. Pachyderm 1.0 
    uses an approach based on HTML forms for authoring presentation screens. </p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="laMar.fig1.jpg" width="400" height="429" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: The original forms-based interface"/></p>      <p class="caption">Fig 1: The original forms-based interface </p>
  <p>In early meetings the team sketched out visions of something far more powerful. 
    Given the increased sophistication of modern browsers using JavaScript, authors 
    could be provided with drag-and-drop functionality for adding their media 
    into a screen template. As the idea developed further, concerns were raised 
    that while this would be adding power, it might also be adding complexity 
    that would detract from the straight-forward authoring model that endeared 
    Pachyderm to many. The team conducted user tests and found that indeed, users 
    preferred the forms-based approach. They liked to be able to clearly identify 
    all the <strong>slots</strong> into which data could be entered. Given this feedback, 
    the team made an unusual decision in software design &#8211; the cool technical 
    gadget was dropped in favor of the simpler approach. </p>

        <p class="caption">Fig 3: Mockup of the updated forms-based interface resulting 
          from user feedback</p>
  <p>The next stage called for turning the designs into a standards-compliant 
    xhtml format that could be read by Web browsers, where the actual authoring 
    will take place. This included mocking-up the screens with actual Web form-based 
    buttons and controls and straightforward color and design treatment. The programmers 
    on the team then took control of these screen designs and made them function 
    by marrying the xhtml coding and programming elements. The testing of these 
    working screens is underway at the time of this writing.</p>
  <p>During this testing time, the team is paying particular attention to feedback 
    on issues of usability and accessibility, with an eye to moving closer to 
    a parity of visual design between the authoring and presentation screens. 
    The interface design cannot be considered complete until it has been proved 
    usable by the intended user group.</p>
  <h1>Software Architecture</h1>
  <h2>Historical Overview</h2>
  <p>Since Pachyderm 1.0 was created to solve a set of needs internal to the SFMOMA, 
    the developers had a certain amount of leeway in the decisions they could 
    make in terms of platform architecture. They selected tools that would allow 
    them to build the software faster, and integrate it with the existing SFMOMA 
    collection management database. The tools they chose to use, however, created 
    dependencies that were very specific to the SFMOMA environment. These dependencies 
    included Windows IIS, ASP, Visual Basic, Windows 2000 Server, SQL Server, 
    Macromedia Generator 1.0, and Filemaker 5.</p>
  <p>As additional on-line versions of exhibits were needed, the Pachyderm 1.0 
    software was adapted and extended, with pieces being added to support new 
    functionality. The original system was not designed with extensibility as 
    a primary consideration, and the consequences were such that both the database 
    schema and the source code grew large, fragmented and difficult to maintain.</p>
  <p>The team knew from the conception of the Pachyderm 2.0 project that two key 
    enhancements would need to be made to the original product: platform independence, 
    and extensibility of the template set. Platform independence would allow Pachyderm 
    to be installed and run on servers with different operating systems, different 
    Web servers and different database applications. Template set extensibility 
    meant that future authors would be able to add new templates, or presentation 
    screen types, to the original set of 12 that SFMOMA designed.</p>
  <h2>Refactor or Rebuild</h2>
  <p>When a software prototype is developed into a full, robust application, there 
    are two accepted paths of development. The first is to throw away all the 
    old code and rebuild from the ground up. This is the more traditional approach; 
    what results is known as a "throwaway prototype." The assumption is that the 
    developers will have learned a lot from coding the prototype and they will 
    be able to build it better the second time around. A newer approach is to 
    refactor the old code. This method involves isolating functional sections 
    of the code (or modules) and carefully rewriting them piece by piece while 
    maintaining the functionality of the whole application. </p>
  <p>Refactoring has the advantages that the software as a whole continues to 
    function throughout the process, making testing much easier, and that the 
    engineers are working intimately with the original code and thus not losing 
    any lessons learned the first time around (Spolsky, 2000). Given the small development budget, the ambitious time 
    line and the fact that the team programmers were not the original developers 
    of Pachyderm 1.0, refactoring seemed to be the most practical approach. It 
    meant that the team would not have to re-solve problems that the original 
    developers had already solved very well, and that something deliverable would 
    always be there in case development fell behind schedule. Since Pachyderm 
    1.0 was developed in Active Server Pages (ASP), a proprietary Microsoft language, 
    the team knew that in addition to refactoring, the code would have to be ported 
    to a platform-independent language. Thus the original approach was dubbed 
    "Port and Refactor."</p>
  <p>The first effort proved to be a sanity check on the whole approach. The team 
    took the prototype code, still in ASP, and created a version that could be 
    installed on a Windows server outside of SFMOMA. This turned out to be surprisingly 
    difficult. The team found that the old code relied not only on specific proprietary 
    software, but in fact also on specific outdated versions of that software. 
    By the time the "Pachyderm 1.1 Rhino" release, a Windows server installable 
    version of the software, was produced, the team had learned enough to reconsider 
    the whole development plan.</p>
  <p>Through the development of the Pachyderm 1.1 version, the team began to analyze 
    the database schema and software design. As they waded into the source code, 
    the team realized that both the software architecture and the database schema 
    were dependent upon the twelve existing templates. In order to add a new template 
    to the system, new authoring and publishing code would have to be written 
    specifically for that template, and new database tables would have to be designed 
    and implemented. Clearly the system was not set up to allow for template set 
    extensibility. The team realized at that point that the "Port and Refactor" 
    approach would not work. Instead, the team needed to redesign and rebuild 
    the software architecture and database schema to make them both template-independent.</p>
  <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
  <p>Having committed to a much more extensive re-write of the application, the 
    team needed to decide on a basic software architecture and a development platform. 
    To support the need for a template-independent architecture, the team developed 
    a component-based approach. A component in this sense is a basic data element 
    of a presentation screen. Thus an image or a block of text would be a component. 
    If the system could be built so that it knew how to deal with all the major 
    components used in the core template set, it would also support new templates 
    that utilized the same components in different configurations without requiring 
    any new coding in the authoring system or the database.</p>
  <p>The selection of a development platform, on the other hand, needed to reflect 
    the goal of creating a platform-independent application. The development platform 
    includes the language in which the software is coded as well as any pre-existing 
    applications or frameworks upon which the software will depend. To help in 
    making this decision, the team created a matrix of possible platforms, listing 
    pros and cons for each suggestion, including issues of expertise, ease of 
    use, ease of learning, stability and scalability, and the ability to leverage 
    work already available in the suggested platform. </p>
  <p>At the time, the "highest risk" component was Macromedia Generator, used 
    to compile images with associated metadata and publishing these in Flash (.swf) 
    format. The Generator product was discontinued several years ago and is no 
    longer commercially available. Without a functional replacement, it would 
    not be possible to publish the Flash-formatted media that are essential to 
    a Pachyderm presentation. The search for replacements led to the jGenerator 
    project - an open-source Java library designed to be a drop-in replacement 
    for Macromedia Generator. This jGenerator library was identified as the only 
    reliably functioning Generator replacement.</p>
  <p>One of the requirements for Pachyderm 2.0 involved the ability to demonstrate 
    database independence. The system needed to be able to connect to a variety 
    of database servers, including Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Filemaker, and 
    potentially many others that had yet to be identified. The primary software 
    development platform that offered this level of database independence and 
    about which the development team as a whole had a significant amount of institutional 
    knowledge was Apple"s WebObjects application server. WebObjects is a java-based 
    set of frameworks and applications, including a database management framework 
    called <em>Enterprise Objects Framework</em> (EOF). EOF would be able to take 
    care of the "heavy lifting" of connecting to various databases, and would 
    allow the team to focus more on application-level development.</p>
  <p>The architecture of the WebObjects frameworks offered a high degree of modularity 
    which could be copied when developing the Pachyderm 2.0 application. The team 
    could build a set of shared functionality into a framework which could be 
    accessed by any WebObjects application deployed on the server. This could 
    let other groups easily build tools to integrate with Pachyderm 2.0. The fact 
    that WebObjects can be deployed on a variety of platforms, including MacOSX, 
    Windows 2000 Server, Solaris and Linux, would satisfy the requirement that 
    the system not be tied to any single server vendor.</p>
  <h2>APOLLO</h2>
  <p>Concurrent with the start of Pachyderm 2.0 development, The University of 
    Calgary was working on the successor to the CAREO learning object repository, 
    code-named APOLLO. APOLLO, built on top of WebObjects, was designed to be 
    an extremely flexible set of frameworks and applications that would allow 
    the development of a wide variety of different but related functionality, 
    specifically aimed at enabling people to publish, locate, and reuse learning 
    objects.</p>
  <p>The team realized that there was a strong overlap in requirements between 
    Pachyderm 2.0 and APOLLO, and in the summer of 2004, decided to base Pachyderm 
    2.0 on the APOLLO frameworks and concepts. This would allow the team to further 
    focus the development effort on the features directly required to support 
    the presentation authoring application, while working with the APOLLO developers 
    to further enhance its functionality.</p>
  <p>One very powerful feature of APOLLO is the ability to build small components 
    and plug-ins that can be integrated dynamically into a running application, 
    allowing the addition of customized functionality without modifying an entire 
    application or framework.</p>
  <p>APOLLO also provides a set of services for transforming media from one format 
    to another, and the set could be leveraged as part of the Pachyderm presentation 
    publication process. As part of that process, the system would need to be 
    able to resize images, convert them into a Flash-friendly format, and compile 
    them into Flash-wrapped media for use in the final published presentation. 
    This process was a strong limiting factor in the scalability of Pachyderm 
    1.0, so the ability to generate transformed media on the fly, and on demand, 
    would allow the system to support a potentially unlimited library of media 
    assets.</p>
  <h2>Open Source</h2>
  <p>The Pachyderm 2.0 project was strongly oriented toward open source development. 
    It had been a central theme in the project from the proposal stage onward, 
    in an effort to ensure collaboration from interested groups. The idea was 
    for development to be as open as possible and to result in a strong set of 
    source code that could be used and extended by others. The source code and 
    developer"s guide for Pachyderm 2.0 will be released to the public in the 
    fall of 2005 under an Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license.</p>
  <h1>Pachyderm Presentation Screens</h1>
  <p><em>Macromedia Flash</em> is a popular application because it enables professional 
    media designers to easily create interactive and dynamic on-line experiences. 
    <em>Flash Player</em> has been adopted in Web communities because of its ability 
    to produce small files facilitating the streaming of rich media content. Other 
    electronic devices such as Web TV, Pocket PC and some cell phones are supporting 
    Flash files today. The secret of success is the small-sized player (less than 
    500 K for <em>Flash Player 7</em>). The new Pachyderm presentation templates 
    are completely designed in Flash MX 2004 and users are expected to have Flash 
    Player 7.0 or above.</p>
        <p>Flash-based Web presentations have many advantages over traditional 
          html-based Web contents. The most valued benefit of using Flash to author 
          Web content is that it is browser- and platform-independent. The same 
          Flash movie will look exactly the same cross-platform (Windows, Mac 
          OS, and Linux) and cross-browser (Netscape, Internet Explorer, FireFox 
          and Safari). This is very important for the on-line learning communities 
          since educators and learners often have a very diverse selection of 
          hardware and software. However, Flash does have its weaknesses. Developers 
          need to be aware of the version issue while developing Flash files. 
          Similar to most software, Flash is not forward compatible (Flash 7 files 
          won't run on Flash 6 player). Another concern is that major search engines 
          are still having trouble indexing the content inside Flash based content 
          packages. This makes the meta-tagging procedure and XML content aggregation 
          so important while creating learning objects in Flash. This is a major 
          reason for the Flash upgrade in Pachyderm 2.0.</p>
  <p>Pachyderm 1.0 includes twelve Flash templates created in Flash version 4.0. 
    The templates are really Flash shells that contain the layout, graphic design 
    and interaction coding (with Action Script). The content (images and text) 
    that makes each presentation screen unique is provided to the template in 
    a variable-based text file (.ini file). The text files are generated in ASCII 
    standard encoding, and meta-data was not adopted within the design. This means 
    the authored learning objects are language-dependent and reference-limited. 
    With additional considerations of forward design requirements, such as templates 
    modularization and learning object standards, the Pachyderm team has decided 
    to integrate the XML referencing model into Pachyderm 2.0.</p>
  <p>In the new implementation, Flash MX technology is being used. Content aggregations 
    on the presentation end are handled by XML files. Presentations are constructed 
    by templates, and each template references a unique XML file. The Flash templates 
    parse the XML files in order to fetch content into the presentation. While 
    serving the purpose of describing the content, these XML files are also being 
    used for assets searching, template referencing and presentation meta-tagging 
    purposes.</p>
  <p>With the up-to-date Flash support, the Pachyderm 2.0 development team can 
    fully integrate XML-based learning standards (i.e., SCORM) with the learning 
    objects authored using Pachyderm 2.0. The presentation will process the IMSmanifest 
    XML file to lay out the navigation through the authored templates. IMSmanifest 
    XML is the key file for SCORM 2.0 compliant learning objects. From this file, 
    a navigational presentation map can be generated. This key file also performs 
    as a "messenger" to connect the learning objects with the learning management 
    system (LMS), allowing institutions to fully integrate Pachyderm as a learning 
    object authoring platform with their existing LMS.</p>
  <p>The next step in the Flash development of Pachyderm 2.0 is to implement the 
    Model View Controller framework and componentized screen elements. This will 
    allow other Flash designers/developers to generate new Pachyderm templates 
    using pre-defined Flash components and not to worry about action scripting. 
    A further step will be to create a tool that allows users to develop custom 
    templates whether or not they know Flash. A truly WYSIWYG Flash designing 
    interface would empower subject matter experts to directly author the templates 
    that suit their needs.</p>
  <h1>Collaboration</h1>
  <p>The Pachyderm development team is composed of over a dozen members located 
    throughout the United States and 
    Canada. Large projects even within 
    the same institution can be challenging, but distance can present significant 
    obstacles to intercommunication and collaboration, and introduces risks to 
    the project. Early in the project, the development team had to establish inexpensive 
    efficient means of collaboration that would reduce the risks. </p>
  <p>Some significant risks to the project accentuated by distance and distribution 
    were: </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">a) wasted or redundant efforts from team members in differing 
    location due to inability to coordinate tasks, and/or inability to coordinate 
    concurrent development efforts.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">b) inefficient use of the resources available to the project 
    due to a lack of understanding of the team"s particular strengths, inability 
    to use each member at his or her maximum potential, a lack of knowledge of 
    what resources may be available to the project (personnel or software), and/or 
    a lack of cohesion or commonality between the members of the development team.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">c) failure to meet expectations of the project due to a 
    mismatch between what is produced by the development team and what is defined 
    in the system requirements, and/or what is defined in the system requirements 
    and what is expected by the system users. </p>
  <p>The team felt confident that the latter risk (c) had been adequately addressed 
    by the requirements gathering process used for the project. Any changes to 
    be made to the requirements would be entered into the tracker application, 
    and would be part of the living requirements document, easily reviewed by 
    the development team on-line.</p>
  <p>In the selection of a development architecture, the team was confident that 
    several of the risks detailed in (b) were covered. In choosing the development 
    platform, the decision was reached to use WebObjects and the APOLLO framework 
    for a number of salient reasons, many detailed in previous parts of the paper, 
    but many important factors stand out as they relate to the issues of distance 
    collaboration. With the choice of WebObjects and APOLLO, the team gained a 
    high level of expertise from a majority of full-time development engineering 
    resources. WebObjects was heavily used in the University of Calgary, and APOLLO 
    was a framework created by one of the staff engineers there. The other team 
    members had no familiarity with WebObjects, but did have significant Java 
    and application server experience to give an adequate starting point for learning 
    about WebObjects. Also, with the use of WebObjects and APOLLO, the team had 
    at its disposal a great many frameworks available for use in the application 
    that would otherwise have had to be written from scratch for other development 
    architectures. The choice allowed the team to speed the level of development, 
    and get a lot of infrastructure free, allowing a greater focus on the application 
    logic itself. </p>
  <p>After deciding on the development platform, the team realized that the first 
    risk category concerning waste due to disorganization and poor communication 
    from (a) remained unaddressed, as well as issues of team cohesion and inability 
    to use each member at maximum potential from (b). To address the remaining 
    risk factors, four methods were used: : collaboration tools, an instant communication 
    process, development methodologies, and scheduled face-to-face meetings.</p>
  <h2>Collaboration Tools</h2>
  <p>Collaboration tools were absolutely essential to the success of the Pachyderm 
    project, and what follows is a list of the different applications employed 
    on the project.</p>
  <h3>Subversion (Version Control) &#8211; <a target="_blank" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a></h3>
  <p>The mere fact that the Pachyderm project involved more than one developer 
    working on the same code base necessitated some sort of version control. Considering 
    that the developers were distributed across the continent, an easily accessed 
    and resilient version control system was required. Although there was a significant 
    degree of institutional knowledge in CVS in the group, Subversion was chosen 
    as the software versioning system for several salient reasons. First and foremost, 
    it is open source and free to use, and CVS itself has a link to it on its 
    home page. It is considered the heir apparent to CVS by many, and many developers 
    have moved to supporting Subversion over CVS. Subversion appeared to be very 
    well suited to a distributed environment, as it used secure http for its communications, 
    tied well into relevant applications such as XCode (the Macintosh IDE being 
    used for the project), and had a Web interface for easy viewing of subversion 
    content. While CVS remains a very strong version control system, Subversion 
    appeared to be an overall better fit for the project. </p>
  <h3>VNC (Virtual Network Computing) &#8211; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.realvnc.com/">http://www.realvnc.com</a></h3>
  <p>Distance pair/team programming techniques required some means for developers 
    to share a common workspace. VNC became an early adoption to the project, 
    because it is open source under the GNU GPL, free to use, and very good. There 
    are actually many clients and servers available that use the VNC protocol, 
    and these are available on most platforms. The team made use of OSXvnc as 
    the server software, and Chicken of the VNC as the client on the Mac. Tight-VNC 
    was used for windows.</p>
  <h3>Instant Messaging &#8211; AIM, iChat, MSN, etc.</h3>
  <p>The developers employed some sort of instant 
    messaging on a daily basis from the very start of the project, as it is an 
    inexpensive (free) form of direct conversational communication that allows 
    for multi-member chat, and keeps a transcript log of any conversations. File 
    sharing is also simple through an instant messenger client. The team also 
    used audio/video chat (via iChat using the iSight camera) during team programming 
    sessions, freeing up the hands for coding and allowing for easy communication. 
    In many respects, it was almost as good as being in the same room.</p>
  <h3>SubEthaEdit (Collaborative file editing) &#8211; 
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit">http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit</a></h3>
  <p>Tools such as SubEthaEdit allowed for joint 
    editing of the same document without having to share an entire desktop, and 
    also tracked contributions/changes from different members in separate colors. 
    Along with VNC, this became one of the primary tools for pair programming.</p>
  <h3>Wiki (on-line collaborative documentation) 
    &#8211; <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a></h3>
  <p>The team maintained a wiki for keeping group 
    institutional knowledge current and available/updateable by all members. Developers 
    would write collaborative documents on the wiki when the timing between participants 
    was asynchronous, and when the platforms of the participants were varied enough 
    that a platform-independent solution was needed. </p>
  <h3>Macromedia Breeze (collaboration app) &#8211; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/breeze/">http://www.macromedia.com/software/breeze/</a></h3>
  <p>Other collaboration tools were investigated, 
    such as Macromedia Breeze, which did provide for a rich environment for demonstrations, 
    and with different intercommunications widgets available to the user. Breeze 
    was not an ideal match for the team's development style, and was not used 
    often.</p>
  <h3>Typepad (blog software) &#8211; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.typepad.com/">http://www.typepad.com</a></h3>
  <p>The Pachyderm project team put up a blog that 
    has been used to communicate news to the project partners, and to act as a 
    centralized repository for project documents. The development team makes use 
    of this to announce larger successes and milestones. It is a way to keep the 
    customer base informed as to progress, and to help keep requirements and development 
    in line with one another.</p>
  <h2>Communication Process</h2>
  <p>As crucial as the tools being employed by the 
    development team are the methods and habits of communication between the members 
    of the team. The success of the project depends on how faithfully, regularly, 
    honestly and easily these communications occur. The developers used the following 
    habits and methods for keeping in synch over vast distances.</p>
  <h3>On-line Live Communication</h3>
  <p>Instant messenger became a lifeline for team 
    members to keep in touch with one another, to work together and share pertinent 
    information. Audio and video chat helped immensely in freeing up the hands 
    to work while still communicating. The developers had daily, often continuous 
    contact with one another through these means.</p>
  <h3>Regular Phone Conferences</h3>
  <p>Starting bi-weekly, then progressing to weekly 
    and then twice a week, the development team has been holding phone conferences 
    to help keep on track. An on-line free conference service was used with the 
    only cost being the toll charge to the dial-in number (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.freeconference.com/">http://www.freeconference.com</a>).</p>
  <h3>On-line Asynchronous Communication</h3>
  <p>E-mail was also heavily used for intra-communication, but not as extensively 
    as instant messenger. E-mail was reserved for communications with the whole 
    team, or to distribute documents to a large group at once. The team also used 
    the Pachyderm blog, which helped communicate successes to the whole team and 
    to the outside world.</p>
  <h1>Development Methodologies</h1>
  <p>On this project, the Pachyderm team members have adopted some methodologies 
    from Extreme Programming, such as "Team" or "Pair" programming, which have 
    been extremely valuable in producing high quality code at a faster pace than 
    normally would have been possible. Using VNC and iChat (or while in person), 
    several team members would join in to a group programming session, with one 
    member controlling the keyboard, and the other members watching, giving syntactical 
    and logic corrections and thinking strategically about the direction of the 
    code. The effect of this methodology was multifold. First, it allowed for 
    the members of the development team with a stronger sense of the application 
    frameworks being used to disseminate that knowledge to other members, in a 
    practical fashion that moved the code forward, instead of taking time out 
    of the development schedule. Second, it built in a process of team code review, 
    since everyone was writing the code at the same time. Third, it blurred the 
    line of ownership of any particular piece of code, allowing for more flexibility 
    in code changes and updates, and helping keep a sense of team cohesion. As 
    a result of team programming, everyone felt an equal responsibility in the 
    code, and felt an equally important member of the team.</p>
  <h2>Scheduled Face-To-Face Meetings</h2>
  <p>Of course, any long-distance project necessarily 
    must contain a component of face-to-face time. The group came together on 
    a larger scale at project meetings, and during conferences at which many members 
    were in attendance. In addition, team members would physically spend periods 
    of time (typically a week at a time, every other month) working on-location 
    with other members of the team. This also allowed time after work for social 
    bonding, and for a more productive team-development environment. Sometimes 
    nothing quite beats a bunch of people in the same room with a white board. 
    The team found that productivity would soar during one of these extended visits, 
    and would continue to remain high for weeks afterwards. They were an integral 
    part of the development process.</p>
  <h1>Future Plans</h1>
  <p>When planning began for Pachyderm 2.0 in October of 2003, the team came up 
    with a lofty vision of what the authoring tool could be. The team has spent 
    the last year and a half carefully pruning expectations to define a goal that 
    is both desirable and achievable. The big ideas, however, have not gone away. 
    They give the project directions in which to grow. The project is actively 
    seeking funding to continue development of the larger vision. Once Pachyderm 
    2.0 is released to the public, the team expects that user feedback will guide 
    the development of additional features that the community truly values.</p>
