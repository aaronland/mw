        <h1>Hands-On versus On-Line:  Evaluating MarsQuest On-line</h1>
        <h2>James B. Harold, Space Science Institute, Randi Korn, Randi Korn &amp; 
          Associate, Paul B. Dusenbery, Space Science Institute, and Christopher 
          Randall, TERC, USA</h2>
      <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">In October, 2000, the Space Science 
          Institute of Boulder, Colorado, launched MarsQuest: a 5000 square foot 
          traveling exhibition on Mars and Mars science. Two years later NSF and 
          NASA gave their support to an associated Web project called MarsQuest 
          Online, a partnership between TERC, the Space Science Institute, and 
          JPL. The goal of the MarsQuest Online project was to create a Web site 
          that extended both the reach and scope of the traveling exhibition. 
          The program was premised on the idea that the effort expended on the 
          museum exhibition - the exhibition framework, interactive concepts, 
          educational goals, etc. - could be leveraged into a highly interactive 
          on-line experience. </p>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">MarsQuest Online has now been live 
          for over a year, and has had well over a half million visits.  Site 
          visitors have flown over Mars in 3D, driven rovers, chosen potential 
          landing sites, and followed NASA's MER rovers as they explore the surface. 
          However, quoting numbers of visitors begs the real question for any 
          education project: what have visitors learned?  More broadly, is the 
          project a success as an informal learning experience, as the physical 
          exhibit was?  If so, how does one define and demonstrate on-line learning?</p>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">Answering these questions has always 
          been a central part of the project.  In addition to a more traditional 
          formative evaluation, which examined the usability of the pieces, MarsQuest 
          Online includes a summative evaluation that contains two primary components.  
          First, the interactives on the site were programmed to record user activities 
          into a database that can be mined to obtained detailed information about 
          visitors' interactions.  Second, Randi Korn &amp; Associates, were hired 
          to conduct a series of standardized interviews.  These interviews, conducted 
          with science center visitors, included three groups: those who visited 
          the MarsQuest exhibit but not the Web site; those who visited the Web 
          site but not the exhibit, and those who visited both.  In that way we 
          hoped to determine how the exhibit and the Web site, together and separately, 
          affect visitors' attitudes and knowledge about Mars and Mars exploration.  
        </p>
        <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">This paper will discuss the MarsQuest 
          Online project, the motivations behind this evaluation program, its 
          challenges, and results.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>The MarsQuest Exhibition</h2>
        <p>Funded by the National Science Foundation and NASA, the MarsQuest traveling 
          exhibition uses data from NASA missions to bring Mars to science centers 
          around the country. This multi-media exhibition includes sixteen interactive 
          components for hands-on learning experiences; five computer stations 
          where visitors navigate through virtual presentations, manipulate computer 
          models, or find information; a video monitor that plays a brief animation 
          of the formation of our solar system; seven scale models depicting spacecraft 
          and portions of Mars and Earth; and the Mitsubishi Digital Imagination 
          Theater, which presents a video of high-definition images of Mars.</p>
        <p>Thematically, the exhibition is structured around sites on the planet.  
          Early on in the exhibition's development process, we decided to treat 
          Mars the way one would a National Park.  Rather than discussing prospects 
          for colonization, for instance, the developers asked the question: if 
          you were a tourist, where would you go?  As a result, the exhibition 
          is organized around locations of compelling interest: Volcanoes, Canyons, 
          the Poles, and Rover Landing Sites. The exhibition components in each 
          site expand on the dual themes of Earth-Mars comparisons and Mars exploration. 
        </p>

        <p class="caption">Fig. 1: A section of the MarsQuest Exhibition, showing 
          part of the Volcano area.</p>
        <p>MarsQuest faired well in its summative evaluation, performed by Randi 
          Korn &amp; Associates (RK&amp;A, 2002).  Visitors moved more slowly 
          through MarsQuest than visitors in other exhibitions of a similar size.  
          In interviews, visitors indicated that they enjoyed the exhibition and 
          were able to articulate at least part of its message.  They recalled 
          specific facts about Mars, and the comparison of Mars characteristics 
          and features with those on Earth helped many interviewees learn new 
          facts about Mars. </p>
        <p>MarsQuest's initial tour was three years, during which it visited nine 
          museums and science centers across the country.  In the fall of 2003, 
          the exhibition was pulled in for refurbishment. It began its second 
          three-year tour in late January of 2004 at The New Detroit Science Center, 
          complete with new interactives and a full-scale model of a MER rover.</p>
        <h1>MarsQuest On-line</h1>
        <p>The idea for the MarsQuest Online site developed independently on two 
          fronts.  SSI was pursuing support for a Web site based on the exhibition, 
          while TERC was pursuing support for an educational Web site on Mars. 
          Eventually TERC contacted SSI, and a joint proposal to the Division 
          of Elementary, Secondary and Informal Education of the National Science 
          Foundation was submitted, with TERC as the project lead.  TERC had also 
          developed a relationship with a group inside NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
          (JPL), and they formed the third partner on the project.  The project 
          Principal Investigator (PI) is Dan Barstow (TERC); co-Investigators 
          (I's) are Paul Dusenbery (SSI), Paul Andres (JPL) and Eric DeJong (JPL).  
          Chris Randall is the project director at TERC, and James Harold is the 
          project director at SSI.  The proposal was submitted to NSF's Informal 
          Division in part because of the connection with the exhibition, but 
          also because we were strongly advocating the Web as a potentially powerful 
          informal learning environment. This is a view that has been gaining 
          momentum as Web technologies allow more interactive and engaging experiences.  
          In fact, the Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC) gave 
          its year 2000 award for innovation not to a physical exhibit, but to 
          the Exploratorium's Web team (ASTC, 2000)</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="harold-figure2.jpg" width="400" height="313" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: The MarsQuest Online"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 2: The MarsQuest Online home page (<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.marsquestonline.org/">http://www.marsquestonline.org</a>).</p>
        <p>The MarsQuest Online site consists of three major components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           <strong>Explore Mars</strong> is modeled after the 
            MarsQuest exhibition.  Following the exhibition's thematic framework, 
            it invites visitors to explore various areas of Mars. Each area includes 
            a series of light, short duration interactives, comparable to what 
            one might find in an exhibition.</li>
        <li> 
           <strong>Mars Mysteries</strong> includes more complex 
            interactives, requiring more time and thought to complete. For instance, 
            a visitor might try to determine where to land a rover, requiring 
            an analysis of Mars' surface features to find a location that is both 
            relatively safe and scientifically interesting</li>
        <li><strong>Rover Images</strong> is a real-time archive of the images received 
          from NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers (MER).  This piece includes navigable, 
          high resolution panoramas that allow visitors to explore the rover's 
          findings in a visual context.  New images are ingested into the system 
          automatically through a dedicated feed from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
          as part of their Museum Visualization Alliance program.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>Other areas include resource materials for teachers and the public.  
          The site has been running since mid-2003, with mirroring support through 
          the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and the San 
          Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC).</p>
        <p>In 2004, NSF granted the project supplemental funding.  The supplement 
          will allow us to expand the <strong>3D Flyover</strong> activities into a global 
          set of guided tours of Mars, and to continue to support the Rover Images 
          area in the face of the unprecedented success of those missions.  The 
          nominal design lifetime of the MER rovers was three months: at the time 
          of this writing, they are celebrating their one-year anniversary of 
          Mars and still functioning well.  This is tremendously exciting and 
          represents an enormous achievement, but it presents obvious maintenance 
          challenges for us as well.</p>
        <h1>The Evaluation Program</h1>
        <p>When the MarsQuest Online project was first beginning, &quot;success&quot; 
          for an educational Web site was typically cast in terms of hits, and 
          evaluation seemed to be limited to usability analysis.  In contrast, 
          our history with exhibit development predisposed us to think that other 
          questions ought to be addressed: in particular, what and how are visitors 
          learning? While a few Web projects were examining these issues (e.g. 
          Allison-Bunnell et al., 2002, and more recently, Honeyman, 2004), they 
          seemed few and far between, and we felt that MarsQuest Online presented 
          an opportunity to further examine these questions.</p>
        <p>Some guidance for our evaluation existed in the approaches used for 
          evaluating museum exhibits. However, while parallels exist, there are 
          also clear differences between physical exhibits and the Web: among 
          other things, the actual audience for a Web site is largely unknown, 
          and in some ways inaccessible. Nevertheless, it seemed to us that establishing 
          a methodology for reviewing educational Web sites was critical if the 
          Web is to be taken seriously as an informal learning environment.  As 
          a result, a broad goal for the evaluation of this project was to contribute 
          to the base of information about how educational Web sites can be evaluated, 
          what success looks like, and how exhibits and Web sites compare in their 
          abilities to meet their goals.  </p>
        <p>The evaluation approach included one-on-one interviews by external 
          evaluators and SSI staff, Web log analysis, and database driven collection 
          of usage information in interactive pieces.  In addition, because the 
          physical MarsQuest exhibition had also undergone extensive evaluation, 
          we were able to use the summative results for that program to provide 
          additional information on visitor perceptions of the exhibition.</p>
        <p>The remainder of this paper will touch on some of the results we have 
          obtained to date.  This paper is not intended to provide an exhaustive 
          review of the results of the evaluation (which at the time of writing 
          is still ongoing).  Instead, we are isolating a subset of results that 
          we feel are of broad interest to those working at the interface of museum 
          exhibits and the Web.  </p>
        <h1>Leveraging from the Exhibition: Front End Results</h1>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>A significant part of the case for developing the MarsQuest Online 
          Web site was the claim that we could both extend the exhibit experience 
          and leverage from the exhibition development program.  To do this, it 
          was important to identify those exhibition experiences that were most 
          effective, both in engaging the public and achieving our learning goals.  
          In addition, since we saw the Web site as a mechanism for expanding 
          on the exhibition's content, we wanted to understand which exhibition 
          components stimulated the greatest interest in seeking additional information. 
        </p>
        <p>In order to assess what aspects of the exhibition might be most productively 
          borrowed, RK&amp;A performed a series of front-end evaluation interviews 
          for the project. The interviews were conducted with MarsQuest exhibition 
          visitors at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum in Chicago in May, 2002.  
          The goals of the evaluation included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           Determining which aspects of the exhibition 
            sparked MarsQuest exhibition visitors' curiosity;</li>
        <li> 
           Identifying exhibition content and experiences 
            that should be complemented on the MarsQuest Web site;</li>
        <li>Determining exhibition visitors' expectations for what they would 
          be able to see and do on a MarsQuest Web site;</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>The visitor population interviewed included nearly equal numbers of 
          children (15 years and younger) and adults (20 years and older).  When 
          children younger than 9 years participated, they were always with a 
          companion in the target audience.  Almost twice as many interviewees 
          were male as female, (<em>n</em>=14 and <em>n</em>=8, respectively). </p>
        <h2>Visitor Expectations Of The Web Site</h2>
        <p>As part of the survey, visitors to the MarsQuest exhibition were asked 
          about their expectations for a MarsQuest Web site. Based on their exhibition 
          experiences, interviewees - especially youngsters - expected the Web 
          site to be fun and interactive, and adults expected it to be rich in 
          interesting information.  As they talked about expectations for the 
          Web site, interviewees sometimes added &quot;interesting...like the 
          exhibition&quot; or &quot;it will have cool stuff...&quot; and pointed 
          to an example in the exhibition that was &quot;cool&quot; to them.  
          Children and preteens often requested three-dimensional simulations 
          of travel to and on Mars, and sometimes said they expected to be able 
          to play entertaining, in-depth games to explore Mars.  A few youngsters 
          also expected to do research for school projects on the Web site.  But 
          all stressed that while they expect the Web site to be educational, 
          they want it to be more fun than typical Web sites they use for school.</p>
        <p>Adults' expectations for the Web site were that it would provide more 
          in-depth information than the exhibition provided, and would enable 
          them to follow up on topics from the exhibition: find out more about 
          Mars' environment; and learn about scientists' latest Mars-related theories, 
          research, and discoveries.  Many adult interviewees appreciated the 
          exhibition's unique perspective, and expected the Web site to continue 
          that level of quality while presenting more in-depth content.</p>
        <p>These results supported many of the goals of the MarsQuest Online program: 
          to borrow from and extend the content in the exhibition, while preserving 
          the interactive nature of the exhibits.  Note, however, the high bar 
          set by children: they expected the site to be interactive, &quot;cool&quot;,  
          and include 3D simulations, in depth games, etc.   </p>
        <h2>What's In A Name?</h2>
        <p>One interesting result of these interviews was that visitors to MarsQuest 
          were not aware of the exhibition's title.  This could perhaps be corrected 
          through a more extensive marketing campaign, but since MarsQuest is 
          a traveling exhibition, such marketing is largely out of the hands of 
          the developers.  The practical consequence is that visitors do not have 
          <em>a priori</em> knowledge of the URL of the exhibition's Web site.  
          The assumption had been that we could hope at least for a &quot;Google&quot; 
          of &quot;MarsQuest&quot;, but even that belief seems to be misplaced. 
          This suggests that in the future, if we expect visitors to find the 
          Web site, it should be directly marketed within the exhibition.</p>
        <h2>Thematic structure</h2>
        <p>Perhaps even more significant is that the interviews indicated that 
          visitors were unfamiliar with the exhibition's thematic structure. MarsQuest 
          is structured around various &quot;locations of interest&quot; on Mars: 
          Volcanoes, Canyons, Poles, and the Pathfinder/Sojourner landing site 
          (a floodplain).  The failure of visitors to perceive this structure 
          is not surprising: exhibition visitors are usually more attuned to discrete 
          exhibit experiences than to an exhibition's thematic organization. While 
          the &quot;national park&quot; concept may have helped the developers 
          produce a cohesive exhibition, visitors tend to remember particular 
          interactive experiences, such as driving a rover, and pieces of interesting 
          information, i.e. that Mars is cold and has volcanoes.</p>
        <p>However, in the interviews, when a sample MarsQuest Online home page 
          presented those themes as its organizational framework, it piqued the 
          interest of many adult interviewees and several youngsters.  Those interviewees 
          often associated the themes with discrete MarsQuest exhibits they enjoyed 
          or exhibition information that intrigued them.  This suggests that replicating 
          the exhibition's structure in the Web site is still beneficial.  While 
          visitors may not directly connect the Web site's structure with the 
          exhibition, they may be able to place their exhibition experiences within 
          that framework after the fact.  And of course the framework remains 
          a valuable tool for developers in creating a coherent story, just as 
          it did for the exhibition.</p>
        <p>Now that the site has been running for some time, it is clear that 
          Web visitors both perceive and take advantage of this thematic structure.  
          Analysis of paths from the home page of the <strong>Mars Tour</strong> shows visitors 
          preferentially going to the rover and volcano areas, behaviour which 
          mimics the preferences mentioned in the interviews.  It may be that 
          ultimately this thematic structure is more valuable to the Web site 
          than it was for the original exhibition.</p>
        <h1>Data Collected Through the Site</h1>
        <p>A central premise of the MarsQuest Online project was that the site 
          should be highly interactive: a direct result of our science center 
          backgrounds.  Science centers place tremendous value on interactivity: 
          it is widely believed to be an effective way of engaging visitors and 
          achieving learning goals.  However, the resulting heavy use of Flash 
          and Shockwave on the site meant that traditional log analysis techniques 
          would provide only limited information on how visitors used the site.  
          On the other hand, the interactives themselves could be coded to collect 
          usage data.  Ultimately we used a combination of approaches, programming 
          many of the interactives to collect data, and using traditional log 
          analysis to examine broader questions (e.g., overall visitorship, and 
          paths through the site). </p>
        <h2>Visitorship and activity</h2>
        <p>Visitorship to the site is strongly driven by the news coverage of 
          the Mars rovers.  When the rovers landed in early 2004, the site received 
          over 17,000 visits in a single day.  Over the next month traffic decreased 
          to a few thousand a day, and in the last six months it has been relatively 
          stable at 500-600 visits per day.  </p>
        <p>On average, visitors view 8-12 pages per visit, which in our experience 
          is reasonably high. Between 20% and 25% of visitors run at least one 
          of the interactive activities, but this activity is highly dependent 
          on the source of the visitor.  For traffic following a link from the 
          Web site of a science center hosting the MarsQuest exhibition, this 
          number may reach 33%, while for traffic arriving from the Yahoo search 
          engine, it can be as low as 16%.  </p>
        <h2>Time Spent in Activities</h2>
        <p>In a typical science center exhibition, visitors spend very little 
          time interacting with exhibit components: a minute or two is considered 
          a &quot;win&quot;. These short dwell times are a strong driver of both 
          the content and design of exhibit computer interactives: learning goals 
          must be well conceived and pieces must be able to achieve those goals 
          quickly.  The MarsQuest exhibition is no exception, and in Table 1 we 
          show a sampling of results from the MarsQuest summative evaluation (RK&amp;A, 
          2002), showing the median time spent at a few of the exhibition components. 
          We include physical as well as computer based exhibits to illustrate 
          that these issues are not specific to computer stations. </p>

        <p>One question we wished to answer in evaluating MarsQuest Online was 
          whether these dwell times would be mirrored in an on-line environment.  
          The point can be argued either way.  Web surfers probably have fewer 
          time constraints than exhibit goers, and because they can return to 
          the site for free as often as they like, there is no pressure to &quot;move 
          on&quot; to the next part of the exhibition.  On the other hand, Web 
          surfers may be even more easily distracted than exhibit goers: they 
          have an entire world of possibilities at their fingertips.  They also 
          lack the investment represented by paying an admission fee, which can 
          encourage visitors to spend more time in an exhibition to &quot;make 
          the most&quot; of their money.</p>

        <p class="caption">Table 2: Median dwell times at several MarsQuest Online 
        interactives</p>
        <p>Table 2 shows the results of time tracking for several MarsQuest Online 
          interactive activities. Time is tracked from leaving the introduction 
          screen to closing the interactive.  We choose to begin timing after 
          the introduction screen because it typically also serves as a &quot;loader&quot;, 
          delaying visitors until enough of the piece has been downloaded to begin.  
          This approach also eliminates people who do not run the piece at all 
          (by choice, or for technical reasons). </p>
        <p>The values in Table 2 are quite similar to the values obtained for 
          the physical exhibits.  This is not a direct comparison, since the pieces 
          are not identical.  But the results suggest that, for activities with 
          comparable complexity, exhibit and Web visitors do not demonstrate substantially 
          different dwell times.</p>
        <h2>Depth of Interaction With Piece</h2>
        <p>Dwell time is an easily measured quantity; however the more substantive 
          measure of the success of an interactive is the degree to which its 
          learning goals were met.  Answering this question presents us with one 
          of the double-edged swords of Web sites. It is easy to amass large amounts 
          of data on specific questions, and that data has the advantage of being 
          <em>in situ</em>: it is an accurate accounting of how visitors actually 
          used your site. However, at the same time you have no personal contact 
          with your users.  You do not know the most basic information about your 
          visitors (gender, age), never mind whether the Web experience has changed 
          their opinion of Mars science.</p>
        <p>However, it is possible to use indirect proxies for the success of 
          these pieces.  The metrics vary by activity, but in general we're looking 
          for evidence that users either </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           explored the activity thoroughly (playing 
            to completion, if relevant for the activity), or </li>
        <li>accomplished a specific task that indicates they met our learning 
          goal.  </li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>By these measures, the MarsQuest Online interactives have been quite 
          successful.  Significant percentages of visitors either complete the 
          piece or at least reach a point that suggests our learning goals have 
          been met. We summarize the results for some of the interactives below.</p>
        <h1>Find the Features</h1>
        <p class="caption"><img src="harold-figure3.jpg" width="400" height="336" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: The &quot;Find the Features&quot; activity"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig. 3: The &quot;Find the Features&quot; activity, 
          showing a topographic Earth globe</p>
        <p>This activity includes 3D topographic globes of Earth and Mars.  Users 
          are challenged to find 5 parallel geographic features on each of the 
          two planets (e.g., highest and lowest points). The globe images can 
          be switched between a conventional &quot;visible&quot; image (as the 
          planet would appear from space) and a topographic image (where terrain 
          is colored based on altitude).  The 3D spheres can also be &quot;stretched&quot;, 
          exaggerating the vertical span of features.  Both of these features 
          were included specifically to expose users to tools and visualization 
          techniques commonly used by scientists.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           Of those who tried at all, 25% stopped 
            at the first feature, and 27% completed all 10 features.</li>
        <li>Half of the visitors examined Earth as well as Mars: this is key to 
          the &quot;comparative planetology&quot; goals of the activity</li>
        <li>45% used the vertical exaggeration tool</li>
        <li>52% switched between visible and topographic views</li>
      </ul>
       
        <h1>Fly to Mars</h1>
        <p>This simple orbital simulation challenges visitors to launch a spacecraft 
          from Earth to Mars.  Success for our purposes does not require the visitor 
          to succeed in getting to Mars: only to recognize that timing (the &quot;launch 
          window&quot;) is an issue.  In addition, the more time visitors spend 
          in the simulation, the more they are exposed to some basic solar system 
          concepts: relative orbital periods of the planets, relative positions, 
          etc. A &quot;hint&quot; button gives some instruction, with an added 
          &quot;Show me&quot; option that tells users when to launch.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           Over 60% of the users launched the spacecraft 
            two or more times; half launched four or more times.  </li>
        <li> 
           Almost 60% succeeded in reaching Mars. 
        </li>
        <li> 
           60% of the visitors used the hint option, 
            and 38% opted to have the program tell them when to launch (this isn't 
            surprising: it's quite difficult to successfully reach Mars in this 
            piece.) </li>
      </ul>
       
        <h1>Drive a Rover</h1>
        <p>This is a simple, &quot;virtual&quot; version of the programmable rover 
          in the MarsQuest exhibition. Visitors upload a series of commands to 
          a rover, which then executes them.  Visitors have 7 days to navigate 
          to as many target rocks as possible before their rover &quot;dies&quot;. 
          The learning goal is simply to understand that rovers are not &quot;joysticked&quot; 
          around the planet like a radio controlled car, but must be given pre-planned 
          sequences of instructions that are then carried out autonomously.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           65% of users found one or more rocks, 
            demonstrating that they understood the basics of rover navigation. 
        </li>
        <li>43% played to completion (when the rover expired).</li>
      </ul>
       
        <h1>Fly in 3D</h1>
        <p>Visitors choose one of several different Martian terrains to explore 
          in 3D.  They can chose to view the terrain as an object, tilting it 
          and changing the angle of the sun, or to fly over it in more of a game-like 
          mode.  In the fly-over mode, there is a series of markers to locate, 
          each of which presents some additional information about the area. In 
          either mode the terrain can also be vertically exaggerated (&quot;stretched&quot;) 
          in order to enhance features.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           Choice of terrain: In order of preference, 
            visitors chose Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system 
            (44%); a section of Valles Marineris, a canyon system as long as the 
            U.S. (21%); the &quot;Face on Mars&quot;, a small mesa which created 
            a stir in the 1970s (16%); one of the MER landing sites, Gusev Crater 
            (11%); and an ancient floodplain (8%).  These results are consistent 
            with previous evaluation results that indicated a preference for Volcanoes 
            and a lack of knowledge of specific Mars features.  </li>
        <li>Choice of mode (&quot;tilt&quot; or &quot;fly&quot;):  86% of visitors 
          used the &quot;fly&quot; mode; 56% used the &quot;spin&quot; mode, and 
          41% used both.  This is more balanced than had originally been predicted: 
          there had been a belief that the more &quot;fun&quot; flying mode would 
          dominate.</li>
        <li>Marker searching: this was less successful, with 40% finding one marker, 
          and only 10% finding all three.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <h1>Summative Evaluation Interviews</h1>
        <p>What is clearly missing from the data presented in the previous section 
          is actual contact with the users.  The evaluation research design for 
          this project presented a number of challenges.  </p>
        <p>As noted earlier, the research question for the evaluation was: does 
          a Web site extend the exhibition experience?  This question is reasonable 
          to ask under one condition: if the Web site was specifically designed 
          to extend the exhibit experience.  In the case of MarsQuest Online, 
          extending the exhibition experience was a central goal of the project.  
          To answer the question with any degree of confidence, we had to design 
          an approach that would allow us to examine Web experiences across three 
          groups of users: those who visited the exhibition only, those who visited 
          the Web site only, and those who visited both the exhibition and the 
          Web site.  </p>
        <h2>Research and Instrument Design</h2>
        <p>We knew that we wanted to obtain large samples of each group to give 
          us confidence in the results.  We also wanted to control who would participate 
          in this study.  We know from conducting museum visitor research that 
          more museum visitors have four or more years of college than the public 
          at large.  The exhibition was designed for museum audiences, and the 
          Web site was designed for life long learners interested in science and 
          Mars exploration - likely a subset of museum visitors.  MarsQuest Online 
          developers were clear in their desire that MarsQuest Online provide 
          a learning experience for users.  We designed a standardized questionnaire 
          that we would use as an interview with users and nonusers over the telephone.  
          This standardized questionnaire had multiple-choice questions and open-ended 
          questions that sought to identify users' learning experiences.  </p>
        <p>We wanted all three groups to have the same data collection experience 
          - that is, we wanted everyone to be interviewed over the telephone.  
          We assumed that some of these individuals would visit the Web site and 
          others would not - providing two of the three groups needed.  We intended 
          to rely on other museums' volunteers to help us collect phone numbers 
          of their visitors, but we learned doing so was too much of an imposition, 
          and after a year of trying to persuade other museums to help answer 
          this research question, we simple gave up.  Instead, we hired graduate 
          students to collect people's phone numbers.  We invited people to participate 
          in this study by approaching them at the exit of the exhibition and 
          giving them a beautiful photograph of Mars with a sticker on which was 
          printed the URL.  We asked people for their phone numbers and the best 
          time to call them.  </p>
        <p>We also needed Web only users.  To solve that problem, we had to let 
          go of our original desire to control our respondents (early on, we decided 
          science center visitors were a reasonable proxy) and decided we should 
          capture Web users only via the Web site.  The survey was placed on-line, 
          via a Flash-driven prompt inside the main navigation bar.  This made 
          the survey immune to pop-up blockers, and insensitive to the part of 
          the site being visited.  The prompt appears after the visitor has been 
          on the site for one minute.  Once the survey link is followed, the prompt 
          will not appear again on that computer.</p>
        <p>To identify exactly what on-line survey respondents have done, the 
          survey asks them whether they have visited the exhibition, and if so, 
          their responses will be placed in the Web and exhibition user group 
          with fellow telephone respondents.  Likewise, we also ask telephone 
          interviewees whether they visited the Web site, and if so, whether they 
          completed the on-line survey.  If they have, we thank them and move 
          on to the next call.  </p>
        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>In museum exhibition evaluation, response rates of 80 percent and higher 
          are expected.  When non-profits solicit for funds or when market researchers 
          conduct a study with the general public, a 1% response rate is not uncommon, 
          nor is it frowned upon.  Our Web survey currently has a response rate 
          of 2.7 percent and a smaller percent choose to complete the survey after 
          clicking on it.  The response rate for collecting phone numbers was 
          77%.  It is difficult to judge response rates because as of yet, there 
          does not appear to be an industry standard.  Prior to conducting any 
          evaluation, however, it is paramount to identify objectives of the Web 
          site, as objectives are the gauge against which outcomes are measured.  
          In this way, a Web site, as a product, is not different from any other 
          product that is evaluated.  Evaluation is the systematic collection 
          of information about a program that examines the successes and shortcomings 
          of the program against stated goals and objectives.  The MarsQuest Online 
          project had a specific target audience and specific learning objectives 
          which set the bar high for evaluation.  The team's attentiveness to 
          identifying success, as well as their passion for their subject, helped 
          make this evaluation very directed, but logistically, it was problematic 
          because no one anticipated how difficult it would be to collect data.   
        </p>
        <p>Complete results (including the telephone interviews) are still pending; 
          however, some preliminary results from the on-line survey are available.  
          To date, 217 visitors (2.7%) have clicked into the survey, and 91 (1%) 
          have completed the survey.  83% of the respondents are male.  26% report 
          high school or below as the highest level of education completed; 26% 
          report having a graduate or technical degree.   With respect to education 
          outcomes, we find:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>92% agreed that MarsQuest had shown them something they had not seen 
          or did not know before;</li>
        <li>53% agreed that their experience with the site changed how they think 
          about Mars</li>
        <li>49% agreed strongly (rating the statement a 7 on a 7-point scale) 
          that they had greater knowledge of Mars and Mars exploration as a result 
          of their experience with the site;</li>
        <li>42% agreed strongly (rating the statement a 7 on a 7-point scale) 
          that the experience made them more interested in learning about Mars 
          and Mars exploration;</li>
      </ul>
      
        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <p>One of the primary goals of the MarsQuest Online project was to determine 
          whether we could leverage from the original exhibition to extend its 
          reach and scope.  Embedded within that are additional questions. Are 
          effective exhibition approaches effective on-line as well?  Do we understand 
          what we can accomplish in on-line learning? Can we successfully evaluate 
          that learning? This project clearly is not going to answer all of those 
          questions, but we believe it can contribute to a baseline of data that 
          can help future projects.</p>
        <p>Some aspects of our approach clearly worked: the story, themes, and 
          framework of the exhibit resonate with Web visitors as well as with 
          exhibition visitors.  The visitor preferences measured on the site align 
          with those obtained in interviews at the exhibition. Even when visitors 
          do not perceive the framework in the exhibition, it helps them organize 
          their experiences when they visit the Web site.</p>
        <p>The emphasis on interactive activities also appears to be successful.  
          High percentages of visitors complete the activities, and even in the 
          absence of interviews, it is reasonable to conclude that they met the 
          learning goals set out for the pieces.  Dwell time is comparable on 
          the Web site and at the exhibits.  This doesn't speak to an upper limit 
          for how long visitors can be engaged on the Web, but it does demonstrate 
          that they will spend at least as much time with a piece on the Web as 
          they would at an exhibit: enough to complete the piece and meet our 
          goals.</p>
        <p>Interviews remain problematic.  Reaching individuals who have used 
          the site &quot;naturally&quot; (at home, unprompted by an evaluator) 
          is challenging.  Our original plan was to assert that science center 
          visitors constituted a reasonable proxy for our intended audience, then 
          reach them directly.  An alternative, which we are now pursing as well, 
          is on-line &quot;pop up&quot; surveys.  At 2-3%, our response rates 
          have been typical for this type of survey (e.g., Goldman and Schaller, 
          2004).  These rates are considered extremely low by the standards of 
          exhibit evaluation, though not by the standards of other professions 
          (marketing, for instance).  It may be that ultimately our community 
          will have to accept this response rate as the expected baseline for 
          this type of evaluation.</p>
        <h1>The Future</h1>
        <p>The last year has been a remarkable one for Mars exploration.  The 
          twin rovers, designed for three month missions, are still functioning 
          well a year later.  The rovers' discoveries are even more impressive 
          than their performance: we now know that Mars once harbored a salty, 
          liquid sea at a time when life was first starting on Earth. Future Mars 
          missions will follow, studying the planet from orbit at high resolution, 
          digging below the surface to search for life and eventually returning 
          samples of Martian rock to Earth.  </p>
        <p>The power of these events to capture the public's interest is extraordinary.  
          NASA received billions of Web hits in the weeks surrounding the rover 
          landings, and the numbers will only be higher for future missions.   
          The challenge for science educators is to use these opportunities to 
          create lasting change in the public's understanding of Mars, Mars exploration, 
          and planetary science in general.  Science centers and museums have 
          been refining their education strategies for years.  Our results with 
          the MarsQuest Online project support our belief that educational Web 
          sites can connect to and learn from museum exhibitions to become powerful 
          informal learning experiences in their own right.  </p>
