      <h1>Place-based Storytelling Tools: A new look at Monticello</h1>
      <h2>Brad Johnson, Second Story Interactive Studios, USA</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">Many cultural institutions face 
            the challenges of making their collections accessible and interpreting 
            them on-line. But what if the 'collection' isn't something on a wall, 
            in a case, or in storage, but is a house, a ship, a 5,000-acre plantation, 
            or all the tombs in the Valley of the Kings? This is an in-depth look 
            at how museums can create rich, immersive interactive sites that connect 
            on-line audiences with places and spaces,- and the ideas, people, objects 
            and histories that have inhabited them. This genre of museum site provides 
            accessibility to physically restrictive locations including remote locales, 
            endangered sites, restricted or dangerous areas, inaccessible rooms, 
            and places that no longer exist. Since most house museums were built 
            before ADA guidelines, these Web sites create new opportunities for 
            disabled visitors to explore places they have never been. Experiences 
            can go beyond the physical limitations of real geographies and beyond 
            the chronological constraints of the present, revealing how a place 
        evolved over time.</p>
      <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">Building on the lessons learned 
            from the Theban Mapping Project, Yin Yu Tang, and the new interactive 
            Monticello Explorer site, Second Story and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation 
            examine the genesis, process and result of their exciting new database-driven 
            3D experience that brings Jefferson, his house and plantation to life 
        on-line.</p>
      <p class="keywords" id="keywords">Keywords: physically restrictive locations,

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p class="blockquote">"Jefferson's real autobiography is Monticello. You can walk around the house and you begin to see the man."   (<em>David 
        McCullough, 1997</em>)</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig1.jpg" width="300" height="225" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson</p>
      <p>Few can leave a visit to the home of Thomas Jefferson unaffected. From 
            the plantation setting to the approach up the mountaintop and the first 
            glimpse of the house, through each stop in the tour, Monticello reveals 
            itself as the inspiring self-portrait of a heroic Renaissance man. As 
            visitors pass through each room, Jefferson's architectural vision gives 
            structure to his ceaseless curiosities and diverse accomplishments, 
            and the artifacts and stories encountered in each location all make 
        Jefferson, his ideas and his world come to life.</p>
      <p>Developing a compelling electronic experience that elicits similar 
            reactions from on-line audiences is a daunting task. While it is impossible 
            to recreate the feeling of being there, well-conceived orchestration 
            of multimedia's most engaging ingredients - comprehensive databases, 
            compelling 3D visualizations, intelligent mapping, rich audio/video, 
            intuitive user interfaces and great content - can transport viewers' 
        imaginations to places they have never been. </p>
      <h1>Fixed Presentation or Dynamic Tool</h1>
      <p>One of the first considerations in determining how to realize a place-based 
            Web site is to determine how dynamic the offering needs to be. If the 
            subject of the site is a location where active research or ongoing reinterpretation 
            is happening, or where collections are growing or changing, a fixed 
            or canned presentation would become inadequate over time, or require 
            considerable maintenance to update. Conversely, a database-driven dynamic 
            solution might be a waste of effort and money if the content never needs 
            to change. To illustrate the differences and appropriateness of each 
            of these approaches, the fixed <em>Yin Yu Tan</em>' site at the Peabody 
            Essex Museum will be contrasted with the dynamic <em>Atlas of the Valley 
        of the Kings</em> for the Theban Mapping Project.</p>
      <p>Yu Tang is an elegant, rural home originally located in a small, remote 
            village in the southeastern region of Huizhou in China's Anhui Province. 
            Built in the late Qing dynasty (1644-1911) by a Chinese merchant surnamed 
            Huang, the residence was home to the Huang family for over two hundred 
            years. By the mid-nineteen-eighties, all surviving Huang family members 
            had moved away from their home which sat in silence until 1997, when 
            the family and the government authorized that the house be transported 
            across the world, to be opened to the public at the Peabody Essex Museum 
            in Salem, Massachusetts. The museum commissioned a Web site for visitors 
            to explore the house to discover this rare example of the region's renowned 
        architecture and learn about the daily life of the Huang family. </p>
      <p>Once the house was re-erected in the museum and filled with objects 
            and belongings, active research, interpretation and collecting came 
            to a close. There was no need for a Yin Yu Tang collection database 
            or for content management tools to make ongoing additions or edits to 
            the site. It was important that the museum direct how the materials 
            in the Web site be presented, and clear that providing unmediated access 
            to house features or collection records would not support the interpretive 
            goals of the museum. For these reasons, a canned or fixed presentation 
        was more appropriate and more affordable.</p>
      <p>By contrast, the needs of the Theban Mapping project were very different. 
            Since 1978, the Theban Mapping Project, under the direction of Egyptologist 
            Dr. Kent Weeks, has been working to prepare a comprehensive archaeological 
            database of the Valley and the entire Theban Necropolis. With information 
            about every archaeological, geological and ethnographic feature in the 
            Valley of the Kings, nearly 6,000 photographs and illustrations, over 
            250 detailed maps, elevations and sections, exhaustive bibliographic 
            resources, articles and glossaries - and a full-time staff engaged in 
            ongoing research, archeological digs, surveying and photography - this 
            organization needed a Web site that could easily be updated, added to 
            and modified. Beyond the needs of a dynamic Web-based publishing system 
            to accommodate active research and interpretation, what are other factors 
            to consider in determining whether a place-based Web site should be 
        fixed or database-driven?</p>
      <p>Is the institution providing a resource for self-directed research, 
            or is the site an on-line equivalent of a house tour? Database-driven 
            solutions are needed when visitors can search for items within a place 
            or when they can access records for items in customized inquiries outside 
            a mediated tour track. For example, when particular objects, ideas or 
            people can be related to multiple locations within a place, or when 
            there are enough meaningful relationships defined between these records 
            that a visitor could discover things based on personalized inquiries, 
            a database solution is imperative. Without the ongoing need to easily 
            publish new records or new interpretive content, without the need to 
            facilitate personalized search and discovery for visitors, and without 
            an existing database, a dynamic, database-driven solution is unnecessary. 
            At Monticello, an existing collection database, a staff devoted to ongoing 
            interpretation, a team of archeologists conducting ongoing research, 
            the need for powerful searches and the need to make the Web site a tool 
            for self-directed inquiry as well as for virtual tours - all required 
        a dynamic solution.</p>
      <p>The idea of connecting locations with a database is straightforward: 
            records in a collection have a relationship with locations (and vice 
            versa). Visitors discover records related to a place as they move from 
            one location to another, or they discover locations related to records 
            as they navigate through a database. The job of a place-based storytelling 
            tool is to spatially contextualize content related to the place so that 
            the relationship between records and locations is clearly established. 
            This context requires compelling representations of locations that clearly 
            describe and interconnect places, so visitors can intuit the relationships 
        between the locations.</p>
      <h1>3D Representations of a Place</h1>
      <p>Monticello refers not only to the house that Thomas Jefferson built, 
            but to the entire mountaintop and plantation as well. The task was to 
            make a site that contextualized content with locations that were both 
            architectural and purely geographic (outside). Some locations were rooms 
            within a house, and other locations were coordinates in a field. While 
            two-dimensional representations of the outdoor locations (maps) were 
            acceptable, two-dimensional representations of the house (measured drawings) 
            would be underwhelming: the third dimension was required to communicate 
        the interiors more intuitively. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a><img src="johnson.fig2.gif" width="400" height="373" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Yin Yu Tang 3D Treatment"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 2: Yin Yu Tang 3D Treatment: 'wireframe hidden-line 
        removed.'</p>
      <p>In Yin Yu Tang, the house was primarily represented as a dissected 
            axonometric object. As content was presented, corresponding views of 
            the house were revealed and highlighted. This fixed, persistent orientation 
            in the interface gave visitors an easy contextual architectural reference, 
            but the detached omnipresent perspective lacks an immersive quality. 
            In this Web site, 3D was employed exclusively for visualization: visitors 
        could not navigate from one location to another within the 3D model.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig3.gif" width="385" height="337" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Theban Mapping Project"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 3: Theban Mapping Project Description Mode Treatment: 
            when navigating through the tombs in the self-directed 'Description' 
            mode, visitors could use the scalable vector (axonometric) wireframe 
        treatments to navigate from chamber to chamber.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig4.gif" width="400" height="420" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Theban Mapping Project"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Figure 4: Theban Mapping Project 3D Tour Treatments: 
            when the tour guide moves through the spaces and refers to architectural 
            features, the wireframe treatment (above) is a lower bandwidth option 
            that communicates the interior spaces; when the guide refers to the 
            surface decorations on the walls, laser scans are revealed that link 
        to high resolution color images.</p>
      <p>In the Theban Mapping Project, tombs were represented in many different 
            ways. The <strong>Description</strong> section displayed data and images 
            in context as visitors selected different 'rooms' in a reactive wireframe 
            axonometric representation. A non-navigable 3D tour of one of the tombs 
            (visitors could pause, play and jump to cue points in the linear narrative) 
            was treated with the architectural 'wireframe hidden-line removed' style 
            with QuantaPoint scans interspersed. This fast loading approach was 
            made possible by the Swift3D renderer that exports Flash vector graphics 
            and proved to be extremely accurate and appropriate for interpreting 
            the architectural spaces. More bandwidth was used for the grayscale 
        bitmaps that revealed the surface decoration on the tomb's walls. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig5.gif" width="378" height="250" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: The Mysterious World of Mummies"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 5: 'Unwrapped: The Mysterious World of Mummies' 
        treatment employed a 3D game style with texture maps and dramatic lighting.</p>
      <p>In <em>Unwrapped: the Mysterious World of Mummies</em>, a generic tomb 
            from the Valley of the Kings was recreated in convincing 3D, complete 
            with texture maps and dramatic lighting. This inaccurate 'caricature' 
            was acceptable for the intended game-like experience of this TLC (Discovery 
            Communications) site. Here the 3D is more than a visual aid: within 
            the 3D experience visitors can navigate from one predefined node to 
            another and can pivot and look in any direction. In certain sections, 
            they can roll over features in the tomb and access more specif ic interpretive 
        information. </p>
      <p>In Monticello we were determined to combine the best of these approaches 
            where the model served as a visualization tool and a navigation device: 
            visitors would be immersed inside the virtual spaces of the model and 
        use it to navigate from room to room. </p>
      <p>Realistic 3D models of an architectural space require comprehensive, 
            accurate measurements which can be obtained in at least two ways. Measured 
            drawings, (plans, sections, elevations) derived from human observation 
            have been until recently the only means by which measurements could 
            be made. Digital measured drawings of Yin Yu Tang were developed by 
            preservation architects in CAD format that modelers could use as a reference 
            in 3D programs. The measured drawings of Monticello came from the Historic 
            American Building Survey (HABS), but unfortunately they were literal 
            drawings created before CAD was prevalent. While the data is still there, 
            the amount of work required to input all these values was immense. Fortunately, 
            a laser scanning technique used in the tombs in the Valley of the Kings 
        for the Theban Mapping Project was also an option at Monticello.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.fig6.gif" width="400" height="468" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Historic American Building Survey"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 6: Historic American Building Survey (HABS) plan 
        showing the South Square room in Monticello.</p>
      <p>Laser scanners developed by QuantaPoint were employed to scan the interior 
            and exterior of the house on two occasions. A small portable scanning 
            unit is strategically positioned throughout the house. At each position 
            the unit's head spins and tilts, emitting a laser beam that records 
            the distance from itself to every surface surrounding it in every direction. 
            The resulting <strong>point cloud</strong> represents the observable 
            surfaces in the room and can in turn be converted into 3D modeling data. 
      </p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 7: Point cloud generated from laser scan of the 
        South Square room. </p>
      <p>Unlike the drawings obtained by human observation, this technology 
            records every imperfection, anomaly or characteristic that often occurs 
            in old buildings over time, but remains virtually undetectable by human 
            observation. In addition to the greater accuracy of data, the time required 
            to capture that data with a laser scanner is a fraction of the alternative.

        created to evaluate appropriate ways to represent the house in 3D. </p>
      <p>The model of the house could now be created, and after considering 
            many different rendering techniques, two distinct treatments were chosen: 
            as visitors move from room to room or pivot within one room, a simplified 
            vector wireframe style is used, and when visitors pause, a shaded, lit 
            grayscale bitmap image loads. In this way a fast loading vector solution 
            gives visitors a sense of the spaces and the relationships between them 
            as they navigate, and the shaded grayscale communicates Jefferson's 
        original architectural vision of the house.</p>

      <h1>Modes of Navigation</h1>
      <p>Developing a compelling navigation scheme for the Web site started 
            with an assessment of the way people visit the brick-and-mortar Monticello. 
            There are first time visitors who begin their experience with a general 
            house tour, returning visitors on special thematic tours, visitors exploring 
            the gardens and grounds by themselves, and scholars conducting research. 
            This site needed to have discreet navigation modes to accommodate each 
            of these different visitor profiles, and had to serve a wide gamut of 
            audiences who come with varying amounts of knowledge about Monticello. 
            A <strong>browse</strong> or <strong>explore</strong> mode would allow 
            users to directly access locations and related materials through self-directed 
            pathways that reflect their curiosities, and a more controlled <strong>tour</strong> 
        mode would provide mediated tracks through the site to help uninitiated 
        visitors discover Monticello. </p>
      <p>With one integrated application-like feature strategically modularized 
            to serve different audiences (from school children to general visitors 
            to academics) and different bandwidth capabilities (from narrowband 
            to broadband), the project simultaneously accommodates 'surgical researchers' 
            who want fast access to information and visitors who want to be educated 
            and entertained through an immersive tour leading them through the core 
            components of the site. This approach blends the entertaining qualities 
        of interactive storytelling with access to authoritative data and resources.</p>
      <p>The tours imagined for this project were unlike any other, and more 
            closely approximate the kind of interpretive tour one would get at Monticello 
            or in a museum. As opposed to a distinct offering within a site - like 
            a narrated movie, for example - these tours are powerful wrappers around 
            the site. In other words, most on-line tours more closely approximate 
            the orientation theater experience in a museum;  they are discreet stand-alone 
            features in the site rather than modes of moving through the site itself. 
            Here the tour is in essence a narrated auto-play mode of navigation 
            that guides visitors through the site in scripted pathways that interpret 
            and introduce content (the same content that is freely accessible in 
        self-directed explore mode). </p>
      <p>At launch, visitors can select from either one of two tours: a <em>General 
            House Tour</em> or the <em>Domestic Life at Monticello Tour</em>. Tours 
            are comprised of a series of narrated segments strung together, much 
            as a house tour guide delivers discreet segments at defined nodes in 
        the house. Tours can be experienced in the following ways:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>
             Tours can be in a passive linear format from 
              beginning to end, just as visitors to the real house might follow 
            their guide through an entire tour.</li>
          <li>
             Tours can be paused while users digress and investigate 
              records in more detail, just as  visitors may wish to stop in the 
              cabinet and study the polygraph while the guide and group wait for 
            them (but can't really do).</li>
          <li>
             Tours can interconnect, enabling visitors to 
              leave the <em>General House Tour</em> and join the <em>Domestic Life 
              at Monticello Tour</em> (imagine being on a tour in an art museum 
              and overhearing another - more interesting - tour and joining the 
              other group).</li>
          <li>
             Tours can be abandoned at any point, leaving 
              the visitor at the active location in <strong>explore </strong>mode 
              (imagine staying in Jefferson's library to explore everything in the 
              room while the group moves on!).</li>
          <li>
             Tours can be joined midstream such that users 
              exploring the house on their own can join a tour in the current location 
              (imagine wandering around the house, overhearing an interesting guide 
            in the parlor, and joining their tour).</li>
        </ol>
        
          <p>As each of these cases illustrate, tours are another means of navigating 
            the site, and visitors are free to weave in and out of them throughout 
            their experience, navigating between mediated and self-directed exploration 
            modes.</p>
          <p>Instead of the tours, visitors can begin their exploration of Monticello 
            by selecting either the plantation or the house. In the plantation section, 
            visitors can select locations by name in a menu list, or pan across 
            and zoom in and out of every detailed feature on a large topographic 
            map of the greater plantation area. Visitors can explore different areas 
            of the mountain, discovering fields, farms, archeological sites, historic 
            roads, gardens or any feature of interest. Selecting the desired historical 
            period controls the visibility of sites, locations and features on the 
            map. In this way, visitors can observe how a place changes over time. 
            In addition to showing changes in the plantation, the exteriors of the 
            current house and Jefferson's first version of the house were modeled 
            and can be compared at any angle.</p>
          <p>When locations are selected, thumbnails of related records are displayed 
            so visitors can see photographs of the location as well as database 
            records that have a relationship to the active location. Each image 
            is a link to an object, a drawing, an animation, a story or another 
            media component. Users can set filters to only show thumbnails and content 
            related to specific inquiry modes (<strong>show only architectural details</strong>, 
            e.g.), further facilitating customization. In the house, visitors explore 
            by name in a menu list by selecting locations on a floor plan or by 
            navigating within the 3D environment. As visitors move through Monticello, 
            the database records connected to each room spill out into the interface 
            like the contents of an overstuffed curiosity cabinet - each record 
            a portal to help visitors better understand the place, the people that 
            lived there and the man who made it, Thomas Jefferson. </p>
          <p>In the end, the application-like qualities of the Web site serve diverse 
            audiences and  different learning styles, and - unlike fixed presentations 
            - can be experienced in so many ways that repeated visits can be unique 
            every time. Visitors can tour or explore, and their exploration can 
            be focused to specific time periods or themes. One time a visitor might 
            explore the house learning about Jefferson's life at Monticello, while 
            another time  the visit could examine the house's architectural features. 
            The scalable granularity even enables some visitors to fly around the 
            plantation and learn where different farms were located, while others 
            might find out what specific plants are found in a particular flower 
            bed. Combining a structure that supports such customization with the 
            fact that the storytellers at the Thomas Jefferson Foundation will continue 
            to add more records, tours and features throughout the plantation, means 
            this place-based storytelling tool will captivate audiences for many 
            years in unexpected ways.</p>
          <h1>Future Opportunities</h1>
          <p>The back end programming that makes this experience possible keeps 
            track of visitors' movements through the site, including all the customization 
            they might make in the course of their exploration. This enables visitors 
            to use the browser's <strong>back</strong> button to revisit their breadcrumb 
            trail, even though the site is developed in Flash.  It is rare to be 
            able to do this in sites developed in Flash, especially such customizable 
            ones. Since the site keeps a running history of the locations visited 
            juxtaposed with the corresponding database records revealed in each 
            location, the visitor is able to capture this state and email the record 
            to colleagues, friends or students. This seemingly small detail turns 
            out to pave the way for powerful enhancements that can be made to the 
            site in the future.</p>
          <p>If a visitor can share a customized state in the site, enhancements 
            could be made to save a series of states. In other words, visitors would 
            be able to send a link not only to a single location in the site, but 
            to a string of locations that they assembled according to a specific 
            order, with specific customized states (e.g. only displaying architectural 
            features). An additional enhancement would enable these visitors to 
            annotate each location/state, adding their own text to the string of 
            'bookmarks.' In this way, viewers could use the site as their own storytelling 
            tool, weaving together their own entertaining playlists of favorite 
            places or scholarly interpretive tours of Monticello to share.</p>
