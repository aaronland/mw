      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>New media art (including digital art, net.art, and interactive installations) 
            has had an interesting relationship with major art institutions over 
            the past five years. In Canada, one particular history of new media 
            art and the institution is longer than that. This year, the Banff New 
            Media Institute (BNMI) &#8211; a world-class research and content innovation 
            Centre &#8211; is celebrating its tenth anniversary. For the last decade, 
            BNMI has been supporting research into the production and distribution 
            of all forms of content using new media technologies &#8211; from art 
            installations to video games to interactive television programmes. To 
            mark the anniversary, BNMI is undertaking a number of activities. These 
        include:</p>
            <ul>
          <li>
             Publication of an anthology of writings</li>
          <li>
             An international exhibition</li>
          <li>
             A reunion programme of the annual summit <em>Interactive Screen</em></li>
          <li>
             A release of DVD editions of the on-line journal <em>Horizon Zero</em></li>
          <li>
             The digitisation of audio archives</li>
          <li>An art history and new media international academic conference (Refresh)</li>
          <li>
             The creation and ongoing support of a 'collaboration net'</li>
          <li>The commissioning of visualizations of the history and networks of 
            the BNMI.</li>
        </ul>
        
          <p>This paper addresses the production of these elements of the BNMI's 
            anniversary and as well discusses the key themes and questions about 
            new media cultural production (from interface to community to artistic 
            uses of the Web) which have arisen in the process. It represents a possible 
            beginning of a case study of the BNMI's ten-year contribution 
            to new media culture, including reflection on the tools and structures 
            used to produce and document theory and practice.</p>
          <h1>The History</h1>
          <p>The BNMI focuses on the cultures of expression and use, enabling the 
            creation of applications and technologies for participatory culture. 
            New media at The Banff Centre converges art, design, architecture, dance, 
            performance, computer science, engineering and science research with 
            education, health, cultural industries, social sciences, humanities, 
            and other constantly emerging forms of content. Fundamental to the BNMI 
            is the belief that the creative sector &#8211; artists and cultural industries, 
            in collaboration with scientists, social scientists and humanists &#8211; 
            has a critical role to play in developing technologies that work for 
            human betterment. </p>
          <p>More than any other new media institution in the world, the BNMI has 
            consistently provoked rigorous, provocative cross-disciplinary debates 
            and productive dialogues about new media. Summits and critical workshops 
            have occurred four to six times each year for eleven years, building 
            on small workshops and conferences that took place at Banff from 1990-1994. 
            This occurs within the context of artistic co-production and research 
            that grounds the BNMI in the presence of practice. The Centre has played 
            a key role in Canada and internationally in the development and sustenance 
            of research into new media technologies and their affect on art practice 
            in particular and society in general.</p>
          <p>Ten years ago, in 1994, the BNMI began with a conversation on a bus 
            between Steven DeNure (then the Senior Vice-President and creative director 
            of Alliance Media, the largest Canadian production and distribution 
            company at that time) and Sara Diamond. Both were interested in creating 
            a context where artists, traditional media producers, technology researchers 
            and thinkers could meet in ongoing dialogue. This discussion began at 
            the very moment the Web was about to come into existence from the seeds 
            of the visual Internet, and at a time when there was tremendous wealth 
            being generated by the software sector. <em>Interactive Screen</em> 
            (financed by Alliance Media, The Banff Centre, and Industry Canada) 
            was born, bringing together the leading writers, directors and producers 
            of television and feature film in Canada to expose them to researchers 
            in interactive television, virtual reality and interactive fiction. 
          </p>
          <p>This initiative (which would prove to be the seed of the BNMI) was 
            possible because The Banff Centre, under the leadership of Michael Century 
            and Douglas MacLeod, had launched a world-renowned artists' project 
            in the field of virtual reality. This venture in turn built on a cross-disciplinary 
            residency, <em>The Bioapparatus</em> (1990), led by Catherine Richards 
            and Nell Tennhaaf. They voiced the uncomfortable but valuable friction 
            among independent artists, researchers in the domain of technologies, 
            and theorists. Artists in the 'Art and Virtual Environment' 
            programme laboured side by side with computer scientists, electronic 
            music composers, and graphics artists. The BNMI underscored the productive 
            quality of these debates, structured them, and facilitated their expression.</p>
          <p>Today, the BNMI is a goldmine of crucial ideas about art, technology, 
            society and media that have resulted from these culturally rich encounters. 
            Hundreds of hours of material have been generated from the nearly one 
            thousand visits made by artists, scientists, and theorists over the 
            last ten years.</p>
          <h1>The Context</h1>
          <p>The Banff Centre is not a museum, nor is the BNMI an exhibition generator 
            <em>per se</em>. The Banff Centre does have a collection of art works, 
            most by former resident artists, on view at all times  across the campus. 
            The Banff Centre also has a gallery &#8211; the Walter Phillips &#8211; 
            that exhibits temporary exhibitions of contemporary art, and until recently 
            held an annual exhibition of new media artwork. The BNMI is one of many 
            programmes that have flourished under the umbrella of The Banff Centre. 
            The Banff Centre is unique in that it is a place of scholarship and  
            information exchange. The BNMI, unlike the Gallery programme or music 
            and theatre programmes of The Banff Centre, for instance, supports the 
            creation of intellectual property and prototypes for cultural and commercial 
            projects. In this, the BNMI holds an intellectual and practical archive 
            that is unique in its cross-disciplinary and inclusive qualities.  As 
            a result, seen together, the activities of the BNMI comprise an archive 
            of the voices of Canadian new media artists, curators and scientists 
            in a framework that links them to international events and concerns.</p>
          <p>It is understood within the ethos of the BNMI that new media is a tool 
            as well as a method; the technology is both form and content of the 
            practice of its participants. New media is not only interpretational, 
            used on behalf of other forms of content, but is also content itself.</p>
          <p>One example of this ethos is <em>Horizon Zero</em>, a multimedia Web 
            magazine about digital art and culture in Canada. Produced in eighteen 
            issues over the course of three years, this bilingual virtual space 
            devoted to creativity and critical ideas in the new media canon was 
            occasion to commission writers, artists and interactive graphic designers 
            to explore an extensive range of subjects &#8211; from memory to gaming 
            to tactility. <em>Horizon Zero</em>’s issues represented an alternative 
            method of distributing content to the usual offline channels, and as 
            such the content was geared to such an interactive communal space. The 
            issues are now archived on DVD-ROM.</p>
          <h1>Tactics of Historicising This Legacy</h1>
          <h2>Researching And Presenting A History Of New Media </h2>
          <p>There are differences between curating an exhibition of new media art 
            and creating other educational or interpretational media to support 
            engagement with new media art. The BNMI focuses its activities for the 
            most part on the latter. See for example Karen Parker's discussion 
            (2005) of the creation of an online tool for collaborative research 
            into new media. While curating an exhibition is often seen as <strong>content</strong> 
            production (the display of new work), organising seminars and editing 
            books is often seen as <strong>context</strong> production (establishing 
            the ground for the new work). Within the field of new media it is difficult 
            to separate out these two activities (content production from context 
            production), as they often share the same platform (for instance, the 
            Web) and demand similar research trajectories.</p>
          <p>In order to realise the BNMI's exhibition and book projects, 
            it has been necessary to create an archive to support the research process, 
            both on paper (locked in a file cabinet) and digitally. This archive 
            consists of agendas from every event ever held at the BNMI as well as 
            class lists of participants, workshop materials, background readings, 
            and presentation-related documentation.</p>
          <p>The BNMI has built audio archives of its events and workshops since 
            its inception in 1995. These articulate and often controversial presentations 
            provide a strong sense of the context and time of each event. These 
            have consistently been digitised and are being placed on-line for visitors 
            to listen to. The Banff Centre has a short-range FM pirate radio station 
            that also broadcasts on the Internet at radio90.fm. In the course of 
            conducting research for the exhibition and publication, it was suggested 
            that those audio recordings which were not yet available on-line could 
            be played on an 'archive hour' on Radio90 so that collaborators 
            outside Banff could tune in on-line to listen to them.</p>
          <p>The publication, which spans a decade's worth of material from 
            the productive summits, seminars and conference activities, will be 
            organized by key themes that have underscored the dialogues and resulting 
            activities of the BNMI and new media culture. The book will be comprised 
            primarily of transcripts, beginning in 1995 with <em>Interactive Screen</em> 
            through the contemporary summits and workshops. Each section will be 
            introduced by a short summary from the book editors or section editors, 
            including Sara Diamond, Susan Kennard, and exhibition co-curator Steve 
            Dietz. Short chapters will discuss the roles of research and co-production 
            at Banff from 1990 to 2005. </p>
          <p>While the Walter Phillips Gallery does have an established track record 
            of exhibiting new media art, only a small percentage of the co-produced 
            art works to emerge from the BNMI have been shown at The Banff Centre. 
            For the exhibition, which seeks to address both the ten-year history 
            as well as the range of themes that have circled around the BNMI's 
            activities, a massive list of artists who have 'been through the 
            door' at Banff was drawn up. This has enabled a curatorial selection 
            process that is not  based just on the actual art works produced or 
            previously exhibited at Banff, but also on the range of past and current 
            practice by those artists who have remained committed in their work 
            to the development of the field. Steve Dietz  (who is based in Minneapolis) 
            and I (based in the UK) have filtered our way through this long list 
            by keeping an on-line wiki – which we can each update remotely. At time 
            of writing, the checklist for the exhibition is still under discussion; 
            however, a few key concerns have arisen.</p>
          <p>First, while we don't want to give up trying to represent the history 
            of the BNMI and the field of new media, it is a difficult job to do 
            with a limited budget, a finite amount of space and the vast changes 
            in technology from 1994 to today. As a result, we've decided to 
            curate an exhibition with perhaps no more than half a dozen art works. 
            Therefore we are seeking out significant projects that, seen together, 
            manage to reflect a train of thinking across ten years &#8211; works 
            that have historical connections, but might be entirely contemporary. 
            It is important for the exhibition to demonstrate new media art endeavors 
            that 'know' they have a history.</p>
          <p>Undertaking the curatorial research for the exhibition and archival 
            research for the publication has pointed out key moments in the history 
            of new media art that owe their beginnings to the BNMI. In 1998, BNMI 
            hosted a conference on curating and conserving new media &#8211; the 
            first of its kind which addressed in particular the place of on-line 
            art in a museum context. In 2000 and 2002, the Bridges Conferences (which 
            included some museum professionals) was groundbreaking in its bringing-together 
            of scientists, technologists and producers (artists and others) from 
            the creative cultural industries, to discuss models of production and 
            distribution and common tactics (in and out of institutional affiliation). 
            More recently, the BNMI has instigated and supported research into collaboration 
            and its integral place in the new media landscape.</p>
          <h2>Themes Within The History Of New Media</h2>
          <p>Those mentioned above are but a few of the themes that permeate the 
            summits of the BNMI. Several of these continue from the early New Media 
            Research initiatives that were part of the activities in the early 1990s, 
            through the late-1990s fragility of new media industries, the danger 
            of the technology drive, the weakness of dotcoms and the obstacles that 
            blocked the production of compelling content. </p>
          <p>Early on was the strong emphasis on virtual reality (now visualization), 
            together with the beginning of an exploration of authoring tools, computer 
            music and surround sound, and Aboriginal culture in new media. As the 
            BNMI emerged, a wider group of themes recurred  through summits and 
            workshops. These are collaborative processes and tools, including the 
            creation process and the experience and learning processes; 3D experience, 
            virtual reality and ubiquity, networked 3D and immersive sound, emotional 
            computing, and on-line virtual worlds; biotechnology and materiality; 
            convergence, including television and new media, games, and other cultural 
            forms; sound and interactive media; and Aboriginal new media culture.</p>
          <h2>Community Development</h2>
          <p>Banff producer Susan Kennard has spearheaded research into the themes 
            of community development in new media both from an industry perspective 
            and an individual one.</p>
          <p>The BNMI has held summits every year on the topic of 'Money and 
            Law, addressing how multimedia is produced. The BNMI has also had a 
            close link with the Banff International Television Festival, and numerous 
            summits have addressed the more mainstream models of production from 
            the broadcast sector. The inclusion of practising new media artists 
            in summits such as <em>Skinning our Tools: Cultural Difference, Aboriginal 
            Presence</em>, <em>Synch or Swim: Subversion, Dispersion and Tactical 
            media</em> and <em>Avatar, Avatar: Where for art thou</em>? has brought 
            a completely different idea of community development into the picture 
          &#8211; one not based on the top-down production of new media content 
            for a collective audience of consumers, but rather on participation 
            and ground-up initiatives centred on the individual.</p>
          <p>This is in part also because the ten-year history of new media production 
            has seen some dramatic shifts in the economic landscape. With the utopian 
            opening up of markets (the dot-com boom) came an emphasis on creating 
            content for the consumer. With the more distopian retreating horizon 
            of what turned out to be in many instances an entirely virtual economy 
            (the dot-com bust) came a shift in perspective about the role of and 
            constituency of the audience &#8211; from consumer to user, and even 
            content provider (think for instance, of reality shows that generate 
            part of their budget through phone-in voting). How do we now think of 
            the audience: as the interactant, the observer, the participant? These 
            industry-related economic shifts were concurrent with changes in understanding 
            of public space. Copy-left and open source/free shareware movements 
            continue to sustain those creative producers engaged less in the hype 
            of convergence and more in the spirit of generosity that most social 
            (and hence digital) networks are founded upon. This is all the more 
            relevant today when public and private spaces are blurred as technologies 
            become more intimate, portable, mobile, ubiquitous, responsive and individual.</p>
          <h2>Artistic Uses of the Web</h2>
          <p>From beginnings in research into the artistic possibilities of virtual 
            reality (1994) and early explorations into authoring tools, the theme 
            of visualisation has been a consistent one at the BNMI. More recently, 
            interest in this issue has moved towards a consideration of immersive 
            data-driven spaces. Is architecture data? How do we interact with it? 
            Engage with it? Is data material? Tangible? Solid? </p>
          <p>The Web is just one way we encounter networked-data. But it is not 
            the only way artists have chosen to work with computer networks. Artists 
            working with new media have consistently questioned how to describe 
            the qualities of data and how data can be managed, imaged or represented. 
            Summits held by the BNMI such as <em>Unforgiving Memory: The Ephemeral 
            Archive and the Data Base </em>have propelled these debates. Databases 
            structure our economy, our knowledge systems, and our security. Yet 
            these structures serve and are subject to multiple goals and agendas. 
            Our practical experience of databases in Westernized societies suggests 
            not just access to information about the world, but also the world's 
            access to information about us. We are the objects of databases: a phone 
            number to market to, a credit risk, a questionable border-crosser.</p>
          <p>As artist and theorist Lev Manovich suggests, for such an ubiquitous 
            cultural form as the database &#8211; just as was the case with the 
            automobile, skyscrapers, even perspective &#8211; we need to imagine 
            the possibilities; to actively shape them and participate in how they 
            are used to organize the world we live in. While artists have always 
            been interested in collections and archives, with networked new media, 
            the possibilities of making old data new or new data old are that much 
            more varied. Thus, together with Steve Dietz and Walter Phillips Gallery 
            director Anthony Kiendl, I co-curated the exhibition <em>Database Imaginary</em> 
            which presented at Banff the work of thirty-three artists interrogating 
            the form of the database in their work. The art included in the exhibition 
            warns, astounds, and challenges us to understand database culture as 
            a pervasive aspect of our contemporary environment and our lived experience. 
          </p>
          <h2>Interfaces and Beyond</h2>
          <p>Along these same lines, Sara Diamond (2005) reflects on the ongoing 
            research the BNMI has supported into the issue of how new media technologies 
            change our perception of time, space and the individual. Summits at 
            Banff such as <em>Emotional Architecture: The Realism and Abstraction 
            Debate in New Media </em>and <em>Navigating Intelligence: Testing Turing</em> 
            have questioned the notion of the interface, asking how we perceive 
            and negotiate the 'cold' architectures of computer-driven 
            media (from virtual-reality driven environments to computer databases). 
            Learning from the many artist-scientist and artist-technologist relationships 
            to have emerged from the BNMI (where at times the artist has been perceived 
            as the one who represents the emotional and human side of interaction 
            and the scientist the logical, machinic or programmed), Diamond discusses 
            the importance of collaboration. Only through collaboration, participation 
            and interaction can preconceptions about what is interface and what 
            is behind it be dismantled.</p>
          <p>Recent work at the BNMI has had strong emphasis on creating platforms 
            for the production and distribution of new media content, be they mobile, 
            wireless or on-line. Emerging from this research are new strategies 
            for working together in networked environments, expanding the possibilities 
            of the spaces of cultural production: from museums and galleries, on 
            the Web, to medialabs, industry, and science labs.</p>
          <h1>Conclusions</h1>
          <p>In this essay I have, through describing the BNMI's activities, 
            reflected on the tools and structures used to produce and document the 
            theory as well as practice of new media cultural producers (artists, 
            theorists, developers, etc.).</p>
          <p>In developing the projects surrounding the anniversary of the BNMI, 
            one challenge has been to share and highlight the legacy of an institute 
            whose strengths are in the scholarship that has been generated around 
            programmed events, one-offs, discussions: process &#8211; and not the 
            traditionally more tangible products such as exhibitions or art works. 
            The BNMI produces knowledge and relationships: intellectual property 
            and collaboration. In order to share this kind of scholarship, the fundamental 
            requirement, which we are lucky to have, is good documentation.</p>
          <p>We have also learned that even in the fast-paced world of new media, 
            archival projects take time. Finding the material, cataloguing and organising 
            it and making it available are just three of the stages, and each has 
            its own hermetic timeline. However, the BNMI both exists in and creates 
            an environment that is a 'growth-culture', sitting as close 
            to the front edge of the curve as possible. Through this the BNMI is 
            very different from a museum, which by definition sits behind the curve 
            of production by its very nature, historicising through scholarship. 
            For the BNMI, a records management approach, where the files are still 
            'alive' and accessible, and in many cases are migrated from 
            one format to another (audio tape to digital file, to on-line stream) 
            was a more useful strategy than archival preservation (though the BNMI 
            is working on an archival preservation strategy as well).</p>
          <p>This case study of the BNMI suggests the benefit that can be had from 
            providing different access points for different audiences: an on-line 
            magazine, a traditional anthology, an exhibition, the production of 
            new tools to support future working, making available the archival material 
            to future researchers. While there are certainly some themes in new 
            media art that have remained constant in the ten years that the BNMI 
            spans - artistic uses of networked data, tools that support community 
            building, a constant questioning of the interfaces we encounter as human 
            beings in an ever-digital world - tracking the changes and developments 
            of those themes is still a challenging and rewarding task.</p>
