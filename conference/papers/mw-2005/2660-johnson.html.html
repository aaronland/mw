      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p id="abstract">At the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), where 
        we have been creating and publishing rich digital content for more than 
        ten years, the urgent question has become how we can guide our audiences

      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>At the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), where we have been 
        creating and publishing rich digital content for more than ten years, 
        the urgent question has become how we can guide our audiences to the information 
        of greatest interest to them, whether they are accessing our Web site 
        remotely or using our multimedia programs at the Museum. We are also asking 
        ourselves what, if any, should be the difference between those two experiences.</p>
      <p>Until recently we had been suffering from the classic problem of first-generation 
        Web sites and multimedia programs: the institution organizes its content 
        in the ways <em>it </em>thinks about itself, replicating its historical 
        development in the digital realm, rather than organizing and presenting 
        content in ways that are intuitive from a visitor&rsquo;s point of view. 
        On the Web, for example, our educational multimedia content was buried 
        deep within the <strong>Education</strong> section of the Web site and, 
        for all practical purposes, inaccessible to those who weren&rsquo;t familiar 
        with this unique aspect of SFMOMA&rsquo;s digital offerings. Users who 
        didn&rsquo;t happen to click through to a particular sub page never discovered 
        the rich variety of multimedia content available on-line. Meanwhile, on 
        the kiosks in SFMOMA&rsquo;s Koret Visitor Education Center, we had organized 
        content using the titles that the programs had at the time of their creation. 
        The titling system was meaningful to us, but to an outsider it simply 
        obscured many potentially rewarding educational experiences.</p>
      <p>This organic, &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; evolution is typical of most museum 
        Web sites and multimedia programs developed in the late 1990s and early 
        2000s. This paper outlines our attempts to remedy the situation within 
        a modest budget, without rebuilding from the ground up. Still, these efforts 
        constitute a significant correction, and put us in the position to explore 
        what our next-generation digital resources will look like.</p>
      <h1>On-line</h1>
      <h2>The On-line Challenge</h2>
      <p>On the Web, our new site-wide search engine is a licensed product called 
        Atomz Search&trade;, which we launched in winter 2004 as a gateway into 
        our wide variety of content. From media-rich, Flash-based multimedia programs 
        such as <em>Ansel Adams at 100</em> to public program information stored 
        in an SQL database, it surfaces resources that would otherwise be buried 
        deep within the site. It makes accessible everything we offer on-line, 
        from museum store products to artworks in our collection. With almost 
        600 searches performed on our site each day, it is a critical feature 
        of sfmoma.org.</p>
      <p>The impetus for a new search engine came in spring 2003 while we were 
        working on a major initiative to bring our collections management database, 
        EmbARK, on-line. (Mitroff, Misunas, and Wise, 2003) That project, informally 
        called <em>Collections Access Online</em>, grew out of a National Endowment 
        for the Humanities (NEH) Challenge grant and was a cross-departmental 
        collaboration of SFMOMA&rsquo;s Web group (part of the Department of Publications 
        and Graphic Design), the Interactive Educational Technologies group (part 
        of the Education Department), and the Collections Information and Access 
        department (part of the Collections Department). Around the same time, 
        we also received a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services 
        (IMLS) to further refine our use of multimedia and improve our ability 
        to communicate with visitors in the galleries and on-line.</p>
      <p>When we began work on <em>Collections Access Online,</em> our plan was 
        to modify the EmbARK Web interface so that it matched the look and feel 
        of our existing site, and to link to it from the <strong>Collection</strong>s 
        section of our Web site. We did not plan to integrate collections data 
        into the search engine, which at that time was a very rudimentary built-in 
        feature that came with our Web server (Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Information 
        Server). In order for users to search SFMOMA&rsquo;s collections, they 
        would have to click through to a separate search within the <strong>Collections</strong> 
        section of the Web site. If they typed an artist&rsquo;s name or the title 
        of an artwork into the home-page search box, the results would not include 
        any collections data.</p>
      <p>As we began developing the functional specifications for the collections 
        project, we quickly realized that this setup would not be the best way 
        to serve our Web users. Burying the collections data within the <strong>Collections</strong> 
        section of the site would assume that all users were familiar with the 
        basic concept of a museum <em>collection.</em> To us, it might be obvious 
        that clicking on <strong>Collections</strong> in the navigation bar would 
        lead to the collections-specific portion of the site (where, presumably, 
        one could then search the database records), but that system would put 
        the burden of knowledge on the user. Here was an acute symptom of &lsquo;first 
        generation&rsquo; Web site balkanization, in which a site&rsquo;s structure 
        mirrors the organization&rsquo;s internal structure.</p>
      <p>Our educational multimedia content was in a similar situation. We had 
        six years&rsquo; worth of rich multimedia content &ndash; a wealth of 
        information illustrating some three hundred objects in our collections 
        &ndash; yet none of this content was accessible via our Web site search 
        engine. The only way to access all of this rich, interpretive content 
        was to navigate three levels deep into the <strong>Education </strong>section 
        of the site, and then, if lucky, stumble upon one of our interactive <strong>Flash 
        </strong>features such as <strong>Making Sense of Modern Art</strong>. 
        But even at that point, there was no quick-and-easy finding aid telling 
        people where to go to learn more about a particular artist or artwork.</p>
      <p>The rest of the site&rsquo;s content suffered from similar navigational 
        problems. Although collections data and educational content are certainly 
        the &lsquo;meat&rsquo; of sfmoma.org, our site includes many other types 
        of content as well. The <strong>Exhibitions</strong> and <strong>Calendar</strong> 
        sections are SQL database-driven areas of our site that&nbsp;receive&nbsp;over 
        240,000&nbsp;visits each year&nbsp;from users who are planning&nbsp;trips&nbsp;to 
        the Museum. Our on-line store, hosted off-site by Yahoo!,&nbsp;receives 
        almost 54,000&nbsp;visits per year.&nbsp;And our on-line Press Room, also 
        SQL database-driven, serves a small but active and important audience 
        of almost 32,000 visitors. Yet the search engine we had at the time could 
        only crawl the static HTML pages on our Web server and could not &lsquo;see&rsquo; 
        any of our dynamic data, multimedia content, or content hosted on external 
        servers. Furthermore, we had very little control over the search results 
        and how they were displayed.</p>
      <h2>The On-line Solution</h2>
      <p>The right solution was obviously a centralized, comprehensive search 
        engine that would bring everything together in a simple, intuitive interface. 
        Hence, the scope of this project quickly grew beyond offering straightforward 
        access to collections data into a larger mission to increase the availability 
        of the full variety of content on our Web site.</p>
      <p>To identify the right search solution, we engaged a San Francisco<strong>-</strong>based 
        technology consulting firm, <strong>Carbon Five</strong>, to assist us 
        with a technical needs analysis and help us select the right search-engine 
        technology. We needed a product that could handle the diversity of our 
        site, in terms of both content and format, and deliver relevant results 
        in a customizable way.</p>
      <h1>Needs Analysis</h1>
      <p>We identified the <strong>Atomz</strong> search engine based on three 
        criteria: its general feature set, our technical requirements, and its 
        reporting capabilities.</p>
      <p><strong>Atomz Search</strong> offered a rich feature set that allowed 
        a high level of control and customization over search results. For example, 
        we wanted to be able to prioritize results for certain words and phrases; 
        the first hit for the word <em>film</em>, we knew, should be a link to 
        the film series <em>The Seventh Art: New Dimensions in Cinema.</em> We 
        could guarantee search returns like this through the configuration tools 
        in the Atomz Search administrative interface. We also wanted to be able 
        to group different types of search results into a handful of categories 
        so that users would not be overwhelmed with an endless Google-type list 
        after each query. An Atomz Search feature called <strong>collections</strong> 
        enabled us to achieve this, consolidating search results into our own 
        customized categories. Atomz Search also supported the easy integration 
        of thumbnail images into search results. This feature alone, we felt, 
        would make the new search function far more useful and efficient than 
        a massive list of text-only results, and it would be more in harmony with 
        the identity of our institution; SFMOMA is, after all, an art museum.</p>
      <p>Atomz Search also satisfied our technical requirements. Because SFMOMA&rsquo;s 
        IT staff did not have the resources to support and maintain a search engine, 
        a hosted search solution was very attractive; it made sense to select 
        one that could be hosted off-site, and that the Web team could maintain 
        without too much outside assistance. Once Atomz Search was configured 
        by the Atomz implementation team, the administrative and technical requirements 
        for maintaining it were negligible.</p>
      <p>The reporting capabilities were also of great importance: We wanted to 
        know what terms and phrases users were searching for, and how we were 
        serving them. Atomz Search had impressive metrics reporting capabilities.</p>
      <p>For all these reasons, Atomz's hosted model with its subscription service 
        was ideal. The hosted solution required no ongoing IT support. The company 
        was willing to work with us to achieve our customized search-return categories 
        and display. And the subscription costs we negotiated were affordable 
        within our IMLS-funded budget.</p>
      <h1>User Interface Design</h1>
      <p>From the start, SFMOMA&rsquo;s Web team was committed to focusing on 
        user-centered design. The project presented a great opportunity to apply 
        interface design principles from the for-profit Web sector to a museum 
        site. We had previously benefited from some pro bono consultation from 
        a user interface specialist with the Nielsen Norman Group. We followed 
        the guidelines articulated in their report <em>E-commerce User Experience: 
        Design Guidelines for Search</em> (Nielsen, et al, 2000), with the following 
        imperatives.</p>
      <h2>Make Search Visible</h2>
      <p>The design of the old SFMOMA site required users to click on an SFMOMA 
        logo to reveal the search box. The only hint offered was the word <strong>search</strong> 
        next to the logo. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.figure1.gif" alt="Screen Shot of Old SFMOMA Site" width="400" height="91" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: Old SFMOMA Search box.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We redesigned the interface to make the search box clearly visible. </p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 2: Current SFMOMA Search box, <a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/" target="_blank">http://www.sfmoma.org</a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Make The Default Search Simple To Use</h2>
      <p>We debated whether or not to offer search parameters such as <em>search 
        collections, search calendar</em>, and <em>search entire site</em>, but 
        we determined that simpler was better. Again, just because a Web site 
        may have evolved over time with a phased rollout of separate back-end 
        systems, those systems may not be meaningful to users. Hence, we determined 
        not to ask users to narrow their searches up front. They would only need 
        to submit a single query; we would, on the other hand, be able to group 
        their returns by category so they could instantly see related results. 
        We created the categories based on our user-testing findings (discussed 
        in detail below).</p>
      <h2>Provide Information About Alternative Ways Of Locating Content</h2>
      <p>Because so much rich content was buried in the SFMOMA Web site, we knew 
        that users might not find everything we had to offer, even with a new 
        search engine. The Atomz Search <strong>collections</strong> feature allowed 
        us to include a special category for interactive features on the first 
        search-return page. We also discovered that we could incorporate links 
        to multimedia content within our on-line collection pages, thereby ensuring 
        that users who might have missed relevant multimedia features in their 
        surfing or search results could find them while browsing the collections.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig3" id="Fig3"></a><a href="johnson.fig3.html"><img src="johnson.figure3_small.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: An object in context on the SFMOMA Site" width="400" height="438" border="0" /></a></p>

        with a link to Making Sense of Modern Art, <a href="http://collections.sfmoma.org/OBJ177.htm" target="_blank">http://collections.sfmoma.org/OBJ177.htm</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition to consulting the for-profit Web world for search engine 
        design principles, our interface design requirements were grounded in 
        extensive data from our Web server logs. An analysis of the logs revealed 
        that the most frequent searches were for specific artists or artworks 
        in the SFMOMA collection. Other popular searches were for art history 
        topics such as &ldquo;California artists,&rdquo; logistical information 
        about the museum, information about current exhibitions and public programs, 
        products in our on-line store, and press-room content.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig4" id="Fig4"></a><a href="johnson.fig4.html"><img src="johnson.figure4_small.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: Atomz search" width="200" height="474" border="0" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 4: Atomz Search results for Paul Klee, <a href="http://catsearch.sfmoma.org/search/catsearch/?sp-p=all&amp;sp-f=ISO-8859-1&amp;sp-a=sp10026505&amp;sp-q=paul+klee" target="_blank">http://catsearch.sfmoma.org/search/catsearch/?sp-p=all&amp;sp-f=ISO-8859-1&amp;sp-a=sp10026505&amp;sp-q=paul+klee</a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Based on these findings, we divided our users into three general groups 
        and mapped out six specific categories of results using the Atomz <strong>collections</strong> 
        feature: </p>
      <p>1. People planning to visit SFMOMA who want logistical information about 
        the institution, its exhibitions, and its public programs</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. 
        Exhibitions and Public Programs</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. 
        General Information<br />
        2. People looking for artists, artworks, and general art historical topics</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. 
        Interactive features</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. 
        Collections</p>
      <p>3. Specific audiences with particular tasks, such as shopping or obtaining 
        press information:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. 
        MuseumStore</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. 
        Press Room</p>
      <h1>Implementation</h1>
      <p>Before we could implement Atomz Search, we had a lot of housecleaning 
        to do. The HTML page titles on our site, for example, followed a haphazard 
        mix of styles and conventions, so that a list of them in search results 
        was neither consistent nor informative. One page might be titled <em>SFMOMA 
        &ndash; Welcome</em> while another page would be titled <em>Info: San 
        Francisco Museum of Modern Art.</em> Some pages were simply <em>Untitled</em>, 
        and a few stragglers from our early on-line curriculum site were titled 
        <em>Welcome to Adobe GoLive 4</em>!</p>
      <p>To tackle this massive project, the Web team first established new naming 
        conventions for the entire site. We then broke the site into sections 
        and subsections and gave every page a unique name. A former intern implemented 
        the re-titling; the job took a full week.</p>
      <p>The next step was adding the appropriate metadata for each page. Not 
        only did this include standard metadata fields such as <strong>keywords</strong> 
        and <strong>description,</strong> but also custom fields that we developed 
        and instructed Atomz Search to recognize. For example, in order to display 
        thumbnail images in search results, we created a metadata field called 
        <strong>SearchImage</strong>.</p>
      <p>For Atomz Search to index our multimedia content required a significant 
        amount of effort. The Flash-based <em>Making Sense of Modern Art</em> 
        program (<a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/msoma/" target="_blank">http://www.sfmoma.org/msoma/</a>), 
        for instance, was buried many levels down with a single entry point, but 
        we wanted to surface numerous artwork-specific sections within it. In 
        order to surface these bodies of content, we had to install multiple &lsquo;side 
        doors&rsquo; into the Flash program. Each new point of entry was given 
        a unique URL using what we call &lsquo;threshold&rsquo; pages. </p>
      <p>A threshold page is a static HTML page that contains a link to a unique 
        Flash file and metadata about the movie&rsquo;s contents. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig5" id="Fig5"></a><a href="johnson.fig5.html"><img src="johnson.figure5_small.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: indexable page" width="400" height="424" border="0" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 5: Threshold screen for Henri Matisse's Femme au

      <p> The threshold pages provide Atomz Search with the artist&rsquo;s name, 
        artwork title, thumbnail image, medium, and other information. They have 
        another benefit as well: the brief descriptions they contain give surfers 
        context and some background information as they enter our interactive 
        features, and they provide links to required plug-ins such as QuickTime 
        and Flash. And because threshold pages are static HTML pages, we can point 
        outside search engines such as Google and Yahoo! to them. </p>

      <p>Now our multimedia content appears in search results not only on the 
        SFMOMA Web site, but also all over the Internet. </p>
      <p> Through our Web logs, we have discovered that Google loves the threshold 
        pages, and we&rsquo;ve seen a tremendous increase in traffic coming from 
        Google straight into our multimedia content. In the past two years, 70% 
        of our search engine traffic has been referred by the Google search engine, 
        and the amount of traffic Google has referred to our site more than doubled 
        between 2003 and 2004. Of the Google searches that led users to our site, 
        almost 21% of those searches were for names of artists or artworks in 
        SFMOMA&rsquo;s collection for which we have interactive multimedia features 
        and relevant threshold pages. In fact, more visitors now come through 
        the threshold pages than through <em>Making Sense of Modern Art&rsquo;s 
        </em>front door.</p>
      <h1>On Site</h1>
      <p>Inside SFMOMA, we have taken a very different approach to surfacing content 
        &ndash; an approach that is designed for visitors who have just seen artworks 
        in the galleries and are sitting down at an interactive kiosk. In October 
        2002, SFMOMA inaugurated its new Koret Visitor Education Center (KVEC) 
        which houses the Learning Lounge, an elegant drop-in space with comfortable 
        seating where visitors can avail themselves of informed staff, exhibition 
        catalogues, film screenings, and programs produced by our Interactive 
        Educational Technologies (IET) team (Samis, 2003). With the opening of 
        the Koret Center, visitors can finally access, via the seven workstations 
        distributed around the Learning Lounge, all of our multimedia programs, 
        including pre-Internet programs that were not previously available on 
        the Web site. Visitor surveys had revealed that people liked to see videos 
        of artists, so we developed a video anthology program called <em>Artists 
        Working, Artists Talking</em> for the new kiosks. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.figure7.jpg" alt="Photograph: interior of the Learning Lounge" width="400" height="281" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 7: The Learning Lounge in the Koret Visitor Education 
        Center at SFMOMA.</p>
      <p>In fact, by 2004 there were no less than thirteen different interactive 
        features on these kiosks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ansel Adams at 100</li>
        <li>Art as Experiment, Art as Experience (12 abstract artists)</li>
        <li>Artists Working, Artists Talking</li>
        <li>Romare Bearden</li>
        <li>Philip Guston</li>
        <li>Eva Hesse</li>
        <li>Making Sense of Modern Art (40 artists in depth and growing)</li>
        <li>Gerhard Richter: Forty Years of Painting</li>
        <li>ROY/design series 1</li>
        <li>Frank Stella</li>
        <li>This Is Not a Web Site (a high-school program about Ren&eacute; Magritte)</li>
        <li>Bill Viola</li>
        <li>Voices &amp; Images of California Art </li>
      </ol>
      <p> The kiosks proved very popular &ndash; second only to the regularly 
        scheduled film screenings &ndash; but we found, to our frustration, that 
        visitors only scratched the surface of their contents. So many human and 
        financial resources had been invested in our flagship program <em>Making 
        Sense of Modern Art,</em> but KVEC visitors consistently chose to view 
        two other programs: the new <em>Artists Working, Artists Talking</em> 
        and the much older (pre-Internet) <em>Voices &amp; Images of California 
        Art.</em></p>
      <p>We determined through visitor surveys that the interface housing the 
        programs was visually compelling but difficult to navigate. According 
        to users, for instance, the title <em>Artists Working, Artists Talking 
        </em>was self-explanatory. Furthermore, once they clicked on it, they 
        were presented with a list-based menu of the forty artists that comprised 
        the entire program&rsquo;s contents &ndash; all on one level. Clicking 
        on a name triggered a full-screen, high-quality video. Instant gratification. 
        Then they clicked on the next name. We often observed people going down 
        the column, starting with a familiar artist such as Diego Rivera or Frida 
        Kahlo and then triggering every subsequent video, whether they knew the 
        artist or not. They were interested in a passive learning experience &ndash; 
        one that required little navigation or reading.</p>
      <p>Visitors informed us that titles such as <em>Making Sense of Modern Art,</em><em>Art 
        as Experiment, Art as Experience</em>, and even <em>Voices &amp; Images 
        of California Art</em> revealed little or nothing about the programs&rsquo; 
        contents. As they sat down at the kiosk, it was not clear which of the 
        featured titles would have information about Jackson Pollock or Salvador 
        Dal&iacute;. Here, again, we had organized our content by the legacy principle, 
        accumulating program titles that were meaningful only to us, as past development 
        and production campaigns.</p>
      <p>Our new project, then, was to reorganize the multimedia content so that 
        a kiosk user could find something of interest within just three clicks. 
        The programs ranged in format from Flash (circa 2000&ndash;2004) to HTML 
        (1998&ndash;99) and now-obsolete applications such as Apple Media Tool 
        (1994&ndash;98). To give visitors what they wanted would require us to 
        unify all of these formats and create a tool that would &lsquo;atomize&rsquo; 
        them &ndash; break them into small content chunks that visitors could 
        access directly and intuitively.</p>
      <p>In March, 2004, SFMOMA contracted with <em>Method Inc</em>., an Internet 
        design firm, to create what we call the <strong>Discovery Interface</strong>. 
        We agreed with <em>Method </em>on the following design goals:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>To make preexisting (and future) content available within three clicks</li>
        <li>To create an interface that is fun to use and a sensory experience</li>
        <li>To create an easy-to-understand sorting mechanism</li>
        <li>To foster cross-linking when possible</li>
        <li>To be tactile, high end, luxurious, and stimulating</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>Method </em>proposed a sophisticated, easy-to-use, and technologically 
        advanced <strong>table of contents</strong> that would allow users to 
        easily find and browse content. They specified Flash back-end with XML, 
        perhaps combined with HTML using Cascading Style Sheets, and they suggested 
        that the framework could be created quite simply with only two to three 
        new screens. We anticipated the project would be completed in three to 
        four months. It turned out to be ten.</p>
      <h1>Needs Analysis: Personae &amp; Requirements Development</h1>
      <p>In the formative phase, we conducted a survey that reflected two distinct 
        sets of users: docents, who were starting their tours using our kiosks, 
        and visitors, who were of various ages, backgrounds, and ranges of art 
        experience. The findings were enlightening. Not only were the users often 
        having trouble finding what they were looking for, but they also had vastly 
        different ways of searching for information: by artist name, by medium 
        or movement, by subject matter or theme. We identified a number of potential 
        user scenarios:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The Browser: a visitor with no particular agenda who just wants to 
          click around and see what&rsquo;s available</li>
        <li>The Knowledge Seeker: a visitor who approaches the kiosk to search 
          for a specific artist or artwork </li>
        <li>The Casual Seeker: a visitor who wants to know more about a particular 
          question or subject, but is willing to browse around to find an answer</li>
        <li>The Planner: a visitor interested in highlights of SFMOMA&rsquo;s 
          programs or collections. This person tends to go directly to orientation 
          or special exhibit links and wants to know where a specific artwork 
          is located in the galleries. (See end note)</li>
        <li>The Visual Player: a visitor who does not know artists&rsquo; names 
          but responds to visual cues and would most likely browse by clicking 
          on available images</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The <strong>Discovery Interface</strong> would need to accommodate users 
        with varied learning styles, objectives, knowledge bases, and computer 
        skills. Technical issues to consider included the fact that some existing 
        multimedia programs were Web-based, while others could only run from a 
        local machine. The task was further complicated by the fact that our kiosks 
        in the Koret Center do not have keyboards (to prevent users from accessing 
        the system/desktop and from using the computers for e-mail). Without a 
        keyboard there could be no search box, so it would be essential to devise 
        clear and creative ways of exposing content via a set of point-and-click 
        visual arrays. </p>
      <p>The team conducted a needs analysis to determine the functional requirements 
        of the interface. Did we want users to be able to learn something while 
        browsing &lsquo;the surface&rsquo;, rather than immediately plunging them 
        into &lsquo;deep&rsquo; content? How much information was enough? How 
        much was too much? We knew that, for the longevity and scalability of 
        the program, the interface should be Web compatible and adhere to Web 
        standards. We finally decided that the home page should offer three paths: 
        a menu of artist names, a visual menu of artworks, and interactive feature 
        titles (the &lsquo;old way&rsquo;). </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig8" id="Fig8"></a><img src="johnson.figure8.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: search interface " width="400" height="299" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 8: Discovery Interface homepage.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.figure9.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: searching for works of art" width="400" height="299" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 9: Discovery Interface artwork menu.</p>
      <p>Beyond this initial set of requirements, an additional set of enhancements 
        was proposed: the creation of a middle, or exploration, zone within the 
        interface that would include zooms of each artwork; connections between 
        related artists and artworks; and ways to filter the opening menus by 
        medium, time period, movement, and geographic location. The goal was for 
        all of the interactive features to be accessible within three clicks. 
        And, of course, the overall design and presentation had to be beautiful 
        and visually compelling.</p>
      <h1>Design Phase and Technical Implementation</h1>
      <p>Early in the conceptual development phase, <em>Method</em> proposed re-titling 
        the entire Discovery Interface <em>Making Sense of Modern Art</em> to 
        reflect the fact that all of our programs explain and contextualize the 
        art in SFMOMA&rsquo;s collection. This re-branding was a crucial step 
        in acknowledging our project&rsquo;s mission. The point of integrating 
        all of our prior programs into a seamless whole, after all, was to give 
        visitors more transparent access to content &ndash; to make their museum 
        experience more user friendly. During the visual design phase, we spent 
        months critiquing many different page layouts, colors, motions, sounds, 
        and navigation schemes.</p>
      <p>Then came the technical build out, which was divided into two parts: 
        the front end, or Flash code that would make the screens interactive and 
        handle the XML produced by the back end, which entailed building a Microsoft 
        Access database and a Web-based authoring interface for inputting data. 
        The decision was made to shift from multiple standalone kiosks to a client-server 
        model for ease of updating. Screen size and video resolution became issues 
        for the developers, given that we were working with aging CD-ROMs running 
        at 640 x 480 pixels, HTML Web sites and Flash-based programs running at 
        800 x 600 pixels, and full-screen QuickTime movies; everything needed 
        to work at a screen size of 1024 x 768. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="johnson.figure10.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: Search interface details about a work of art" width="400" height="299" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 10: Discovery Interface artwork detail page.</p>
      <p>Also important to consider was the amount of in-house production time 
        required to create thumbnails and zoom-size artworks, to recompress QuickTime 
        movies into Flash files, to write artist bios, and so on. As the production 
        workload grew and the rollout date fell further behind, we realized that 
        our simple project had become much more than a new &lsquo;front end&rsquo;. 
        But when we were finally able to conduct usability tests, users typically 
        <em>did</em> find what they were looking for &ndash; and serendipitously 
        came upon much more in the process. At this writing, we are installing 
        the full-featured program into our Koret Visitor Education Center. </p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>These two parallel and cooperative initiatives, supported by a National 
        Leadership Grant from IMLS, represent our attempts to guide our museum 
        audiences effectively to the content of greatest interest to them &ndash; 
        whether they are on our Web site or inside SFMOMA &ndash; in an intuitive 
        and technologically mature way. The outcomes of these initiatives include 
        a comprehensive search engine for the Web site with easy-to-read returns 
        full of visual highlights, and a sensually rewarding point-and-click Museum 
        kiosk browsing interface that builds on visitors&rsquo; gallery experiences 
        and presents them with interesting and provocative multimedia content.</p>
      <p>We expect that the new <em>Making Sense of Modern Art </em>will find 
        its way to the Web, augmented by educational curriculum, in the second-generation 
        phase of development. Now that we have &lsquo;atomized&rsquo; our content, 
        we are more prepared to target it to a spectrum of users in a variety 
        of ways and places: on-line at home, in SFMOMA&rsquo;s Koret Visitor Education 
        Center, in school, and in the galleries. </p>
      <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
      <h4>Post Script</h4>
      <p>Full support of &ldquo;The Planner&rdquo; scenario was deemed out of 
        scope for present purposes. Although more and more museums seem able to 
        fulfill it, we were less than sanguine about our ability to channel reliable 
        information about object locations from our collections management system 
        to the Koret kiosks and to refresh it on a regular basis.</p>
