      <h1>3D Worlds and Cultural Heritage: Realism vs. Virtual Presence</h1>
      <h2>Nicoletta Di Blas, Evelyne Gobbo, and Paolo Paolini, HOC-DEI, Politecnico 
        di Milano, Italy</h2>
      <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">3D graphics are evidently appealing 
            for cultural heritage communication: the possibility of (re)creating 
            environments, buildings, objects, etc. raised great expectations, both 
            with professionals and end-users. Actual applications, however, have 
            turned out not be so successful as they had promised to be. Therefore 
            we must rethink goals (what can 3D be used for?), requirements (which 
            features should we try to achieve?) and design (how do we do it?). This 
            paper deals with a specific niche, i.e. shared 3D worlds accessible 
            by several users (represented by <em>avatars</em>) over the Internet; 
            some of our considerations, however, can probably be extended to other 
            types of environment. Our main point is that shared 3D worlds are effective 
            not just because they offer a <em>realistic reconstruction</em> of something, 
            but because they have the property of creating (if well designed) <em>virtual 
            presence</em>, i.e. the feeling of 'being there' with someone else, 
            engaged in some kind of activity. We argue that, if virtual presence 
            is what we look for, the main concern should switch from the quality 
            of the graphics to the quality of the overall design of the application. 
            The paper discusses the above issues on the basis of the experience 
            gained in 3D educational projects developed by the HOC laboratory of 
            Politecnico di Milano: SEE &#8211; Shrine Educational Experience (in 
            cooperation with The Israel Museum, Jerusalem), Learning@Europe (in 
            cooperation with the International Accenture Foundation) and Stori@Lombardia 
            (in cooperation with the Regional Government of Lombardy). These projects 
            have so far involved more than 1400 students and teachers from all over 
            Europe. All these projects are an evolution of <em>Virtual Leonardo</em>, 
            winner of the prize as &#8220;best on-line exhibition&#8221; at Museums 
        and the Web 1999.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>3D graphics have been considered, in recent years, a promising communication 
            means for Cultural Heritage. Virtual Reality (VR) in particular has 
            been considered a way to make museums, archeological sites, objects, 
            etc. visible and/or interactive. From a graphical point of view, these 
            environments are designed to be as <em>detailed</em> (i.e. corresponding 
            to the real environment) as possible, and also aesthetically pleasant. 
            If we consider immersive 3D environments, in which users can enter and 
            move around, <em>realism</em> is considered a further, fundamental requirement: 
            the physical behaviours of the real world are reproduced. Several interesting 
            experiences of 3D virtual realities have been created with the above 
        assumptions.</p>
      <p>However, user experiences with these environments have turned out, 
            sometimes, to be unsatisfactory (or not as positive as expected). After 
            a bit of exploration, the interest of the user wanes, for, on one hand, 
            no matter how carefully reconstructed the place is, the experience cannot 
            be compared to the real-world experience, and, on the other, no meaningful 
            goal is offered to trigger interaction. The <em>magic</em> of the real 
            experience is not there; the engagement is low, the information conveyed 
        is not rich enough.</p>
      <p>We claim that an interesting goal for 3D technology is to create a 
            place where people can have a meaningful experience by meeting other 
            people. To this aim, a 'faithful reproduction' of a 'real' place is 
            of no use: a fundamental role is rather played by <em>virtual presence</em>; 
            that is, the sense of 'being there' with the other visitors of the 3D 
            environment. A strong sense of virtual presence is achieved by means 
            of accurate design of the application, including effective graphics 
        and a well-planned interaction.</p>
      <p>The paper discusses the above issues based on the experience gained 
            on 3D projects developed by the HOC laboratory of Politecnico di Milano: 
            SEE &#8211; Shrine Educational Experience (in cooperation with The Israel 
            Museum, Jerusalem), Learning@Europe (in cooperation with the International 
            Accenture Foundation) and Stori@Lombardia (in cooperation with the Regional 
            Government of Lombardy). All these projects are an evolution of <em>Virtual 
            Leonardo</em>, winner of the prize as 'best on-line exhibition' at Museums 
            and the Web 1999 (Barbieri et al., 1999, and other works by the same 
        authors).</p>
      <p>SEE (Shrine Educational Experience; Di Blas, Hazan &amp; Paolini, 2003 
            and Di Blas, Paolini, Poggi, 2003) was a project developed in cooperation 
            with The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, dealing with the Dead Sea Scrolls 
            (preserved in the Shrine of the Book at The Israel Museum, Jerusalem) 
            and related topics (including history, religion, and anthropology). 
            It was aimed at students from 13 to 18 years of age, both from Israel 
            and Europe. The project underwent a massive testing phase, from November 
            2002 to May 2004, involving approximately 1400 students from Europe 
            and Israel. The educational goals of the project were fully achieved, 
        and users were strongly engaged by their experience with the 3D environment.</p>
      <p>Building on our experience gained with SEE, the HOC laboratory is currently 
            developing two similar projects: Learning@Europe and Stori@Lombardia.  Learning@Europe is sponsored 
            by Accenture Foundations (as part of the Accenture Corporate Citizenship 
            investment program) and executed in cooperation with Fondazione Italiana 
            Accenture; it is aimed at European high school students and deals with 
            European history. It has already undergone a first testing phase, in 
            November 2004, with Italian students only. From February 2005 to May 
            2005, more than 60 classes (approximately 1200 students) from 6 different 
            European countries will participate. The project Stori@Lombardia is 
            also based on the same format, but it deals with Lombardy region's history, 
        and will involve more than 1000 Italian students in the same period.</p>

        The courtyard of the castle</p>
      <p>These projects have a common feature: there is an overall educational 
            'experience' (lasting approximately 6 weeks), within which 3D worlds 
            play a well-defined role. In the virtual environment students 'meet' 
            the other students, play with them, discuss with them (via chat), etc. 
            The key success factor is the feeling of 'being there' all together, 
            the so-called <em>virtual presence</em>: it is almost impossible to 
            convey in words, or even with a demo, the emotion of a real session 
            of use, when students from faraway countries meet together on-line and 
        start cooperating, playing, discussing all together. </p>
      <h1>Virtual Presence</h1>
      <p>Virtual presence (Carassa et al., 2004; MacIntyre et al, 2004; Presence, 
            2004) is not an exclusive prerogative of 3D worlds: it can be achieved 
            using a variety of technologies (including photographs, movies, phones, 
            paintings, etc.). We will confine our discussion to the virtual presence 
            that can be achieved through (shared or not shared) 3D environments. 
            There are several different opinions about what virtual presence is 
        exactly, what it is useful for, and how it can be achieved. </p>
      <h2>What Virtual Presence is</h2>
      <p>There are many definitions of <em>virtual presence</em>, all sharing 
            a common trait: for virtual presence, people must feel themselves to 
            be somewhere different from their actual location. Experts disagree 
            about the nature of the 'where' to which the person is projected. We 
            can basically distinguish three main opinions: the first is that the 
            user is projected to a <em>replica of a real place</em> (e.g. a palace, 
            an ancient location, etc.); the second is that the user is projected 
            to a <em>fictitious</em> (more or less realistic) <em>environment</em> 
        (e.g. what videogames do); the third is that the user is projected to 
        a <em>situation</em>, where by situation something more complex than 
        'place' is meant.</p>
      <p>Being in a replica of a real place (whether the place is still existing 
            or not) has the ambition of mimicking the real experience; paintings, 
            photographs, drawings, movies, virtual environments of this kind share 
            this goal: almost pure 'physical illusion' is at stake. Being in a fictitious 
            place is more about imagination, since the place reproduced does not 
            claim to be real. Eventually, a 'situation' is a dematerialized reality: 
            think for example of people immersed in a telephone conversation: they 
            feel detached from their physical situation and oblivious of the technological 
            means they are using (in fact, they often gesticulate, as if they could 
        be seen!).</p>
      <h2>How Virtual Presence Can Be Effective </h2>
      <p>A 3D application can have one (or more) of the following goals:</p>
      <p> a)&nbsp; <em>Understanding how a real place is (or was):</em> e.g. 
            allowing a user to explore the ancient Roman city of Pompeii or a far-away 
        museum.</p>
      <p>3D worlds, after the great promises of 10-15 years ago, have not fully 
            succeeded in achieving this goal. For existing environments (such as 
            museums or churches), pictures (possibly the panoramic ones) or movies 
            or other traditional means have often been more effective (and less 
        expensive!).</p>
      <p>As far as no-longer existent environments are concerned, 3D worlds 
            have scored better, but still less than expected, in the sense that 
            users turned out not to appreciate them so much. The problem is even 
            more acute when we consider shared 3D environments that are characterised 
        by an inherent reduction of visual quality.</p>
      <p> b)&nbsp; <em>Conveying the 'emotion' of being in a real place</em>: 
        e.g., recreating the emotion related to the above experiences.</p>
      <p>If point a) (above) has resulted in partial disappointment, we must 
            speak of complete failure on this aspect. The insufficient visual quality, 
            the evidence that what we call 3D is actually displayed on a flat (2D) 
            screen, the lack of other sensorial features, are all obstacles to the 
            emotion-raising capacity of these environments. Any visitor who would 
            feel almost overwhelmed when entering the premises of a famous museum, 
            feels no emotion at all when entering  a 3D reconstruction of it; surprisingly 
            (or not?), we find the same lack of emotion also for archaeological 
            reconstructions, where the 3D replica has more details and more things 
            to look at than the 'real' object which is only partially visible (or 
        not visible at all).</p>
      <p> c)&nbsp; <em>Creating the illusion of being in a 'fantasy' place</em>: 
            e.g. fairy places in which videogames take place: we know that they 
        do not exist, but still we feel an emotional attraction for them.</p>
      <p>The user may feel somehow 'immersed' in a fantasy place, having no 
            real experience to compare it with; still, the experience is more rational 
            than emotional: all the details are available, the world is too shallow 
        to explore.</p>
      <p> d)&nbsp; <em>Creating an immaterial situation</em>: e.g. a conversation 
        among peers, a teaching-learning situation, a competition, etc. </p>
      <p>This is, in the end, and as far as our experience goes, the most effective 
            kind of virtual presence we can create. A variety of technologies can 
            be used to create situations where users feel engaged in an activity 
            where to some extent they forget about technology as such. A shared 
            3D world, for example, offers quite a crude solution: a visually poor 
            fictitious 3D rendering (remember that the screen is flat!), a chat, 
            some very simple avatars moving around, etc. Given careful design of 
            the activities (people do not have just to move around purposelessly, 
            as we shall argue below), this is enough to create situations where 
        users feel immersed 'in the situation', oblivious of technology.</p>
      <h2>How Virtual Presence Can Be Achieved</h2>
      <p><em>Situational virtual presence</em> is not achievable by reproducing 
            a virtual copy of a 'real-life place', but rather by focusing on what 
            goes on in the situation, and trying to put the users in the best position 
            to 'feel part of the situation'. Assume, for example, that the situation 
            is a 'virtual classroom' where pupils can ask questions of the teacher, 
            and get answers: in the real life situation, pupils must raise their 
            hands, the teacher selects one of the pupils, the pupil asks the question 
            (that everybody can hear), the teacher either dismisses the question 
            or provides an answer (that everybody can hear); in the meantime, pupils 
            may chat in low voice. Creating the situation (in view of achieving 
            a feeling of <em>virtual presence</em>) is not about recreating the 
            physical room, or simulating raising hands, or adding the audio to reproduce 
            the classroom chatting. The effect of virtual presence can be achieved 
            if the mutual interaction among students and with the teachers is as 
            effective and 'natural' as the real one, not because the physical features 
            of the real world are reproduced, but rather because both teachers and 
            pupils are focused on the question-answering activity, and being engaged 
            in this interaction, do not even perceive the technological medium binding 
        them together.</p>
      <h1>Building Effective 3D Worlds</h1>
      <p>In this section we explain how good design of the interaction rules 
            and of the graphics for shared 3D worlds can effectively help achieve 
            a sense of virtual presence and therefore make the overall experience 
            (be it educational, entertaining, informative&#8230;) effective and 
            satisfying for the users. We assume, of course, that the purpose is 
            to achieve some kind of virtual presence and not, for example, to show 
            the features of an archaeological monument, as was the case, for example, 
            of the beautiful Olympia project of the Powerhouse Museum (Kenderdine, 
            2001). Examples will be taken from the three projects we introduced 
        in the first paragraph: SEE, Learning@Europe and Stori@Lombardia.</p>
      <h2>Interaction Requirements</h2>
      <p>Interaction is a complex feature, creating engagement and excitement 
            on its own. In 3D shared worlds each user interacts not only with the 
            world but also with the other users; therefore, a careful balance must 
            be found: interaction with the world (and the objects in it) must be 
            interesting on its own, but at the same time it can't distract the user 
            from interaction with the other users (which is the main motivation 
            for having a shared environment). For this reason, it is not viable 
            just to let the users into the shared world, hoping that something will 
        happen: there must be careful planning of activities.</p>
      <h2>Planning The Experience In The 3D World</h2>
      <p>In all the above projects, 8 students (from 4 different classes) access 
            a 3D world simultaneously, for a one-hour-long 'session' of use. The 
            sequence of actions must be carefully planned, but within each step, 
            room for 'spontaneous' interaction must be provided. A careful balance 
        between 'Do what I want you to do', and 'Do what you want' must be found.</p>

        the sequence of activities of the first session of use</p>
      <p>After a welcome phase (during which users log into the world and start 
            practising its advanced features &#8211; flying, chatting, whispering, 
            etc.), a first 'lesson' takes place: the guide introduces the environment 
            students find themselves in by means of boards (i.e. pop-up windows); 
            then a self-presentation of all the participants takes place in 4 different, 
            though similar, environments (4 domes, of different colours, each associated 
            with a different town). Finally a short recap of the session takes place; 
            the guide gives the assignment for the next meeting (in this case, studying 
            material and preparing a team's presentation); and everybody says goodbye. 
            This very detailed storyboard motivates avatars to move around and do 
            things; moreover, the concrete tasks given, as well as clever hints 
            by the guide, enhance chat interaction with the other 3D world's visitors 
            (treasure hunts and quizzes will take place, during which students will 
            have to take decisions together). The guide keeps the action fast paced 
            and engaging so that none of the participants feels bored or cut off 
        from the action. </p>
      <h2>Features Of The Avatars: How 'Powerful' They Should Be</h2>
      <p>The designers of a 3D world decide what avatars can do, must do, can't 
            do and when. Once 'realism' of behaviour is not the driving paradigm, 
            a new set of requirements must be devised. Avatars can perform many 
            actions, some similar to real world ones (such as walking around), others 
            completely new (such as flying, seeing through other avatars' eyes, 
            activating boards and hotspots from everywhere &#8211; as if they could 
            stretch their hands reaching everywhere, etc.). What must be noted is 
            that if we design a totally powerful avatar, then its physical presence 
            in the 3D world paradoxically becomes almost useless: if anything can 
            be done from anywhere, then in a certain sense the avatar <em>is</em> 
        <em>already</em> everywhere in the environment: why should it move around? 
            It is as if we could buy a newspaper from home, by clicking on a hotspot: 
            why should we dress and go out? Therefore, the first lesson to be learned 
            is that if we want to make use of the physical representation of the 
            avatar and also of the 3D environment (such as stairs, labyrinths, etc.), 
            the avatar must not be allowed any power, at least not in any moment! 
            The designer selects what powers avatars are given according to the 
            activity they're expected to perform. For example, in all our projects, 
            a treasure hunt takes place: avatars have to look for objects hidden 
            in a labyrinth. Of course, during the treasure hunt flying is forbidden: 
            otherwise, they would spot the object almost immediately! On the other 
            hand, avatars can be forced to use some features: for example, again 
            during the treasure hunt, an object can be selected as the right one 
            only after consultation. Therefore when players find an object they 
            deem correct, they ask their mate to check it by looking at it through 
        an avatar's eyes.</p>
      <p>A very important consequence of the powers avatars are given or not 
            given concerns what is called <em>proxemic semiotics</em>. By proxemic 
            semiotics we mean &#8211; taking the term in broad sense with respect 
            to its scientific meaning (Hall, 1966) &#8211; all the signs we convey 
            by means of our actions and position in space. In moving, gesturing, 
            living, we produce signs clearly readable by those around us. They are 
            culturally determined (for example, we shake hands when we meet) or, 
            so to speak, natural, spontaneous. These last signs are not meant to 
            be signs; that is, there isn't a semiotic intention behind them (for 
            the distinction between intentional and non-intentional signs see Bobes 
            Naves, 1989). In other words, we generally don't open a door <em>to 
            show</em> that we're entering a room, but <em>because we want</em> to 
            enter a room; in doing so, nonetheless, we make it clear for those who 
            see us that we are actually moving towards another room. A totally powerful 
            avatar that can do anything from anywhere fails to convey all the proxemic 
            signs: when we spot an avatar standing still, we do not know what its 
            human-master is doing: is s/he looking at a board? Chatting with the 
            others? Is s/he busy or idle, willing to be involved in a conversation? 
      </p>
      <p>A lot of work is required in this very promising area of research, 
            the basic question of which is: what physical constraints of the real 
            world should be kept (and in which situations) in order to save the 
            signals conveyed by the gestures and positions implied by them? In our 
            projects, we have started implementing some features and rules so as 
        to preserve some of them.</p>
      <p><strong>Example 1</strong>: in order to move from one environment to 
            the other (say from the meeting point to the labyrinth), we have the 
            technical possibility of forcibly dragging all the avatars behind the 
            guide. Although we keep this chance for 'desperate' situations (when 
            one user is left behind all alone), avatars are required to follow the 
            guide and physically pass through a door (or something similar). This 
            enhances the sense of being together: stray avatars tend to follow the 
            others (hoping they are not stray avatars too!), if they can't spot 
            the guide. They try to find the right place ('enter through the blue 
            door!'), they chat with the others if they need help in orientation. 
            If the guide simply moved all the avatars from one place to another, 
        a lot of cooperation would be lost.</p>
      <p><strong>Example 2</strong>: Avatars reading boards apparently 'do nothing'; 
            they might even be very far from the board they are looking at. We decided 
            in Learning@Europe to make it compulsory to be close to a board in order 
            to be able to open it. In this way, all the users can see that an avatar 
            is performing that specific action (that is, reading that board), and 
            can decide, for example, to start up a conversation with the avatar 
        on that topic.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig5" id="Fig5"></a><img src="diBlas.fig.5.jpg" width="400" height="290" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Learning@Europe"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig. 5 Learning@Europe (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.learningateurope.net/">www.learningateurope.net</a>). 
        What is this avatar doing? </p>
      <p><strong>Example 3</strong>: When someone wants to whisper to someone 
            else, the name of the addressee has to be selected. But there's no relation 
            between the space and the people 'speaking': they can be very far in 
            the virtual world, so none can notice there's a conversation going on 
            and join in. A possible solution could be, at least in some situations, 
            to make it compulsory for users to be physically close in order to be 
        allowed to whisper.</p>
      <p>The above are just few examples of the proxemic consequences of the 
            designers' choices: every limitation or power, imposed/given or denied 
            to the avatars, implies the survival or disappearance or translation 
            of those spatial signs of which, in the real world, we make such large 
            use. The issue is: in view of achieving virtual presence, what proxemic 
            signs of the real world (implementing its physical limitations) should 
            be imported into the virtual world? What other signs should be somehow 
            'translated' into the virtual world, so as to save them? What others 
        should be simply ignored?</p>
      <h2>Graphic Requirements</h2>
      <h3>Reproduction Of A Real Place</h3>
      <p>Our main point is that realism in the replica of a real space (e.g. 
            a city, a building, a monument) is not relevant: being very detailed 
            in the graphics or close to the original would not make much of a difference 
            for users. The emotion (virtual presence effect) of being there would 
            be missing anyway. At most, an allusion can be effective: the same technique 
            used in theatre can be used in 3D worlds. As it is impossible to reproduce 
            the city of Venice in a theatre for the play <em>Othello</em>, some 
            simple objects will serve the purpose of alluding to the famous city: 
            some striped poles will do for canals, gorgeous pieces of furniture 
            will allude to the interior of a noble palace, etc. Since full realism 
            is not achievable, allusion is sufficient, and can be emotionally very 
            effective: the audience 'feels' that the action is in Venice (with the 
            'magic' of the city missing, of course). A similar strategy can be used 
            for 3D applications: a few rough architectural elements can suggest 
            that the action tales place in The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, or in the 
            Science and Technology Museum in Milan. Detailed modelling is useless, 
        since it would not add anything to the user's emotional experience.</p>

      <h3>Spatiality</h3>
      <p>As regards spatiality, two different concerns must be kept in mind: 
      </p>
          <ol>
          <li>there must be enough room for the avatars to move around, without 
            colliding too often </li>
          <li> 
            <div class="Section1"> there must be something interesting enough to 
              spur users to move around and explore. </div>
          </li>
        </ol>
      <p>Exploration by the avatars can be spontaneous (they want to look around) 
            or forced by the interaction's design (see the corresponding section): 
            e.g. users can be asked to reach some specific spots, to look for objects, 
            to pass through a door, etc. We must keep in mind that virtual spaces 
            get explored only if there's a good reason to do so: e.g. getting different 
            points of view or being able to perform some kind of otherwise impossible 
            interaction. It is therefore important to not exaggerate with 'cameras' 
            (allowing avatars to look around without moving) or with interaction 
            capabilities (allowing avatars to manipulate far away objects); as we 
            have already said in the last section, too powerful features would make 
        it pointless for the avatars to move around.</p>
      <h3>Distance, Depth And Size Of The Objects</h3>
      <p>Another issue is the feeling of 'distance' and 'depth': we know (and 
            painters too know very well) that we have a number of clues in order 
            to guess the distance of objects: we can use 'apparent size' of well 
            known objects (a car smaller than a person, for example, must be more 
            distant than a person), the convergence of lines, shading, light, etc. 
            Our opinion is that the size of the objects is very important in keeping 
            the illusion, even if realism is not at stake: a door or a ball should 
            have a size that makes sense with respect to the size of the avatars, 
            in order to keep an overall consistency of the world. Textures are very 
            helpful in conveying the impression of depth: geometric, striped textures 
            are much more effective in this respect than homogeneous textures that 
            convey the impression of a flat surface. In other words, a user who 
            is represented by avatar A who sees  4 lines on the floor separating 
            it from avatar B, and 6 lines separating avatar B from avatar C, will 
            be able to tell immediately their relative positions in the virtual 
        environment.</p>
      <h3>Precision Of Modelling And The Size Of The Space</h3>
      <p>Let us assume that the action takes place in an open area, where there 
            is empty desert out to the horizon, or in a large room, with a window, 
        from where a faraway city can be seen.</p>
      <p>It is probably ineffective to try to model, graphically, a very large 
            desert (with scattered objects in it) or a faraway city: the size of 
            the graphical model becomes too big and the illusion is poor (when we 
            tried, the far away city looked like a mess of confusing lines!). We 
            suggest using texture instead, i.e. a drawing (e.g. of the desert or 
            of the city) overlaid on a panel, giving the illusion that something 
            is there, far away. Obviously, if an avatar reaches that place it will 
            uncover the trick: the city is not there! That's just a panel with a 
            drawing on it. But this is not a serious danger with respect to the 
            achieved benefits: a more effective illusion and more economic graphic 
            modelling. First of all, if the avatars behave, they won't go far away 
            from where the action takes place, i.e. from where the other avatars 
            are. Second, the tricky panels should not be placed too close to the 
            action location, but at some distance: the avatars can start moving 
            towards them, but it is very unlikely that they will actually reach 
            them. Our students (more than 1500) never went so far away from the 
        action as to uncover the trick!</p>
      <h1>Conclusions and Future Work</h1>
      <p>We can summarize our conclusions as follows:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>  we should not consider 3D graphics as 
              a unique field, even if we confine it within the realm of Cultural 
              Heritage applications. If the technology is more or less common, different 
              purposes (for building 3D environments) lead to different requirements 
              and different design considerations</li>
          <li>the strong point of shared 3D environments is not realism but rather 
            <em>virtual presence</em> (i.e. 'I am engaged in an activity with someone 
            else'), to which realism or high quality graphics are not relevant issues</li>
          <li>in a shared 3D world the interaction of each user with the environment 
            must be carefully balanced with the interaction with other users </li>
          <li>  the design of features ('powers') of the 
              avatars should consider psychological factors (such as fun, engagement, 
              and proxemic semiotics), as well as technical factors</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="Section1">
          <p>In terms of future work, our main effort today (besides making our 
            3D environments successful!), is to isolate the single features (say 
            <em>virtual presence</em>, <em>graphics</em>, <em>interaction</em>, 
            <em>proxemic semiotics</em>, etc.), trying to understand how each of 
            them works; we shall try different alternatives and put them to test 
            by measuring users' reactions. </p>
