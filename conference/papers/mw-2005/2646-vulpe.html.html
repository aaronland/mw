        <h1>Expanding the Knowledge Base Managing Extended Knowledge at the National 
          Museum of the American Indian</h1>
        <h2>Michael Vulpe, i4i, Canada, and Jane Sledge, National Museum of the 
          American Indian, USA</h2>
      <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
        <p id="abstract">A Native American basketmaker was hired to teach a college 
          class in Indian crafts. Each day she began and ended her class by having 
          her students sing songs she had taught them, until some of the students 
          began to complain that they would never learn basket making at that 
          rate. So the teacher said, &quot;Now we'll collect the materials for 
          making baskets&quot; &#8211; but it turned out that in order to do that 
          she had to teach them still more songs, and the students became frustrated 
          again. Finally, after they had collected all the materials and returned 
          to the studio the teacher announced that she would now have to teach 
          them still more songs in order to make the baskets. At this the students 
          rebelled and demanded to know how to make baskets instead. To which 
          the teacher replied, &quot;Don't you know that the basket only represents 
          the song, and that the songs are really the tradition that you need 
          to make baskets? For a basket is only a visual representation of a song.&quot;</p>
        <p id="abstract">Web technologies have the potential to expand the depth 
          and scope of the knowledge base by including other, often underrepresented, 
          sources of knowledge. This paper explores a project underway at the 
          National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) that uses Web technologies 
          to reach out to Native American communities and enables them to be active 
          participants in the development of the knowledge base and in the sensitive 
          care of Native American collections. The strategy goes beyond the simple 
          'feedback' forms on Web pages and relates directly to NMAI's mission 
          to advance, in consultation, collaboration and cooperation with Natives, 
          knowledge and understanding of Native cultures. The NMAI is testing 
          a suite of Web infrastructure tools that offers Native communities opportunities 
          to represent themselves in the knowledge base and locally manage knowledge 
          about NMAI objects, media, and documents and related objects often stewarded 
          by others. </p>
        <p id="abstract">Focusing on technical aspects, this paper will discuss 
          the importance of a metadata server that provides a data front end to 
          a virtual content aggregator to bring together previously unconnected 
          collections databases. The metadata server, which can normalize an unlimited 
          number of metadata namespaces, is front-ended by knowledge organization 
          applications such as XML word processors and e-learning visual studios. 
          It allows users to create and manipulate personalized metadata driven 
          points of view (POV) on the aggregated collections. NMAI is testing 
          the application of these tools in its collections research, public programs, 
          and community services activities. </p>
        <p id="abstract">NMAI hopes that, by extending a level playing field using 
          Web technologies, the knowledge base at the NMAI will serve as a public 
          and educational resource that enables appreciation for the multiplicity 
          of POVs of all subject matter experts.</p>

        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>The National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) faces many challenges 
          to effectively use its electronic information resources to meet its 
          business objectives. The challenge discussed in this paper is how NMAI 
          addresses the need to support collaborative interchanges of information 
          by offering integrated modes of access to its own and other databases 
          and incorporates, within its systems, appropriate additional knowledge 
          gained through the collaborative processes.</p>
        <p>Many projects successfully bring data together from diverse resources. 
          (France chartered the development of national databases to hold cultural 
          information in 1968 and Canada launched its National Inventory Programme 
          in 1972). This challenge addresses the next step: what people want to 
          do after they have access to the diverse resources.  The challenge includes 
          ensuring that research, comments and expanded knowledge can be held 
          in NMAI's systems. For example, a recent New York-based NMAI exhibit 
          entitled, <strong><em>The Language of Native American Baskets:</em></strong><strong><em> 
          </em></strong><strong><em>From the Weavers'</em></strong><strong><em> 
          View</em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong><strong> featured more 
          than </strong>200 baskets from the NMAI collection.  None of the information 
          prepared for the exhibit was entered into NMAI's Registration Information 
          Tracking System because neither the system, designed to support the 
          move of collections, nor the work-flow processes for museum record-keeping 
          could support the information.  NMAI identified a potential solution 
          in an emerging methodology: using a separate metadata tier as a mechanism 
          of integration and a work and staging area for extended information.  
          NMAI asked Infrastructures For Information Inc. (i4i), an organization 
          experienced in metadata management, to identify and define a metadata 
          repository implementation to address the challenge, enhance the Museum's 
          business processes, and contribute to its strategic goals.</p>
        <p>NMAI contracted with i4i to produce a proof of concept project sufficient 
          to demonstrate and evaluate, in controlled use, key concepts inherent 
          in the use of an XML metadata repository to support on-going and collaborative 
          content development, knowledge capture and knowledge representation 
          through placeless document views. </p>
        <p>This project is linked to other efforts: internal efforts such as NMAI's 
          implementation of Collections Information System (CIS) and Digital Asset 
          Management (DAM) software, and external efforts such as Indigenous Knowledge 
          Management software (Hunter et al 2002), a project previously presented 
          at Museums and the Web by Dr. Jane Hunter, Senior Computer Scientist 
          at Distributed Systems Technology Center in Brisbane, Queensland. The 
          software tools developed by Dr. Hunter <em>et al</em> enable authorized 
          members of Indigenous communities to define and control a variety of 
          sensitive care needs, accessibility, and reuse of their digital resources; 
          uphold traditional laws pertaining to secret/sacred knowledge or objects; 
          prevent the misuse of indigenous heritage in culturally inappropriate 
          or insensitive ways; ensure proper attribution to the traditional owners; 
          and enable Indigenous communities to describe their resources in their 
          own words.</p>
        <p>The goal of the project is to identify, define, and implement a proof 
          of concept metadata repository implementation that can serve both as 
          a &quot;finding aid&quot; for the museum to users of its various databases; 
          for instance the CIS and DAM databases or public users of NMAI's Interactive 
          Learning Center on the National Mall; and as a framework for collaborative 
          development supporting NMAI's internal and external projects such as 
          the Indigenous Knowledge Project.</p>
        <p>The metadata repository is based on relevant industry standards, particularly 
          on XML, for defining metadata and for managing content created in the 
          collaborative environment. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software 
          is used, though some configuration and customization work is needed 
          to adapt the software to the museum's particular content. The repository 
          fits into the high-level system architectures set by the Smithsonian 
          Institution's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) and the 
          NMAI, and makes use of existing capabilities and services wherever possible.</p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Databases and other information resources proliferate within enterprises, 
          and networking based on standard protocols such as TCP/IP and HTTP makes 
          access to them broadly available, both within and among organizations. 
          The challenge is to create a unified view or views of these resources 
          to enable users to find what they need with a minimum of exploration, 
          and to support software applications that can work with a set of databases 
          without the need for separate interfaces to each one.  An emerging methodology 
          to address this fundamental problem is the use of controlled vocabulary 
          expressed in XML to create a normalized metadata tier to provide users 
          with location, navigation, and content categorization management services 
          across multiple independent databases. An example of this type of service 
          is the WinFS component of the Microsoft Longhorn operating system, promised 
          for 2006 but now delayed indefinitely.  </p>
        <h2>The Function Of Metadata</h2>
        <p>Simply put, metadata is data about data. Managed metadata can provide 
          meaningful categories for content elements. These categories can then 
          be used to create structured abstracts of the information held in the 
          data stores below, and to present navigable views of the resources. 
          There is a relatively long history of the use of a distinct metadata 
          layer in document management and geographic information systems, but 
          in these applications the metadata is drawn from a unified data store 
          with a homogeneous data model and vocabulary. Advances in technology, 
          specifically XML, which supports the design of very flexible data models 
          and the interleaving of models, allow heterogeneous databases to effectively 
          project themselves in metadata.. The projected metadata is a binary 
          pair; an XML tag which defines 'aboutness’ and a content object which 
          is the ‘subject’, are captured in a metadata tier that is data model 
          agnostic. The net result is a consolidation of all of the participating 
          databases presented in a normalized form and organized to support certain 
          interactive services efficiently. (This approach is consistent with 
          the evolving Web services model expressed in architectures like J2E 
          and .NET. In these architectures, physical services and data stores 
          have neutral (XML) abstract representations that are available over 
          the Web for interrogation. The neutral abstraction masks complexities;,physical 
          and logical, that need be resolved only once a decision to use a service 
          or dataset is reached.)</p>
        <p>A metadata repository integrates, to some degree, the contents of the 
          participating databases into a common view for users (persons or software 
          processes). The degree of sophistication of the consolidation is proportional 
          to the sophistication of the normalized form.   </p>
        <h2> MetaData and the Repository</h2>
        <p>To a database designer, metadata comprises the names and definitions 
          of the components of a data model: tables, columns, relationships, constraints, 
          etc.  We call this <em>prescriptive</em> metadata. The designers of 
          object-oriented software hold a similar view. To the curator, cataloguer, 
          or document manager, metadata comprise the values of pre-defined data 
          elements that identify or classify an object, intellectual work or document; 
          author, title, subject, provenance, etc. We call this <em>descriptive</em> 
          metadata. A Google search on the term <em>metadata</em> will yield a 
          result set in which both views are represented, but as two almost completely 
          disjointed subsets.  Both views are relevant to a metadata repository. 
          The following diagram illustrates their relationship:</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="vulpe.fig1.jpg" width="400" height="156" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: descriptive and prescriptive metadata"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 1: descriptive and prescriptive metadata</p>
        <p>Metadata is built on data content. The <strong>data layer</strong> 
          below the metadata repository represents a set of repositories holding 
          digital content, in XML or other formats. Digital content may be in 
          the form of individual files such as Word documents or organized in 
          databases. Information processes and services, constrained by the security 
          model, may also be included in this layer, because they too can be described 
          in metadata. These resources are represented in the metadata repository 
          by descriptive metadata, which must include an explicit identification 
          (a data repository identity and some sort of address or link) in order 
          to retrieve the content entity. Aside from this reference, the metadata 
          repository is separate from, and essentially agnostic to, the data repositories; 
          stronger couplings are possible, but increase the complexity of the 
          metadata repository software for little gain in functionality. </p>
        <p>The lower layer of the metadata repository is a type of directory, 
          encoded in XML, containing data elements defined in the dictionary layer 
          above, populated by values that either (a) describe individual information 
          resources or (b) define classification schemes or categories used to 
          organize views of the resource collection. In a sense, (a) represents 
          cataloguing of various kinds and (b) represents organizational frameworks 
          of various kinds &#8211; thesauri, topic maps, or simply arbitrary hierarchies 
          of <strong>folders</strong>. The content <strong>units </strong>of the 
          directory itself are XML instances. </p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText">The upper layer of the metadata repository is a 
          type of dictionary that defines the data elements and their relationships, 
          and is used to describe and relate information resources in the directory 
          layer. In XML, the dictionary can be implemented as a schema or DTD 
          or a set of schemas and/or DTDs that define the XML used in the directory 
          layer and in any XML digital resources. A resource discovery tool would 
          query the dictionary to be informed as to the meaning of the metadata 
          used in the directory.</p>
        <p>This two-layer model of a metadata repository provides several potential 
          values not inherent in a single-layer model:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It can represent all resources. Without 
            the dictionary layer, the directory is locked into a single representational 
            model of the resources layer and is not easily adapted to new kinds 
            of resources or new forms of organization. </li>
        <li>
           It can dynamically support the creation 
            of new digital resources; that is, the process of creating digital 
            resources can be modeled in the dictionary layer and managed in the 
            directory layer, so that the descriptions of resources and their organization 
            are captured as they are created. This is particularly powerful when 
            the new resources are assembled from existing digital resources and 
            existing directory content.</li>
        <li>It can easily support multiple views of the resources, organized in 
          different ways for different uses or users. Directory data elements 
          can be arbitrarily designated in the dictionary layer as carrying classification 
          values so that associations between content entities and hierarchies 
          of associations can be created as needed. </li>
      </ul>
      
        <p>The content entities represented in the directory layer can be organized 
          into various hierarchical views by associations built on common values 
          in directory data elements. There may be other relationships between 
          content entities, represented by cross-references or links embedded 
          in the content itself. In principle, such links could also be managed 
          in the metadata repository at the directory level; however, link management 
          would only include XML content and would entail metadata server's being 
          more tightly coupled to the XML content repository, significantly increasing 
          its complexity. By maintaining a loose coupling between the metadata 
          repository and the resource repositories whose content it represents, 
          the metadata repository fits cleanly into most existing high-level architectures. 
        </p>
        <p>The metadata repository does not impose any restrictions on the data 
          layer repositories; it only requires that the metadata about the content 
          entities it describes be passed to it, or routed by it, as content entities 
          are created or changed. An interesting aspect of this is that the metadata 
          repository does not need to represent all of the content in any or all 
          of the data layer repositories. This allows metadata management services 
          to be developed over selected content, enabling an evolutionary approach 
          to implementation.</p>
        <h1>A Starting Point For NMAI</h1>
        <p>The starting point for the NMAI was an XML repository that created 
          an aggregated metadata view of data from Smithsonian Institution museums 
          and offices. The data includes information from the Smithsonian's American 
          Art Museum Web site, Native American Portraits from the National Portrait 
          Gallery's <em>Catalogue of American Portraits</em>, a combination of 
          the Smithsonian Institution Library and Northwestern University's Edward 
          Curtis Collection images, the National Anthropological Archives glass 
          plate negative portraits of Native Americans, and NMAI's collections. 
          The idea was to bring together an interesting subset of information 
          that could provide users with insight about Native American materials 
          at the Smithsonian and illustrate how a metadata repository addressed 
          NMAI's objectives &#8211; managing knowledge capture and facilitating 
          collaboration. </p>
        <p>The metadata view is delivered in way that allows the museum's external 
          constituencies to collaborate with the museum to build new information 
          products and expands the factual and interpretive knowledge base about 
          the collections.  The metadata repository is not the interface but the 
          enabler of diverse interfaces. This addresses key business needs articulated 
          in Director West's Strategic Plan 2002-2004:</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Develop and produce multi-dimensional exhibitions 
          that reach out to visitors to connect them with our message, utilize 
          new and emerging technology tools, link them to Native sources of knowledge, 
          and provide intergenerational learning experiences.</p>
        <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(NMAI Strategic Plan)</p>
        <h2>Knowledge Capture &amp; Collaboration</h2>
        <p>The problem with knowledge capture is that new information is infrequently 
          returned, managed, or preserved in a meaningful way in museums' collections 
          systems. Knowledge about the collection is developed during the process 
          of research projects, publication planning, and exhibit design. This 
          knowledge is captured and held in documents. Unfortunately much of this 
          'added' knowledge does not return to the collection information system; 
          it remains in the curatorial files and publication documents. It may 
          be that this information should NOT be returned to the collections system 
          as it is tangential to the collections data, or of a different genre, 
          or owned and held by other communities or institutions.  Staff should 
          be able to choose to include information (records, documents, or media) 
          in the collections system, the digital asset management system, the 
          metadata repository, or through the metadata directory link to related 
          information in other museum, library, and archive systems. We do not 
          have to stuff all our expanded knowledge into a single system.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="vulpe.fig2.jpg" width="302" height="229" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: The NMAI structure"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig. 2: The NMAI structure tells the user that NMAI 
          thinks first of object type, then where it came from (geography), then 
          the tribe and the artist/maker.</p>
        <p>The problem of collaboration has both technical and human aspects. 
          While the human aspect of getting people to work together is separate 
          issue, the technology aspect that can help make it as easy as possible 
          for people to access subject materials is central to the objectives 
          of the metadata repository project. An aspect of the project is defining 
          and managing an electronic 'public space' wherein collaborative activity 
          takes place. That public space brings together information resources 
          that are a necessary part of an informed discourse as well as contributions 
          to the discourse. Documents are central to the discourse. They are a 
          primary knowledge capture and collaboration medium. Authors put their 
          thoughts and knowledge on to 'paper' &#8211; documents. These are distributed 
          to the collaborative community for review, comment, and edit. It can 
          be said that in an asynchronous digital world, the document is the medium.</p>
        <p>XML is a core technology for enabling access to document content. An 
          XML repository for the storage, and ultimately, management of publication 
          materials, supported by XML content creation and manipulation systems, 
          addresses the problem of knowledge capture and collaboration. Specifically, 
          XML is used to identify knowledge developed during document development 
          and editing: the 'aboutness’ and ‘subject’ pairing of metadata in the 
          metadata repository. The XML knowledge document is abstracted as metadata 
          that populates the metadata repository and when projected to the normalized 
          form is used to define and organize a public space for the collaborative 
          activity. (A further application of this software tool will take place 
          within a project called <em>Indigenous Knowledge Initiative). </em></p>
        <h2>A Pilot </h2>
        <p>Native communities seek local control over cultural heritage and language 
          preservation efforts and desire to speak for and represent themselves 
          to the museum's public. To meet these objectives, NMAI and other partners 
          are considering a strategy, still in the formative stages, called the 
          <em>Indigenous Knowledge Initiative</em> which brings together community, 
          education, and technical experts, computer research projects, and electronic 
          software resources outlined below. These resources will improve the 
          ability of individual Native communities to strengthen culture and language 
          at home while, at the same time increasing their ability to learn about 
          other cultures, educational practices, and languages. The Initiative 
          is centered in concepts of Native community control and Native Ways 
          of Being approaches to teaching and learning, developed by Native people 
          from around the world</p>
        <p>The Initiative will create a distributed network built around culture 
          and language preservation and continuance in Indigenous communities.  
          The <strong>Indigenous Knowledge Management System (IKMS</strong>) is 
          a software tool developed by Smithsonian Fellow and Senior Computer 
          Scientist Dr. Jane Hunter, at the Distributed Systems Technology Center 
          (DSTC) in Queensland, Australia. Jane Hunter started with the premise 
          of enabling Native communities to use multimedia technologies to &quot;record 
          and preserve significant aspects of their cultures, including languages, 
          ceremonies, dances, songs, stories, symbols, design, artwork, tools, 
          costumes, historical photographs, film, videos, and audio tapes.&quot; 
          (Hunter et al 2002). In concert with NMAI, Jane Hunter sought to develop 
          electronic mechanisms to enable traditional owners</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">to define and control the rights and access to their 
          resources, in order to: uphold traditional laws; prevent misuse of Indigenous 
          heritage in culturally inappropriate or insensitive ways; and receive 
          proper compensation for their cultural and intellectual property. &#8230; 
          [NMAI staff believes] it is essential that Native communities describe 
          and contextualize their culturally and historically significant collections, 
          in their own words and from their own perspectives (Hunter et al 2002.)</p>
        <p>KMS software is designed for use by any community willing to work with 
          NMAI and the DSTC to develop the expertise necessary to implement the 
          software in their community. Member colleges and universities from the 
          American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIIHEC) and World Indigenous 
          Network Higher Education Consortium (WINHEC) reviewed the Indigenous 
          Knowledge Management software, and two colleges are involved in the 
          project as beta testing sites. Little Priest Tribal College in Nebraska 
          is developing a three dimensional tour of the Ho Chunk Society Historical 
          Museum located on the campus.Working with experts from NMAI, middle 
          school students from the community's schools are taking photographs 
          of the local museum's artifacts and displays. They are also meeting 
          with elders and historical society members as part of the effort to 
          develop annotations for each object included in their tour. Local objects 
          will be supplemented in the virtual museum by working with NMAI to photograph 
          Ho Chunk artifacts stored at NMAI's Cultural Resource Center located 
          in Suitland, Maryland. </p>
        <p>NMAI's challenge is to manage and make accessible appropriate information 
          resulting from this Initiative. NMAI will use its metadata repository 
          to provide a staging ground and gathering site for materials generated 
          in the Indigenous Knowledge Management software. The metadata repository 
          'integrates' commercial collections management and digital asset management 
          software products as well as XML-MARC. This unified view enables tribal 
          members to explore music or oral recordings, for example, in museum 
          collections or on-line tribal archives from around the world, along 
          with records about the instruments and records about objects being created 
          while the music is played or sung. </p>
        <p>Tom Davis, a contributor to the First Voices Project, writes,</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Robert Peacock, former Chairman of the Fond du Lac 
          Band of Ojibwa Indians in Minnesota and now the President of White Earth 
          Tribal and Community College, used to dream that he could go over to 
          the tribe's small museum, and then use computers to explore Anishinaabe 
          artifacts and items and information available from Canada, Europe, or 
          wherever they might be found.  (First Voices)</p>
        <p>A preliminary view is that the Indigenous Knowledge Initiative has 
          7 major activity stages, suggested by Jane Hunter in the <em>Software 
          Tools for Indigenous Knowledge Management</em> resource (Hunter et al 
          2002).</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="vulpe.fig3.jpg" width="400" height="287" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Seven activity stages"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig. 3: Seven activity stages of Indigenous Knowledge 
          Initiative</p>
        <p>They are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generation of a digital information request</li>
        <li>Submission and review of a digital information request</li>
        <li> 
           Organization of resources and the provision 
            of these resources to the native community</li>
        <li>Attachment of rights</li>
        <li> 
          Application of annotations</li>
        <li>Disposition of information by the native community</li>
        <li> 
           Review of information by the NMAI</li>
        <li>Disposition of information by the NMAI</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>The following diagram shows the basic workflow of the spiral, with 
          the metadata repository providing the initial application support for 
          NMAI processes and Jane Hunter's Indigenous Knowledge Management System 
          providing the application support for community use.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="vulpe.fig4.jpg" width="400" height="263" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Basic workflow"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig. 4: Basic workflow</p>
        <p>At NMAI the information / documents are available in a shared Web space 
          which has the 'look and feel' of Windows folders with documents. The 
          default folder structure is the NMAI organization model. That default 
          structure is populated with publications, collections, and media asset 
          documents. The metadata from the collections documents, the media asset 
          store and the publications documents is used to create the model and 
          the documents 'appear' in folders because of their metadata. Change 
          the metadata in a document, and it automatically appears in the appropriate 
          folder. This allows content to appear in multiple places simultaneously. 
          The physical constraints of organization are removed; objects position 
          themselves based on their metadata properties.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="vulpe.fig5.jpg" width="307" height="223" border="0" alt="individual folder structure"/></p>
        <p class="caption"> Fig. 5: This individual folder structure tells the 
          NMAI that the user thinks first of the tribe, then the season, then 
          the theme, then the material</p>
        <p>Folders, being in effect XML documents with metadata, act as documents 
          do. Because documents and folders position themselves logically rather 
          than physically, the user is able to create multiple axes of understanding 
          without having to worry about the physical placement of objects in the 
          structures &#8211; they appear automatically. </p>
        <p>The shared Web space appears to the user as an extension of the Window's 
          file system. Documents are accessed on users' computers from the shared 
          Web space. Saved documents pass through the metadata server, their properties 
          extracted and the metadata views updated appropriately. They are then 
          stored in an XML document repository or returned, in their native form, 
          to the collections information system or media asset server as appropriate.</p>
        <p>These logical folder structures, which are in fact XML documents viewed 
          through the prism of Window's Explorer, are available to Web browsers. 
          This paradigm may be easier for casual users and viewers to accept and 
          to navigate.</p>
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig6" id="Fig6"><img src="vulpe.fig6.jpg" width="375" height="288" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: What the users see"/></a></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig. 6: What the users see</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The creation of XML representations of collections 
          records and media assets is an extract of the current database(s) into 
          XML form. The XML is used to populate the metadata repository and is 
          the neutral intermediate form that the new CIS system will support. 
          It is also the basis for data interchange between the metadata asset 
          system and the CIS.</p>
        <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
        <p>New knowledge sources, such as researchers or tribal visitors, can 
          add knowledge to the collections information documents. That knowledge 
          is expressed in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           direct supplements to the collections 
            documents </li>
        <li>references made from the publications documents to the collections 
          documents</li>
        <li>alternative organization models for the information</li>
        <li>Publication products (Web sites, exhibits, books, Web casts, video-conferences 
          and educational resources) incorporate and attribute the newly acquired 
          knowledge.</li>
      </ul>
      
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>NMAI is developing a technical infrastructure to support knowledge 
          gathering and collaboration to manage, maintain, and present information 
          for use in a variety of museum activities. No one system solves all 
          the challenges. NMAI chose to acquire a variety of systems to meet the 
          needs of specific functions and to integrate these systems at a higher 
          level. Just as no one system solves all the challenges, no single museum, 
          library, archives, or information store can hold all the information 
          and knowledge.  Museums are interdependent with libraries, archives, 
          universities and larger constituent communities. Unlike many libraries 
          and archives, museum activities expand the existing knowledge base.  
          Museum systems are not static; museum systems are dynamic and ever expanding. 
          The systems must enable communities to converse, collaborate, generate, 
          share, and comment upon information held in multiple systems. We must 
          be able to link resources across multiple systems, add information and 
          comment, cooperatively engage with external constituents and communities, 
          and develop new interfaces and products. </p>
