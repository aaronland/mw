      <h3 id="abstract">Abstract </h3>
      <p id="abstract">Funded by both NEH and IMLS, <em>The Raid on Deerfield: 
            The Many Stories of 1704 </em>Web site is a multi-cultural collaborative 
            effort that commemorates and reinterprets the 1704 raid on Deerfield 
            from the perspectives of the five different groups who were present 
            at the event: Kanienkehaka (Mohawk), Wôbanakiak (Abenaki), Wendats (Huron), 
            the French, and the English. A tabbed approach to the multiple perspectives 
            allows learners to move quickly and easily among the different perspectives, 
            facilitating comparison and enabling the telling of the story from conflicting 
            points of view without the loss of coherence in the narrative. A layered 
            approach to the content structure permits storytelling in small, understandable, 
            compelling segments, supported by fuller context &ndash; thereby capturing 
            the visitor's attention and providing a rich context to satisfy 
            the casual observer, as well as the motivated visitor. Multiple paths 
            through the content, both within the narrative context and from an indexed 
            list or menu, accommodate different kinds of inquiry. Special features 
            allow for different learning styles and promote active engagement with 
        potentially unfamiliar and challenging primary sources.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>On February 29, 1704, a coalition of French and Native Americans launched 
            a pre-dawn raid on the English settlement at Deerfield, Massachusetts. 
            Three hundred years later, on the 300th anniversary of the raid, the 
            Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association (PVMA)/Memorial Hall Museum in 
            Deerfield, Massachusetts, launched a Web site titled <em>Raid on </em><em>Deerfield</em><em>: 
            The Many Stories of 1704</em>, in an attempt to tell an old story in 
            a new way. For three centuries, this event has been interpreted from 
            the dominant European viewpoint as an unprovoked, brutal attack on an 
            innocent village of English settlers. However, the same event can be 
            seen from other perspectives; for example, as a justified military action 
            taken by Native Americans and their French allies against a highly-fortified 
            English settlement in lands belonging to Native peoples. Our challenge 
            was to tell this complex story of conflict in a fair and unbiased way 
        to a general audience.</p>
      <h2>Appealing to a General Audience</h2>
      <p>History museums are the repository of our nation's memory. They 
            are the entrusted keepers of our history and past. Understanding both 
            the successes and the challenges of the past is critical to an informed 
            and involved citizenry, necessary for a strong democracy.  The role 
            of museums in the 21st century is an expanded one, moving away from 
            a focus on collections for collections' sake, toward the conscious 
            use and interpretation of collections for the purpose of engaging and 
            educating a wide public audience in informal lifelong learning. As Harold 
            Skramstad, President Emeritus of Henry Ford Museum &amp; Greenfield 
        Village stated in Daedalus, Aug. '99: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Effective development of a much expanded educational 
            and community role for museums in the next century will require museums 
            to develop a much deeper competence in designing powerful and engaging 
            educational experiences and delivering them to broad public audiences. 
      </p>
      <p>Our intention was to do just that &ndash; develop a powerful and engaging 
            educational experience for a broad public audience &ndash; to both commemorate 
            the event and reinterpret it from the perspectives of the five different 
            cultural groups involved: Kanienkehaka (Mohawk), Wôbanakiak (Abenaki), 
            Wendat (Huron), the French, and the English. We did not want simply 
            to present historical information; we wanted to harness the power of 
            conflict so that visitors to the site could reach a deeper understanding 
            of the raid. We wanted this understanding to be based on an appreciation 
            of the unique and often conflicting perspectives of the five groups 
            involved so that visitors would form their own interpretations and conclusions 
            about this controversial conflict, the forces that led up to it, and 
        its profound legacy.</p>

      <h1>Historical Background: The Raid</h1>
      <p>In the pre-dawn hours of February 29, 1704, a force of about 300 French 
            and Native American allies from New France (Canada) launched a daring 
            surprise attack on the English settlement of Deerfield, situated in 
            the homeland of the Pocumtuck Indians. By the end of the three-hour 
            attack, many were dead and 112 Deerfield men, women, and children were 
            taken captive. These captives, led by their captors, embarked on a 300-mile 
            forced march to Canada in harsh winter conditions. Some of the captives 
            were later 'redeemed' (ransomed) and returned to Deerfield, 
            but one-third chose to remain living among their former French and American 
        Indian captors.</p>
      <p>This event was one of many such battles fought in North America during 
            the complex war known variously as The French and Indian Wars, Queen 
            Anne's War, and The War of Spanish Succession. As such, the raid 
            provided us with a window into a world of global political and religious 
            conflict, family stories and military sagas. The raid is a story of 
            alliances made, broken, and remade. It's an exploration of contradictory 
            meanings of land ownership, a confrontation among different values, 
            and a case study of colonialism. This Web site, then, is a multi-cultural 
            glimpse of early American History rooted in cultural and religious conflicts, 
            trade and kinship ties, personal and family honor, and genocidal expansion. 
            To retell the story of the Deerfield Raid, we felt it was essential 
            to tell the story of these events from the point of view of the numerous 
        cultures involved in the conflict.</p>
      <h1>Collaboration: Content Development</h1>
      <p>To ensure the authenticity of the points of view that our site is based 
            on, we first set out to form a collaboration that would include advisors 
            and scholars from the five cultural groups. We began by assembling a 
            planning team that included Native American and non-Native American 
            scholars, an historian-in-residence, a Web site designer specializing 
            in history and humanities Web sites, a French Canadian illustrator with 
            extensive knowledge of this period of history, a technical director; 
            and a project manager with extensive experience in interactive multi-media 
            training and project administration. This team worked closely with Native 
            American and French Canadian cultural organizations, including the tribal 
            council of the Huron-Wendat Nation in Quebec; the Kanien'kehaka Onkwawén:na 
            Raotitiohkwa Cultural Center in Kahnawake, south of Montreal; the Musée 
            des Abénakis located in Odanak, west of Quebec City; and Pointe-à-Callière, 
        the Montreal Museum of Archaeology and History.</p>
      <p>At our first all-team meeting, some of the Native advisors challenged 
            the original plan for the site that had placed Deerfield at the center 
            of the story.  Thus began an ongoing process of collaboration that was 
            at times contentious, but that always resulted in a richer, more complex 
            telling of the story. The Native advisors argued that in order to understand 
            Native participation in the Deerfield attack, our audience needed to 
            understand each group's history and culture.&nbsp;They stressed that 
            the site needed to communicate each culture's values and world-views 
            and the events that led their people to their location and alliances 
            in 1704. This meeting resulted in a new direction for the Web site, 
            motivating us to redesign our fundamental conceptual model, changing 
            it from a Deerfield-centric model to a more cultural-group-inclusive 
        model. </p>
      <p>Rethinking the content we planned to include in the site caused us 
            to redesign the structure of the site: rather than a single narrative 
            strand centered around the raid, we broke apart the structure to include 
            multiple story lines, allowing visitors to follow their choices of several 
            possible narrative paths. In our original model, we focused simply on 
            the raid and its immediate, local antecedents; in the revised model, 
            we recognized the importance of earlier historical events occurring 
            outside the Connecticut River Valley, events that contributed to later 
        French-Native alliances and their attack on Deerfield.</p>

            content structure before and after initial collaboration. ©&nbsp;2004 Juliet 
        Jacobson.</p>
      <p>As we changed the content included in the site, the 
            structure of the site changed. When the structure changed, the user 
            interface needed to change to reflect this new structure. As a result, 
            a redesign of our primary pages &ndash; the historical scenes &ndash; quickly ensued. 
            We rethought the design to emphasize and provide easy access to the 
            multiple perspectives of the various groups. Here are two early rough 
            sketches showing before and after designs. In the first sketch, as illustrated 
            in Figure 4, the event and illustration are interpreted with a single 
            text box. In the second, we've provided interpretative text from 
            the viewpoints of all five cultural groups. This text is accessed via 
        the tabs you see directly below the illustration.</p>

        pages before and after intial collaboration. © 2004 Juliet Jacobson.</p>
      <p>Our entire development process has been built around this sort of active 
            collaboration. We felt strongly that a Web site about a conflict ought 
            to be built using a process of collaboration; we believe that from such 
            a process can come reconciliation &ndash; in terms of both the Web site's 
            impact on its viewers and the collaboration process itself. Our collaborative 
            effort helped produce a site that we believe is richer and more complex 
            than it might otherwise have been. More importantly though, it's 
            a site that doesn't seek to speak with a single voice, but rather 
        preserves the distinct voices of each of our collaborators. </p>
      <h1>Collaboration: Technology</h1>
      <h2>Shared Team Site and Trackers</h2>
      <p>To facilitate ongoing communication and collaboration among geographically 
            dispersed team members, we developed a team Web site. The site contains 
            links to contact information, writing and review guidelines, policy 
            statements, an advisor review section, an art gallery with successive 
            iterations of illustrations, Web statistics, user testing results, and 
            content development progress trackers. An example of these trackers 
            is the People tracker, built by our programmer and illustrated in Figure 
            5. It serves as a menu to the pages about each character's narrative, 
            the name of the author, the stage of development, the person responsible 
            for the next task, the due date for the next task, and the grant that 
            is paying for this element of the Web site. To edit or enter information 
            about an item, the user simply clicks the track link and brings up a 
            data entry page; to review the actual text of the narrative, the user 
            clicks the Title/Preview link which opens the page as it appears in 
            the final Web site. Using these trackers, everyone on the team is able 
            to access up-to-date information about the Web site's components.<br />
      </p>

      </p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 5: The People tracker. 2004 P.V.M.A.</p>
      <h2>Two Ways of Handling Content</h2>
          <ol>
          <li> 
            Some of our content is list-like in nature &ndash; for instance, artifacts 
              and glossary terms. The content for these is edited directly in the 
              tracker and stored in a database. </li>
          <li> Other content, such as the character narratives, is lengthy prose 
              and requires more formatting flexibility. This content is stored as 
              XML in separate files on the server. In both cases, once the update 
              is posted, authors and reviewers can see the results immediately in 
              the previews accessed from the tracker. Storing the content in the 
              database and in XML, separate from the HTML, has several advantages: 
            </li>
          </ol>
        <ul>
          <li> 
             it provides structure for the author; 
          </li>
          <li> 
             it keeps the content separate from the 
              design, allowing more flexibility to change the look and format of 
              all the pages without touching the text; </li>
          <li>we can reuse the material in future formats 
                without hands-on intervention. </li>
        </ul>
         
          <h2>Tools To Aid in Collaboration</h2>
          <p>Collaboration is enhanced by using Macromedia Dreamweaver to check 
            files in and out of our server: a team member can see when another member 
            has something checked out and is editing it. We use the check-in feature 
            for both HTML pages and the XML content files. The writers check in 
            a draft, and then technical people check it out to add links, pointers 
            to illustration files and other display-oriented information. The technical 
            information remains in place when the writer checks the XML out for 
            further revision. Using Altova's light-weight XML editor called Authentic, 
            we have created structured templates that allow the authors to write 
            comfortably, but directly, into the XML format.</p>
          <p>For version control we use another tool with an easy Windows-based 
            graphic interface: CS-RCS Component Software's Revision Control System. 
            The writer checks each draft into his or her local system. This tool 
            allows the user to annotate each draft and to go back easily and retrieve 
            any earlier version.</p>
          <h1>A Design to Support Context, Complexity and Multiple Perspectives</h1>
          <p>With a working collaborative process in place, we set out to design 
            a site that successfully communicates this complicated, conflict-rich 
            event. We needed to capture the casual user's attention with compelling 
            content and an engaging design, and also facilitate the comparison of 
            perspectives; and we needed to support this with a vast amount of relevant 
            primary and secondary source material. In the interest of providing 
            historical context to the telling of the story, the site ultimately 
            grew to include 20 rich, interactive historical scenes; 23 narratives 
            of people's lives; 165 brief biographical profiles; approximately 130 
            artifacts and historic documents gathered from the collections of PVMA 
            and more than 30 cultural institutions in the U.S., Canada, and Europe; 
            13 maps &#8211; some historic and others interactive; over 400 glossary 
            definitions; over 200 bibliography and webography citations; audio files 
            of stories and songs; over a dozen essays; more than 100 illustrations/paintings, 
            many commissioned expressly for this project; and an interactive timeline 
            covering 120 years of Deerfield, New England, and world history.</p>
          <h2>History Museums and Multiple Points of View</h2>
          <p>The AAM in its <em>Museum Education Standards and Principles</em> (2002) 
            stresses the importance of museums' presenting multiple points of view.  <em>Standard 2.</em><em> Diversity of Perspectives</em> states that: 
          </p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">Museum educators use interpretive practices that 
            acknowledge the variety of cultural, scientific, and aesthetic points 
            of view that contribute to visitors' understanding.  They create opportunities 
            that enable informed viewpoints to receive judicious consideration. 
          </p>
          <p>However, American history museums until relatively recently have presented 
            a one-sided view of history, with exhibits displaying, for the most 
            part, the perspective of the dominant European/American culture. In 
            the 1960s and 1970s, with the rise of new social history, museums perceived 
            a larger mission to present the histories of the many diverse groups 
            that make up America and the world. By the 1990s, the need for museums 
            to present diverse perspectives was well established, and fully explored 
            in Smithsonian publications edited by Ivan Karp (1992).  In these books, 
            Karp, Peirson, and others elucidate the importance of representing multiple 
            perspectives of history, including the power that museum exhibits hold 
            in defining a group's identity and history, as well as the need for 
            the groups represented to have a strong voice in how their experiences 
            are depicted.  In a groundbreaking study, Rosenzweig and Thelen (1998) 
            established that Americans trust history presented in museums over any 
            other historical outlet.</p>
          <p>Over the past 10-15 years, there have been concerted and well-publicized 
            efforts by museums to reinterpret their exhibits and add new exhibits 
            to include diverse perspectives; such as Colonial Williamsburg's efforts 
            to improve its interpretation of slavery. History museums throughout 
            the country continue to seek effective ways to reinterpret and create 
            new public programs that provide a fuller understanding of the many 
            groups of people who are part of our nation's history.  As recently 
            as 2000, Dr. Eric Foner (2000), president of the AHA, in an article 
            in <em>Perspectives, </em>spoke to the continuing need for museums and 
            historical societies to do a better job of presenting diverse perspectives 
            of historic events. </p>
          <p>Although many of these new or reinterpreted exhibits do an excellent 
            job of educating audiences about different cultural views, there has 
            been the concern that too many exhibits awkwardly try to retrofit multicultural 
            history into pre-existing narratives which place Euro-American history 
            at their center.  At times this takes the form of adding exceptional 
            individuals to a mainstream narrative; at other times, sections of an 
            exhibit deal with marginalized groups without integrating their story 
            into the whole. Often, only one or possibly two additional perspectives 
            are depicted in any one exhibit.  It is generally agreed that one of 
            the critical, though infrequently achieved, factors in the inclusion 
            of diverse perspectives, is for the museum to work closely with representatives 
            of the diverse groups whose history is being depicted. </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, even in the best exhibits, the medium of a physical museum 
            exhibit limits the degree to which diverse perspectives can be presented 
            and easily compared by the viewer. Comparisons among perspectives are 
            best understood when a viewer can rapidly and effortlessly move from 
            one to the other, appreciating the points of similarity and difference 
            without being required to remember one before learning the next. In 
            a traditional museum-based exhibit, it is very difficult to convey the 
            diverse roots of an event and its ensuing legacies in a way that is 
            easily accessible to the visitor. To present diverse perspectives on 
            a single event thoroughly, it is necessary to include some of the history 
            leading up to the event as well as the legacies of the event. These 
            histories, the roots and legacies, are different for each group. Creating 
            a balanced presentation among these different groups' histories is a 
            challenge. How do you both engage your audience and ensure an equitable 
            and sophisticated interpretation of the material? </p>
          <p>Using an interactive medium, we were able to design for the historical 
            scenes an approach that allows users to move quickly and easily among 
            the different perspectives, facilitating comparison and enabling the 
            telling of the story from conflicting points of view without the loss 
            of coherence in the narrative. This gives visitors control over which 
            viewpoints they read. In Figure 6, you can see the five perspectives 
            <strong>tabs</strong> to the right of the illustration, with the Wôbanakiak 
            perspective selected. Also note how the illustration has dimmed to spotlight 
            just the Wôbanakiak who are present in this scene.</p>

          <h1>Layered Content Structure to Make Complex Material Accessible</h1>
          <p>Organizing all this material so that it was accessible and not overwhelming 
            to visitors was one of our primary challenges. We created a strict, 
            layered content structure that allows us to tell the story in small, 
            understandable segments supported by fuller, more detailed context. 
            We sought to engage the visitor's attention and then provide rich supporting 
            context. In this way we hoped to satisfy the casual, less knowledgeable 
            visitor as well as the more informed and motivated visitor. This structure 
            allows the viewer to dig deep and focus on a particular topic, following 
            only the links that are of interest. We carefully structured the content 
            of the site so that the most visually engaging and accessible content 
            comprised the <em>top</em> layer of the site. We were conscious of developing 
            this top layer so that a visitor could easily have a brief but complete 
            narrative experience of the story simply by viewing the historical scene 
            pages, looking at the illustrations and reading the <strong>overview</strong> 
            tabs' text. We thought of this as the quick visit and made sure that 
            the primary content was included.</p>
          <p>However, as visitors' interests are engaged and they dig down deeper 
            into the site, the content becomes more detailed and dense. As seen 
            in Figure 6, viewers can delve deeper into the story from the historical 
            scenes in several ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Visitors can follow the links in the text that open maps, essays, 
            character biographies, audio pronunciations, glossary definitions and 
            artifact pages. </li>
          <li>They can roll over the objects and people in the illustration to view 
            a caption below the illustration. (Note hand cursor on the bayonet and 
            the descriptive text beneath the illustration, including Click object 
            for more.) </li>
          <li>They can follow links in the illustration by clicking an object or 
            person.</li>
          <li>They can use the Related To This Scene menus beneath the illustration 
            to reveal pop-up menus of people, artifacts, explanations, and maps.</li>
        </ul>
         
          <p>This variety of linked pages enables visitors to take charge of their 
            own learning &ndash; textually, visually, and interactively. All the supporting 
            pages with links to the historic scenes open in windows that are on 
            top of &ndash; but do not obscure &ndash; the historic scene page. This design reinforces 
            the content structure of the site, presenting supporting information 
            in a clear visual and structural relationship to the historical narrative.</p>
          <h1>Multiple Paths</h1>
          <p>All of the linked material that is accessible from the context of an 
            historic scene is also accessible from menus organized by content type. 
            The visitor can browse menus of people, maps, artifacts, essays, audio 
            files and glossary definitions. Offering the material both within the 
            narrative context and from an indexed list or menu accommodates two 
            different kinds of inquiry. The strictly consistent format of these 
            pages helps the user navigate and conceptually manage the wealth of 
            information in this site.</p>

          <h1>Special Features</h1>
          <p>In addition to presenting content in a layered structure that is accessible 
            from both inside and outside  the narrative, we also sought to present 
            the content in as many <strong>modes<em> </em></strong>as possible. 
            Our aim was to encourage different learning styles and to promote active 
            engagement with potentially unfamiliar and challenging primary sources. 
            We use a variety of interactive features both to capture the viewer's 
            interest and to provide control over examining and manipulating primary 
            source material. Here, we describe three of these interactive features:</p>
          <p>1. Interactive historic maps that allow viewers to zoom in and out, and 
            pan left, right, up and down. Interactive animated maps communicate 
            a geographic story over time.

          <h1>Evaluation</h1>
          <p>Throughout the development process, we conducted 
            numerous formative evaluations to help us refine both the design and 
            content of the site. We used a thorough advisor review process, direct 
            observation of users of the site, interviews, on-line and in-person 
            questionnaires, and focus groups to collect feedback about accuracy 
            of content, clarity of writing, interface usability, and technical performance. 
            The feedback we collected from these various sources was instrumental 
            in the development of the site. In one example, we observed confusion 
            about the story menu which, in its previous design, attempted to include 
            more information than the viewer could easily assimilate. We scrapped 
            the entire menu and started from scratch, striving for a simpler and 
            clearer organization. In another instance, we observed that some visitors 
            were missing many of the rollover features in the historic scene pages. 
            To address this, we created a <strong>Show all hotspots  button</strong>: 
            when the visitor clicks this button, every rollover hotspot in the illustration 
            is clearly illuminated as illustrated in Figure 12.</p>
          <p class="caption"><img src="spichiger_fig12.jpg" width="400" height="297" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Interactive illustration"/></p>
          <p class="caption">Figure 12: Interactive illustration showing the Show 
            all hotspots<em> feature. © 2004 P.V.M.A.</em></p>
          <p>In their detailed case study of the issues facing museums in using 
            and evaluating the new medium of internet technologies, Patricia Gillard 
            and Anne Cranny-Francis state that most Web site evaluations narrowly 
            focus on an outdated model of usability testing (assigning defined tasks 
            and scenarios) and fail to focus on users' experience with the Web site, 
            the meaning they make of its content, and how they engage with it. Gillard 
            and Cranny-Francis (2002) systematically evaluated the Australian government's 
            <em>Documenting a Democracy</em> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/">http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au</a>), 
            one of the earliest Web sites to use the Internet medium to assemble, 
            display and interpret the major documents that define a democratic nation 
            and its continuing formation. Like our Web site, their site sought to 
            represent history in ways that articulated indigenous perspectives. 
            In their article they list the following objectives for examining the 
            contents of this Web site: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assess whether the site is reaching its intended target audiences</li>
          <li>
             Assess whether the site content is achieving 
              its intended aims</li>
          <li>
             Assess whether the site's marketing is 
              appropriate and effective</li>
          <li>
             Develop suggestions for improving the 
              site as a result of the evaluation</li>
        </ul>
        
          <p>This article has been helpful to us in planning our own evaluation 
            of the 1704 Web site. </p>
          <h1>Audience Reactions</h1>
          <p>Have we achieved our goals with this Web site? Do visitors come away 
            from the site with a greater understanding of the raid on Deerfield, 
            the forces that led up to it, and its lasting legacies? Do visitors 
            gain a greater awareness of the different viewpoints about this event? 
            Are they able to form their own opinions about the controversy?</p>
          <p>While we have not yet begun a summative evaluation to answer these 
            questions, we do have some preliminary indications that we are on the 
            right track. One questionnaire filled out by a high school class yielded 
            the following comment when students were asked what they really liked 
            about the Web site: &quot;The fact that it examines all sides of the 
            story.&quot; When asked how they would describe the Web site to someone, 
            three students said the following: &quot;French and Indian war and all 
            the different sides and stories&quot;; &quot;the attack on Deerfield 
            and the opinions of the people&quot;; &quot;the different views of an 
            attack on Deerfield during the French and Indian War.&quot;</p>
          <p>Much of the e-mail feedback we have received to date has recognized 
            the importance of the multi-perspective approach. For example:</p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">I am an Australian consultant historian working 
            in education and public history at The National Archives in London UK. 
            The Head of Education showed me your Web site yesterday and I wanted 
            to acknowledge you for a most extraordinary Web site, but more importantly, 
            for the perspectives on history that it provides &ndash; the multiple stories 
            and interpretations, the equality of the various perspectives, whether 
            they be indigenous or English, and the accompanying essays, manuscripts, 
            artifacts, etc. I have already recommended it to several colleagues 
            in Australia as an exemplar of how a history Web site can be.</p>
          <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Lesley Walker, National Archives, London</p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">I spend a lot of time involved with e-learning, 
            and I have to say this is one of the best Web sites I have ever come across. It has kept me engaged for a long period and I have learnt lots of things. The way you present 
            the stories from different perspectives is excellent; you have really brought this to life. May I also ask how you developed the interactive feature 
            for looking at documents &ndash; this is wonderful! </p>
          <p class="blockquoteauthor">Tom O'Leary, Head of Education and Interpretation, 
            The National Archives, 
            Kew, Richmond, Surrey</p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">What a terrific job you've done on explaining the 
            complexity of the Deerfield Massacre. The interactive features add much 
            to the site in a timely and simple fashion to be able to help readers 
            understand both the sources and the language inserted in your analysis 
            of the event, its people, and the conflict. I particularly like your 
            discourse on &quot;Who Owns History,&quot; that was included because 
            in interpretation, you have rightly made reference to the fact that 
            different perspectives are always possible, and indeed, probable because 
            of different vantage points of observation, and knowledge of events. 
            Great Job, thanks. </p>

          <h1>Summary</h1>
          <p>We believe that viewers can experience the <em>Raid on Deerfield</em> 
            Web site on three distinct levels. On the first, they can learn about 
            the local history of the town of Deerfield. Many people have written 
            to us about shaking their family trees and finding genealogical information 
            about a relative on the site. On a second level, the Web site invites 
            a broader view of history, beyond the town of Deerfield and the raid. 
            For while conventional history may have relegated the raid on Deerfield 
            to one small episode in a larger global contest as European powers vied 
            for control of the Spanish throne, the raid was &ndash; and is to this day &ndash; much more when it is viewed as a window into larger global conflicts. 
            And finally, on a third level, the Web site invites the viewer to look 
            at the 1704 raid &ndash; and by extension, ANY conflict &ndash; in a multi-perspective 
            way, thereby providing a model for the examination of other controversial 
            topics. In our present day, rife with so many painful examples of conflict, 
            the promise of this kind of model lies in its potential for the development 
            of understanding and appreciation of others' viewpoints, and ultimately, 
            reconciliation. </p>
          <p>In an essay entitled &quot;Who Owns History,&quot; Barry O'Connell, 
            Professor of History at Amherst College, tells us that:</p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">The end to be sought is not to get something &quot;absolutely 
            right,&quot; but to make it come alive in all of its uncertainties. 
            The more we can multiply perspectives from many different kinds of people, 
            the better able we are to ask useful and specific questions out of which 
            can come the fullest sense both of what did happen in the past and how 
            we might understand and judge it&#8230;It is our task, as students and 
            teachers, writers and citizens, to bring everyone and everything out 
            of the mist so we might hear their voices, follow their actions, and 
            respect each person, past and present, as a maker as well as a subject 
            of history.</p>
          <p>Our Web site endeavors to &quot;bring everyone and everything out of 
            the mist&quot; so that we might hear the voices and follow the actions 
            of the people who were present on that day so long ago. There is no 
          &quot;one truth&quot; on this Web site; rather, it is for the visitor 
            to determine his or her own truth and meaning about this event, the 
            crosscurrents and forces that led up to it, and its powerful legacies. 
            And in the search for that truth lies the deeper understanding &ndash; the 
            real learning &ndash; that is possible on this Web site.</p>

            Massachusetts that offers a variety of cultural opportunities including 
            two museums, a library, numerous educational programs, online curriculum 
            projects in conjunction with local school districts, and the Old Deerfield 
            craft fairs. The association was founded in 1870 when a group of residents, 
            concerned that the younger generation knew little of the region's history&#8212;especially 
            the raid on Deerfield&#8212;created a museum that would  memorialize 
            the past, including Native peoples of the region.</p>
