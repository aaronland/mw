      <h1>Deriving Meaning From Specimens: Making Zoological Data Available 
        On The Web</h1>

      <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
      <p id="abstract">In museums, natural sciences collections reflect past 
            and present faunal and floral biodiversity and the geology of the earth. 
            These collections are characterized by having many duplicate specimens 
            of each species, with variation in collection locality and time. This 
            is in contrast to cultural collections where few duplicates may be collected 
            and the unique value of each object is emphasized. Museum collection 
            management systems that document natural sciences collections are usually 
            highly structured and have few fields that contain interpreted data 
            (information). Each individual specimen record carries little special 
            meaning. Again, this is in contrast to cultural collections where individual 
            objects may be endowed with a great deal of meaning; may be extensively 
            documented; and may even be accorded <em>iconic</em> status in an institution's 
        collection.</p>
      <p id="abstract">The challenge in presenting natural sciences collections 
            on the Web is to construct meaning from the individual, duplicate specimens.  
        Whilst the precise data for a single specimen may not be interesting 
        to an on-line user, a map showing information about a species may be. 
        Users may be interested in how common the species is, what its geographical 
        distribution is, and whether that distribution has changed over time. 
      </p>
      <p id="abstract">In Australia, and across the world, there are a number 
            of searchable Web sites of natural sciences collections. Common to all 
            is the ability to derive new meanings from individual specimens. This 
            is often achieved by combining specimen data points in a graphic way 
            to provide information about the species. One such project, the Online 
            Zoological Collections of Australian Museums (OZCAM), Australia’s Fauna 
            Web site, is a collaboration among all the major and several minor natural 
            sciences collecting institutions in Australia to present museum collections 
            on-line. Further collaborations are made with the Collections Australia 
            Network, who provide technical support and who host the site, and with 
            software providers KE Software, who have developed the portal and display 
            software.  The OZCAM, Australia’s Fauna project, will be described and 
            used as an illustration of how multi-institutional collaborations can 
            provide greater access and meaning to natural sciences collections on 
        the Web. </p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <h2>A Brief History Of Natural Sciences Collections</h2>
      <p>Collecting is a pastime enjoyed by many, over hundreds of years. The 
            natural world has provided fertile soil, often literally, for collections. 
            The reasons that people collect specimens from the natural world vary 
            widely &#8211; curiosity, a desire to find the first example of a species, 
            or sometimes just as a hobby, much as others find enjoyment in collecting 
            apple dolls or flutes. There have been many famous collectors and collections. 
            For example, the Italian collector Aldrovandi in the sixteenth century 
            amassed a collection of some 20,000 specimens with the aim of completing 
            a inventory of the natural world (Blom, 2002). Others in history were 
            attracted by the rare, the beastly or the grotesque. One example is 
            the cabinet of curiosities collected by Francesco Calceolari in Verona 
            in the seventeenth century. It contained, among many things, the &quot;saw 
            of a sawfish, antlers and snail houses&quot; (Blom, 2002), sharks, crocodiles, 
            a deformed head, and numerous stuffed animals and birds. Some of these 
            'cabinets of curiosities' became very large indeed, sometimes filling 
            entire mansions or palaces. And some of these collections are still 
            preserved today &#8211; although not often in their original form. The 
            200,000 curiosities of Sir Hans Sloane, which included zoological specimens 
            of snakes, insects (including beetles and butterflies), fish, palaeontological 
            specimens, strange oddments such as a bezoar, and various monstrosities 
            (often deformed human foetuses) (Blom, 2002), were donated to the Royal 
            Society of London upon his death. His collection then joined the library 
            of Sir Robert Cotton and the Royal Library to form the British Museum 
        (Blom, 2002). </p>
      <p>Gradually, the focus of collecting the history of the natural world 
            became more systematized and methodical, and less concerned with odd 
            curiosities from distant and exotic lands. One man, who was highly influential 
            in the development of this new &quot;scientific&quot; style of collecting 
            and is known to all natural sciences scholars today, is Carl Linnaeus. 
            Linnaeus was a botanist who sought to find order in the chaos of the 
            natural world and who developed the Latin binomial system of naming 
            species: it is still used today (Blom, 2002). In his time, Linnaeus 
            amassed a huge collection of botanical specimens which is still preserved 
            in the headquarters of the Linnaean Society in Piccadilly. Of course, 
            these specimens were ordered quite differently to the old 'cabinets' 
            where, if there was any order at all, it was entirely at the whim of 
            the owner. The new collections were ordered according to the dictates 
            of scientific realism &#8211; that every living thing had its place 
            and that the order of collections should reflect this. Scientific realism 
            has set the stage for natural sciences collecting for several centuries 
            now and, although the techniques for collection, documentation and storage 
            are now far advanced from those of several centuries ago, the same principles 
        still apply. </p>
      <p>The purpose of this brief history lesson is to give some flavour to 
            how natural history collections in many museums have developed. Some 
            of the now centuries-old specimens that once belonged to the cabinets 
            of curiosities of the European nobility, along with the, also sometimes 
            centuries-old specimens collected by the rationalist scientists of the 
            eighteenth century onwards, have made their way into modern institutions. 
            The old specimens have been joined by large quantities of new specimens 
            - although the terms &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; do not adequately 
        reflect the continuum of collecting that has occurred. </p>
      <p>Many of the old specimens kept in museum collections are now considered 
            to be curios, retained in the collection for reasons other than their 
            scientific value. As Knell (2004) describes, they may be kept because 
            they are unique &#8211; such as the only known occurrences of taxonomically, 
            geologically or stratigraphically interesting specimens, or species 
            now extinct and thus impossible to recollect. Or they may be specimens 
            which hold some interest for the viewing public, such as huge fossil 
            or mineral specimens. Some retain a scientific importance, such as specimens 
            whose descriptions have been published in the scientific literature. 
            Others may not be striking specimens at all, but may be kept because 
            of their associations with important historical characters &#8211; such 
            as barnacles or finches collected by Charles Darwin or orchids by Alfred 
            Russel Wallace. These older specimens are really &quot;objects of history 
            and culture&quot; (Knell, 2004) rather than objects interesting to modern 
            science. They may be imbued with narratives and meanings so that, in 
            the sense of their worth, they are more closely associated with objects 
            of cultural history and material culture (Knell, 2004). These old specimens 
            can form large parts of natural science collections, but they are not 
        the specimens which are the focus of this paper.</p>
      <h1>Modern Natural Sciences Collections </h1>
      <h2>Documentation </h2>
      <p>Arguably the principal reason that the old collections described above 
            have little value to the modern scientific world is their documentation, 
            or lack thereof. Natural sciences specimens need two basic pieces of 
            information in order to be useful scientifically. The specimen must 
            be able to be identified; that is, have a scientific name applied to 
            it, and its provenance (from where the specimen was collected) must 
            be known. Prior to the advent of computer-based collection management 
            tools, all that was known about a particular specimen was written on 
            to the tag attached to the specimen and recorded in a ledger. The records, 
            being handwritten, were often brief. Modern computer-based registration 
            systems provide a much more complex way of recording data and many more 
            cues about what data to record. Data standards for documentation of 
            natural sciences specimens have also been developed, and some are extensive 
        &#8211; running to a potential several hundred pieces of data that could 
            be recorded about a single specimen (for example, see the ABCD schema 
            at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bgbm.org/TDWG/CODATA/Schema/default.htm">http://www.bgbm.org/TDWG/CODATA/Schema/default.htm</a> 
        which has approximately 700 elements, and Darwin Core at <a target="_blank" href="http://darwincore.calacademy.org/">darwincore.calacademy.org/</a> 
        which has 44 elements).</p>
      <p>Interestingly, it should be noted that data, rather than information, 
            is generally recorded in natural sciences collection registration systems.  
        Here, 'data' is defined as uninterpreted, objective facts, and 'information' 
        is data that has been analyzed and interpreted &#8211; &quot;data endowed 
            with relevance and purpose&quot; (Drucker, 1998).  In information is 
            the notion of human involvement, that a person has taken raw data and 
            refined it. This lack of a place for recording information about a specimen 
            means that, often, collection records appear to be one dimensional &#8211; 
        full of facts but not very interesting reading. The stories or narratives 
        that may be told about a particular specimen, and which may give that 
        specimen additional layers of meaning are not recorded in the database. 
        One of the interesting developments in newer collection management systems, 
        where both natural sciences specimens and cultural history objects are 
        recorded in the same system, is the opportunity for natural scientists 
        to make use of some of the fields placed in the database for the cultural 
        historians &#8211; and some of the narratives are beginning to be written 
            (for example, see Museum Victoria's <em>Treasures of Museum Victoria</em> 
        Web site at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/treasures">http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/treasures</a> 
        which draws data from KE Software's KE EMu collection management software, 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kesoftware.com/">http://www.kesoftware.com</a>.)</p>
      <p>But to return to the data stored about specimens</p>
      <h3>Provenance Data</h3>
      <p> Provenance data is more widely known as collection locality data in 
            natural sciences circles. These are the key pieces of data about a specimen 
            that can never be retrieved or recreated if lost. This is unlike specimen 
            identification which, if the specimen exists in good condition, an expert 
            taxonomist or geologist can redo. These data include the exact location 
            that the specimen was collected, on land or in the sea, and including 
            stratigraphic data for mineral and fossil specimens; surrounding physical 
            characteristics of the environment such as temperature, salinity, vegetation, 
            or the host plant for an insect; the date; the collector's name and 
            the method of collection. Old collection labels and register entries, 
            as previously mentioned, are often brief. It is not uncommon to see 
            old specimen labels which read like an out-of-date atlas and provide 
            only a country name for the collection locality, such as Abyssinia, 
            Persia or Tanganyika. Or, worse, the locality may be so broad as to 
        be meaningless, such as &quot;Pacific Ocean&quot;. </p>
      <p>Modern collecting practices require much more rigorous documentation 
            standards at the point of collection than simply the name of the country 
            or water body. Arguably most important of all these pieces of data, 
            at least for zoological and botanical collections, is the precise location, 
            or the latitude and longitude, expressed as accurately as possible in 
            decimal degrees. (Although note that this still does not accurately 
            describe the third dimension of stratigraphic depth for palaeontological 
            and geological specimens). Technology has provided the modern collector 
            with new ways to accurately record the latitude and longitude &#8211; 
        with GPS units now virtually standard-issue equipment in any collector's 
        field bag. The wide availability of GPS technology has led to an increasing 
        desire for accuracy in the recording of the latitude and longitude &#8211; 
        at least by the writers of documentation standards and those interested 
        in geospatial modeling and mapping - such that some standards require 
        an estimate of inaccuracy of the latitude and longitude to be provided 
        in metres from the collection point. For example, the Darwin Core 2.0 
        element &quot;CoordinateUncertaintyInMetres&quot; is defined as </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">the upper limit of the distance (in meters) from 
            the given latitude and longitude describing a circle within which the 
            whole of the described locality must lie. Use NULL where the uncertainty 
            is unknown, cannot be estimated, or is not applicable (because there 
        are no coordinates).</p>
      <p class="blockquoteauthor">(Taxonomic Databases Working Group, 2004).</p>
      <p>Ironically, this requirement for exceptional precision in the recording 
            of the latitude and longitude means that even collections made just 
            two decades ago can now be thought of as &quot;poorly documented&quot;. 
            (At that time, latitude and longitude was often calculated from a map, 
            with a wide margin for inaccuracy depending on the scale of the map 
            and the skill of the reader, or determined using a Gazetteer to provide 
        the latitude and longitude of the nearest named place.) </p>
      <h3>Focus or Rationale</h3>
      <p>The other development that marks modern from old collections is the 
            focus or rationale for undertaking the collecting process in the first 
            place. In some ways little has changed; modern taxonomists are still 
            just as interested as they ever were in describing new species and creating 
            an immense catalogue of the biodiversity of the world. An example of 
            this effort is <em>Species 2000</em>, a project with a stated objective 
        of </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">enumerating all known species of organisms on Earth 
            (animals, plants, fungi and microbes) as the baseline dataset for studies 
        of global biodiversity </p>
      <p class="blockquoteauthor">(Species 2000, 2005).</p>
      <p>However, mounting expeditions is an expensive business, and funding 
            bodies rarely reward the collector who wishes to visit an unexplored 
            area just to &quot;see what's there&quot;. Collections today are made 
            to answer a particular and well-articulated scientific question. Museums, 
            however, are often cash-starved and have found funding sources by turning 
            their resident taxonomists into consultants &#8211; guns for hire to 
            be contracted by government departments and private enterprise to run 
            surveys and assessments of the impacts of development or mining or fishing, 
            or to run monitoring programs in national parks or ecologically fragile 
            environments. All of these activities generate more and more specimens, 
        and often many duplicates of the same species collected over time. </p>
      <h1>The Curation Crisis and the Taxonomic Impediment</h1>
      <p>The holdings of natural sciences material in many state or national 
            museums are immense, growing, and expensive to care for. They require 
            large storage areas, and special monitoring and storage materials (Stankowski, 
            1998). The older specimens, which may have lost their scientific value 
            as previously discussed, but which are retained for their historical 
            and cultural meanings, compete for space with new collections. The new 
            specimens, whilst they might have been &quot;wage earners&quot; during 
            the collection process as part of a consultancy, become money sinks 
            afterwards. Also, with consultancies and other scientific collecting 
            often yielding many duplicate specimens, the vast majority of specimens 
            are never used in exhibitions, or even in further scientific research, 
            and spend 99% of their time in the collection stores (Stankowski, 1998). 
            Deaccessioning these specimens to save money and make more room often 
        appears to be an attractive solution. </p>
      <p>However, alongside the curation crisis is what is known as the &quot;taxonomic 
            impediment&quot;. The taxonomic impediment describes our gaps in knowledge 
            and understanding of the natural world; the shortage of museum professionals, 
            including taxonomists and curators; and the &quot;impact that these 
            deficiencies have on our ability to manage and use our biological diversity&quot; 
        (Environment Australia, 1998). The taxonomic impediment means that the 
        immense collections should not be viewed as just be taking up valuable 
        space, but are actually a tremendous source of information and knowledge 
      &#8211; if we can just make it available in a form that others can use.

      <h1>Presenting Natural Sciences Collections On-line</h1>
      <p>Museums have been enthusiastic about their adoption of new technologies 
            for publishing to the Web. As Knell (2004) states, by the late 20<sup>th</sup> 
        century, collecting and documentation frameworks in the disciplines 
        had become &quot;set in a world of digitization and information networking.&quot; 
        On-line technologies allowed data about collection objects to be made 
        more freely available. However, in doing so, there was also an expectation 
        that the content would be meaningful, understandable and navigable (Cameron, 
        2001, 2003). </p>
      <p>In the past few years, museums have explored two basic ways of making 
            their collections accessible on-line. Often both ways are presented 
            in one Web site. The first is through the &quot;theme/subtheme/storyline&quot; 
        approach (Cameron, 2001) where objects are presented as they would be 
        in an exhibition. The user is led through a predefined path and allowed 
        to access authored statements about the objects. The interpretation 
        is made by the curator rather than the user. This type of Web site has 
        been less prominent for natural sciences collections, partly because 
        of the effort involved in writing the text. As stated above, the stories 
        that might relate to certain objects in a collection are generally not 
        written down &#8211; certainly not in older collection management systems, 
            and sometimes not at all. The knowledge about the collections is often 
        held only in the heads of the scientific staff. </p>
      <p>The second way that collections are made accessible on-line is through 
            a search interface into data held in the collection management system. 
            This method is often adopted for collections which are documented using 
        discrete fields for data. However, as Cameron (2001) states:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Generally this solution is more useful to specialists 
            who have an interest in fielded data. Without a clear understanding 
            of the information available, the way data is modeled, and the search 
            terminologies used to access material, an approach such as this is of 
        little use to non-specialist users.</p>
      <p>In addition to being difficult to search, simply presenting the fielded 
            data from a collection management system has not proved to be an engaging 
            way to deliver information about natural sciences collections. This 
            sentiment is echoed by Siegel and Grigoryeva (1999) who state that collection 
            management systems are designed for &quot;researchers, registrars and 
            collection managers.&quot; That is, they are not designed with direct 
            access for the general public in mind. There are a number of reasons 
            why direct access into the collection management system has proved to 
            be unsatisfactory. One compelling reason is that the data are simply 
            uninteresting when presented as page after page, in list format, of 
            collection records of duplicate specimens of the same species. This 
            is a common result to a general query and simply reflects the content 
            of the actual collections. As described above, the collection management 
            system would not usually store information about the <em>species</em> 
        that a single specimen represents. Information such as the distribution 
        of the species, how common the species is or whether the habitat of 
        the species has been affected recently by bushfires, for example, would 
        not be stored in the object catalogue. In short, object catalogues for 
        natural sciences collections do not make compelling reading on-line 
        without an interpretive overlay. </p>
      <p>What is required is a way that on-line users can engage dynamically 
            with the data &#8211; frame their own questions, and extract their own 
            meanings. Furthermore, a capacity is needed for users to frame questions 
            not just about the individual specimens in the collection but about 
            the <em>species</em> they represent. New generation Web sites provide 
            a retrieval mechanism that is sophisticated enough to take the data 
            in natural sciences collections and add meaning through automation. 
            This provides the users with greater autonomy to phrase their own questions 
            and make their own interpretations (Cameron, 2001). Embedded in this 
            idea is one about how different data have different meanings for different 
            people, a point Marty (1999) makes. Interfaces that permit users to 
            frame their own questions and interpret the answers using their own 
            frames of reference are likely to encourage the users to stay longer 
        and are also likely to attract a wider variety of users. </p>
      <h1>Biodiversity Informatics</h1>
      <p>The new generation of natural sciences Web sites provides user-driven 
            views of biological data, utilizing the very aspects of the collection 
            documentation that made for uninteresting Web pages in the simple search-and-display 
            model. That is, natural sciences object level data usually contain reference 
            to spatial data &#8211; where the specimen was collected from &#8211; 
        and temporal data &#8211; when it was collected. Thus, natural sciences 
            collections, at least the new collections where these data are recorded, 
            are perfect for applying geographic information systems (GIS) technologies. 
      </p>
      <p>Geographic information systems are a suite of technologies that allow 
            for the manipulation and display of spatially-based data. In their simplest 
            form, they allow for computerized cartography (Limp, 1999/2001). In 
            their more complex forms, they allow for mapping the distribution of 
            species across time, or tracking the migration of animals across the 
            globe, for example. When built into Web sites, they provide the user 
            with tools to dynamically generate maps; for example, of species distribution. 
            A number of such sites now exist. One of the largest examples is the 
            Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iobis.org/">http://www.iobis.org/</a>). 
            This site provides geo-referenced information about marine species from 
            around the world. Another is the Mammal Networked Information System 
            (MaNIS at <a target="_blank" href="http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/manis/">http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/manis/</a>). 
            A third example is the Australian Virtual Herbarium (AVH at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chah.gov.au/avh/">http://www.chah.gov.au/avh/</a>) 
            which provides access to floral (plant) collections There are many others. 
      </p>
      <p>In the rest of this paper, a description will be provided of one such 
            Web site, that of OZCAM, Australia’s Fauna (at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ozcam.gov.au/">http://www.ozcam.gov.au</a>). 
            This site provides access to the collections of most of Australia’s 
            major and minor museums and collecting institutions and allows users 
            to dynamically create maps of animal species as well as to view individual 
        specimen records. </p>
      <h1>The OZCAM, Australia's Fauna Website Project</h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Collectively, the Australian custodians of faunal data and collections, 
            through their peak body - the Council of Heads of Australian Faunal 
            Collections (CHAFC) - decided to provide access to specimen data on 
            the Internet. The aim of the project was to provide a search interface 
            to distributed datasets of Australian faunal collections. The result 
            is the OZCAM, Australia’s Fauna gateway which is accessible at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ozcam.gov.au/">http://www.ozcam.gov.au</a> 
        or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fauna.net.au/">http://www.fauna.net.au</a>. 
            All major and a number of minor collecting institutions (including museums 
            and scientific research organizations) are collaborators in the project. 
            The collaboration further extends to Australian government departments, 
            including the Department of Communication, Information Technology and 
            the Arts (DCITA) through the Collections Australia Network (CAN), the 
            Department of the Environment and Heritage through the Australian Biological 
        Resources Study (ABRS), and the National Oceans Office (NOO).  </p>
      <p>Software for OZCAM was built by KE Software, who had already implemented 
            a similar system for the Australian Herbarium community. The Collections 
            Australia Network (then Australian Museums Online (AMOL)) provided expertise, 
            a technical developer/programmer and the Web server, and the museums 
            provided project management and, of course, the data. The partnership 
            of the museums, CAN (AMOL) and KE Software proved to be very successful, 
            completing the initial stages of the project in very tight timeframes 
        and on budget.</p>
      <h2>Description Of The Site</h2>
      <p>Currently the faunal groups available for searching are reptiles and 
            amphibians, fishes, one group of insects (dung beetles), and mammals. 
            Other faunal groups continue to be added. A project funded by the Global 
            Biodiversity Information Facility DIGIT program will see images added 
            for vertebrate type specimens, including birds, and new records for 
            molluscs. Another project will see data for more marine invertebrate 
        groups become available, starting with barnacles. </p>
      <p>There are two access levels, <strong>'public'</strong> and <strong><em>'club'</em></strong>. 
            Users with club level access are mainly those whose institutions are 
            members of CHAFC. Club level access is password-protected, and these 
            users are able to access full data records from each institution's collections.  
        Users accessing the public level search have access to all records available 
        to club level users; however, they are presented with fewer fields (specimen 
        identifier and precise collection location are unavailable), and the 
        latitudes and longitudes for the collection location are 'fuzzed' by 
        up to 10 minutes of a degree.  This fuzzing of coordinates is designed 
            to protect the exact collection location of the specimen, particularly 
        important if the species is rare or endangered.</p>
      <h2>Description Of Search, Display And Download Functions</h2>
      <p>To search the collections, users visit the gateway and opt to <em>Search 
            Australia's Fauna</em>.  The Australia's Fauna search page allows users 
            to conduct detailed searches across most of the record fields (Figure 
        1).</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="wallis.fig1.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: The search screen"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1. The search screen for the OZCAM, Australia’s 
            Fauna Web site, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ozcam.gov.au/">http://www.ozcam.gov.au</a> 
          </p>
      <p>The compulsory fields for searching are genus and/or species, and users 
            can optionally constrain their search by group (e.g. mammals), specimen 
            type (e.g. holotype), locality, State or Territory, and latitude and 
            longitude.  Users are also able to limit their searches by data source. 
            There are currently 22 data sources, and the search can be limited by 
            institution (e.g. Museum Victoria or the South Australian Museum), or 
            by faunal group (e.g. only search reptile data). Alternatively, the 
        search can be made by common name for mammals only. </p>
      <p>The user may also define the maximum number of records to be returned 
            from each data source. Finally, the user can elect to turn off the system 
        default of a 15 minute cache of the search. </p>
      <p>The search interface allows users to request results be returned as 
            mapped points, where the specimen records matching the user's query 
            are plotted on a map of Australia, or as data. In the map display, the 
            points are colour-coded and can represent different genus/species combinations 
            or indicate which institution provided the data. The results also show 
            the status of the data sources so that users can see if a particular 
            data source is available or not, or if it has timed out and not returned 
        any results. </p>
      <p>The map display, an example of which is shown in Figure 2, allows users 
            to pan and to zoom in or out. The query may also be further refined 
            from the map display, on the club site only, by the user's drawing a 
        bounding box to restrict the returned matches by geographic area. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a><img src="wallis.fig2.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: a map display of records returned"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Figure 2. An example of a map display of records returned 
            from a search of the genus Macropus, a genus of kangaroos, on the OZCAM, 
            Australia's Fauna Web site, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ozcam.gov.au/">http://www.ozcam.gov.au</a>  
          </p>
      <p>Each point shown on the map represents one or more specimen records. 
            Points may be individually queried to drill down into the data records. 
            The map display also allows users to turn on and off various map layers, 
            which can include topographical or habitat features. If the map is drawn 
        <em>by species</em> the different species are also represented as layers 
            which can be turned on or off. A legend provides details of the numbers 
            of records returned per species or per institution and provides another 
        way to navigate from the map page into the data records. </p>
      <p>If users opt for results to be returned as data then they are presented 
            with a list of specimens matching their query.  At this point users 
            can select to view the specimen record of their choice. An example of 
        a specimen record is shown in Figure 3.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="wallis.fig3.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: an individual specimen record of Choerodon sugillatum"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Figure 3. An example of an individual specimen record 
        of Choerodon sugillatum, the Wedge-tailed tuskfish, on the OZCAM, Australia's 
        Fauna Web site, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ozcam.gov.au/">http://www.ozcam.gov.au</a></p>
      <p>As well as being able to view individual specimen records, users are 
            able to download data for specimen matches returned in their search. 
            The amount of data available to be downloaded is restricted in the public 
            site. These data are available in a number of formats: HTML, comma or 
            tilde separated values, text, DiGIR format and in the internal XML format 
        used by the KE Portal.</p>
      <h2>Technical Operation Of The Web Site</h2>
      <p>The technical infrastructure for the Australia's Fauna gateway is comprised 
            of a number of components: the KE Portal, KE Mapper, and a number of 
            'wrappers' hosted on institutional Web sites. The portal software can 
            communicate with any database engine capable of providing Web data. 
            Currently the system interfaces with KE EMu, KE Texpress, ORACLE, My 
            SQL, Access and other data sources. This provides a great deal of flexibility 
            for institutions to develop or retain their own institutional processes 
            and Web publishing protocols rather than being shoe-horned into a particular 
            database structure and methodology. This also allows the OZCAM, Australia's 
            Fauna to have  decentralized data sources and a distributed search model. 
            Data providers retain maximum control over their data and are easily 
            able to update their data. As well as supporting the custom wrappers, 
            the KE Portal also supports DiGIR data sources, allowing further connectivity 
        options.</p>
      <p>In a typical query, the user requests records via the search interface, 
            and the KE portal distributes this request to each data source concurrently 
            using HTTP GET or POST queries.  The wrappers are essentially middleware 
            that interpret queries from the KE portal, communicate with institutional 
            databases, and return XML documents containing specimen records.  These 
            XML documents are conformant with the OZCAM XML data schema which is 
            available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fanua.net.au/ozcam/schema/ozcam.xsd">http://www.fanua.net.au/ozcam/schema/ozcam.xsd</a>.  
        This schema describes a container format for the response and a record 
        format.  Each XML response provides descriptive information about the 
            repository hosted by the institution, the number of records available, 
            and any errors resulting from badly formed requests. The portal sorts 
            the data and presents the results. Each <em>thread</em> to a data source 
            has an arbitrary timeout (currently set at 45 seconds but can be changed 
            by the portal administrator). If the data source is timed out, the summary 
        of searched data sources will report the timeout.</p>
      <p>The record format returned by each wrapper is currently a subset of 
            the fields defined in the Darwin Core version 1.2 2003 standard (<a target="_blank" href="http://digir.net/schema/conceptual/darwin/2003/1.0/darwin2.xsd">http://digir.net/schema/conceptual/darwin/2003/1.0/darwin2.xsd</a>).  
        These fields were selected on the basis that all institutions would 
        be able to provide data for most, if not all fields. A planned development 
        to the gateway is to move to a new schema that incorporates the full 
        Darwin Core dataset for Darwin Core version 1.2 2003 as well as a number 
        of elements of the proposed Darwin Core 2 (<a target="_blank" href="http://darwincore.calacademy.org/DarwinCore2Draft.xsd/download">http://darwincore.calacademy.org/DarwinCore2Draft.xsd/download</a>).

          <h2>Future Developments For OZCAM, Australia's Fauna</h2>
          <p>One significant future development for the OZCAM, Australia's Fauna 
            gateway, as previously discussed, is to upgrade the data schema to full 
            Darwin Core. A second significant future development relates to the 
            portal itself. The aim and focus of KE EMu portal software development 
            has been to enable the portal to interoperate with other open standard 
            data sharing tools and protocols (e.g. DiGIR, OAI etc). This will allow 
            members of an EMu portal to participate in these other environments 
            without requiring them to set up separate interfaces: the EMu portal 
            would act as a 'proxy' for them when dealing with these systems. The 
            portal in effect will be able to present multiple <em>personalities</em> 
            to the world whilst having access to a common set of data sources.</p>
          <p>A related development is the facility to allow EMu portals to operate 
            in a hierarchical fashion (<em>daisy chaining</em>) so that a portal not 
            only can be a repository of several individual institutional data sources 
            but also can interrogate (or be interrogated by) other portals. As an 
            example, one portal may have direct contact with institutional data 
            sources within Australia (such as the current OZCAM, Australia's Fauna 
            system).  Another portal, such as the Australian GBIF node, may sit 
            further up the hierarchy and be able to treat the first portal as a 
            single data source. All of this functionality is dependent upon the 
            existence of open standards for sharing data, including data representation  
            (XML), communication protocols (e.g. SOAP, OAI, DiGIR etc), and data 
            description schemes (e.g. Dublin Core, Darwin Core etc).  </p>
          <p>A final future development is for OZCAM, Australia's Fauna to reference 
            a master names list for taxonomic names. Examples of such master names 
            lists are those collated by the <em>Species 2000</em> project (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sp2000.org/">http://www.sp2000.org/</a>) 
            or the Australian Faunal Directory collated by ABRS (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/online-resources/fauna/afd/index.html">http://www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/online-resources/fauna/afd/index.html</a>). 
            Taxonomic names often change as revisions and new scientific research 
            is being conducted. Having a single authority list of currently accepted 
            species names is much easier to maintain and update than multiple lists 
            kept by each data provider. </p>
          <h1>Conclusions</h1>
          <p>Natural sciences collections store a wealth of information; if only 
            it can be made accessible. Individual specimens and the data records 
            associated with them do not make compelling reading. However, when these 
            data can be aggregated and presented in a graphical format, such as 
            points plotted on a map, meanings about species abundance and distribution 
            can be drawn. This paper has discussed meaning-making for natural sciences 
            specimens using the OZCAM, Australia's Fauna gateway as an example. 
            This collaboration of Australian natural sciences institutions in presenting 
            their collections on-line represents a significant advance in how museums 
            can bring their 'dusty old specimens' back to life.</p>
