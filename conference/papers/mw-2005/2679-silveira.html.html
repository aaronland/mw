    <h1>Using Mobile Devices to Help Teachers and Students 
     during a Visit to a Museum</h1>
        <h2>Milene Silveira, Marcia Pinho, Adriano Gonella, Melina Herrmann, Patrick 
     Calvetti, Projeto <em>Mobile Museum, </em>     Faculdade de Informática, PUCRS, Ana Clair Bertoletti, and Mauricio Girardi, 
     Museu de Ciências e Tecnologia, Brazil</h2>
        <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
        <p id="abstract">This work presents an interactive system built to help 
     teachers and students during a museum visit. We also present the interaction 
     design process used to define the user interface. The system’s main 
     purpose is to help  elementary and high school teachers to plan their 
     students visit to a Museum. Using a portable device (Tablet-PC), the 
     teachers can define a visiting guide with a set of questions that their 
     students need to answer during the visit. The interaction was designed 
     with participation of the <em>PUCRS Science and Technology Museum</em> 
     staff and through many usability tests developed with the elementary 
     and high school teachers.</p>
        <p id="keywords">Keywords:  interaction design, Tablet-PC, user interface</p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Many museums around the world offer, besides the traditional exposition 
     areas, alternative exploration spaces where the visitor can <em>interact 
     </em>with <em>experiments</em>. In both cases the visitors can ask specialized people for help or can 
     use resources like folders, paper and audio guides in which they can 
     find detailed descriptions of museum pieces or rooms, while visiting 
          the museum. Presently, there are also some projects trying to create digital guides 
          with mobile devices in order to allow the visitors to more easily get 
          details from the museum pieces. These guides usually use texts, images 
          and videos to present these details [Aoki &amp; Woodruff, 2000; Kray &amp; Baus, 
          2003; Melchior, 2003].</p>
        <p>In order to explore this alternative to improve the visiting using 
          mobile devices, we developed an electronic guide to help teachers prepare 
          the visit of their students to a museum. This work presents the case study developed in the Science and Technology 
          Museum at PUCRS University (MCT, 2004), describing the interaction design 
          process used to build the system and the first users' impressions while 
          interacting with the system.</p>
        <h2>Case Study</h2>
        <p>We chose to develop this work at the Science and Technology Museum<em> 
          </em>(MCT)<em> </em>at the Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, 
          Brazil (PUCRS). This museum 
          is located inside the PUCRS Central Campus in a three-floor building 
          with an area of 12,500 square meters. The exposition area holds more 
          than 5000 pieces and 700 interactive experiments in areas like Physics, 
          Mathematics, Ecology, Astronomy, Medicine, Archeology and Informatics, 
          among others. Every day the MCT receives approximately 1,300 visitors 
          from Brazil and abroad, 80 
          % of them from elementary and middle school classes.</p>
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a><img src="silveira.fig1-small.jpg" width="400" height="266" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Partial view of the museum exposition area"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 1:  Partial view of the museum exposition area</p>
        <p>Currently, to access information about an experiment the visitor can 
          use various <strong>totems </strong>available inside the building. These 
          totems are equipped with a PC computer running a system with multimedia 
          information. Similar information from outside the museum, via the Internet, 
          is available on the SAGRES system (Bertoletti et al., 2001; Moraes et 
          al., 2001; SAGRES, 2004). This system allows users to browse the experiments 
          catalogue and to view museum research in order to plan their visits 
          in advance, from home or school.</p>
        <p>The project presented here aims to help the teachers plan their students' 
          visit <strong>inside</strong> the museum. To allow the teacher to access 
          information while walking around in the museum, we use HP Tablet PC<em> 
          </em>computers. The intrinsic mobility of this type of equipment allows 
          teachers to get detailed information about an experiment without having 
          to go to one of the totems inside the museum building.</p>

        <p class="caption">Fig 2: Tablet-PC device</p>
        <h2>The Interaction Design Process</h2>
        <p>In order to guide the interaction design process we adopted the method 
          presented by Barbosa (Barbosa et al., 2002), structuring the process 
          into the following five phases: Analysis, Construction of Interaction 
          Scenarios, Task Modeling, Interaction Modeling and Storyboard Definition 
          and Prototyping. Each of these phases is described in the following 
          sections.</p>
        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>During the first phase we collected and analyzed information about 
     the final users, the context (environment) where the system would be 
        used, and the tasks the users intended or needed to perform with the 
          system.  We completed this phase by attending meetings with the museum 
          staff and analyzing the museum environment during typical visiting days. 
          The first idea was to develop an electronic guide for museum visitors 
          based on the SAGRES system, but running on a Tablet-PC, adapting the 
          user interface to the new device and adding new functionalities to help 
          them during the visit. However, after some meetings and discussions 
          with the museum staff, we changed our focus to help the students, presenting 
          to them a list of questions that could be answered through interacting 
          with museum experiments. </p>
        <h2>Construction of Interaction Scenarios </h2>
        <p>Following the design methodology, during this phase it is necessary 
          to create the interaction scenarios; i.e. textual or pictorial descriptions 
          of real situations using the system, involving real or potential users, 
          process and data (Carroll et al, 1994). One of the main goals of this 
          phase is to clarify complex questions and to explore alternative project 
          decisions. </p>
        <p>Keeping the idea of creating a system to be used by students during 
          their visit to the museum, we elaborated 13 scenarios representing possible 
          user interaction situations. Among these situations we can enumerate 
          first contact with the device, device use by students, questions selection, 
          and questions definition. To better understand the scenario concept, 
          the following paragraphs illustrate the use of a set of questions by 
          a couple of users (students):</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">John and Barbara were chosen to use the portable 
          computer during the visit. Both love to use computers and usually spent 
          their afternoons surfing on the Web and chatting via instant messengers. 
          They had already heard about these portable computers and were very 
          excited about the opportunity to use them.</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">When they arrive at the museum, they follow the 
          teacher Carla to the reception desk, hear the instructions on how to 
          use the computer and what activity they have to perform, and receive 
          the computer previously reserved for them. They are very surprised at 
          the small size of the computer and at the use of a pen to interact with 
          it.</p>
        <p>After that, they select the appropriate questionnaire previously chosen 
          by their teacher, and see on the screen the image of the architectural 
          design of the museum, indicating the area to be visited in order to 
          answer the first questions. </p>
        <p>When they reach the third floor, they go straight to the area named 
          'Power and Movement'. There they read again the question presented by 
          the system and see that it is related to the ‘free falling movement' 
          subject. They search for the experiments related to this subject and 
          find a big pink wheel. John quickly decides to use the experiment, while 
          Barbara holds the Tablet. …</p>
        <p>Discussing theses scenarios and the alternatives for the interaction 
          process with museum staff, and furthermore, taking into account issues 
          like freedom of movement and security of the equipment, we changed our 
          system focus, deciding that it will be used by the teachers instead 
          of the students. </p>
        <p>The central idea now is that the teachers can use the Tablets inside 
          the museum and, getting detailed information about the experiments, 
          can build new questionnaires to be further used, in printed form, by 
          their students.   </p>
        <p>To build these questionnaires, the teacher gets a more detailed description 
          of an experiment and chooses any of the available questions for that 
          experiment. This process can be repeated for any one of the experiments, 
          allowing the teacher to build a customized questionnaire. Hence, the 
          teacher can make the students do a more focused visit to the museum 
          because they need to go to specific experiments.</p>
        <p>During this phase, the system goals are defined from the user's perspective. 
          To accomplish this, we defined the system state to be reached by the 
          user, the tasks needed  to reach this state, and the sequence of actions 
          that should be followed by the user to accomplish each of those tasks 
          (Preece, 1994). </p>
        <p>After deciding that the system focus was to create the questionnaires, 
          we refined each one of the scenarios and extracted from the system goals. 
          These goals were structured in a goal diagram that presents a global 
          view of the system, showing what can be done using the system. For each 
          goal, we also defined a task model that represents the necessary tasks 
          that must be performed to reach this specific goal, and the correct 
          sequence of actions that should be executed in order to complete each 
          one of the tasks. All these goals and tasks are defined through the 
          user's point of view.</p>
        <h2>Interaction Modeling</h2>
        <p>In this step we map from the tasks structure (represented by the task 
          models) to the possible interaction sequences the user should execute 
          in order to complete the tasks. In this case the interaction is viewed 
          as a conversation (a interactive discourse) representing the possible 
          communicative exchanges that may take place between users and the system 
          (Barbosa e Paula, 2003).</p>
        <p>After these discussions we defined the interaction model of the system, 
          describing all the possible paths that can be followed by the user while 
          interacting with the system. </p>
        <h2>Storyboard Definition and Prototyping </h2>
        <p>A storyboard is a sequence of drawings that represents the possible 
          states of the system interface during the interaction process. This 
          technique allows the exploration of alternatives to effectively implement 
          the interface project, considering the environment where the application 
          will be used. It also serves as an efficient communication tool between 
          the project team and the potential application user. The prototypes 
          are used for the same purpose, but, besides being built on a sheet of 
          paper, they can exist as real software that implements a reduced but 
          consistent number of system features (Preece et al., 1994).  </p>
        <p>In our project, after specifying the interaction model, the development 
          team decided to start building the prototype without creating the storyboards. 
        </p>
        <p>Concurrently with all these phases (the system interaction design), 
          we planned and implemented a database to store the data that will be 
          used by the system. </p>
        <h1>The Prototype: Visitors Support System </h1>
        <p>The Visitors Support System was designed to help teachers create customized 
          museum questionnaires for their students using a Tablet-PC. The system 
          allows the teachers to obtain detailed information about an experiment 
          and to choose one or more of the related questions available for each, 
          for inclusion in the customized visitor questionnaire. </p>
        <p>In a similar way, it is possible to choose these questions using other 
          search criteria, like the level of students (elementary, middle or high 
          school) or the subject (chemistry, math, physics, etc) it is related 
          to. It is also possible to view saved questionnaires  previously built 
          by the museum staff or by other teachers.</p>
        <p>In Figure 3, on the left side is the login system screen, and on the 
          right, the main system screen with the three possible ways to start 
          the interaction with the system: Experiments&nbsp;(<em>Experimentos</em>), 
          Questions&nbsp;(<em>Perguntas</em>) and Questionnaires&nbsp;(<em>Roteiros</em>).  
          (The system interface is written in Portuguese.)</p>
        <p class="caption" align="center"><img src="silveira.fig3-small.jpg" width="400" height="228" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Login and Main Screens"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 3:  Login and Main Screens</p>
        <p>In order to browse the experiments database, the user selects the museum 
          floor and the area where it is located on this floor. As a result, the 
          user will receive a list of all the experiments in the selected area 
          (Figure 4 - left side). Choosing one experiment from the list, the user 
          can get detailed information about it (Figure 4 - right side). This 
          information includes name, internal code, textual description and images.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="silveira.fig4-small.jpg" width="400" height="229" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: List of Experiments"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 4:  List of Experiments in an Area, and Experiment 
          Detailed Information</p>
        <p>For each experiment, the system offers the options <strong>Question 
          s</strong>(<em>Perguntas</em>) and <strong>Annotations</strong> (<em>Anotações</em>). 
          Using them, the user can, respectively, visualize the available questions 
          for the selected experiment (Figure 5 – left side) and take notes about 
          the experiment. This second feature is not implemented in the current 
          system version. Once the user selects a question, specific information 
          about it, like the related experiment and its localization, the text 
          of the question and its respective answers (Figure 5 - right side), 
          appears.  </p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="silveira.fig5-small.jpg" width="400" height="229" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Questions Available"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 5: Questions Available for the Experiment and Information 
          about a Question</p>
        <p>If the user concludes that the selected question is suitable for the 
          students, it can be added to the questionnaire being created (Figure 
          6 - left side). A complete questionnaire can be seen at (Figure 6 - 
          right side).</p>

        <p class="caption">Fig 6: Insertion of a Question in the Guide (a) and 
          Sample Guide (b)</p>
        <p>An alternative method can be used to create a questionnaire. The user 
          can access the saved questions directly from the big button (<em>Roteiros</em>) 
          available on the interior part of the screen. This is the method for 
          choosing questions through the school level or the subject instead of 
          the experiment (Figure 7 - left side). The same can be done for previously 
          created guides (Figure 7 - right side).</p>

        <p class="caption">Fig 7: Searching Questions and Guides</p>
        <p>After performing usability tests&nbsp;(that will be described in the 
          following section), we designed and implemented an alternative interface 
          for the system. In this interface, instead of using textual menus, the 
          user can choose the experiments from <em>maps</em> (Figure 8 - left 
          side) that represent the museum floors and from <em>images</em> of the 
          real experiments (Figure 8 - right side). </p>

          from Images</p>
        <h1 class="MWSection">Evaluating The System's Quality Of Use</h1>
        <p>While we were developing the prototype system, we also executed many 
          inspection evaluations of the quality of the use of the system; and 
          from the results, many successive refinements were implemented.</p>
        <p>After we finished the prototype and the first set of inspection evaluation, 
          the prototype was tested by the team of CPTS (Center for Software Testing). 
          This center was also created inside a partnership of HP Brazil R&amp;D 
          and the School of Informatics at PUCRS. At the end of the tests, just 
          five minor errors were found and quickly corrected.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, we concluded the prototype, and started planning the tests 
          to be executed with the final users (Figure 9).</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="silveira.fig9-small.jpg" width="400" height="231" border="0" alt="Photo: Real User"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 9: Real User Accessing the Questionnaire inside 
          the Museum</p>
        <p>The first tests were done using the text-only version of the system, 
          without the maps to guide user interaction. The selected area in the 
          museum was the third floor where the physics experiments are located, 
          because this was the area with the major number of experiments recorded 
          in the system.</p>
        <p>To make the tests easier, we choose as first users teachers and students 
          who already perform some kind of activities inside the museum. We separated 
          them into three different groups:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Group 1:</strong> last-year Biology students (four users);</li>
        <li> 
           <strong>Group 2:</strong> elementary, middle 
            and high school teachers and master students (five users);</li>
        <li> 
           <strong>Group 3:</strong> Faculty members 
            (professors) of PUCRS (four users).</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>All these users had basic computer skills and had at least one previous 
          visit to the museum.</p>
        <p>Inside the area chosen for the tests and according to the availability 
          of recorded questions we developed a set of seven activities (tasks) 
          to be performed. For each task a scenario was created in order to allow 
          the user to easily understand it.  For example, for the fourth task, 
          the scenario was the following:</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">One of your colleagues requested you to check how 
          many experiments are available in the system related to the subject 
          Fluids, in the third floor.</p>
        <p>As the tests were the first contact of these users with the system 
          and, moreover, the Tablet-PC was a new kind of device for all of them, 
          the tasks were very simple and required just the selection of system 
          options and the reading of information on screen. </p>
        <p>The tests were all made under supervision of a design team member and 
          all the interaction (navigation, menu selection, mouse movements, user 
          actions and system responses) was recorded with one-capture software.</p>
        <p>Besides the tests with the original version of the system, we also 
          tested (with new activities) the modified version that allows navigation 
          using maps. These new tests were developed with three new groups:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           <strong>Groups 1 and 2: </strong>undergraduate 
            students from different areas who worked as assistants in the museum 
            (four users in each group);  </li>
        <li><strong>Group 3: </strong>undergraduate students from Education who 
          were visiting the museum in order to create activities for students 
          (3 users).</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>All the tests were analyzed according to the communicability evaluation 
          (Prates et al., 2000). In this evaluation, specialists take videos and 
          the observers' annotations of the users’ interaction and then describe 
          each interaction, pointing out when the users seem to have any kind 
          of problem (phase of interaction tagging). The tagging is done through 
          communicability expressions equivalent to what the user would be 'saying' 
          at the exact moment of the interaction breakdown. For example, when 
          the user is browsing through the system menus searching for a specific 
          option (without finding it), the specialist uses the expression, 'Where 
          is it?'. </p>
        <p>The results obtained from these tests were used to implement new refinements 
          on the system interface. The main problems found during the tests were 
          related to the amount of information on the screen and the size of the 
          text used to display it in a small-screen device. </p>
        <p>In terms of usefulness, all the users said that they very much like 
          to use the system and that it will certainly facilitate the planning 
          of visits for their students, as can be seen from the comments made 
          to the observers. (In parentheses are the gender and the age of the 
          user.)</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>The thing I like most is the agility the system can provide, it’s 
          is very simple to use (male, 23)</em></li>
        <li><em>
           The system is very helpful for organizing 
            a task inside the museum. Before that it was necessary to see everything 
            to create my own new questions (male, 27)</em></li>
        <li><em>The thing I like most is that I can have many guided suggestions (female, 
          33)</em></li>
        <li><em>
           The new dynamic created with the software 
            can speed up the visit preparation (female, 37)</em></li>
        <li><em>
           The thing I like most is the interactivity. 
            I can keep the questionnaire with me (female, 37)</em></li>
        <li><em>
           I think that using the guide is very interesting 
            because it avoids dispersion and can make the visit more focused (male, 
            no age given)</em></li>
        <li><em>The system can stimulate the user to answer challenging questions. 
          This is what a museum visit is for (male, 55)</em></li>
        <li><em> The use of the Tablets can replace the manual 
            notes, with many advantages. The visitor doesn’t need to return to 
            the experiment to clarify a detail (male, 35)</em></li>
        <li><em>
           The system utilization helps the learning 
            process very much (male, 22)</em></li>
        <li><em>
           The system can provide a much more organized 
            visit (male, 23).</em></li>
      </ul>
      
        <h1>Final Remarks</h1>
        <p>After the conclusion of successive refinements of the Visitors Support 
          System, we are starting the use of the system with regular museum visitors, 
          focusing on teachers who  are coming to the museum for the first time 
          and need to prepare the visit for their students. </p>
        <p>We still have many difficulties to overcome, especially related to 
          the use of the technology by teachers. Some teachers from poor areas 
          of the countryside are afraid because they don't have very much contact 
          with new technologies, and some others, even having regular access to 
          computers, are still afraid because the equipment (the Tablet) seems 
          to be very expensive and they are afraid of damaging it.</p>
        <p>Concerning the questionnaire customization, a very important point 
          to be considered is that the questionnaire created by one teacher for 
          his/her students can be available to many others visitors and teachers. 
          Another import issue is that teachers can suggest new questions to the 
          database. This constant update of the questionnaires and questions also 
          allows teachers to collaborate with the community, and permits them 
          to bring their students to the museum many times in order to explore 
          the environment with different objectives.</p>
        <p>As future work we intend to explore the context (localization of the 
          user inside the museum) in the user interaction experience. We are also 
          already working on a version of the system to run in devices like PDAs 
          (Personal Digital Assistants), in order to facilitate the user’s movements 
          inside the museum.</p>
