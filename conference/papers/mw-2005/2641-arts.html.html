        <h1><em>Culture Around The Corner</em> And Its Location-Based Application</h1>
        <h2>Martijn Arts and Sophie Schoonhoven, ZaPPWeRK Creative Webdevelopment, 
          The Netherlands</h2>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cultuurindebuurt.nl/">http://www.cultuurindebuurt.nl</a></p>
      <h3 id="abstract">Abstract </h3>
        <p id="abstract">The Netherlands is a relatively small country. Museums 
          and cultural institutions are located within a small distance of each 
          other. Not just Amsterdam but the whole country has a high density of 
          art &amp; culture. This is unique worldwide. But in spite of the highly 
          concentrated offerings of museums, monuments and theatres in the Netherlands, 
          the Dutch seldom are aware that there is a cultural location or event 
          close to their home or office. They just pass it everyday without noticing. 
        </p>
        <p id="abstract">ZaPPWeRK initiated Culture around the Corner to make 
          people more aware of art/culture in their surroundings. Via this location-based 
          service, information about the nearest place of interest is sent to 
          users and received by mobile phone, PDA or Laptop. Users do not need 
          to enter their locations: this is detected automatically.</p>
        <p id="abstract">This non-profit project resulted in a national cultural 
          platform in which the Netherlands Department for Conservation, the Netherlands 
          Museums Association and the National Service for Archaeological Heritage 
          take part. Existing techniques are combined in a creative way. Up till 
          now location based services were not very common in the Netherlands.</p>
        <p id="abstract">The goal of the project is to achieve and maintain a 
          public database in which all Dutch cultural locations are stored. This 
          information is available without charge, for cultural and educational 
          purposes. Technology partners can use this platform in order to research 
          and develop new location-based services. All devices and all techniques 
          will be integrated, connected and tested. The functionalities will be 
          made available for cultural partners.</p>

        <h1>Introduction:  ZaPPWeRK</h1>
        <p>ZaPPWeRK is a Web communication and technology company based in Delft, 
          the Netherlands. We offer Web design, Web development, content management 
          systems, Web applications, hosting services and consultancy. Three students 
          from Delft University founded the company eight years ago, and it currently 
          employs 28 people (Web designers, programmers, project managers). ZaPPWeRK 
          mainly focuses on clients in the cultural and educational sector; for 
          example, museums, universities and governmental institutions. Once in 
          a while we start our own projects in order to experiment with new technologies 
          and to contribute to social/cultural issues. </p>
        <h1>How Does The Service Work<strong>?</strong></h1>
        <p>Cultural information is made accessible via mobile phone, PDA or Laptop.  
          To the mobile phone, information is sent via text messaging, and information 
          also can be found via mobile portals of Dutch Mobile phone companies. 
          The Web site <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.cultuurindebuurt.nl/">http://www.cultuurindebuurt.nl</a> can 
          be consulted via PDA and laptop (WIFI). Whatever instrument you use, 
          the system retrieves your position automatically and matches your location 
          with the location of the specified place of interest.  We also developed 
          a non-location based tool where the location of the person should be 
          entered manually. This is useful when the Web site on your home computer 
          is used, for instance. </p>
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1"></a><img src="arts.fig1.jpg" width="400" height="463" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Illustraton of the location based service"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 1. Illustration of the location based service</p>
        <h2>Text Messaging</h2>
        <p>It's very simple! The user texts <em>monument</em>, <em>museum</em>, 
          <em>theatre</em> or <em>archaeology</em> to a short number and within 
          seconds a text message is sent with information regarding the requested 
          item. Information consists of address, telephone number, opening hours 
          and some general information about the cultural place of interest. The 
          user can also dial a regular telephone number in order to get more information. 
          The computer reads the additional information and the number is mentioned 
          in the text message.    </p>
        <h2>Mobile Portals</h2>
        <p>When requesting information via the mobile portal of several Dutch 
          telecom companies, users can navigate via a menu on the mobile phone 
          to the nearest monuments or museums. After selection of one of the items 
          shown, a street map appears, together with the required information, 
          and users can navigate to the nearest monument or museum from where 
          they stand. </p>
        <h2>Laptop or Handheld</h2>
        <p>When the information is retrieved via laptop or handheld computer (PDA), 
          more information is sent to the user because of the unlimited amount 
          of data that can be shown on the screen.  </p>
        <h1>Content Partners</h1>
        <p>A lot of parties are involved in making this technically innovative 
          <strong>location-based service </strong>an outstanding success. The 
          Netherlands Department for Conservation (Rijksdienst voor de Monumentenzorg) 
          and The Netherlands Museums Association (Nederlandse Museum Vereniging) 
          supplied the locations of all monuments and museums. The equivalent 
          of Time Out Amsterdam delivers the theatres throughout the Netherlands, 
          and The National Service for Archaeological Heritage (Rijksdienst voor 
          Oudheidkundig Bodemonderzoek) is the owner of information about archaeological 
          heritage. </p>
        <p>Culture around the Corner combined these databases, 
          producing the biggest Dutch national platform with valuable cultural 
          location information. Apart from individual users, local governments 
          and travel agencies are really excited about the service and the content 
          offerings. </p>
        <h2>The Netherlands Museums Association (Nederlandse Museumvereniging, 
          NMV)<br /> 
          <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.museumvereniging.nl/">http://www.museumvereniging.nl</a></h2>
        <p><em>NMV </em>looks after the interests of the museum sector and acts 
          as the representative organ of Dutch museums. The NMV is also active 
          in stimulating knowledge and skills by organizing courses and workshops. 
          It initiates debates and policy development, gives advice, propagates 
          information and issues publications. In addition, the NMV offers marketing 
          support to museums and promotes museums in general. On 1 January 2003,the 
          NMV became publisher of the national museum card.</p>
        <h2>Netherlands Department for Conservation <br />
        <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.monumentenzorg.nl/">http://www.monumentenzorg.nl</a></h2>
        <p>The Netherlands Department for Conservation (RDMZ), established in 
          1947, is the central point for advice, research and know-how in the 
          field of monuments. Its most important task is the protection and conservation 
          of monuments. Not only historic buildings are protected, but also the 
          historical environment, such as townscapes and valuable landscapes. 
          This task is regulated in the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments 
          Act 1988. The RDMZ coordinates the knowledge of the built environment, 
          propagates it and stimulates a qualitative correct conservation of this 
          part of the cultural heritage. </p>
        <h2>The National Service for Archaeological Heritage <br />
        <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.archis.nl/">http://www.archis.nl</a></h2>
        <p> ROB, as its Dutch acronym goes, manages the nation's archaeological 
          heritage on behalf of the Minister of Education, Culture and Science. 
          Its mission is to 'give the future a past'.  Dutch Time Out</p>
        <p>The Dutch equivalent of <em>Time Out</em><em> Amsterdam</em> is famous 
          for its breadth and depth of coverage of reviews of movies and plays. 
          <em>The Dutch Time Out</em> Web site features daily news, over 1,000 
          reviews and unrivalled cinema listings.  (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.aub.nl/">http://www.aub.nl</a>)</p>
        <h1>Technological Partners &amp; Details</h1>
        <p>ZaPPWeRK started this project to investigate technical boundaries and 
          to address usability issues. The next steps are twofold: first, more 
          partners will be approached and databases will be added to enable the 
          users to have access to all kinds of information (e.g. cinemas, theatres) 
          and secondly, the technology will be perfected.     </p>
        <p>New and existing technologies are combined in one platform. The platform 
          used is called MARK. MARK is a ColdFusion programmed toolbox provided 
          with a content management module. This toolbox works via a SOAP protocol 
          in order to communicate with all connected Web services and performs 
          GIS functions such as the converting of zip codes into geo-coordinates. 
          Furthermore, it communicates periodically with the databases of the 
          content partners. </p>
        <p>The location of mobile phones is determined via detecting the cell-ID 
          in the mobile network. A GSM antenna detects the mobile phone and knows 
          the area the person is in. GSM network coverage exceeds 99% in urban 
          areas in the Netherlands, and therefore a mobile phone is always detected 
          by more than one antenna. We are now working on improving the accuracy 
          of the detected location by using triangulation. By comparing the intensity 
          of at least three different signals, the position can be precisely monitored. 
          After the location is specified, this location is matched with the information 
          that is required. </p>
        <p>The global positioning of PDA's and Laptops works slightly differently, 
          as GSM antennas cannot detect them. Some PDA's and laptops already have 
          a WIFI card (Wireless Fidelity). This card detects signals from 'wireless 
          access points'. These &quot;wireless access points&quot; are transmitters 
          which are usually based at offices, university buildings or other large 
          buildings. As soon as a PDA or laptop has contact with a wireless access 
          point, the user can enter the Internet. The wireless access points are 
          coded with a unique address (MAC), and this address is linked to the 
          geographic coordinates, enabling us to detect the position of the Internet 
          user. In a later version, stadium triangulation will be used, also with 
          WIFI location detection. </p>
        <p>At this moment the content of the connected databases (Microsoft SQL 
          Database server and Oracle 8.1.7 Database server) are temporarily migrated/copied 
          to one central database. In the near future, this periodic (automatic) 
          migration of databases will be replaced by a real time connection with 
          both databases. </p>

        <p class="caption">Fig 2. Structure of Culture around the Corner</p>
        <h2>Location Detection</h2>
        <p>Culture around the Corner and location detection works 
          for GSM and WIFI. Mobile phones connect to the nearest antenna. This 
          information is then entered in the network as the Cell-ID. The geo co-ordinates 
          of these Cell-IDs are known in the network. Vodafone and Telfort make 
          this information available for location-based services, other telecommunications 
          providers do not at this stage. The Culture around the Corner system 
          is therefore limited to Vodafone and Telfort users only (35% of all 
          Dutch mobile phone users). Other users can use the system but do not 
          have the advantage of having their location detected automatically and 
          have to type in the address manually. In the near future, all Dutch 
          operators will make this location information available, and therefore 
          our user base will grow fast.</p>
        <p>WIFI (Wireless Fidelity) is used more and more. As more and more individuals, 
          organizations and institutions buy hotspots, the WIFI network is becoming 
          denser and denser in the Netherlands. In some large Dutch cities, such 
          as Enschede and Leiden, local government has invested in a WIFI network 
          that covers the entire city. A PDA or laptop that connects through the 
          Internet by a hotspot can be detected in several ways; for instance, 
          by a WMA call or a server script installed on the hotspot. When our 
          system traces a client to a hotspot, the system looks in a public database 
          where all registered hotspots are stored with geo co-ordinates. Only 
          the registered hotspots can thus be used for localizing users. Together 
          with SURFnet, ZaPPWeRK is now building an open source database for storage 
          of all hotspots. In order for users to manage their visibility in the 
          WIFI, location detection users can use their Jabber software (open standard).   
        </p>
        <p>There are two other location detection technologies, GPS and RF-ID. 
          ZaPPWeRK is setting up two research and development projects to integrate 
          both these technologies. In addition to that, we are analyzing other 
          possibilities such as a python script that reads the Cell-ID client 
          side and a triangulation script that runs client side.</p>
        <h2>How Do We Import Data?</h2>
        <p>Several partners deliver the cultural data to us. For the pilot, this 
          was done by manual export and import. The data was exported in CSV, 
          following a predefined structure (see list 1). All values to attributes 
          that are filled in are processed by the system and stored in the database. 
          The data is enriched with geo co-ordinates or addresses by calling a 
          GIS-Web service. Points of interest (POIs) that are delivered with addresses 
          are enriched with longitudes and latitudes, and POIs with geo co-ordinates 
          are enriched with nearest addresses. </p>
        <p>This manual import is developed further into a periodical system. This 
          system uses a Web service to call a remote Web service in order to get 
          actual data. Some data is migrated, and other data remains on the remote 
          server that can be addressed by an external key. This system is prepared 
          for decentralized management of POIs using centrally available (location 
          based) Web services.  </p>

        <h2>GPS Based Searching On Own Web site</h2>
        <p>We would like to integrate GPS detection into this service. </p>
        <p>Internet-applications and Web sites are structured semantically. Users 
          click on keywords and navigate to other pieces of information. This 
          kind of navigation has been the only way to navigate through information 
          for quite some time. Besides this kind of navigation, location-based 
          navigation is becoming more and more common now, as location detection 
          and mobile devices are widely available. ZaPPWeRK believes that this 
          type of navigation will be very important for it is very user-friendly 
          if worked out properly. We therefore propagate the geo-enrichment of 
          content and promote this in the Netherlands in the project Culture around 
          the Corner. Geo-enrichment of data is a very simple process. An address 
          can be transformed into a geo co-ordinate (longitude and latitude) and 
          geo co-ordinates can be transformed into addresses. Geo-enriched data 
          can be visualized not only in lists and texts but also on geographic 
          maps and navigation systems. The geo-enrichment process is very simple 
          but the process of choosing and integrating the correct GIS-Web services 
          is complex as an increasing amount of services is becoming available.   
        </p>
        <h1>Funding Structure </h1>
        <p>Culture around the Corner is a project initiated by 
          ZaPPWeRK. ZaPPWeRK produced the concept itself: the design and the development 
          of the platform. SURFnet participated in making the concept work and 
          helped in doing the technical design. Both these initiators have funded 
          the project out of their R&amp;D budgets. Smaller but not insignificant 
          contributions have been made by the Netherlands Museums Association<em> 
          </em>and the Netherlands Department for Conservation. Together these 
          four financial contributions were enough to develop the system. Extensions 
          are developed with project budgets that are made available by (new) 
          partners that have specific requests. The ongoing costs consist of geo 
          coding, maps, Cell-IDs, text messages, hosting and ZaPPWeRK plans to 
          transform the project into a (non-profit) foundation during 2005. The 
          content-partners will be the editorial board of this foundation, the 
          financial contributors will take part in the advisory board, and a small 
          (part-time) operational staff will continue the business as usual. Other 
          organizations and institutions can easily participate if no commercial 
          goal is being served, and the government is more likely to subsidize 
          this foundation. Until that time, it will remain a project of ZaPPWeRK.</p>
        <h2>Revenues and Advantages</h2>
        <p>Culture is being made accessible for the general public in the Netherlands. 
          Lejo Schenk, director of the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, states: &quot;Culture 
          fits everyone and often one is not aware of the closeness of it. Through 
          this initiative people get a final push which is necessary.&#8221; and 
          &quot;it leads to more culture in the virtual cosmos&#8221;. </p>
        <p>The current content partners chose to participate because they want 
          people to experience culture in every possible way. Culture suffers 
          from a somewhat old-fashioned image, and by using fashionable communication 
          instruments, this image is improved radically. New potential customer 
          groups are reached and attracted. The location-based service stimulates 
          a totally different target group to visit a museum. Eventually this 
          service leads to an increase in the number of visitors. </p>
        <p>The data supplied by our content partners is enriched by geo-coding 
          locations. We match every zip code with longitude and latitude data, 
          and this information can be used for other purposes in future as well. 
          It also helps in archiving our Dutch monuments in a valuable way.  </p>
        <p>The service is free of charge and it should be highly accessible. The 
          advantage for the technical partners is the experience in using new 
          technologies and developing services. Investment efficiency is high 
          because of the shared costs between the cultural content providers.  
          Another advantage has been extensive cooperation within the Dutch cultural 
          sector. </p>
        <h1>Plans for the Future </h1>
        <h2>Voice service</h2>
        <p>A voice service is added in the new version of Culture around the Corner. 
          In the received text message, a telephone number is included, from which 
          people can get more spoken information about monuments or programming 
          in theatres and museums. The texts are generated by our computer which 
          is linked to the databases of the content partners. </p>
        <h2>GPS </h2>
        <p>Up until now we focused on the accessibility of the service by using 
          text messages as the main information instrument. The only problem that 
          occurs is that sometimes the location is not accurate enough, especially 
          outside urban areas. We will expand the service by adding GPS detection. 
          As in many countries, the capabilities of mobile phones rapidly increase, 
          and soon every phone will feature a GPS receiver.  </p>
        <h2>RF-ID</h2>
        <p>This goes for RF-ID as well. Radio frequency identification (RFID) 
          is a method of remotely storing and retrieving data using devices called 
          RFID tags. An RFID tag is a small object, such as an adhesive sticker, 
          that can be attached to or incorporated into a product. RFID tags contain 
          antennas to enable them to receive and respond to radio-frequency queries 
          from an RFID transceiver. This enables the determination of an exact 
          location. </p>
        <h2>Tourism and other purposes</h2>
        <p class="MsoBodyText2">The Dutch Tourist association is interested in 
          this service as it enhances the possibility of guided walks with a personal 
          mobile phone. Furthermore, the culture map can be integrated in all 
          municipal Web sites. </p>
        <p>The technical base of the service can be used easily for other non-cultural 
          institutions as well. The Dutch environmental organization would like 
          to use the service for (self)guided walks and for interaction between 
          nature lovers. Locations of just-spotted rare animals can be exchanged. 
          For this application, GPS is preferable. To promote sports in the Netherlands, 
          the NOC NSF is considering entering locations of sports locations.</p>
        <h1>Non-Profit Foundation</h1>
        <p>Culture around the Corner becomes a non-profit foundation by the end 
          of this year. The content partners are responsible for the quality of 
          the information, and that is why the future foundation chooses to work 
          with nationally established institutions. The project will be managed 
          and supervised by the foundation.  </p>
        <h2>Potential Involvement Of Individual Institutions</h2>
        <p>Culture around the Corner aims at being a national player distributing 
          and offering all cultural locations. Culture around the Corner does 
          not have an administrative office as it is a virtual organization. The 
          number of partner-contacts that can be maintained is therefore limited. 
          As a consequence, we don't have contact with individual institutions 
          but only with relevant 'umbrella' institutions. As the system 
          and all functionalities become more and more developed, we can make 
          the service available to individual institutions as well. These institutions 
          can manage and improve their own content, they can place the 'culture-map' 
          on their own Web sites and they can be part of a tourism city tour, 
          and much more. </p>
        <h2>Decentralization</h2>
        <p>Decentralized functionalities can be implemented in Web sites of individuals, 
          but currently this is realized manually. In the future this will be 
          done via an on-line shop. Then individual institutions can register 
          themselves, select their preferred service, and finish by paying for 
          using the service. Some individual institutions can offer other services 
          in payment for the use of our services. All is aimed at making as much 
          cultural information available as possible for a minimum costs to the 
          end-user. </p>
