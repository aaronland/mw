  <h1>Recontextualizing the Collection: Virtual Reconstruction, 
    Replacement, and Repatriation</h1>
  <h2>John Tolva, IBM, USA</h2>
        <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
        <p id="abstract">This paper addresses the evolution of the technologies 
          of virtual representation in the cultural milieu. Using IBM project 
          case studies from a decade of experience in this field, the paper brings 
          to the fore the ways in which these technologies both reify and challenge 
          traditional ideas of what a museum is or should be. The paper examines 
          the evolution of simple virtual representation (exemplified by the Hermitage 
          Museum project) to modeled reconstruction and deconstruction (exemplified 
          by the Digital Pietà project) and thence to virtual replacement of artifacts 
          <em>in situ</em> at their point of creation or discovery (exemplified 
          by the Eternal Egypt project). The paper concludes with a look forward 
          to the concept of virtual repatriation between countries and inter-organizational 
          'sharing' of artifacts between museums.</p>
        <p id="keywords">Keywords: virtual, reconstruction, replacement, repatriation,

  <h1>I. The Context of the Museum</h1>
  <p>Virtual reconstructions of archaeological sites and artifacts have become 
    commonplace in the cultural heritage domain. Repairing damaged works, re-erecting 
    structures, or providing conjectural models of items lost to history &#8211; there 
    are many examples of the ways in which virtual archaeology supplements and 
    enhances out understanding of cultural heritage. 
    However, new 3D scanning and modeling technologies, together with distributed 
    content management and enhanced methods for accessing these virtual representations, 
    have important consequences for museums, consequences that force us to confront 
    the nature of a museum as a collection of artifacts separate from the cultural-historical 
    matrix from which they originated.</p>
  <h2>1. Tools Of Representation</h2>
  <p>All museums are places of technologically-enhanced representation. At its 
    most fundamental level, a museum is a place for the re-presentation &#8211; the 
    presenting again &#8211; of something created, used, or identified with someplace 
    else. Many technologies or tools assist in this enterprise. Plate glass, cases, 
    framing, interior architecture, lighting, climate-control, and signage combine 
    to form a sometimes surprisingly high-tech, if mostly transparent, &quot;machine&quot; 
    for the presentation of a cultural artifact, artwork, or other exhibit. Certainly 
    more complex mechanisms exist. Interactive technologies both in physical space 
    and on-line enable museums to act as platforms for the creation of an experience 
    (Hein 2000). In the manner that a theater stage is a kind of machine for the 
    production of an experience or a run-time application is a virtual machine 
    for enabling lines of code to be actualized, the museum today operates as 
    an enabler of visitor experience. For many museums and cultural organizations, 
    this experience is made possible by providing context. But it has not always 
    been this way. As Brad Johnson puts it, </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">The user experience has crept from one 
    extreme to the other. From the Webmaster's directory structure full of data, 
    to the documentary filmmaker's online QuickTime narrative, the brief history 
    of the Web has offered users the full spectrum of intermediation. (Johnson 2003). </p>
  <p>One way of approaching the history of representation in museums is thus to 
    chart the development of the tools used to create context.</p>
  <p>Ironically, if extrapolated to extend to its intended target, the trajectory 
    of the intermediation Johnson mentions points to a complete technological 
    <em>dis</em>intermediation of the visitor experience: we want context to be 
    created in ways as transparent as plate glass. If a collection is artifact-based, 
    for example, visitors are far more likely to privilege the viewing of these 
    objects over reading or looking at secondary materials, though these materials 
    may be highly valuable. Thus the context-generating tools that work most effectively 
    in this scenario are today largely audio-based, enabling a 'heads-up' experience. 
    As another example, if an exhibit seeks to juxtapose present and past (as 
    many do), often a layering or augmentation of the physical artifact with virtual 
    information can be the most intuitively understandable method for delivering 
    contextual information. A last example &#8211; well-articulated in recent years 
    &#8211; is the 'technology' of storytelling. In drama, the <em>fourth wall</em> is 
    the tool used to foment suspension of disbelief, the ultimate 'transparent' 
    experience. It is similarly used in museum exhibits to help visitors make 
    personal connections, to target information to specific user groups, to compete 
    with other forms of entertainment, or merely to efface discontinuity between 
    elements in a collection. As such, narrative is arguably the greatest context-making 
    device in use in museums today. The twist is that in the virtualized museum 
    experience, the modes of interaction reach right through the fourth wall to 
    pull the visitors in closer.</p>
  <h2>2. Virtualized Experiences</h2>
  <p>The term <em>virtualized experience</em> is here used in the broadest sense. 
    Certainly on-line exhibits are contained in this term. But most experiences 
    inside the physical buildings we call museums have been virtualized to some 
    degree too. That is, even the most traditional museums have been technologically 
    augmented through a virtual representation of subject-matter. Informational 
    signage, detailed close-up images, audio guides, tour guides, even the easels 
    of artists allowed to study and replicate artwork inside the museum &#8211; these 
    are all low-tech re-presentations of the core collection. Even so, neither 
    the on-line museum nor its physically-embodied counterpart 
    are completely virtual museums: they retain aspects of one another. 
    But we may usefully call both <em>virtualized</em> entities. </p>
  <p>What are the characteristics of a virtualized cultural experience? Though 
    there are plenty of non-computer-based modes of virtualization, I will limit 
    the description here to those that are digital, multimedia, and interactive. 
    Likewise, the virtualization of museum services &#8211; on-line ticketing, on-line 
    shops, etc &#8211; though vital to the museum as a business, is not primarily concerned 
    with re-presenting the collection or providing context to the subject matter 
    and so will not be discussed here. Looking back on the last fifteen years 
    of cultural computing, we find certain trends emerge. The trends are philosophical 
    as much as technological and, though they are presented here in chronological 
    sequence, they are not linear in their development. There is considerable 
    overlap</p>
  <p>The first trend is that of strict representation. It is typified by on-line 
    collections and exhibits, the now-common CD-ROM-based or Web-based supplement 
    to a portion of the main physical collection. The origin of this form of virtualization 
    often can be found in preservation and documentation efforts that preceded 
    the emergence of multimedia end-user technologies of CD-ROM and the Web. Representation 
    in some form &#8211; usually the capture of two-dimensional images &#8211; is the overriding 
    task; 'bringing the collection to the world' or creating a 
    digital simulacra of the physical collection (though not necessarily 
    the <em>experience</em> of being in the physical space) is the goal. Representation 
    provides context mainly through description or by letting the flexibility 
    of on-line grouping and juxtaposition imply contextual relationships between 
    elements (Freedman 2003).</p>
  <p>The second trend is one of reconstruction. For at least the last ten years, 
    virtual archaeology and digital reconstruction of artifacts have been important 
    tools for the management and presentation of cultural heritage. This mode 
    of virtualization has a more complex goal than representation as it seeks 
    to show what no longer exists or what exists in a different state. As a mode 
    it is necessarily context-generating, adding a layer of interpretation and 
    even artistry to the pre-existing represented element. In more advanced types 
    of reconstructive virtualization, often termed augmented reality, the interpretive 
    layer co-exists with the physical element through projection on to the surface 
    of the element or by dynamic overlay in a semi-transparent head-mounted display. 
    Heavily dependent on three-dimensional imaging &#8211; either by direct scan or 
    by modeling &#8211; the computing requirements for this kind of virtualization are 
    non-trivial and often limit the degree to which it can be presented on the 
    Web.</p>
  <p>Presentation and preservation of artifacts in a physical museum setting necessarily 
    removes them from their original setting. It follows that a useful way to 
    provide a superior visitor experience is try to mitigate this decontextualization 
    by re-situating a collection in the milieu of its creation, usage, or discovery. 
    This third trend is defined as a replacement of museum artifacts <em>in situ</em>. 
    It is a component of virtual archaeology, though it differs from a purely 
    archaeological approach in how it capitalizes on the juxtaposition of the 
    current museum setting and information base with the re-placed setting and 
    information base. Being able to cross-reference the two, to choose one's type 
    of mediation, is where the most value in this mode of virtualization is to 
    be found. In addition to replacement, there is also a related mode of re-collection, 
    the bringing back together of elements from previous physical groupings of 
    elements. Examples of this include re-grouping virtually all the items found 
    together in a buried cache or recreating collections virtually according to 
    their presence in the collections of previous owners. Two-dimensional and 
    three-dimensional representation and reconstruction are the building blocks 
    for experiences such as these, but the real enabling technology is a flexible 
    content management system and presentation layer. When cultural elements &#8211; 
    people, places, and things &#8211; are represented digitally and stored in a systematic, 
    standardized way, the malleability of their presentation increases exponentially. 
    Certainly <em>in situ</em> replacement or re-collection can be achieved without 
    a centralized content management system, but the extensibility of such a virtualized 
    experience is greatly limited without one.</p>
  <p>The final mode concerns the creation of meta-museums through inter-organizational 
    sharing of content. It is no great leap technically to move from virtually-reorganized 
    collections to virtualized collections that span multiple institutions. A 
    distributed content management system is a prerequisite for such an experience 
    as it is the fulcrum that enables collaboration among different organizations. 
    The leap required is rather political since the nature of the technology is 
    to foreground the relationships between the cultural elements and <em>not</em> 
    the relationships of the elements to their current physical location and organization. 
    Trickier still is the concept of virtual repatriation, the bringing together 
    of cultural elements in the country of their provenance. The difficulties 
    come not only from the political issues surrounding the 'return' of objects 
    from one country to another, but also from the difficulty of reaching definitive, 
    scholarly consensus on a given object's actual provenance. Yet it is precisely 
    these difficulties that make meta-museums and virtual repatriation such effective 
    experiences. Combining high-fidelity representation, distributed content management 
    and workflow, and digital rights management, partner organizations can created 
    a virtualized experience that generates a whole new level of context for their 
    subject-matter. In many ways this focus away from a collection's physical 
    storage location is a focus on the needs of the end-user. Visitors desire 
    an experience of the subject matter unconcerned with the peculiarities of 
    any one institution's acquisitions history or classification scheme.</p>
  <h1>II. Evolution and Trends</h1>
  <p>The IBM Corporation has over a decade of experience working with cultural 
    organizations around the world. As a global technology and services provider 
    with broad resources at its disposal, IBM has brought a great diversity of 
    solutions to bear in the pursuit of virtualized experiences. Looking back 
    on selected projects over the past decade enables a more concrete understanding 
    of the emergence of the trends identified in the previous section. Far from 
    a deterministic survey of the field of cultural heritage informatics, these 
    case studies seek to show the interrelation of the technological and non-technological 
    aspects of the overall museum experience. This section concludes with a look 
    forward in an attempt to divine the next trend from those that precede and 
    will no doubt overlap it.</p>
  <h2>1. The Hermitage Museum Project</h2>
  <p>In 1997 the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, 
    and IBM embarked on a two-year project to develop three end-user applications 
    in support of the museum director's vision of the museum as it entered the 
    21st Century. The plan called for the development of a Web site 
    (<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/">http://www.hermitagemuseum.org</a>) built 
    upon a digital library database, an education and technology center featuring 
    multimedia courseware, and visitor information kiosks placed throughout the 
    museum. A repository of thousands of high resolution digital images from the 
    Hermitage collection formed the hub of the solution as it provided the management 
    system for the main content for each of these applications. To develop the 
    image archive, an image creation studio was outfitted with an IBM Pro/3000 
    scanner and accompanying processing system for retouching and derivative generation. 
  </p>
  <p>Upon launch in 1999, the project received accolades for the quality of its 
    digital imagery and the breadth of its functionality on the Web site. Visitors 
    to the site could (and still can, of course) perform keyword searches, assemble 
    complex searches, search by color and shape, or browse one of the twelve categories 
    of artifact. The taxonomy of the collection was fixed and hierarchical, built 
    for scaffolded knowledge acquisition, not serendipity (see figure 1).</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="tolva-figure1.jpg" width="347" height="414" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Artwork categories"/></p>      <p class="caption">Fig 1: Artwork categories of the Hermitage Museum Digital 
          Collection</p>
  <p>The digital images were by far the most important element of the user experience 
    on the Web site. Digitally watermarked images were available in two sizes 
    and via a Java-based zooming applet (see figure 2). Descriptive information 
    could be found further down the page while intra-collection relationships 
    were defined primarily by attribute similarity (same artist, same theme, etc).</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="tolva-figure2.jpg" width="276" height="376" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: High-resolution 'ZoomView' applet"/></p>      <p class="caption">Fig. 2: High-resolution 'ZoomView' applet</p>
  <p>From the beginning the project was representative in nature. That is, re-presenting 
    the Hermitage treasures digitally was the means to the end of opening the 
    museum to a global audience. Indeed, creating a digital proxy for the actual 
    museum &#8211; largely inaccessible to much of the West for so long &#8211; was an unstated 
    but pervasive goal. An extensive virtual tour from nearly every vantage point 
    was created for the palaces in which the collection is housed (see figure 
    3).</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="tolva-figure3.jpg" width="400" height="171" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Museum virtual tour floorplan"/></p>      <p class="caption">Fig. 3: Museum virtual tour floorplan showing panorama nodes</p>
  <p>Peering through the lens of the years since the project launched, it is apparent 
    how much of the development was suffused with 'archival' nomenclature: we 
    created a <em>Digital Collection </em>using <em>Digital Library</em> software 
    and afterwards published an article called <em>Populating the Hermitage Museum's 
    New Web Site</em> (Mintzer 2001). The design philosophy was very much one of 
    replicating a physical archive or repository. There is no value judgment implied 
    here. Digital archives are fundamental, necessary, and extremely useful. The 
    question is whether the archival nature of the project was just a reflection 
    of the needs of the museum or an outgrowth of a database-centric approach 
    to the project. It is difficult to say unequivocally. One way to approach 
    this question is to consider the possibility that the Hermitage Project is 
    an example of the first step in an evolution of virtualized experiences that 
    parallels changing attitudes towards visitor experience in general in the 
    larger museum community. Just as the notion of what a museum is has evolved 
    over the last two centuries from a <em>wunderkammer­</em>-like assemblage of 
    artifacts to its current incarnation as an interactive locus of self-directed 
    or explicit education, the Hermitage Project may represent the beginning of 
    the evolution of the virtualized museum from simple repository to a complex, 
    media-rich, story-based experience (Tolva and Martin 2004).</p>
  <h2>2. The Digital Pietà Project</h2>
  <p>The which-came-first question from the Hermitage &#8211; did the representational, 
    repository nature of the site grow from the database-centric design or vice 
    versa? &#8211; is easy to answer for the Digital Pietà Project (<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.research.ibm.com/pieta">http://www.research.ibm.com/pieta</a>). 
    The art historian Jack Wasserman approached IBM with a well-conceived idea 
    to scan Michelangelo's Florentine Pietà in three dimensions. Wasserman's goal 
    was both to enable a full documentation of the sculpture for posterity and 
    to permit him to test some of his own theories about the statue's creation 
    and re-creation. In short, the goal was to recontextualize the artifact through 
    a virtualized reconstruction. But the story of Michelangelo's sculpture was 
    one of deconstruction and reconstruction well before being virtually reconstructed 
    by IBM and Wasserman. We know that Michelangelo began the Florentine Pietà 
    in the 1550's, purportedly as his own tomb monument. What is not known is 
    why Michelangelo decided to break off parts of the sculpture before abandoning 
    it or why, shortly before dying, he permitted a student to repair and partially 
    finish the statue (Bernardini 2002). By producing 
    a detailed three-dimensional model, Wasserman hoped to validate his theories 
    about these questions (see figure 4). </p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="tolva-figure4.jpg" width="300" height="226" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Pietà model"/></p>      <p class="caption">Fig. 4: Pietà model showing the damaged and repaired segments 
          of the sculpture</p>
  <p>The <em>Digital Piet</em><em>à </em>project 
    exemplifies the trend identified as reconstructive virtualization. The three-dimensional 
    model achieved more than a representation of the stone sculpture (though this 
    accomplishment in itself is highly useful for measurement, analysis, and preservation). 
    Digital representation was merely the step which enabled manipulation of the 
    artifact, permitting Wasserman:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">to view the statue in the environment 
    Michelangelo intended, to examine it without the pieces Michelangelo removed, 
    and to analyze the detailed tool marks in the unfinished portion of the work 
    (Bernardini 2002)</p>
  <p> As a tool, digital reconstruction permits modes of inquiry that would not 
    be possible without virtualization, but it also represents a layer of interpretation 
    which may seem to be a 'thicker' type of mediation than simple representation. 
  </p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="tolva-figure5.jpg" width="337" height="448" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Pietà model"/></p>      <p class="caption">Fig. 5: Pietà model placed in an elevated niche as it might 
          have looked had it been completed and installed as a tomb monument</p>
  <p>The results of the project were published in 2002 with an accompanying CD-ROM permitting readers to manipulate 
    the digital model in a customized viewer application. In addition, a kiosk 
    presenting the IBM work and its part in Wasserman's study has been on display 
    in museums throughout the US and 
    Europe.</p>
  <h2>3. The Eternal Egypt Project</h2>
  <p>Though the <em>Digital Pietà Project</em> used a virtualized model to imagine 
    placements and environments that the sculpture might once have been intended 
    for or viewed in (see figure 5), replacement was not the primary goal of the 
    effort. A more comprehensive example of digital replacement of artifacts can 
    be found in the <em>Eternal Egypt Project</em> (<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.eternalegypt.org/">http://www.eternalegypt.org</a>), a collaboration 
    of the Egyptian Center for the Documentation of Cultural and Natural Heritage 
    (CultNat), the Supreme Council of Antiquities, and IBM, launched in 2003. 
    <em>Eternal Egypt</em> shared the same nominal goal as the <em>Hermitage </em>project 
    &#8211; to bring the cultural treasures to the world, virtually. Yet, from the beginning 
    <em>Eternal Egypt</em> was conceived not as a museum project but as a cultural 
    project for all of the country of Egypt. 
  </p>
  <p>Treating the country as a single museum had many consequences. First, the 
    project had to represent the cultural heritage of Egypt 
    across multiple millennia, using several thousand elements (artifacts, people, 
    places) submitted by over a dozen museums and archaeological 
    sites. Naturally a Web site was created to allow easy access to this information. 
    Unlike <em>the Hermitage's</em> use of artwork type categories as the primary 
    means of navigating the repository of information, the modes of exploration 
    on <em>Eternal Egypt</em> reflect the advance of technologies of Web presentation, 
    a more robust architecture of the user experience, and a belief that the relationships 
    between elements can often provide an effective navigation system. The project 
    used storytelling to ensure that the experience of the Web site was not one 
    of thousands of discrete, undifferentiated chunks of data. Narrative arcs 
    linked elements together into compelling threads, providing an organizational 
    undercarriage for the repository of data.</p>
  <p>The second consequence of building a project around the idea of a unified 
    cultural heritage was the need to create technologies that would bring the 
    stories and functionality of the Web site into the museums and archaeological 
    sites around Egypt as if they were part of one institution that the visitor 
    was merely strolling through. To this end, a PDA-based Digital Guide was deployed 
    in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo to deliver deep, on-demand context to artifacts 
    in its collection. Information from museums and places outside the Cairo museum 
    was used to explicate the collection contained within the museum walls. The 
    Digital Guide was also deployed for cellphone access so that visitors could 
    use their own devices and move out of one physical environment (the Cairo 
    museum, for instance) to anot her (say, the pyramids) on the same virtual 
    tour. </p>
  <p>The most important consequence of the country-as-museum philosophy was the 
    ability to use advanced scanning and presentation technologies to recontextualize 
    artifacts by placing them in their original 'found' state. The fullest example 
    of this in <em>Eternal Egypt</em> is the replacement of the artifacts from the 
    tomb of King Tutankhamun into a three-dimensional model of the now-empty tomb. 
    With the exception of an outer sarcophagus and the mummy of the king himself, 
    all the tomb's artifacts now physically reside in a few dozen rooms in the 
    Egyptian Museum in Cairo. When Howard Carter first discovered the tomb in 
    1922, he assiduously photographed the artifacts in the four small rooms and 
    descending corridor. (Enlarged versions of these stunning photos adorn the 
    galleries that contain the artifacts in the museum, a low-tech virtualization 
    of the space.) These photographs, together with the two- and three-dimensional 
    scans and models of the artifacts, enabled the project team to recreate the 
    tomb as Carter found it. On the Web site one may navigate the tomb virtual 
    environment from one of nine fixed vantage points. Browsing the collection 
    as it was found &#8211; and intended to be for all eternity &#8211; offers users a glimpse 
    into the functions of many of the artifacts (see figure 6). Statues are seen 
    to be 'guarding' doorways; sarcophagi are nested like matryoshka dolls; there 
    is evidence of an aborted tomb robbery. The replacement affords an entirely 
    new perspective on the artifacts on display in the glass cases of the museum.</p>

          Egyptian Museum in Cairo replaced in a virtual replica of the tomb in 
          the Valley of the Kings</p>
  <p>On the Web site, seamless transitioning from one node to another is not possible, 
    given the heavy computing burden of real-time 3D graphics and bandwidth limitations. 
    However, a kiosk version of the re-populated tomb has been developed, and 
    it does employ real-time rendering of the virtual environment. In the kiosk 
    version, users can explore the tomb any way they like, moving in almost any 
    direction. Closer inspection of artifacts is facilitated by a semi-transparent 
    overlay <em>card </em>that displays a subset of the information from the Web 
    site (see figure 7). This overlay functions as a kind of virtualized augmented 
    reality: you move about wherever you like and information is provided to you 
    in a heads-up manner. One can easily envision a system that uses this same 
    content and functionality to repopulate the actual, empty tomb using projection 
    or a head-mounted display.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="tolva-figure7.jpg" width="400" height="240" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Informational overlay from the kiosk version"/></p>      <p class="caption">Fig. 7: Informational overlay from the kiosk version of the 
          Tutankhamun virtual environment</p>
  <p>The recreated tomb of Tutankhamun is no more valid an organizational framework 
    than the actual collection in Cairo. There is no single virtualization that 
    offers all the context available. Yet there are certain 
    privileged perspectives. In the museum, the artifacts are arranged mainly 
    to permit the most visitors to experience them. Visitor throughput, issues 
    of collection protection and security, and some thematic groupings offer an 
    organizational framework inside the museum. In a virtualized museum, however, 
    this is but one of many possible frameworks. Technology has progressed to 
    a point where visitors are empowered to select from multiple context-generating 
    frameworks. With such tools at their disposal, visitors can synthesize their 
    own meaning by viewing cultural artifacts from multiple perspectives. </p>
  <h2>4. Future Directions: The <em>Flexhibit </em>Concept</h2>
  <p>Advanced content management systems and presentation technologies now enable 
    an almost endless re-collection of artifacts and artwork. When a collection 
    is partially or completely virtualized, it opens up a wide range of possibilities 
    for rethinking the within-the-walls nature of the museum. The <em>Guggenheim.com</em> 
    initiative, <em>Eternal Egypt</em>, and the <em>TryScience project</em> all use 
    digital content from multiple organizations to create a meta-museum. More 
    than portals to constituent organizations' sites, the best of these virtualized 
    museums actively integrate their content to create an experience greater than 
    the sum of its parts. </p>
  <p>The <em>Greater Palace Museum Project</em>, a newly-established partnership 
    of IBM and three museums in China 
    and Taiwan, will offer an opportunity 
    to explore the possibilities of a comprehensively re-collected set of artifacts 
    and artwork. Though the project is only in its beginning stages, the concept 
    is simple: to virtually bring together the collection of the former palaces 
    of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Displaced through invasion and conflict, 
    the treasures from the Forbidden City are now contained mainly at the Palace 
    Museum in Beijing, the Nanjing Museum in Nanjing, and the National Palace 
    Museum in Taipei. Geopolitical and institutional realities disallow a physical 
    re-collection of all these artifacts, but scanning and advanced 'in-museum' 
    display technologies point towards the rich context that a merger of physical 
    space and virtualized information will provide. Indeed, other institutions 
    with Qing- and Ming-era artifacts around the world can participate in the 
    virtual re-collection by way of a distributed content management system.</p>
  <p>At the heart of a system that can enable such an undertaking is the concept 
    of the <em>flexhibit,</em> a set of integrated tools for enabling truly configurable 
    virtual, real, and hybrid spaces. Because of the continuing evolution of the 
    story of a museum's collection, all of a museum's facilities (from the physical 
    space to the digital channels) must be able to adapt and respond to change. 
    The flexhibit provides a language for creating exhibits that can be experienced 
    across a range of installations. Modular, adaptive, story-based, exploratory, 
    and personalized, the flexhibit is the latest stage in the evolution of the 
    many trends &#8211; representation, reconstruction, replacement, and re-collection 
    &#8211; that have characterized virtualized museum development over the past decade. 
    Because none of these modes of virtualization provides a definitive perspective 
    on its subject matter, they have supplemented ,rather 
    than supplanted, one another. The goal of projects based on the flexhibit 
    concept is to provide as many contextual frameworks for the user/visitor as 
    possible.</p>
