        Through The Museums Of The Person</h1>

      <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">The Museum of the Person is an initiative 
            that emerged in São Paulo, Brazil, in 1991, aiming at building a virtual 
            museum whose collection includes life stories of all and every person 
            in society. To be a virtual museum developed as a network has been the 
            Museum of the Person's postulate from the start. The 1997 advent of 
            the Internet provided the idea with the tool needed for its expansion. 
            Since then the Museum of the Person has been open to receive stories, 
            documents, photographs and other data through the Internet (<a href="http://www.museudapessoa.net/" target="blank">http://www.museudapessoa.net</a>). 
      </p>
      <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">The presentation of that idea at 
            the MW1999 in New Orleans inspired the creation of the Museum of the 
            Person in Portugal (<a href="http://www.museu-da-pessoa.net/"
target="blank">http://www.museu-da-pessoa.net</a>), which is currently based at the University 
            of Minho. After that experience, other initiatives were started &#8211; 
        one in Bloomington, at Indiana University (<a
href="http://www.bloomington.in.us/~mop-i/index" target="blank">http://www.bloomington.in.us/~mop-i/index</a>) 
            and another one related to the Centre d'histoire de Montréal, Canada 
        (<a href="http://www.ville.montreal.qc.ca/chm/chm.htm"

      <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">Each center independently carries 
            out on-line and off-line activities, and each has distinct experiences. 
            During the session, from the viewpoint of those issues, the distinct 
            experiences will be presented and the audience will be invited to take 
        part, further discussing the issues and/or suggesting new ideas. </p>

      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>In 2003 a meeting of Museum of the Person centers took place in São 
        Paulo. Some key issues were pointed out: </p>
            <ul>
          <li>What is The Museum of the Person's methodological essence? </li>
          <li> 
             How can the collections be integrated 
              through metadata? </li>
          <li> 
             Which are the technological challenges 
              in order to integrate this and other similar efforts? </li>
          <li> 
             How can the effort be expanded? </li>
          <li> 
             What are the sustainability challenges? 
            </li>
          <li> 
             How is it possible to function as a network 
              and keep independence and connection between efforts? </li>
          <li> 
             Which is the cultural and social role 
              of Museums of the Person in the world? </li>

          <p>Joselita Cardoso was born in the Brazilian state of Bahia in 1960.  
            Her father, who came from the state of Pernambuco, was a small farmer 
            and her mother, also born in Bahia, was a housewife.  Her parents met 
            in Bahia’s capital Salvador, where he had migrated to in search of a 
            better life and started to do occasional work as an assistant mechanic 
            at a garage.  When Joselita was 13, her mother, who had a heart condition, 
            died suddenly.  She and her brother stayed with their father, who started 
            to drink heavily.  When she was 17, her father decided to move back 
            to Recife, in his native Pernambuco. There she decided to hop on a bus 
            and go back to Bahia secretly, where she started to live with a neighbour.  
            At 20 she got married and had her first child, a girl.  When she was 
            pregnant with her second child, her husband  was hit by a car.  She 
            went to the morgue to identify the body, and there she saw her father's 
            body and her husband's body in the same place.  She says: &quot;<em>I 
            was benumbed. I wouldn't eat, I wouldn't drink, all I would have was 
            coffee.  All I did was drinking coffee and smoking</em>".  Eleven months 
            later, Joselita lost her second child, still a baby.</p>
          <p>After a quarrel with her family, Joselita left her husband's home and, 
            surviving on people's help, ended up living and working at Salvador's 
            landfill, where, together with her daughter, she worked for several 
            years.  There she remarried and, still at the landfill, she had four 
            more children &#8211; only one of them at the hospital, because, according 
            to her: </p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">I worked until dark at the landfill and when I felt 
            the throes and went to the hospital, I was still dirty and stinking 
            with garbage.  The nuns looked at me and thought I was a beggar.  I'll 
            never forget that look.  I said &#8216;I work, I'm no beggar'.  After 
            that I never came back to the hospital, I gave birth to all my children 
            at home...  I didn't feel alright there.</p>
          <p>After Salvador's landfill was shut down in 2000, a non-government organization 
            helped the garbage catchers to found a cooperative to recycle.  Four 
            years later, with five children and two grandaughters, Joselita is the 
            leader of Salvador's garbage catchers cooperative, which gathers 50 
            catchers. She is a member of Brazil’s National Movement of Recyclable 
            Garbage Catchers.  Recycling involves over 600,000 people all over the 
            country and makes Brazil one of the world's recycling champions. Joselita 
            laughs:</p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">My dream? My dream is to work to organize the cooperative 
            in order to turn people into a new professional category. Because the 
            more we get to bring [in] those fellows that are out there in the streets, 
            the more the category will gain strength and the whole thing will grow 
            and be appreciated. What changed in my life after the movement? I don't 
            feel like society's garbage anymore.<em></em></p>
          <p>That story was recorded at the Museum of the Person on December 18, 
            2004, within a joint pilot project developed by the Museum of the Person 
            and the National Movement of Recyclable Garbage Catchers, sponsored 
            by Avina.  When the leader of the Movement learned of the work developed 
            by the Museum of the Person, his eyes twinkled. Based on the assumption 
            that each and every person can be part of social memory and that those 
            stories are, can be, and should be used as information to review our 
            reading of history and our way to see relations within our society, 
            the work carried out by the Museum of the Person matched the needs of 
            the National Movement of Recyclable Garbage Catchers.  An ex-alcoholic, 
            a paper catcher for several years, and founder of a recycling cooperative 
            in Poá, in the Greater São Paulo Area, Roberto Laureano da Rocha said: 
          </p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">That is exactly what we need. We need garbage catchers 
            to understand that they are not garbage, to be inspired by our own stories, 
            to mobilize and assert their role in society. We will record stories, 
            we will make a documentary, we will tell the rest of society who we 
            are. </p>
          <h1>Development of the Museum</h1>
          <p>The partnership has just begun, but that story was intrinsic to the 
            proposal that guided the creation and development of the Museum of the 
            Person, founded in São Paulo in 1991: how to allow other Joselitas the 
            possibility to narrate, preserve and, above all, convey their story. 
            How do we make that story help us review our biases? How do we make 
            that story and others help mobilization and organization of catchers 
            in our society?  How do we make that and other stories become part of 
            our intangible heritage at the same time that, by forming the identity 
            of today's Brazilians, it touches humankind's universal values.</p>
          <p>The Museum of the Person believes that promoting the construction of 
            a social memory open to narrative by people from all segments of society 
            and acting to spread that memory are essential to building a democratic 
            society based on respect for the other.  That stance is grounded on 
            some conceptual assumptions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> 
             Every life story has its value and should 
              be part of social memory;</li>
          <li> 
             Listening to others is essential in order 
              to respect them and to act as peers.</li>
        </ol>
         
          <p>Before the Internet became popular, we used to believe that common 
            people's narratives recorded in CD-ROM were important information sources 
            and should make up a significant collection to help rethink paradigms 
            of value that guide symbolic constructions in our society.  Thompson 
          &amp; Slim (1993) point out the importance of oral records to promote 
            social change:</p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">Whatever the outcome, it is important that the process 
            of listening does eventually result in acknowledgement and action, and 
            that those who have given up their time to talk, know that their words 
            have been taken seriously. This notion of applied oral testimony is 
            what gives the listening process a particular relevance to development 
            and differentiates it from a purely academic study.<em></em></p>
          <h1>Why Call Us Museums?</h1>
          <p>But why Museums of the Person? What characterizes our activities that 
            allows us to call them museums, and, more precisely, virtual museums? 
            Why have we not chosen memory centers or mere oral history archives? 
            A museum of the history of people is a museum whose museological goals 
            are stories themselves and those people's worldviews. Based on the symbolic 
            assumptions that guided the construction and function of museums in 
            our society &#8211; spaces for preservation of symbols (objects, narratives, 
            artifacts) of what we elect as &quot;monuments&quot; of our memory, 
            focusing on the perpetuation of those values, where we &quot;keep&quot; 
            what we consider meaningful &#8211; we collect our achievements, and 
            there is nothing more important than to review what we &quot;keep&quot;.  
          </p>
          <p>The proposals of the Museum of the Person comply with a museum's basic 
            activities: constitution and preservation of a collection; organization 
            of such collection aimed at social and cultural reflection; and museological 
            actions, more precisely those aimed at capturing statements and cultural 
            formation and mobilization of communities. However, that same view entails 
            the review of some musicological paradigms:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> 
             Instead of consolidating symbolic &quot;moments&quot;, 
              it consecrates common people's narratives and objects.</li>
          <li> 
             The role of the curator, of the collector, 
              is replaced by that of the mediator, since the aim is to encourage 
              people and communities to take responsibility for recording and organizing 
              their own memories.</li>
          <li> 
             To make the collection virtual without 
              necessarily having a physical counterpart, the collection is digital.  
              Actions are the ones to go beyond the digital domain.</li>
        </ol>
         
          <p>The Museum of the Person in Brazil is a virtual museum that since 1997 
            has been on the Internet open for each and every person to send his 
            or her story. Part of its collection is already available on-line. Together 
            with its Internet activity, the Museum of the Person in Brazil has developed, 
            for the last 13 years, an oral history methodology that allowed it to 
            record 4,931 life stories, besides production of 4 thematic museums, 
            20 books, 18 documentaries, and 24 exhibitions. Since the beginning, 
            the Museum of the Person Brazil has worked independently from Government, 
            using the oral history methodology and developing cultural, pedagogic, 
            and communication products as a way to raise funds. In 2003, the Museum 
            of the Person developed a new Internet Portal aimed at organizing all 
            its statements in a database, integrating those sent through the Internet, 
            and allowing users, besides sending in the stories, to assemble their 
            own exhibitions and story collections.</p>
          <h1>Challenges and Successes</h1>
          <p>In a country where less then 15% of the population has Internet access, 
            challenges to the dissemination of statements are multiple.  Therefore, 
            some efforts were developed that go beyond the Museum's Web activity.  
            The Walking Museum (traveling video recording booths), for instance, 
            has traveled the whole country recording people's statements in public 
            spaces such as subways stations, squares, schools and even oil platforms. 
            On the other hand, the perception that each person is a potential producer 
            and multiplier of memory led us to create training programs for technology 
            transfer. Project Local Memory is an example, since it involves teachers, 
            students, and technicians of Municipal Education Departments who have 
            worked for three years with people in their communities.  Nowadays, 
            Project Local Memory's assumptions are already part of History curricula 
            in some Brazilian cities.  The Project &#8211; based on three pillars: 
            reading, memory, and digital inclusion &#8211; trains teachers and pedagogic 
            coordinators to encourage children to build their stories as well as 
            those of their families, their neighborhoods, and their towns.  The 
            Project often means it is the first time a teacher or a child uses a 
            computer and sometimes the first opportunity for children to produce 
            their own texts.</p>
          <p>Another interesting experience developed in 2004 as a partnership with 
            Ashoka (<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.ashoka.org/">http://www.ashoka.org</a>) was the training of leadership 
            in civil society organizations. The proposal involved 9 institutions 
            that for a year took part in training activities, using the Museum of 
            the Person Portal's collection tools.  From patients' memory to training 
            of youngsters in a slum to promoting interviews with community elders, 
            each of the institutions identified a specific use for memory production 
            while taking responsibility for capturing and treating stories in their 
            community.  Therefore, the Museum of the Person Brazil has advanced 
            towards promoting a role as protagonist for every-man and inclusion 
            of multiple narratives in a common collection through proactive efforts.</p>
          <h1>The Museum of the Person Portugal</h1>
          <p>Inspired by that experience, after a meeting at <em>Museums and Web 
            99</em>, the Museum of the Person Portugal nucleus was born, linked 
            to University of Minho. Originally at the Computer Science Department, 
            the first motive was understanding that those narratives were an excellent 
            information source. Nevertheless, in order for all those narratives 
            to become information and, after they have been grasped, become knowledge, 
            we must catalogue and structure the whole Museum of the Person's collection 
            so that readers can explore all its potential &#8211; whether they are 
            only curious or are investigators.  That structure &#8211; which is 
            not necessary fixed &#8211; starts within life stories, where markup 
            techniques are applied in order to organize stories, identify people's 
            names, historical context, important dates, episodes, etc.  Only then 
            can people take advantage of that collection.  If it is no more than 
            a repository of stories, it will be like a museum's storage facility: 
            full of interesting things but rather inaccessible.  The Portuguese 
            nucleus, however, not only took an interest in technical issues; but 
            they were also willing to undergo the whole process of constituting 
            a team to develop memory projects. That experience is crucial to better 
            perceiving the reach of the Museum of the Person. In these five years, 
            the Portuguese nucleus has already developed 6 projects, collecting 
            150 life story interviews and promoting training actions for University 
            of Minho students as well as teachers of the public school network in 
            the northern Portuguese city of Braga.</p>
          <h2>The Idea Expands</h2>
          <p>Two institutions emerged right after that.  The nucleus of the Museum 
            of the Person in the USA, inspired by the same assumptions, was born 
            within Indiana University, in Bloomington (see Stafford, Philip B. 2005)</p>
          <p>The other initiative started in Canadá. The<em> Musée de la Personne</em> 
            in Montreal is the brainchild of the Centre d'histoire de Montréal's 
            (CHM) director Jean Francois Leclerc. One of CHM's main focuses has 
            always been to promote Montréal's diverse cultural heritage through 
            individual stories. Contact was initiated between Montréal and Sao Paulo 
            in 2003 by the CHM's director and local historian Marc Andre Delorme 
            (now director of the Musée de la personne de Montréal) who met the Brazilian 
            team at a workshop in Sao Paulo in Brazil. </p>
          <h1>Musée de la Personne (MDP) Canada</h1>
          <p>In 2003 a small team was formed, inspired by the CHM's exposition for 
            the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the arrival of the Portuguese in 
            Montreal: <em>Encontros</em><em>. The Portuguese Community. Neighbours 
            for 50 years.</em> The team managed to gather over 100 hours of audio 
            information, drawn from 70 interviews. Numerous artifacts and photos 
            were also collected. The event was called a Memory Clinic. The participants 
            responded tremendously with excitement and enthusiasm. The project was 
            so successful that a similar clinic was organized the following year 
            with the Haitian community of Montréal to commemorate the bicentennial 
            celebration of Haitian independence. </p>
          <p>From these fruitful and positive experiences, the non profit organization 
            <em>Musée de la Personne</em> (MDP) was officially created in 2004. 
            Seven people presently staff the museum. The organization already has 
            over 80 digitalized photos of artifacts and 100 recorded audio interviews 
            in the  archives <em>Musée de la Personne</em> collected during more 
            than 5 community benefit events.  Numerous other projects will be organized 
            this year to continue this work of cultural preservation.</p>
          <p> MDP of Montreal is one of the first to become a part of the growing 
            nucleus of institutions similar to the<em> Museu da Pessoa</em> on Sao 
            Paulo. The collaboration between these two organizations is a sign of 
            a growing trend towards a globally accessible museum which brings many 
            disparate cultures together. The <em>Musée de la Personne</em> believes 
            that documenting historical and cultural context behind individual experiences 
            is as important as, if not more important than, the collection of personal 
            memories and objects. How to make the stories understood by such different 
            people from so different historical and cultural backgrounds: that is 
            the question. There is indeed much work to be done in this venture. 
            But with the help of a growing number of people from all over the world, 
            perhaps the ultimate goal of preserving the collective memory of mankind 
            can be achieved.</p>
          <h1>Establishing a  Museum of the Person Network</h1>
          <p>With distinct experiences aligned to their origin and place of birth 
            and resulting from each country and team's context, today the Museum 
            of the Person nuclei's main challenge is the actual construction of 
            a network that can jointly:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> 
             Expand itself and widen the scope of the 
              work developed in each country;</li>
          <li> 
             Trigger new initiatives; </li>
          <li>Connect the information produced;</li>
          <li> 
             Align the actions in order to allow the 
              global use of life stories.</li>
        </ol>
         
          <p>Network-oriented management of knowledge produced by people themselves 
            aims at empowering communities, people, and schools as potential content 
            producers and users, carrying out actions that go beyond their own communities. 
            Those are premises that ground the constitution and the challenges of 
            all the Museum of the Person's nuclei, especially regarding our network 
            action. The assumption that the network is based on local Museum of 
            the Person nuclei is grounded on the perception that the collection 
            process is an essentially presential action and, besides being global, 
            is under strong influence by local cultures and processes.  Each person's 
            identity and the perception of cultural arrays that segment each activity 
            derive from empathy between producers and receptors, and that is what 
            guides the Museum of the Person in each place.  However, in order for 
            those stories, organized in a decentralized way, to go beyond their 
            boundaries, it is important that nuclei overcome communication challenges.  
            Besides sharing and integration by nuclei, it is necessary to share 
            experiences, to improve and adapt methodological aspects, and to reinforce 
            their own identities within the Museum of the Person brand. Regional 
            nuclei are autonomous to develop products that are adequate to the community 
            around them, but they have to share methodologies, experiences, and 
            institutional stances with the others.</p>
          <p>As the idea of how that network of museums of the person must be built 
            matures, it seems clear to us that the three main aspects are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> 
             Network management that allows independence 
              of each nucleus at the same time that it combines efforts in face 
              of common challenges;</li>
          <li> 
             Definition of actions that focus on the 
              use of the context produced and allow the best use of the collection 
              so as to integrate actions towards education, opinion formation, and 
              influence on public policies;</li>
          <li> 
             Creation of technological parameters that 
              allow the use of the collection in the most varied actions, together 
              with a large diversity of publics, thus going beyond the boundaries 
              of each nucleus.</li>
        </ol>
         
          <p>It is important that the story of someone like Joselita can be cross-compared 
            with so many others from all over the world to awaken desires for change. 
            Occasionally, some reading keys must be provided to those who do not 
            understand the codes used by Joselita. Her face or a picture of Salvador's 
            landfill, in turn, are easier to read in any place in the world.  That 
            technological challenge has to answer question such as:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
             Digital preservation of contents. Supports 
              (floppy disks, cassettes, etc.) deteriorate and have to be replaced 
              from time to time.  Content formats might become obsolete within a 
              short time and proprietary formats can suddenly lose their support.</li>
          <li>
             Compatible cataloguing/markup mechanisms. 
              While cataloguing can more or less be homogenized, making the markup 
              process by researchers from distinct nuclei uniform is a complex task 
            &#8211; because inside each nucleus there are stories collected within 
              different projects, with different scripts, and with different markup 
              demands. A possible solution &#8211; already rehearsed but not yet 
              assumed &#8211; is the construction of a local thesaurus that meets 
              the needs of each nucleus and then the construction of correspondences 
              between the terms of each nucleus/language so as to allow studies 
              about the several contents, e. g. the term marriage, whose concept 
              we know has distinct meanings from culture to culture.</li>
          <li>
             Integration of different media. In technological 
              terms, it is increasingly feasible to offer different media on the 
              Web. Given that there are already hundreds of hours of audio and video 
              within the Museum of the Person' archives, it is necessary to make 
              them available, as a whole or in part, thus creating the maximum synchrony 
              possible between audio, video, and photographs and their corresponding 
              narratives.</li>
          <li>
             Translation mechanisms. The Museum of 
              the Person's contents have a high linguistic value. The audio recording 
              of stories is also a very rich document, but only those who speak 
              the same language are able to capture those peculiarities. Some automatic 
              translation mechanisms will be tried in order to offer the contents 
              to a larger public, thus allowing people who do not understand the 
              statement's original language to read the stories.</li>
          <li>
             Virtual Museums: taking advantage of personalization 
              mechanisms. The Internet is no doubt becoming the cheapest means to 
              reach everyone. The challenge of publishing all that content on the 
              Web implies the creation of virtual museums that exploit as much as 
              possible the absence of the physical restrictions of traditional museums, 
              open 365 days a year. It will have to be easy to show the thematic 
              exhibitions integrating distinct contents that speak to a certain 
              controversy, subject, or event.  Those museums will also have to explore 
              as much as possible the possibility of keeping every visitor's trajectory 
              (stories read, subjects that were more often sought after, interests, 
              etc.), so as to suggest new contents every time that visitor enters 
              the Web site and is identified.</li>
        </ol>
        
          <p>The result of the sum of those efforts can be evaluated as Joselitas 
            from all over the world are able actually to be protagonists of their 
            stories, and those stories, together, help change the organization of 
            our global society.  As Burke (1992) points out:</p>
          <p>it is often said that history is written by the winners. It could also 
            be said that history is forgotten by the winners...  I would rather 
            see historians as guardians of disturbing facts, skeletons in the closet 
            of social memory…  </p>
          <p>To turn those memories into consolidated collections organized in virtual 
            museum networks is certainly to make the best use out of technologies 
          &#8211; those available and those that are to yet come &#8211; on behalf 
            of a more democratic view of our society. That is the real proposal 
            that justifies us and unifies us after all.<u></u></p>
