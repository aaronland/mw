  <h1>Using the Web to Support and Document New Media Collaboration</h1>
  <h2>J. Karen Parker, Banff New Media Institute, Canada</h2>
  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.banffcentre.ca/bnmi">http://www.banffcentre.ca/bnmi</a></p>
        <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="keywords" id="abstract">The Banff New Media Institute's endeavours 
          often involve collaborations with artists at other institutions. Historically, 
          such artistic collaborations were restricted mainly to telephone communication 
          and in-person visits. However, with the increasing pervasiveness of 
          the Internet, there are many more options and opportunities to connect 
          with artists from around the world. This paper presents case studies 
          of two such collaborations, both involving the use of on-line Web communities.</p>
        <p class="keywords" id="keywords">Keywords: new media, collaboration, artistic 
          research, Web-based communities</p>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>With the increasing use of the Internet in institutions around the world, 
    it has become a common medium for artistic collaboration. Unlike proprietary 
    collaborative tools (such as teleconferencing systems), the Web offers a common 
    platform, allowing users with different operating systems or Web browsers 
    to find a shared venue for their collaborations. The Banff New Media Institute 
    takes advantage of this venue to support collaborations with outside artists, 
    and also to help the people within their own walls communicate effectively.</p>
  <p>While they cannot replace the richness of face-to-face communication, on-line 
    Web communities are great tools for supporting collaboration. 
    Users can post discussions in forums, share files and other resources, and 
    even participate in real-time chats. Recently, we developed on-line communities 
    for two separate collaborations at the Banff New Media Institute. We present 
    case studies of these collaborations in the hopes of informing future use 
    of such tools in new media collaboration. </p>
  <h1>First Case Study: Supporting a Large, Distributed Research Group</h1>
  <h2>Project</h2>
  <p>As part of a grant based on collaboration studies in new media, the Banff 
    New Media Institute assembled a team of international artists and researchers. 
    In order to support the team's work, it was essential to have a central forum 
    for communication. We wanted to create an on-line environment where members 
    of the network could chat and share ideas, documents, links, and other resources.</p>
  <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
  <p>Members of our collaboration network came from a wide range of disciplines 
    &#8211; from engineering to art to social science. They also ranged in technical 
    ability: some were technology experts, while others barely knew the basics 
    of Web browsing.</p>
  <h2>Development</h2>
  <p>We first considered using a service such as Yahoo Groups (<a target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/">http://groups.yahoo.com</a>), 
    which allows users to set up free e-mail lists and discussion boards, as well 
    as share files and photos. While this is a quick and easy solution for setting 
    up an on-line community, it has several drawbacks. Your users must provide 
    their personal information to a third party, as well as view ads on the site 
    and in the discussion list e-mails. And since all of the content is hosted 
    by Yahoo, there is limited storage space available. As the message archives 
    and the files grow, available storage space quickly dwindles.</p>
  <p>Another alternative that we considered was the development of our own content 
    management system. Building such a system from the ground up would allow us 
    to tailor it to meet out specific needs, but would be time consuming. We needed 
    to set up our community quickly (ideally within a window of a couple weeks).</p>
  <p>An existing content management system (CMS) offered a happy medium between 
    the restrictiveness of a free third-party-hosted community and the time required 
    to development our own from scratch. There are many content management systems 
    available for people who wish to start an on-line community. In choosing a 
    CMS, it was important that it be easy for us to install and modify. We settled 
    on a CMS called Xoops (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.xoops.org/">http://www.xoops.org</a>), since 
    our Web administrators felt most comfortable with this system, and it offered 
    modules which would be useful for our community.</p>
  <p>Many CMS sites use a module system. Modules are site components that can 
    be easily added or removed depending on the needs of your community. Xoops 
    comes pre-installed with some basic modules such as Forums, Downloads, and 
    Links. The collaboration grant researchers were in many different time zones, 
    and some had more time to devote to collaborating than others. As such we 
    felt it was important to have some areas within the Web site for persistent 
    content: discussion forums allowed for ongoing discussions, while files and 
    links sections also allowed users to post content for other site members to 
    view at their leisure. However, there is also something very compelling about 
    real-time communication: a flash-based chat room module provided a real-time 
    component for our community.</p>
  <h2>Initial Site Use</h2>
  <p>Our main goal upon initially launching the site was to motivate the network 
    members to make use of it. In collaborations involving weekly conference calls 
    or in-person meetings, there is a certain amount of pressure for people to 
    show up, but there is less accountability with an on-line community; the researchers 
    could visit the site (or not) according to their own individual schedules. 
    Keeping this in mind, we opted to use occasional e-mail reminders to urge 
    our members to visit the site.</p>
  <p>We signed all of the network members up for the site and sent each person 
    a welcome e-mail with username, password, and information about the site. 
    A small subset of the network members began to use the site immediately, but 
    it quickly became obvious that the majority of the members were not making 
    use of the site, and many had not even logged in once!</p>
  <p>We compiled a list of the users who had never logged in and gently prodded 
    them with another e-mail "reminding" them of their username and password for 
    the site, in case they had forgotten them. Additionally, we sent a general 
    e-mail to all of the users, reminding them about our community site and stressing 
    the importance of using it in preparing for a series of upcoming in-person 
    workshops at a scheduled summit at Banff. By motivating the site with a purpose 
    (preparing for the summit) more users were drawn to log in and participate 
    in the on-line forums and chat, and activity picked up on the site. </p>
  <p>Adoption of the site was further helped by scheduled chats. Site moderators 
    invited users to participate in discussions - both on the forums and in the 
    chat room &#8211; during a fixed window of time. Given a specific time and goal, 
    users were more likely to visit the site.</p>
  <h2>From Distributed To Face-To-Face</h2>
  <p>Although the site was getting more use after our second blitz of information, 
    we still worried that some users were feeling intimidated or overwhelmed and 
    that this was preventing them from fully participating in the research.</p>
  <p>We hosted a weekend workshop in Banff for our network of collaboration researchers, 
    giving them a chance to meet the peers they had interacted with on the site. 
    The face-to-face time acted as a catalyst, with the workshop producing many 
    fruitful ideas. Observing the richness of the interactions at the workshop, 
    it was painfully obvious that we would never be able to duplicate such a setting 
    in our virtual environment.</p>
  <p>However, the face-to-face event did give us a unique opportunity to educate 
    our site users, and to elicit their feedback regarding our on-line community. 
    We went through each of the site's modules step-by-step, providing instruction 
    on their use and answering user questions. The session provided a lot of insight 
    into problems that we might otherwise never have discovered, and the ensuing 
    discussion helped us determine some key areas for improvements and make changes 
    to the site.</p>
  <h2>Current Site Use</h2>
  <p>After the workshop, users initially returned to the site with renewed interest. 
    However, the large user base made it difficult for everyone to participate 
    <em>together</em>, and the researchers were in fact interested in investigating 
    several different projects. As specific research projects emerged and sub-groups 
    formed, most of the research discussion moved to other venues (beyond the 
    Web site we built). While the community we developed is still a valuable tool 
    for communicating with all the researchers as a group, other more familiar 
    tools (e-mail, phone, instant messaging) have provided a better medium for 
    hashing out the details of specific research projects.</p>
  <h1>Second Case Study: Supporting a (Mostly) 
    Local New Media Team</h1>
  <h2>Project</h2>
  <p>Combining two grants received for development of mobile gaming and wearable 
    technology, the Banff New Media Institute (BNMI) brought together artists, 
    developers, and support staff in Banff to create several innovative new media 
    projects. Although the team members were mainly located within Banff, they 
    wanted a Web site to document their work and share ideas, as well as to facilitate 
    input from outside collaborators on the project (based in Montreal and Vancouver).</p>
  <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
  <p>Members of the team included graphic designers, fashion designers, computer 
    programmers, engineers, and a production coordinator. All were comfortable 
    working with basic Internet technology such as e-mail and chat, and some were 
    even experts in the field of Web design. All were located at the Banff New 
    Media Institute, but were dispersed through offices in two different buildings.</p>
  <h2>Development</h2>
  <p>Having learned from our work with Xoops in setting 
    up our previous Web-based community site, we had a better idea of what we 
    were getting into in setting up <em>this</em> community site. Additionally, 
    since the intended users were a relatively small group and were local, we 
    were able to consult with them in choosing a content management system to 
    suit their specific needs. A couple of users of our original Xoops 
    site had mentioned an alternative tool called Drupal 
    (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.drupal.org/">http://www.drupal.org</a>). Upon investigating, we decided it would be a good 
    fit for our needs.</p>
  <p>While we had used a default template with our first community site, the designers 
    who would be using this site were keen to tweak the interface to make it more 
    usable. One of the graphic designers on the team took the initiative and developed 
    a custom design. Converting the design into a Drupal-friendly template proved time consuming - much more 
    so than using one of the default designs - but was worthwhile in that it pleased 
    the team that would be using the site.</p>
  <p>Similarly to Xoops, Drupal uses modules to control content. As with our first 
    site, we outfitted this one with forum, files, and links modules. Because 
    this community was designed to support some very specific projects, we also 
    included an issue tracker which participants could easily use to keep track 
    of the current status of their project tasks. Since our users were local to 
    each other, we chose not to include a real-time chat module on this site. 
    In addition to telephone, all users adopted a common instant messaging platform 
    in order to communicate in real-time.</p>
  <h2>Site Use</h2>
  <p>Adoption of the site by our user team was swift, as it was a key component 
    in their project work. Team leads stressed the importance of using the forums 
    for discussion in order to keep a record of the work being done on the project, 
    and the files section provided a much-needed venue for the sharing of diagrams, 
    images, and other project documentation.</p>
  <p>Since everyone was in Banff, interactions on the site were supplemented by 
    weekly production meetings and also by smaller, more informal meetings of 
    team members. However, the site remained an important tool throughout the 
    design process.</p>
  <p>Feedback regarding the site happened both in the forums and at the weekly 
    meetings.  This allowed us to keep up with any problems or requests for changes, 
    and implement them quickly. The small number of users meant we were able to 
    implement most requested changes within a few days.</p>
  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>Our experiences in the above two case studies show that, while Web-based 
    communities are an invaluable tool for providing support for new media collaboration, 
    they will never replace the richness of face-to-face interpersonal interactions. 
    In considering such an environment for an artistic project, it is important 
    to consider the technology you have at hand, the group you will be supporting, 
    and the overall goal of the project.</p>
  <p>With little experience in on-line community building, setting up our first 
    community site required a great deal of research, and the entire development 
    process was a learning experience. When it came time to set up the second 
    community, our experience from the first site was invaluable. In both cases, 
    we had to consider our available resources - both technical expertise and 
    software tools - and select a system that was a good fit with these.</p>
  <p>The user group was also an important consideration. Our first site was designed 
    to support a large group of users with a wide range of backgrounds, and exploring 
    a wide range of topics. Our second site was tailored to a smaller, much more 
    focused group. , Thus it is no surprise that while with the first site it 
    was impossible to please everyone, with the second one we were better able 
    to fine-tune features to the group's liking. Smaller group size &#8211; in both 
    the second group, and in the sub-groups from our first community &#8211; also made 
    it easier for users to adopt a common platform for other tools (such as a 
    common instant messaging client) and subsequently move some or all of their 
    discussions to that platform.</p>
  <p>Finally, the goals of a project will also have some bearing on the success 
    of a community site. The goals for the research project which our first site 
    supported were very open-ended. While discussions on the site's forums provided 
    some initial ideas, it was not until the users met in person that they were 
    able to really bring these ideas to fruition. Conversely, the second community 
    site was developed for a project with some very specific goals, and supported 
    the journey to these goals quite well. Because they already had common goals, 
    the users were able to use the site to share their work and move towards their 
    completion.</p>
  <p>In the end, it was the combination of our previous experience and the very 
    goal-oriented nature of the project that made our second on-line community 
    a success.  Our case studies show that in developing on-line communities for 
    new media collaboration, it is important to provide clear goals for the community 
    users; these goals could be scheduled chats (as in our first case study) or 
    specific projects.  It is also important to note that with a larger user base, 
    as in our first case study, users have such a wide range of motivations and 
    experience that it is nearly impossible to get 100% buy-in.  Instead, focus 
    on supporting the users that do adopt the community.</p>
