        <h2>Dr. Ian E. Wilson, National Librarian and Archivist, Library and Archivist of Canada, Canada</h2>
		<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/">http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca</a></p>
        <h3>Welcoming remarks</h3>
        <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I appreciate your invitation and 
          the courage of the organizing committee in inviting a librarian and 
          archivist to have the last word in this 9th Museum and the Web Conference.  
        </p>
        <p>This is indeed a committed and dedicated audience, who as museologists, 
          librarians and archivists worldwide are making extraordinary efforts 
          and progress in bringing cultural resources and learning experiences 
          to as broad an audience as possible via the Web. </p>
        <p>I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to David Bearman and Jennifer 
          Trant for their initiative, perseverance and commitment in creating 
          this forum for us to meet, discuss and learn. This is a significant 
          contribution to our shared enterprise, sparking inspiration and discussion 
          that continues throughout the year from contacts and friendships established 
          here. They have inspired and enabled a global dialogue to advance this 
          field for all of us. Thank you.</p>
        <h3>On Gretzky &amp; goals</h3>
        <p>There are those who say that Canada's culture is hockey and that hockey 
          is Canada's culture. I'm not necessarily one of those, but I want to 
          begin with a reference to hockey and perhaps a lesson from hockey. Many 
          of you I trust will recognize the name of Wayne Gretzky, born in 1961, 
          and probably the greatest hockey player ever to lace on a pair of skates. 
          Wayne Gretzky is to hockey what Hank Aaron is to baseball, what Michael 
          Jordan is to basketball and what Pele is to soccer. It was said of Wayne 
          Gretzky that he had exceptional peripheral vision. He could see more 
          of the ice surface than other players and that allowed him to control 
          the flow of the game. Gretzky once described his great success as a 
          hockey player in the following way: &quot;I skate to where the puck 
          is going to be, not where it's been.&quot; </p>
        <p>I think that this sporting analogy is also a good one for cultural 
          organizations &mdash; skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it's 
          been. This is our challenge; this is my theme. </p>
        <h3>Library &amp; Archives Canada as knowledge institution</h3>
        <p>First, let me talk about my perspective from Library and Archives  
          Canada. We are Canada's newest and oldest cultural institution, combining 
          the former National Library established in 1953 and the former National 
          Archives established in 1872. We are also in the process of creating 
          the Portrait Gallery of Canada as an integral part of our new institution, 
          meaning that we now combine the roles and mandates of a major archives, 
          library, and museum.</p>
        <p>The legislation that brought us into being as the Library and Archives  
          Canada was passed just last year and I have the privilege of being Canada's 
          first librarian and archivist. I believe we're also the first country 
          in the world to fully integrate the services and functions of our national 
          library and national archives. This physical, organizational and functional 
          convergence was in response to evident and growing public expectation 
          regarding access to authoritative information about the Canadian experience. 
        </p>
        <p>The initiative to do this was very unusual in the federal bureaucracy. 
          Those who work in provincial, state or federal bureaucracies know the 
          inclination is to protect and defend turf. But the National Librarian 
          at the time, Roch Carrier, and I met and together we looked at our visions 
          and our plans, our shared values and our commitments; we looked at what 
          we were trying to achieve as librarians and archivists and said, &quot;We 
          can't explain to the public or to ourselves anymore why how we are different. 
          It's time the two institutions came together.&quot; We heard this from 
          students and from Canadians who want access to the extraordinary riches 
          we hold and who don't frankly care if something comes from a library 
          or an archive. I suspect they don't care if it comes from a museum either. 
          They want access to the stuff &mdash; a highly technical term so common to 
          all of our institutions. They want access to the content, the stuff.  
        </p>
        <p>In speaking with our staff, we were very clear, and this is not uncontroversial, 
          that our institutions had to focus on the needs of the public, not on 
          the internal professional interests of librarians and archivists. We 
          were challenging them and our colleagues in other information disciplines 
          &mdash; our conservators, systems experts and administrators &mdash; to serve 
          the public through the institutions. </p>
        <p>Our federal government announced the new institution in 2002 as a key 
          strategic initiative for the knowledge society of the 21st century. 
          Our vision and plan, our aims and efforts are not just to amalgamate 
          the library and archives &#8211; if that's all we do, it probably isn't 
          worth doing. The intent is not to simply put the two under one administration; 
          the intent is to create a new integrated institution, perhaps a new 
          type of knowledge based institution for the 21st century. The legislation 
          introduces the concept of Canada's &quot;documentary heritage&quot;, 
          a term defined to include all recorded information about Canada, from 
          print in all its forms, to film, to photos, to official administrative 
          records, manuscripts, sound and video recordings, stamps, documentary 
          art and the broad field of electronic media. Our mandate is fourfold:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           to ensure the systematic acquisition of the key 
            parts of this heritage, often in collaboration with other libraries 
            and archives;</li>
        <li>
           to ensure the proper preservation of this heritage;</li>
        <li>
           to describe this heritage for access by the general 
            public; and</li>
        <li>
           to make it accessible to all Canadians now and 
            long into the future. </li>
      </ul>
      
        <p>This is ambitious and it is a major challenge for our professions.  
          Can we make this, often fragile, largely unique heritage as accessible 
          and meaningful across the country as it is in Ottawa? This will take 
          time to become reality. </p>
        <p>Let me tell you a bit about the holdings of this institution because 
          in British terms we combine the British library and the national archives, 
          and we also combine some other functions. In American terms, we combine 
          some of roles of the Library of Congress, (but we focus exclusively 
          on Canada), of the National Archives and Records Administration, the 
          United States Portrait Gallery, together with some of the sound film 
          and moving image archives. Our combined institutions have now over 180 
          years of experience in the acquisition of documentary materials relating 
          to this country. </p>
        <h3>An extraordinary collection (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/">www.collectionscanada.gc.ca</a>)</h3>
        <p>Library and Archives Canada has inherited an extraordinary collection 
          that includes 19 million books and titles and 158 kilometres of records 
          &mdash; everything from official records of the Government of Canada, records 
          of wars, records from the private sector, of Canadian authors, writers, 
          artists, of Canadian businesses and business people, of unions and of 
          many voluntary associations and organizations. We preserve over 300,000 
          original works in our documentary art collection, providing an extensive 
          visual record of life and landscape prior to the invention of photography; 
          and we hold some 22 million photographs. This includes portraits of 
          about one million Canadians since 1710. We have the national music collection, 
          portions of which are online as the Virtual Gramophone. Over 50,000 
          titles of Canadian motion picture film from about 1900 can be found 
          in our holdings and a small selection of documentary films is available 
          online as the Virtual Silver Screen. Our very extensive stamp collection 
          is online and has won international awards as the best national philatelic 
          web site. And we have records from Canadian broadcasters back to the 
          origins of radio and television. In other words, it is an absolutely 
          extraordinary and original collection of multimedia information, including 
          all documentary media relating to this country. </p>
        <p>Our documentary holdings and the web are made for each other. We, particularly 
          the archivists, have struggled for years to take the rare, usually fragile 
          materials in their keeping to a broader audience, but the absolute imperative 
          of preservation has always limited such initiatives. The web is searching 
          for content and we've got it. </p>
        <h3>Settlers in web world</h3>
        <p>So, where are we going with all of this? There's a suggestion, a direction 
          that we have from Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who was Prime Minister of Canada 
          between 1896 and 1911. He was firmly engaged in nation building. Exactly 
          100 years ago, in 1905, when the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta 
          were created, Sir Wilfrid journeyed to Edmonton and spoke to the people 
          &mdash; largely immigrants &mdash; of that new province. This is what he said: 
        </p>
        <p> &quot;I see everywhere hope, calm resolution, courage, enthusiasm 
          to face all difficulties, to settle all problems. We do not anticipate, 
          and we do not want, that any individuals should forget the land of their 
          origin or their ancestors. Let them look to the past, but let them also 
          look to the future; let them look to the land of their ancestors, but 
          let them look also to the land of their children.&quot;<a name="1" id="1"></a>[<a href="#n1">1</a>]</p>
        <p>Laurier understood something about history that we are still wrestling 
          with today. He was making a statement about cultural continuity, bringing 
          together the past, present and future, bringing ancestors with their 
          overseas traditions together with the hopes of their children in the 
          new world. Laurier understood that history is not a fixed document or 
          narrative; it is a process of dialogue between and across generations. 
        </p>
        <p>The worldwide web is a powerful tool to foster that dialogue of the 
          past with the present and future, and the web enables the dialogue to 
          occur on a far more democratic basis than any of us ever dreamed possible 
          even a decade ago. I suggest that Laurier's comment also applies to 
          our various heritage institutions. We are &mdash; libraries, archives, museums 
          and galleries &#8211; all settlers in a new land, a web world. For the 
          last decade we have been exploring some of the frontiers, surveying 
          the landscape, testing the potential of this new land.  It has also 
          been testing us, our methodologies and our technologies, to respond 
          to its new realities. But while we remain firmly planted in the land 
          of our ancestors &mdash; those comfortable institutions and professional 
          assumptions in which we grew up and began our careers &mdash; we must also 
          look to the land of our children, the web world, and we need to address 
          the expectations and demands of this new land. </p>
        <h3>Where do we go from here?</h3>
        <p>I want to talk today about where we are going from here, especially 
          as it relates to our use of the web. The question that haunts me is 
          whether we are recreating, repeating and perpetuating online the institutional 
          walls, the boundaries and the practices that have developed and served 
          us well in the physical world. The web world has little patience with 
          institutional walls and boundaries, and even less patience with an information 
          priesthood that tries to insert itself between the inquirer and the 
          source material, or which seeks to limit direct access. If we were to 
          invent a new kind of heritage or knowledge institution solely for the 
          web &mdash; and you know implicitly we are actually doing that &mdash; what would 
          it look like? Should we not have some informed discussion of this development 
          rather than just letting it happen? Certainly, we need to respect and 
          carry forward the best elements of our ancestor institutions and professions. 
          By this I mean the curatorial commitment to the integrity of sources, 
          artifacts, documents, sites, books and paintings. We must carry that 
          respect forward and learn from our different approaches in structuring 
          information about our holdings. We have to respect the strengths and 
          unique contributions of our different information and curatorial disciplines. 
          We must maintain and convey the essential context of the source as authoritative 
          evidence, providing our guarantee of authenticity. We do not deal just 
          with fact or simple information, but with context. The full meaning 
          of the artifact, the archeological site, the furniture, or heritage 
          building, or a letter is to be found in the context of its design, creation, 
          or use. These are vital attributes of our materials. They give the tangible 
          item meaning and power as documented evidence of conditions, actions, 
          creative endeavours of those who have gone before. They constitute direct 
          links with past society, whether that past is yesterday or a millennium 
          ago. Maintaining and communicating these attributes with the item form 
          part of our professional core.</p>
        <p>The web can help us to expand and emphasize our notion of context in 
          all of our disciplines. The web enables us to recall that the past was 
          a holistic place &mdash; the document, artifact, painting, books, the historic 
          site, the photos existed together, informed each other and collectively 
          formed part of the holistic context of any historical action. The web 
          enables us to overcome the territorial boundaries that have arisen over 
          the decades &mdash; when we broke up the past, ripped it apart and put some 
          in museums and some in archives and libraries, some in historic sites. 
          The web can enable us to overcome those boundaries and reassemble the 
          past in web world. We can present the various forms of heritage or intellectual 
          materials in a connected way, adding to the understanding of the object, 
          its meaning, its context and its place in our story. We do not need 
          to merge our institutions to accomplish this, but we do need to develop 
          our institutional and national strategies in the web world to harmonize 
          search capabilities and ensure institutional walls are minimized.</p>
        <p>I don't pretend this is simple. Within our Library and Archives, researchers 
          have been required to gain access to certain resources through multiple 
          individual databases. We are working quickly towards a federated search 
          capability which will enable clients to search the union catalogue containing 
          38 million records of material held in 1,300 libraries, and 7 million 
          records spanning our archival collections and those of 200 archives 
          across the country. We are challenging ourselves to find new and user-friendly 
          ways to open up material. For example, we placed the 14 volumes of the 
          <em>Dictionary of Canadian Biography</em> online in both languages. We 
          now need to use it. Why not link it to the published biographies, to 
          the portraits, to the papers, to historic sites and monuments, to museum 
          collections related to each individual? Why not link the detailed and 
          well-written biographical sketches in the <em>Dictionary of Canadian 
          Biography</em><b> </b>and use them as one of the user-friendly access 
          points into all of our collections?</p>
        <h3><b>On Serving our Full Public</b></h3>
        <p>I recall when I was appointed as National Archivist in 1999, my first 
          meeting with our minister, the Honourable Sheila Copps, a politician 
          who was passionate about culture and cultural diversity. She brought 
          together the heads of all of our national curatorial institutions: the 
          museums, the galleries, the libraries and archives and she challenged 
          us to ask ourselves at the end of each day not what we did for our institutions, 
          but what had we accomplished that day for Canada. She was idealistic 
          and this was a essentially a question about institutional culture, &quot;What 
          did you do for Canada?&quot; Not, &quot;What did you do for your institution, 
          or what did you do for your profession?&quot; </p>
        <p>There are structural issues to be addressed. I know that the funding 
          for many museums depends in part on attendance. We need to educate funders 
          to understand the broader possibilities of the web in enabling more 
          of our citizens to access, use and enjoy our heritage resources, soon 
          perhaps employing virtual reality to tour exhibits. I suspect that some 
          museums are inhibited from making full use of the web to reach its full 
          potential audience when the funding model is decades out of date by 
          emphasizing the number of people who walk through the door. </p>
        <p>Library and Archives Canada has participated in several major inter-jurisdictional 
          web projects to make important content available. In doing so, we have 
          challenged our web page designers to respect and incorporate the visual 
          identity requirements of the various funders, several governments, universities 
          and research centres. The logos are there on the first page to satisfy 
          the participating partners, but I suspect most users ignore these entirely 
          and move directly to the content. And that's great. </p>
        <p>These resources long hidden in our institutions, the preserve of academics 
          and archivists and librarians, are now becoming part of the common social 
          memory and are being used. </p>
        <p>In fact, on one of the web sites that we developed in co-operation 
          with the Archives nationales de France, Québec, the Acadian archives 
          in Moncton and others &mdash; we have digitized some 1.2 million pages of 
          the original administrative records of New France. These are held in 
          France. We found that our predecessors in the 1880s and 1890s had visited 
          these archives and prepared detailed calendars of all of these key documents 
          and published them. So, we took those published detailed calendars and 
          linked them directly to the images of the pages. We recycled descriptive 
          work done more than a century ago and brought it forward into web world. 
          We're now talking to the Bibliothèque National de France and the Library 
          of Congress about expanding this web site, all focused on New France. 
          This project has opened up material for a whole range of research uses, 
          from academic studies to family history and genealogy. </p>
        <p>This web site is pointing the way and hinting at a far larger use of 
          the web than we had anticipated. In effect, what we are doing is reconstituting 
          the documentary heritage of a people, of a nation. Following the peace 
          treaty in 1763, all of these records were scattered to the four winds. 
          Three shiploads of records that went from Québec back to France, other 
          records fell into private hands and still others went to the United 
          States. What we can do online, for the first time, is to reconstitute 
          both the print and the unpublished documentary heritage of New France. 
          This is not just for research and reference, this is very much about 
          nation building and about understanding afresh our past as our society. 
          The web enables us to reconstruct materials which were once together 
          and which now need to come back together to properly understand a society. 
        </p>
        <p>In other projects of this sort, are our institutions mature enough 
          to share identity and ownership in endeavours important to our cultural 
          identity? Or can we only undertake projects where we say, &quot;That's 
          ours and I want my visual identity across the top?&quot; Or can we say, 
          &quot;The interests of our citizens are more important?&quot; </p>
        <h3><b>The Development of National Strategies</b></h3>
        <p>We have experienced a decade of experimentation, of development, of 
          innovation and of growth on the web. We've done the exploration phase; 
          we're now into the settlement phase. I think it's time to stand back 
          and to assess what has been accomplished individually and collectively 
          and to talk about where we want to go. </p>
        <p>What impacts have our collective efforts and the extraordinary riches 
          we have placed on the web had on our societies, at the community level, 
          at the national level, at the international level, on schools, on an 
          informed citizenry and on democratic participation? Can we yet ask what 
          is it we as institutions, individually and collectively, are trying 
          to accomplish? Is there a goal? Is there an end state? How far do we 
          want to go? </p>
        <p>When we ask government for money, what is our goal?  How much do we 
          need and what will our web presence look like in ten years? I've mentioned 
          50 million records online Library and Archives Canada. We have the national 
          bibliographic database, AMICUS. Many libraries in Alberta and Quebec 
          are digitizing collections. Google has of course announced with great 
          fanfare their intention to digitize entire libraries in the United States 
          and in the United Kingdom. What is our plan, or at least, what is our 
          vision for the curatorial institutions in web world?</p>
        <p> On the library side, we are beginning to study the feasibility of 
          a major project &mdash; the digitization of Canada's entire print heritage. 
          We have the bibliographic database to define the universe of material 
          involved. It is manageable. I would not want to try and do it for the 
          United States, but in the Canadian context, it is possible to digitize 
          all of our printed heritage since the 17th century. And we are looking 
          now at how to develop the technology for mass scanning of print material 
          in a production mode. We want to test the feasibility over the next 
          several months, cost the project over five years, consider the consortium 
          of libraries and other partners that are going to be necessary to do 
          it, and then assess whether such a visionary project is yet practicable.  
          This is far from clear as yet.</p>
        <p>It is a big idea with far reaching impacts on teaching and education, 
          on the understanding of Canada, on the reading public, and it will open 
          key resource material in new ways. It's going to provide the very foundation 
          for a knowledge society. We are already finding that simply by putting 
          print material online, digitized and searchable, Canadian history is 
          changing. New details are emerging which frankly were impossible to 
          find in the past. For example, many of you probably do not realize that 
          one of the burning issues in our history is where the first hockey game 
          was played in Canada. Two communities in Nova Scotia have been to court 
          in an effort to determine the location of the first hockey game in the 
          1840s. A researcher went to one of our web sites and typed in the word 
          'hockey' and found a reference to in obscure letter written by Sir John 
          Franklin during his Arctic expedition in 1827. In a letter written back 
          to Britain, Franklin said, &quot;My men were playing hockey yesterday.&quot;  
          This was in 1827 in what would become the Northwest Territories. We 
          publicized that and we immediately heard from those lawyers in Nova 
          Scotia saying, &quot;It couldn't have been hockey as we know it, it must 
          have been field hockey, they wouldn't have had skates.&quot; So we went 
          to another web site where we had access to the digitized journals of 
          Sir John Franklin. Here we found that on the day before he wrote the 
          letter, Franklin recorded in his journal, &quot;My men were skating on 
          the ice today.&quot;  Skating and ice &#8211; sounds like hockey to 
          me. </p>
        <p>At this point, it appears that Sir John Franklin's crew, in the British 
          Navy, played the first hockey game in Canada in the Northwest Territories. 
          The interesting point is that when he wrote to his correspondent in 
          Britain, the recipient understood the use of the word &#8216;hockey'. 
          So the debate continues. Maybe hockey wasn't invented in Canada.</p>
        <p>What an impact we would have on society if we could put all of our 
          printed information online &#8211; searchable, free and publicly accessible. 
          What an impact we would have on teaching and on research. I've done 
          historical research in newspapers. I've got my hands filthy going through 
          that mass of volumes, and I could never be certain that I had found 
          all the references to Sir John A. Macdonald or whatever subject I was 
          seeking. Digitized, OCR, available online &mdash; it's all possible. History 
          is going to change. This is all fundamental to developing a knowledge-based 
          society in this country. Do it once, do it well and we'll have long-term 
          impacts.</p>
        <p>On the archival side of our endeavours at Library and Archives Canada, 
          it is a much larger universe and much more diverse in terms of media. 
          We have been putting about a million pages per year online now, and 
          if we do it for 10 years we'll have something less than one per cent 
          of the national archives online. So we need a digital strategy that 
          is selective and focused on the needs of a diverse user community.  
          Following our recent discussions in the archival community, I think 
          we have a national consensus in the archival community on how we should 
          proceed with digitization. </p>
        <p>The first step is to tell Canadians what we have: to put online for 
          the first time our inventories with a high level description of our 
          collections, linked down into lower level and detailed descriptions. 
          The Canadian Council of Archives is leading this initiative, establishing 
          the standards, helping with training and encouraging archives across 
          the country. The collective guide to archives in Canada is perhaps 40% 
          complete and can be used at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.archivescanada.ca/">www.archivescanada.ca</a>. We are telling 
          Canadians what we have in a system which begins at the most general 
          level and which will eventually include more detailed descriptions. 
        </p>
        <p>Secondly, tell Canadians how to access documentation described in archivescanada. 
          There are many possibilities: inter-library loan of microfilm, through 
          photocopies, through a visit. This remains necessary because we cannot 
          digitize everything. Some of us are exploring new services suited to 
          a web environment, with perhaps a digital on demand service, or the 
          use of teleconferencing.</p>
        <p>The third step is to put online the more frequently used materials, 
          things of broad general interest &mdash; the war records, passenger lists, 
          Métis scrip, census records, key maps, some of the diaries of prime 
          ministers. The national stamp collection is already online. </p>
        <p>We can also use some of this material to develop exhibits. You may 
          remember Expo '67 in Montreal, the great world exposition. It was formative 
          for a generation of Canadians. Our creative folks really went to town 
          one day and they created the web site Expo 67 would have had if the 
          web had been invented in the 1960's &mdash; the music, sound, design, colours, 
          the texture. The exhibit is designed to suggest the breadth, depth and 
          variety of materials accessible and available on almost any subject 
          in the Canadian experience. </p>
        <p>The fifth part of our digital strategy is to develop educational materials 
          with modules that are linked to the curriculum. These could be used 
          in a self-contained form, but they could also serve as a guide to explore 
          in more detail, layer upon layer upon layer, what we have on our web 
          site for those students who want to go further. </p>
        <p>The sixth area in our strategy is to innovate and find new kinds of 
          access points. Simply automating archival description, or even a library 
          catalogue, is not sufficient. There are other ways of providing access 
          into our collections. </p>
        <p>These are some practical strategies that we are working on in the library 
          and archival communities. We know we need to focus; we can't digitize 
          everything, and we won't, certainly not in my lifetime. But there are 
          opportunities to open and make this material more widely accessible, 
          to enable research, working with many partners and with support from 
          many people.</p>
        <h3>History as first person singular</h3>
        <p>In her opening remarks to this conference, Eileen Sarkar, assistant 
          deputy minister in the Department of Canadian Heritage, emphasized three 
          challenges for us. One is the involvement of citizens and the challenge 
          to remove barriers, equalize opportunities and encourage people to take 
          an active role in cultural exploration and expression. Secondly, she 
          talked about the transformation of human experience and the role of 
          culture in provoking, inspiring and enabling that transformation. And 
          thirdly, she talked about the impact of museums in a creative society, 
          fostering knowledge, inspiration and innovation. These are broad social 
          goals and we need to be thinking of them when we talk about our new 
          presence on the web. </p>
        <p>How do we work together to achieve this citizen participation? We are 
          witnessing an extraordinary development in our web presence. The material 
          that we hold is extraordinarily detailed, it is granular. Academic historians 
          ignored much of it because they weren't interested, for example,  in 
          the personal details of 630,000 Canadians who served in the First World 
          War. But individual Canadians want to see great grandfather or great 
          grandmother's service record from that war. We hold this detailed material. 
          It was seldom used for many decades, but a vast number of people are 
          discovering these documents for the first time. Immigration records, 
          passenger lists, census records, war records, city directories, and 
          newspapers &mdash; they are all becoming accessible and increasingly searchable. 
        </p>
        <p>History is usually written in terms of general themes and we are all 
          familiar with the textbooks. But history can now also be written in 
          the first person singular &mdash; my family, my history, my community. Our 
          sources are deeply personal, and the web is enabling us to make these 
          accessible in ways that we couldn't even touch before because we (and 
          the documents) could never handle that kind of use. I don't know if 
          you realize it, but there is an explosion in genealogy.  Genealogists 
          are some of the most sophisticated web users I've yet found, and they're 
          also some of the most politically active web users. They played an essential 
          role in modifying copyright proposals in the 1990s and in securing legislation 
          to open the 1911 census for research. When the 1911 census went live 
          online this year, there were 15 downloads per second from our web site. 
          Genealogists, professional and amateur, are discovering that online 
          they can do history in the first person singular. The material they 
          seek is individualized and meaningful. They are going beyond and around 
          the history textbooks. </p>
        <p>Participation by individuals has also been encouraged by major investments 
          in networking. In Canada we have more than 3,000 public libraries &#8211; 
          more outlets than McDonald's. Public libraries are 100% networked. Studies 
          of information-seeking behaviour show that the first place people go 
          to look when they need information is the public library. Libraries 
          are also the main point of access for people who don't have their own 
          access to Internet. Our libraries are staffed by information professionals. 
          When I was responsible for the public library system in Ontario, a consultant 
          we were working with said, &quot;What you have here is a franchise system.&quot;  
          In a franchise, of course, the key is location, location and location. 
          Public libraries do have location. They are the heart of every town 
          in Canada, the United States, Great Britain and in many other countries. 
          The consultant's question was, &quot;What do you want to do with the 
          franchise? What's the product you're going to put out there?&quot; </p>
        <p>Certainly at Library and Archives Canada, we are making efforts to 
          ensure that the reference librarians in each of those public libraries 
          know about our services and collections, and know how to find their 
          way around our web site. We want them to know how to use us, our limitations 
          and our capacity. Do museums routinely work with public libraries? They 
          are networked and they are in touch with the public and that's how we 
          get citizen participation. </p>
        <h3>The transformative experience</h3>
        <p>Eileen Sarkar talked about the transformative experience. At Library 
          and Archives, our legislation was proclaimed on a Friday in May 2004. 
          On the following Monday morning we had a full staff meeting just to 
          talk about this with all of our staff. By chance, the Lieutenant Governor 
          of Ontario, The Honourable James Bartleman, was in our building to complete 
          research for a book he was soon to publish. When I saw him, I asked 
          him to say a few words to our staff. Mr. Bartleman said he was not prepared, 
          but that he would talk for a minute or two. He finished a full 20 minutes 
          later, and what he told us was a most extraordinary story of transformative 
          experience. He is an individual of aboriginal background. He said that 
          he grew up beside the town dump in Port Carling, a very small town in 
          Ontario. As an aboriginal person he had no future and no prospects. 
          The one thing that allowed him to escape from this dismal environment 
          was the public library. He discovered the library's riches, he read 
          his way through it, and he went on to an absolutely extraordinary career 
          as a Canadian ambassador, a foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, 
          and now the Queen's representative in Ontario. He's an extraordinary 
          individual and he gave a most powerful statement to our staff about 
          the transformational impact of good library service. That was a key 
          founding message for our new institution.</p>
        <p>My question to our staff was, &quot;How do we take something like this 
          to the web? How do we share this, particularly with our aboriginal communities 
          across northern, Canada? How do we get that experience out there and 
          open the world of knowledge and learning to them?&quot;</p>
        <p>At Library and Archives Canada we have an initiative called &quot;Project 
          Naming&quot;. We have several thousand photographs that were taken in 
          the High Arctic in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, and we realizes that 
          the individuals in these photographs were often identified as &quot;Captain 
          Jones and five Eskimaux&quot;, or some such description. The Inuit individuals 
          had no identity; they were just part of the landscape. So, we initiated 
          a project &mdash; we digitized the photographs and sent them to high schools 
          in the new Territory of Nunavut. We invited the students to talk with 
          their elders, and using the digitized images, identify the individuals 
          in the photographs; our success rate is about 75%. In the process, this 
          is giving students and elders an opportunity to talk about a way of 
          life that has essentially disappeared. </p>
        <p>We're giving back an identity. I had one of the elders come to Ottawa 
          and she was going through a number of these photographs online. Suddenly 
          she said, &quot;Stop.&quot; There was a photograph of her father when 
          he was in his 20s. He had died 30 years earlier and she was tremendously 
          moved by the photo. That is just a hint of the power contain ed in our 
          material. </p>
        <p>Recently, we launched another web site called the Aboriginal Healing 
          Foundation. One of the black marks in Canadian history is the residential 
          school system, where young native students were removed from their homes 
          and placed in residential schools and taught European ways. They lost 
          their language, their identity and their families. Canadian society 
          is recognizing this and is in the process of providing compensation, 
          a process, I believe, of truth and reconciliation. We created a travelling 
          exhibit and it's also online. It is used now in teaching programs across 
          the country. There is power in the records that we hold, which goes 
          well beyond straight information. If you really want to know about the 
          material we hold in our institutions &mdash; libraries, archives, and museums 
          &mdash; it's very much about identity, about who we are. It is knowledge 
          of our collective experience as a society and a record of how we lived 
          and worked together. </p>
        <p>This leads to the third point Eileen Sarkar was making &#8211; about 
          the creative impact of our institutions. We can put the past back together 
          again, enabling it to be understood in all its dimensions and complexity, 
          and enabling us to understand our population in all of its diversity. 
          Ours is very much a multicultural society, and our role in our various 
          information disciplines is to transform information into knowledge. 
        </p>
        <h3>Electronic democracy &amp; convergence</h3>
        <p>I would add a fourth point to what Eileen Sarkar talked about, and 
          that is electronic democracy. I think part of our role is a responsibility 
          to serve an informed electorate. In fact, the preamble to our legislation 
          says that  Library and Archives Canada must contribute to and promote 
          the advancement of Canada as a free and democratic society. The records 
          of government, access to reports, access to critiques of government 
          and access to newspapers and broadcasts helps to ensure the continuation 
          of a free and democratic society. </p>
        <p>We're also a key public institution assisting government with what 
          is commonly referred to as &quot;Government Online&quot;. So far this 
          effort is focused on how to automate the transactional services of the 
          federal government. Canada has won a series of awards over the years 
          for developing online services for our citizens and integrating these 
          federally, provincially and municipally. It is interesting that the 
          original direction of Government Online was not just transactional services 
          &mdash; because if government is only about transactional services there 
          were a couple of governments in the 1930's who made the trains run on 
          time. That's not the model we want for a free and democratic society. 
          We need an informed electorate and we need information in their hands. 
          We need to think about this in our institutions &mdash; if we change the 
          basic means of communication between society, citizenry and government, 
          how does that change society itself? How does a fully transparent democracy 
          change government and governance? There are many things happening on 
          this front, and I believe our institutions understand it best. </p>
        <p>Another challenge that I'll mention briefly is the issue of preservation 
          of the web. Our recent legislation provides authority for us to download 
          sites of Canadian interest for preservation. Libraries and archives 
          in other countries &mdash; Scandinavia, France, the United States and Australia  
          &mdash; are in the forefront on this. We have begun to retain certain key 
          sites, developing criteria for the future and working closely with the 
          Canadian Culture Online Program in developing this approach. </p>
        <h3><b>Phenomenal possibilities  </b></h3>
        <p>There are phenomenal possibilities before us. Perhaps it is time for 
          us to pause briefly, to think and talk about these possibilities, to 
          look at the road ahead. Are we simply going to let it evolve like topsy? 
          What are our institutional, professional and national strategies in 
          developing our web presences in our institutions, libraries, archives 
          and museums? These are places of memory in society. We hold the authentic 
          material required for memory to come in contact with people so that 
          it becomes knowledge. </p>
        <p>Our cultural institutions are places where we celebrate, we commemorate, 
          we laugh, we mourn, and sometimes we cry &mdash; but we also learn from the 
          experiences of those who have gone before us. Our institutions are places 
          that allow us to understand the past honestly so that we can commit 
          ourselves to change the future. </p>
        <p>The footage we saw at this conference yesterday on the aftermath of 
          the atomic bomb in Hiroshima is part of that kind of determination. 
          Our institutions, more specifically our collections and our expertise, 
          are vital to communication in a knowledge society. We are very much 
          about communication in the fourth dimension, communication over time. 
          Every society, every generation must engage in dialogue with its inherited 
          past. Each generation asks new questions of that past, seeking the experience 
          and wisdom needed for the challenges of its present and its future. 
        </p>
        <p>Playwrights, poets, novelists, film and television producers, storytellers, 
          writers, teachers &mdash; all use the accumulated knowledge and experience 
          of a civilized society to provide fresh insights and interpretations. 
          Through their words, images and voices, the hopes and disappointments 
          of earlier generations live on to inspire and challenge. Our collective 
          and growing presence on the web enables citizens to play an active and 
          important role in reshaping our past. </p>
        <p>One of my predecessors, the first archivist in Canada, Douglas Brymner, 
          was invited to speak to the American Historical Association in 1888. 
          He had three basement rooms in an office building in Ottawa, but he 
          talked about his ambition for the archives: about a storehouse of information 
          about this country in all forms and all media. </p>
        <p>He observed that &quot;It may be a dream, but it is a noble dream. It 
          has often spurred me to renewed effort, when the daily drudgery, for 
          it is drudgery, was telling on mind and body.&quot;<a name="2" id="2"></a>[<a href="#n2">2</a>]  We need a similar 
          noble dream for web world, one we can define and achieve together.
