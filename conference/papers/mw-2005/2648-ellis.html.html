      <h3 class="AbstractTitle" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">The Science Museum, London, recently 
            opened a new building - the Dana Centre - dedicated to the dialogue 
            between public and scientists. The building has allowed us to create 
            an experimental environment for discussion and debate at the cutting 
        edge of Web and broadcast technologies. </p>
      <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">This paper examines this range of 
            technologies and their application - in particular focusing on the ways 
            in which the Dana Centre is beginning to allow users to contribute content 
            for use both on- and off-line. It also looks at the ways in which the 
            boundary is crossed between the event space and the virtual space, by 
            using text messaging, live Webcast, live voting, XML feeds, 3D chat 
        and discussion boards. </p>
      <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">As well as looking at the technologies

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The Dana Centre is a new space, in a new building &#8211; The Wellcome 
            Wolfson building<sup><a href="#Note1">1</a></sup>, at the Science Museum, London. The Dana 
            Centre opened to the public in November 2003. It was conceived as an 
            accessible place for 'talking science' where everyone is 
        equal and the outcomes make a difference. The Centre is:</p>
          <ul>
          <li> 
            Audience led</li>
          <li> 
            Relevant and issues based</li>
          <li> 
            Independent and empowering</li>
          <li> 
            Creative and bold</li>
          <li> 
            Engaging and fun</li>
        </ul>
     
          <p> The Centre was developed as a response 
              to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> A shift in Government priorities in the UK raising the profile of 
                Science as a whole</li>
            <li> 
               Increasing public and media interest in 
              issues raised by science, technology and medicine</li>
            <li> 
               Increasing public scepticism and mistrust 
              of science and its applications</li>
          </ul>
      <p>The Centre was developed as a number of public performance spaces (The 
            d-café, d-lounge, d-studio and d-study) where the museum could run exciting, 
            informative and innovative debates and other types of performances 
            about contemporary science, technology and culture for an adult audience. 
        The main target audience for the Dana Centre is 18-45-year-olds.</p>
          <p>No two days at the Dana Centre are the same. It's the place for experimental 
            dialogue events, blending the best from science, art, performance and 
            multimedia to provoke discussion and real engagement with the key issues 
            of the day. State-of-the-art digital facilities link the Centre and 
            its events with venues all over the UK, those on the Internet, and everyone 
            with a mobile phone. </p>
          <p>The events focus on themes that are important to the centre's 
            audience, presenting them in new and attractive ways &ndash; all in a lively, 
        engaging but informal atmosphere. </p>
          <h1>The "Real&quot; Space</h1>
          <h2>How Is The Space Organized?</h2>
          <p>The Dana centre comprises 3 main public spaces for performances &#8211; 
            the d-café, d-study and d-studio - and the d-lounge, which is an informal 
            space with computers for free public Internet access and two large round 
            seats for informal gatherings. Because the Dana centre is not large, 
            a capacity audience for an event where all public spaces are being used 
            is 260 people. To this end we created a fourth public space for the 
            Dana centre on-line &#8211; the Web site or "4th room&#8221;.</p>
          <p>Most public events in the Dana centre are video recorded so that we 
            have a record of the event.</p>
          <h3>Lower Ground Floor</h3>
          <h4>The d-café</h4>
          <p>This is the main public space in the building. It is multifunctional 
            and houses a bar/restaurant. It is designed to be used as an experimental 
            multifunctional performance space and a digital Webcasting studio: during 
            the day it is a communal space for the South Kensington campus. At other 
            times it can host formal talks, theatre performance, debates, comedy 
            nights or club nights. </p>
          <p>The east wall of the d-café is completely glazed, making the space 
            feel light and open during daylight hours. The d-café contains a portable 
            stage that can be used in two main locations - in the centre of the 
            East wall and forward of the South wall.</p>
          <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a><img src="ellis.fig1.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: The d-caf&eacute;"/></p>
          <p class="caption">Fig. 1: The d-café</p>
          <p>Two double height projections onto the North and South flanking walls 
            are used both to provide information during events and to help define 
            the character of the space when no events are running. </p>
          <p>Most of the technical equipment used for events is suspended from a 
            ceiling mounted rig that sits centrally above the lower ground floor 
            space. The rig is motorized and can be lowered to floor level to allow 
            maintenance and rigging of additional equipment.<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup></p>
      <h3>The Upper Ground Floor</h3>
          <h4>Control room</h4>
          <p>The control room contains much of the AV/IT equipment required to run 
            the Dana centre. It also contains the Dana centre's Webcasting 
            and video editing equipment. There is provision in this room for four 
            technical staff. From here they can control events, carry out video 
            editing and run Webcasts. </p>
          <h4>d-lounge</h4>
          <p>The space around the control room is known as the d-lounge. Eight publicly 
            accessible Internet-connected computers are mounted around the sides 
            of the control room. Spaces on either side of the control room are used 
            for informal meetings and also for hosting temporary media art installations.</p>
          <h3>1st Floor</h3>
          <h4>d-studio</h4>
          <p>The d-studio is the larger space on the 1st floor. It is a flexible 
            space designed for both formal and informal events, with audiences of 
            up to 100 people. It is equipped with video projection, a 5:1 audio 
            system for program audio and a voice reinforcement system. </p>
          <h4>d-study</h4>
          <p>The d-study is the smaller of the two main spaces on the 1st floor. 
            Again, it is a flexible space - capable of hosting events with audiences 
            of up to 40 people. The room has video projection and an audio system 
            for both Programme audio and voice reinforcement. Most non-event-based 
            video conferencing takes place from here.</p>
          <h3>Breakout spaces</h3>
          <p>On either side of the d-studio are two breakout spaces. These spaces 
            have no fixed equipment within them but do have connection points to 
            both the data and the AV network. </p>
          <h2>Control</h2>
          <p>All of the AV systems within the Dana Centre are controlled using an 
            AMX control system which controls the routing of all AV signals around 
            the building. It allows video sources to be routed to the display systems 
            and also controls the audio and lighting systems.</p>
          <h2>Networks</h2>
          <p>The Dana centre contains 3 distinct networks.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
             A data network linked to the museum's 
          main network infrastructure</li>
          <li> 
             A publicly accessible wireless network 
          that sits outside the museum's security system</li>
          <li> 
             An AV network that allows the distribution 
          and routing of audio and video signals around the building</li>
        </ul>
         
          <p>The purpose of the AV network is to allow audio and video signals to 
            be routed from any space in the Dana centre to any other space (via 
            the Control Room).</p>
          <p>For example, a camera plugged in on the ground floor can have its video 
            and audio signals routed via the control room to the video projector 
            in the forum. A video signal from the control room can be sent to an 
            AV network point on the lower ground floor and from there to a portable 
            plasma screen. The network should allow seamless dynamic switching of 
            pre-selected video signals.</p>
          <p>The AV network allows the distribution of audio and video signals around 
            the public spaces of the building. Some of this network is hard wired 
            to particular devices and some of it terminates in floor or wall sockets, 
            allowing connection of portable equipment; for example, additional plasma 
            screens, video cameras, microphones etc.</p>
          <p>The AV network allows any device or connection point to be routed to 
            any other (appropriate device or connection point) either by patching 
            or using the matrix switches to allow automatic routing of signals. 
            All AV devices and points are routed via the control room on the upper 
            ground floor. The video components should allow for the distribution 
            of composite video but should be capable, with the addition of the relevant 
            converters, to take serial digital video signals. The network should 
            allow seamless dynamic switching of pre-selected video signals.</p>
          <h2>How Is It Used?</h2>
          <p>The Programme of events in the Dana Centre is split into three seasons 
            that run from</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
          Beginning of January until Easter</li>
          <li>Easter until the end of July</li>
          <li> 
          Beginning of September until Mid December</li>
        </ul>
         
          <p>During most weeks of each season we run three public events a week 
            during the evenings. These events are quite varied and include;</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
          Panel debates</li>
          <li> 
          Comedy events</li>
          <li> 
          Multimedia performances</li>
          <li> 
          Theatre</li>
          <li>Informal Workshops</li>
          <li> 
          Musical events</li>
          <li> 
          Science News reviews</li>
        </ul>
         
          <p>These events are open to the general public (because the Centre is 
            licensed and because of the nature of some of the programs, the audience 
            is restricted to over 18's), and the majority of events are free.</p>
          <p>We currently Webcast two events a month.</p>
          <p>The events are run by the Science Museum and its partner organizations 
            in the Dana Centre, The BA and EDAB. We also have partnerships with 
            other organizations; for example, Cybersalon, who hold events in the 
            Dana Centre.</p>
          <p>As well as for public events, the Dana Centre is used for private corporate 
            events and for internal Science Museum meetings.</p>
          <h1>The Virtual Space</h1>
          <h2>Objectives</h2>
          <p>The Dana Centre site was designed not only to be a virtual extension 
            of the physical venue, letting real and virtual audiences take part 
            in science debate both on- and off-line, but also eventually to become 
            a content hub which supports and actively extends the events Programme 
            and the real space. </p>
          <p>From a technology perspective, the facilities within the building put 
            the centre and Web site in a unique position whereby the vision of connecting 
            the two spaces becomes very real. A WLAN, network points, Web cam units, 
            Webcast facilities and means to &quot;patch through&quot; not only between 
            the three public spaces but also across to the virtual makes this an 
            extremely flexible environment.</p>
          <p>To date, the focus on the Web has been about supporting the event Programme 
            with a simple set of on-line applications outlined in more detail below. 
            Now that the centre is established, a second phase of building has been 
            planned for the site. This will expand and improve the content and technology 
            which are already in place </p>
          <h2>Overview of Web site</h2>
          <p>The main thrust behind the Web site design was simplicity coupled with 
            a design linked to the real space. The stark, bright colours match the 
            branding and concept of the building itself, while the navigation was 
            put together in line with extensive user evaluation so that the key 
            areas of the site were represented at the top level. &quot;What is the 
            Dana Centre about?&quot;, &quot;What's on?&quot;, &quot;Can I take part 
            on-line?&quot; were key questions which needed answering - and the response 
            is obvious header navigation: &quot;about us&quot;, &quot;what's on&quot;, 
          &quot;discuss&quot;.</p>
          <p class="caption"><img src="ellis.fig2.gif" width="400" height="467" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Dana Centre Web site"/></p>
          <p class="caption">Fig 2: The homepage of the Dana Centre Web site <a target="_blank" href="http://www.danacentre.org.uk/">http://www.danacentre.org.uk</a></p>
          <h2>Calendar</h2>
          <p>The calendar sits at the centre of the Web site functionality and as 
            such is one of the most visited sets of pages. At launch, we planned 
            that it could be used retrospectively, with &quot;post event&quot; information 
            added once an event had passed. The vision was that this would give 
            users the means to look back through an ever-expanding archive of information 
            and opinion. In reality, the concern that we had at build - that users 
            only understand calendar applications as being forward-looking - appears 
            to be born out by the statistics. This is one of several areas to be 
            addressed, probably through improved editorial, during further phases 
            of development.</p>
          <p>Each event can have a number of associated items which can be hyperlinked 
            from the event text. These items include discussion topics, speaker 
            bios, assets or associated reading, 3rd party Web site links, etc. From 
            an editorial perspective, the team was keen not always to create explicit 
            links between an event and a discussion associated with it (&quot;discuss 
            this event&quot;), but instead leave the on-line community to provide 
            the impetus behind this linking. This meant creating within the discussion 
            board areas which could be associated with the particular topic but 
            which were not explicitly tied to it. This flexibility has meant that 
            the discussions range more freely, helping fulfill the aim of the centre 
            to be truly audience-led.</p>
          <h2>Discussion Boards</h2>
          <p>The second major section of the site is the discussion board area. 
            Further detail follows below.</p>
          <h3>4th Room interactive</h3>
          <p>The &quot;4th room&quot; interactive is a Flash-based interface to 
            the discussion boards which can be found on the site homepage. The idea 
            behind it was to provide an interactive which gave a feeling of community, 
            movement and engagement developed over time, in the spirit of the experimental 
            Dana Centre approach. The present interface is reasonably simple, but 
            further developments are planned (see &quot;Future&quot; section, below).</p>
          <p>A discussion thread is chosen by the Web site editors (using the CMS) 
            and the topic is then fed into the interactive. As a user posts a topic, 
            an avatar representing that user appears within the interactive. Clicking 
            on the figure shows a speech bubble with the post. The figures themselves 
            wander randomly around the interactive. If it is left without clicking, 
            speech bubbles begin to appear above the relevant figures with the thread 
            posts displayed in the order in which they were posted. This goes some 
            way toward giving the feeling of a real discussion.</p>

          <h1>User Contributed Content</h1>
          <h2>Webcasting</h2>
          <p>As mentioned above, we Webcast roughly two events each month as well 
            as hosting an ever-expanding archive of previous event footage.</p>
          <h3>Why Webcast?</h3>
          <p>The Dana Centre embarked on a program of Webcasting for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
             to broaden the Dana Centre's reach to 
              audiences that may not otherwise attend events due to distance, the 
          limited size of the venue for popular events or possible social exclusion.</li>
          <li> 
             as a marketing tool: potential visitors 
              can sample Dana events without having to make the commitment necessary 
          to physically attend.</li>
          <li> 
             to investigate the wider potential of 
          broadcast technologies and techniques.</li>
          <li>for sustainability: Webcasts can be archived to provide lasting records 
            of Dana events.</li>
        </ul>
         
          <h3>What Was Our Approach?<em></em></h3>
          <p>Our research suggested that although many organizations were experimenting 
            with Webcasts, the results were often disappointing and a poor substitute 
            for the physical experience they were replicating. We therefore took 
            the early decision to prioritize quality over quantity.</p>
          <p class="caption"><img src="ellis.fig4.gif" width="400" height="411" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: A live Webcast"/></p>
          <p class="caption">Fig 4: A live Webcast </p>
          <p class="caption"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.danacentre.org.uk/Default.aspx?DanaMenu=_WEBCASTARCHIVE">http://www.danacentre.org.uk/Default.aspx?DanaMenu=_WEBCASTARCHIVE</a></p>
          <p>As a result of this, we currently only Webcast a small selection of 
            our events, selected partly to reflect the diversity of our programming 
            and partly on the basis of the suitability of the event format (a Webcast 
            couldn't adequately convey the essence of a series of parallel small-group 
            discussions, for example). These events are streamed across a global 
            commercial content distribution network of 6,000 dedicated media servers 
            to overcome the inherent shortcomings of the Internet as a medium for 
            real-time high-bandwidth communication.</p>
          <p>Our Webcasts are broadband only: research showed that 60% of our audience 
            had access to broadband, and that this was growing. More important, 
            the quality of video streamed at modem bit-rates was so poor as to be 
            almost valueless as a representation of an event. We concluded that 
            modem visitors would be better served by high-quality audio streams 
            than by low-quality video streams.</p>
          <p>Controversially, we stream using proprietary Microsoft "Windows Media&quot; 
            technologies. There are other media formats that in theory can be watched 
            on a slightly wider range of computing platforms, but the need to download 
            and install large pieces of new software can present formidable obstacles 
            to viewers who aren't necessarily highly technical. The far larger proportion 
            of computers that have Windows Media Players pre-installed mean that 
            in practice it is the most accessible format, even if its theoretical 
            maximum potential audience is slightly lower.</p>
          <p>Above all, we worked to maximize our production values. Audiences are 
            accustomed to the techniques of commercial broadcasters and are easily 
            disappointed when Webcasts fall short of these standards. Our Webcasts 
            generally involve feeds from three cameras (two fixed, one roving) mixed 
            by directors with commercial broadcast experience.</p>
          <h3>What Have Our Experiences Been?</h3>
          <p>Our initial audiences for live Webcasts were quite small, generally 
            in single figures, probably a good thing while we built up our basic 
            processes and competencies. Audiences have steadily grown, however: 
            more recent events have attracted on-line audiences of the order of 
            50-60 viewers, which is around 50% of the typical physical attendance 
            at an event. Average viewing time is around 15 minutes, though (a typical 
            Dana event will last 2 hours), so it is clear that a large proportion 
            of this audience is 'dipping in' to the event rather than watching 
            it in its entirety.</p>
          <p>Archived Webcasts generally receive around 500 visits per month in 
            total, though the average view time is even shorter here &#8211; around 
            5 minutes &#8211; so it seems that many of these visitors are using 
            the archives as a 'taster'.</p>
          <h3>For The Future?</h3>
          <p>Our Webcasts so far have generally been one-way affairs: the remote 
            viewer is largely a spectator receiving information from the event in 
            the Dana Centre. Opportunities for the Web audience to get actively 
            involved in the discussion have mainly been limited to emailing questions 
            and points to the discussion facilitator to be read out in the physical 
            space.</p>
          <p>For Webcasting to fully contribute to the Dana Centre's mission as 
            a venue for two-way dialogue, the degree of interactivity between the 
            real and the virtual events needs to be increased. We are therefore 
            looking at ways of extending our e-voting systems on the Web and integrating 
            Webcasts with other messaging technologies such as SMS and on-line chat. 
            See below for further details.</p>
          <p>It is this quest for two-way dialogue that led us to experiment with 
            incorporating Webcasts within an interactive 3D chat environment using 
            Flash Communication Server &#8211; the "4th room event&". 
          </p>
          <h2>Chat: The "4<sup>th</sup> Room event&#8221;</h2>
          <p>The challenges of providing real-time chat are real. Perceptions are 
            big, with stories of &quot;grooming&quot; in the media. Providing a 
            means of democratizing the chat space is an immense challenge. Removing 
            users who abuse the space is time-consuming. </p>
          <p>Even if these challenges can be overcome, text-based chat can be incredibly 
            boring, with those people who are quick types rather than those with 
            a quick wit the dominant figures.</p>
          <p>With all this in mind, the Web team looked to an alternative and more 
            innovative solution. </p>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>Funding was provided by the Wellcome Trust for an innovative on-line 
            event which used Web-based activities to promote science-related dialogue. 
            The subject of the event was &quot;Telepathy - does it exist?&quot;, 
            and it was decided to spend the budget developing a once-off project 
            with a company called Lightmaker (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lightmaker.com/tnt">www.lightmaker.com/tmt</a>) 
            who build 3d environments. Their Web sites include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.virtualibiza.com/">www.virtualibiza.com</a>, 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.contactsandperonals.co.uk/">www.contactsandperonals.co.uk</a> 
            and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.globalstage.tv/">www.globalstage.tv</a>. 
            They have developed a framework called TMT which is an innovative solution 
            for providing real-time 3D avatar-based chat.</p>
          <p>The full solution allows user to create an account, interact with others 
            in real-time via a number of 3d spaces, and create their own, customizable 
          &quot;virtual room&quot;. The solution worked up for the Telepathy event 
            was a cut-down version of the full product, giving two &quot;rooms&quot;, 
            both Dana-branded. </p>
          <p>Twenty users were invited to participate in the event. These were members 
            of staff, expert members of the panel, and trusted users from the discussion 
            board area of the site.</p>
          <p class="caption"><a name="Fig5" id="Fig5"></a><img src="ellis.fig5.gif" width="400" height="250" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: The 3d chat environment"/></p>
          <p class="caption">Fig. 5: The 3d chat environment</p>
          <p>The avatar-based nature of the technology means that the flow of dialogue 
            is not necessarily linear: sometimes a frustration in standard text-based 
            chat. Also, typed comments remain on-screen for some time, allowing 
            more complex thoughts to be voiced before the conversation has moved 
            on. The interface is colourful, engaging and innovative. Users can make 
            their avatars react with smiles or other emotions. Clicking around the 
            space makes your avatar move to that point, thereby allowing people 
            to &quot;mingle&quot;. Private chat can also be used to interact one-to-one 
            with the other members of the event. The event was scripted and an hour 
            long. </p>
          <h3>What Have Our Experiences Been?</h3>
          <p>The overall feeling from the event was that the interface was immensely 
            engaging and provided a fun and different front-end. There were, however, 
            huge challenges in making the technology fit the format of the event. 
            Many of the users found the interface frustrating and felt that stronger 
            moderation and guidance was required.</p>
          <p>The primary challenges and results taken from the evaluation report 
            are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
             strong moderation is key in helping drive 
          an event such as this</li>
          <li>specialists (&quot;the panel&quot;) and moderators needed to be flagged 
            as such and given the means to drive the flow of the event</li>
          <li>certain sections of the event worked well - these were the ones that 
            were incredibly simple (for example, &quot;move your avatar to the left 
            side of the room for yes&quot; worked better than &quot;click the poll 
            icon to vote yes&quot;)</li>
        </ul>
         
          <p>The full evaluation report is available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/evaluation/danacentre/4throom_Virtual_Event_eval_report.pdf">http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/evaluation/danacentre/4throom_Virtual_Event_eval_report.pdf</a></p>
          <h2>E-Voting</h2>
          <h3>Why E-Voting ?</h3>
          <p>In the run up to the opening of the Dana Centre, the museum ran a series 
            of pilot events under the banner of Naked Science. These events were 
            used to trial possible formats and technologies for use in the Dana 
            Centre. They took place in a variety of venues around London. One of 
            the things we tried was an electronic voting system. This proved to 
            be immensely popular with the audience. In particular, it allowed users 
            to comment on issues anonymously, so they could make a contribution 
            to the debate even if they were embarrassed or unwilling to make a comment 
            directly. </p>
          <p>Importantly, the system also allows us to assess the mood and opinion 
            of the audience. With a careful choice of questions it is thereby possible 
            to use the audience answers to direct the flow of an event. In other 
            words, we can use the system to find out what the majority of the audience 
            are concerned about and direct the speakers to address these concerns. 
            We also use the system to check if there has been any shift in the audience's 
            position in light of the debate.</p>
          <h3>What Was Our Approach?</h3>
          <p>We looked at a number of available systems. We borrowed several systems 
            to trial at events to gauge their usability.</p>
          <p>We wanted a system that was easy to use, very robust, expandable and 
            portable. After looking at a number of systems and their associated 
            software, we decided we also wanted a system that we could write our 
            own software for, as this would give us the ultimate flexibility to 
            build a system that did exactly what we needed.</p>
          <h3>Our System<strong><em></em></strong></h3>
          <p>We eventually decided on an RF based system developed by a company 
            called Fleetwood. The system consists of a receiver unit (which connects 
            via a serial lead to a PC) and the voting handsets. We purchased 150 
            handsets, enough for everyone at an event to have one with a few spares 
            in case of loss or damage. </p>
          <p>The software is written in Macromedia Director and reads in the questions 
            from an external XML file. This means that they can be composed and 
            input away from the system. The software also allows questions to be 
            added on the fly during events; if the event organiser decides that 
            in light of the debate a new question needs to be added, this is easily 
            accomplished.</p>
          <p>The look of the software reflects the design of the Dana centre itself:</p>
          <p class="caption"><img src="ellis.fig6.gif" width="400" height="301" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: e-voting software"/></p>
          <p class="caption">Fig.6: The Dana Centre e-voting software</p>
          <h3>What Have Our Experiences Been?</h3>
          <p>The system has been very successful. It is popular with both audience 
            and speakers and is used at over half of the events we run at the Dana 
            Centre. We have also used the system at events in the museum, as well 
            as lending the system out for use at a number of external events.</p>
          <h3>The Future</h3>
          <p>The next major development of the system will be to allow on-line voting 
            (during a Webcast event) to be integrated into the system so that there 
            is parity between the real and the virtual audience. It will also let 
            us start to explore the differences between real and virtual audiences.</p>
          <p>We are also looking at other software modules that will allow other 
            forms of interaction. We have already written prototype software that 
            allows the handsets to be used to control multi-user games and other 
            types of interaction. Whilst these are not necessarily useful during 
            most events, they could make a welcome addition to the space when it 
            is just a café.</p>
          <p>We are also investigating the commercial possibilities of both the 
            software that we have written and also the hiring out of the complete 
            system.</p>
          <h2>Discussion Boards</h2>
          <p>The Dana Centre Web site was intended to support dialogue taking place 
            within the building, but it was also crucially intended that it should 
            itself be a medium for such dialogue. During the planning process this 
            evolved into the Fourth Room concept: as there are three physical spaces 
            for science dialogue within the Dana Centre, the Web site should be 
            thought of analogously as the fourth.</p>
          <p>After investigating existing models for discussion on the Web and other 
            virtual environments, it was felt that the most effective model for 
            encouraging participation in on-line dialogue and empowering participants 
            to shape the discussion themselves was to have a core forum based on 
            the classic threaded message board format supplemented by more experimental 
            formats for dialogue that could grow or wither according to their success.</p>
          <p class="caption"><img src="ellis.fig7.gif" width="400" height="402" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Discussion Board"/></p>
          <p class="caption">Fig.7: The Dana Centre discussion board</p>
          <p class="caption"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.danacentre.org.uk/Default.aspx?DanaMenu=_DISCUSS">http://www.danacentre.org.uk/Default.aspx?DanaMenu=_DISCUSS</a></p>
          <p>The role of the core forum was:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
             To encourage the growth of a community 
          associated with the Dana Centre.</li>
          <li> 
             To encourage a culture of participation, 
              where everyone feels empowered to shape, as well as take part in, 
          the discussion.</li>
          <li>To enable discussion to build up in advance of physical events, and 
            for it to continue after physical events had finished. In trial events 
            many of the most interesting discussions took place in the bar after 
            formal events had taken place. With the provision of internet-enabled 
            PCs within the centre, some of this continuing dialogue could be captured 
            and become part of an event's value.</li>
        </ul>
         
          <p>Moderating was a worry while the discussion forums were under development, 
            particularly as encouraging difficult, controversial and 'adult' 
            subjects was an explicit aim of the project. Legal advice suggested 
            that not pre-moderating content would actually lessen our legal liability 
            for content posted, and this, coupled with Dana's 'adult' ethos, 
            suggested that we should only post-moderate discussions except for a 
            small number of particularly controversial topics where extra sensitivity 
            might be called for. In practice, moderating has presented very few 
            problems either in terms of workload or in terms of rancour.</p>
          <p>Finally it was considered important to communicate the 'fourth 
            room' concept on the Web site to emphasize that the on-line and off-line 
            discussions were related, analogous and complimentary, but not necessarily 
            mutually dependent. This was achieved by creating a flash application 
            that could load an xml-formatted representation of a thread in the normal 
            Dana forums, and present it visually as a series of comments from individuals 
            located within a metaphorical 3D space. Limited interaction with the 
            thread is possible within the flash environment (posts can be read and 
            replied to), or the environment can be used as a 'gateway' into 
            the full discussion taking place within the messageboards.</p>
          <h3>What Have Our Experiences Been?</h3>
          <p>A great deal of real dialogue on scientific issues and related controversies 
            can be found on the Dana Centre discussion forums. Although a very large 
            number of people register but go on to make few if any posts, there 
            quickly built up a core community of regular posters who provided much 
            of the discussion for others to participate in. Topics have ranged from 
            the deadly serious to the frivolous, but comments have generally been 
            thoughtful and considered, and serious trouble-makers have been few 
            and easily dealt with.</p>
          <p>The goal of using the Web as a means for enabling participants to actively 
            influence the direction of the Dana Centre has also been successful. 
            Feedback and ideas from on-line participants have been instrumental 
            in setting the directions of many of our more innovative activities 
            and technological experiments.</p>
          <h1>The Future</h1>
          <p>At the inception of the Dana Centre project, it was planned that development 
            would continue as time went on. Even after project launch and the opening 
            of the building to the public, the focus has always been on this being 
            an experimental and changing centre of science communication excellence. 
          </p>
          <p>To this end, all Dana Centre projects &#8211; whether on-line, in the 
            building itself or Programme related &#8211; have been put together 
            with future horizons in mind. Although "future proofing&#8221; is not 
            a reality in the world of technology, the groundwork that has been done 
            provides what we believe is an unprecedented level of flexibility to 
            move in the direction of best practice as it emerges. </p>
          <h2>Linking The Virtual And The Real</h2>
          <p>The means by which, for example, the audio and video feeds from live 
            events can be piped to anywhere in the building from a central control 
            point - or delivered out onto the Web - means that various technologies 
            (Webcams, microphones, projectors, screens) can be interconnected to 
            create a network of content that can be tapped in various ways. Many 
            of these ways are undefined at present, but several have been identified 
            and are outlined below.</p>
          <p>One area that has proved difficult has been linking on-line and off-line 
            activities. To date, few discussions on the Web have followed on from 
            where physical events have left off, and few physical events have had 
            their agendas influenced by discussions on the forum. More basic techniques 
            like "email us with your ideas&#8221; seem to have been more effective 
            in achieving this.</p>
          <p>We hope that as the technology matures and becomes more integrated, 
            the "joined up&#8221; scenario will begin to become a reality as feeds 
            of information travel in, around and out of the building. Content will 
            eventually be added via any number of channels: on-line, off-line, SMS, 
            MMS, etc. - and immediately available to people using other channels. 
            Thus, a pre-event poll might influence the speaker's view on the night 
            of the event (which is then live Webcast) and discussed afterwards on 
            the discussion boards. </p>
          <h2>Expanding Audiences</h2>
          <p>The overall focus in strategic terms for the Dana Centre over the next 
            few years is on developing the existing audience and extending reach 
            to new, larger and broader audiences, increasing the impact of the Centre 
            in the arena of science dialogue, and making more of the tangible outputs 
            from the events. </p>
          <p>Obviously with limited physical space, the onus for audience development 
            falls to a certain extent to the Web and other virtual channels. In 
            the same way, making more out of the outputs of events is facilitated 
            by the technologies that the Web offers. </p>
          <p>The following are some of the avenues that are being considered.</p>
          <h2>Audiocasting</h2>
          <p>Cheaper than Webcasting, and arguably more viable at this point in 
            time, Internet radio and audiocasting (including spin-offs such as podcasting) 
            is gathering real momentum on-line and would truly add value to the 
            Centre's offerings. Feasibility studies are underway to determine likely 
            reach and cost</p>
          <h2>Video booths</h2>
          <p>Setting up video booths would allow audiences &#8211; and passing members 
            of public &#8211; the means to leave Webcam postings of their thoughts 
            on current science topics (or anything at all!). These could then be 
            projected in the real space, compressed for viewing on-line, or archived 
            for use at forthcoming events</p>
          <h2>Chat</h2>
          <p>Taking the 3d chat environment and extending it so that an avatar-based 
            community could exist on-line is an attractive proposal that also fits 
            well with the experimental nature of the Centre. The challenges &#8211; 
            as outlined above &#8211; are still considerable, but given a suitable 
            event and extensive user evaluation to determine the best way ahead, 
            we believe there could be a potential future with this kind of technology.</p>
          <h2>User Driven Events</h2>
          <p>From a simple e-mailed form allowing comments to be seen live during 
            events to using discussion board opinions to proactively steer the programming, 
            the means by which we give our audience true power over what we discuss 
            is one of the enduring aims of the Dana Centre. Several technologies 
            are likely to be trialed as this becomes more and more a reality.</p>
          <h2>Dana Desktop</h2>
          <p>A pre-release version of a Dana desktop has already been developed. 
            It is essentially a standalone Flash application which runs as a background 
            process on a user's desktop and talks, via XML, to the Dana Centre Web 
            site. At present, the application only displays simple event information 
            and recent posts to the discussion board, but the plan is to develop 
            this so that personalised information can be pushed at users. Eventually, 
            we may be able to Webcast into the application as well or build some 
            MSN-messenger-like chat tools for real-time communication among users.</p>
          <h2>Personalization</h2>
          <p>The bare bones of personalization &#8211; a simple sign-in and user 
            profile &#8211; are available via the discussion boards, but it is hoped 
            to extend this functionality as and when resources allow. A cross-site 
            sign-in mechanism (a kind of "Microsoft Passport&#8221; for the Science 
            Museum) may well be integrated in the near future, thus allowing users 
            to create one profile for any number of e-products across the Museum's 
            virtual space. As time goes on, we hope to develop this to target personalised 
            offerings at specific users. "You came to the event last night &#8211; 
            tell us what you think&#8221; is one possible example. ECRM is expensive, 
            however, so this depth of functionality may be some time in coming.</p>
          <h2>Miscellaneous Developments</h2>
          <p>Many other ideas have been captured during brainstorming meetings for 
            further development of the virtual and real spaces. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>pre/during event feedback: simply allowing virtual and real users 
            to post into either space while an event is running. Either Web or SMS 
            technologies could be used and the results displayed as a ticker or 
            Web page</li>
          <li>event booking and reminders: allowing users to flag up events they 
            are interested in. The system would then e-mail them in advance of the 
            event to remind them to turn up (or log in, in the case of Webcasts)</li>
          <li>continued development in more art-based pieces </li>
          <li>links to affiliate partners such as Amazon ("read more about the topic 
            here&#8221;) etc.</li>
        </ul>
      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>The Dana Centre has become a very successful forum for science-based 
            dialogue, with Web site, Webcasting and a whole suite of technologies 
            available to users to extend their experience of an innovative Programme 
        of events. </p>
      <p>Because of careful planning at the build phase, the technologies for 
            delivering content have been put together to foster an experimental 
            environment with the potential to be "joined up&#8221; to an unprecedented 
            extent. Although some of the elements mentioned in this paper are making 
            serious moves in the direction of a holistic experience, there is still 
        a fair distance to go.</p>
      <p>It is also worth highlighting that this approach is largely different 
            from that in the main museum. It is to this end that the Dana Centre 
            performs one of its most interesting roles: it is a test bed for experimental 
            technology where "getting it wrong&#8221; and learning from the experience 
            is as much a part of getting it right. Once the technologies have been 
            created, honed and developed in the Dana Centre, they can then to begin 
            to migrate into the main museum and, we hope, further expand the audiences 
        and experiences of the core user base there as well.</p>
