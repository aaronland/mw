      <h1>Interpretation and Personalisation: Enriching Individual Experience 
        by Annotating On-line Materials </h1>
      <h2>Behzad Kateli and Liddy Nevile, La Trobe University, Australia</h2>
      <h3>Abstract </h3>
      <p class="AbstractText" id="abstract">Providing historical and cultural 
            information that adapts to personal content and presentation preferences 
            is increasingly important to museums. There is a need for personalization 
            not only for accessibility but also to provide the user with relevant 
            information-rich content. This paper describes how annotations can be 
            used to support an interpretive process. Scenarios demonstrate how annotation 
            technologies can enable different Museum user groups to add interpretive 
            and academic content to <em>Quinkan Country</em> rock art records. Further, 
            we extend the AccessForAll specification to allow Museum users to set 
        display, control and content preferences for annotations. </p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Museums provide information that encourages learning, thought, experience 
            and discovery to a number of user groups. This has led information technology 
            designers in museums to take less techno-centric, more people-oriented 
            approaches when creating information retrieval systems. Tailoring presentation 
            and content has become a focus for many institutions and organizations. 
            User-centric systems allow the individual to have control over access 
            modalities and preferences for information retrieval. The IMS Accessibility 
            for Learner Information Package (AccLIP) is a metadata specification 
            to support user descriptions of content, control and display preferences 
            in a standardized format known as a 'user profile'.  As more people 
            are using the Web as a primary means of information, it is becoming 
            more important for museums to provide information-rich content in a 
        form that is accessible to all users. </p>
      <p>The Quinkan Matchbox is a repository for cataloguing Australian Aboriginal 
            cultural heritage. It aims to increase understanding of cultural artifacts 
            by not only cataloguing curatorial-type information about the resources 
            but also encouraging experts to contribute information <em>in response 
            to</em> information already contributed by others. In particular, it 
            is hoped to elicit opinions and interpretations from members of the 
            Quinkan Aboriginal community. Annotations are used to store this information 
            in a manner that does not alter the original state of the resource and 
            allows for contributors to extend information in personalized formats 
            for different user groups. For example, imagine Harry, an Aboriginal 
            student, browsing the Museum of Natural History Web site for research 
            on Quinkan Prehistory. He comes across a rock-art painting called 'Giant 
            Horse'. He remembers stories of its myths and origin told by the elders 
            of his tribe. Harry creates an annotation containing this information. 
            This annotated document acts as a supplementary resource designed to 
        increase knowledge for a particular user group. </p>
      <p>This paper demonstrates how museums can use annotations for interpretation 
        and personalization to increase individual experience. </p>
      <p>The first part describes technologies currently used in the creation 
            of annotations. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed many 
            Web technologies, always being careful to support alternative interfaces 
            for people with accessibility needs and preferences. Two of these are 
            Amaya and Annotea which incorporate W3C standards and specifications 
            to allow users to create, store, modify, and delete annotations. In 
            this section, we present use cases showing how these technologies can 
            be used to create personalized annotation for storing interpretations 
            made by different expert user groups. Other annotation technologies 
            such as AnnoSource will also be discussed. The second part of the paper 
            will further develop earlier ideas (Nevile et al., 2004) . We exploit 
            the utility of the IMS AccessForAll profile and show how it can be used 
            to interact with annotations. We present ideas suggesting how museums 
            can modify the user profile to best suit the content needs of its diverse 
            clientele.  Finally, the paper presents conclusions and ideas for possible 
        future research in this area. </p>
      <h1>Terminology Use In This Paper</h1>
            <ul>
          <li> 
            <div class="listwithbullets"> <em>Accessibility</em> is used to refer 
              to the effective matching of resources to users' stated needs and 
              preferences. </div>
          </li>
          <li><em>Interpreters</em> are users providing expert interpretations and 
            views. For example, interpreters may be Aboriginal Elders, anthropologists, 
            archeologists, teachers or other experts within a particular knowledge 
            domain. </li>
          <li><em>Annotations</em> are described by the W3C as &#8220;comments, 
            notes, explanations or other types of external remarks that can be attached 
            to a document&#8221;   (Koivunen, 2004) .</li>
        </ul>
      <p>In this paper, we propose to use annotations that have the capability 
            to be functional. They have the ability to present information to the 
            user in separate forms or modalities by augmentation or transformation 
            of the original content. For example, an annotation can contain content 
            in Braille that would be useful for a blind Braille-user. The Matchbox 
            Project uses annotations as a means of cataloguing interpretive knowledge 
            in modalities that increase cultural experiences. One of the major benefits 
            is that the original document remains unchanged; the annotations are 
            stored on a separate server and are accessed only when a user accesses 
            a resource through the annotation server. Annotations are expressed 
            using the Resource Description Framework (RDF - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3c.org/RDF/">http://www.w3c.org/RDF/</a>), 
            a language which uses XML syntax to present information on the World 
            Wide Web. Thus, annotation information is described in a standard format 
            which can be shared with other institutions such as universities, high 
            schools, art galleries, W3C, etc. Museums may also share information 
            using Annotation clients which have the capability to obtain annotation(s) 
            from one or more annotation servers such as the Matchbox annotation 
            server (<a target="_blank"
href="http://matchbox01.cs.latrobe.edu.au/quinkan/annotations/">http://matchbox01.cs.latrobe.edu.au/quinkan/annotations/</a>) 
        and the W3C annotation server (<a target="_blank" href="http://annotest.w3.org/annotations">http://annotest.w3.org/annotations</a>).</p>
      <p>Recently, we have started to use annotations to introduce Semantic 
            Web information by linking annotations to other systems that contain 
        information that also can be extended. </p>

      <h2>Annotating Museum Content</h2>
      <p>The way people seek information on the Web is changing. Simply put, 
            people endlessly want more. They seek information through forums, mailing 
            lists, conference transcripts etc. Museums have a very wide spread of 
            user types, ranging from learners to experts from different cultural 
            and knowledge backgrounds, and increasingly they seek better personalization 
            technologies to improve the visiting experience by creating a <em>human 
            element </em> (Bowen, 2004) . Annotations can help improve user experiences 
            by providing additional sources of rich accessible information. The 
            following describes current technologies used to create annotations. 
            Museums can adopt annotation technology without having to sacrifice 
            their current information technology infrastructure. Most annotation 
            servers and clients described are available, free and they often come 
        with support. </p>
      <p>Fig. 1 shows how a typical server works. A user chooses to annotate 
            a single paragraph within a resource, so the server stores both the 
            coordinates of the position where the user has decided to add an annotation 
            and the content of the annotation.  The flexibility of annotation servers 
            such as Annotea (<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/">http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/</a>) and 
            Zope (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.zope.org/">http://www.zope.org/</a>) 
            allows a user to make any number of annotations to a single document. 
            In addition, a user can make annotations to existing annotations. This 
            facility is expected to be of great use in museums as information about 
            the same thing can be contributed from different discipline perspectives. 
      </p>

      <p>The W3C annotation client Amaya (<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/">http://www.w3.org/Amaya/</a>) offers the user 
            a functional interface for posting, modifying and deleting annotations 
            on the annotation servers (Fig. 2). Kateli and Nevile (Kateli &amp; 
        Nevile, 2004) have developed use cases for creating accessible annotations 
        in an educational environment for students with special needs. Museum 
        interpreters can extend these to enrich content by including images, 
        sound and other features using methods described in those use cases. 
        AnnoSource (<a target="_blank"
href="http://matchbox01.cs.latrobe.edu.au/annosource/">http://matchbox01.cs.latrobe.edu.au/annosource/</a>) 
            created by Kateli (2004) for the Matchbox project is an experimental 
            annotation client that extends author information. Currently AnnoSource 
            uses the 'Friend of a Friend' (FOAF) specification (Brickley &amp; Miller, 
            2004) to tailor 'author' for greater descriptive use in a cultural environment. 
            For example, Mr. Tommy George is an Aboriginal Elder from the Quinkan 
            tribe; he is an expert in Aboriginal cultural heritage. Using AnnoSource, 
            any additional information he contributes can be associated with his 
            authorship, described in a standardized format, giving a later user 
        greater access to information about the author of the annotation. </p>
      <p>Museums who integrate annotation servers and clients offer a valuable 
            service to their users. Now not only can people use Museum systems to 
            retrieve information, but they can also use them to publish their own 
            materials and share them with the world. Academics can add reports of 
            their expeditions. Aboriginal community members can catalogue stories, 
        myths and locations of ancient cultural artifacts (Fig. 3 ). </p>

      <h1>Annotations &#8211; Interpreting Aboriginal art in 'Quinkan Country'  
      </h1>
      <p class="BlockQuote">This is our place. Our country. The country of our 
            ancestors. The spirits of our ancestors live here. In the rocks, those 
            sand stone escarpments. Our ancestors made that art your see on the 
            rocks. The Quinkans do their work at night. The good ones and those 
            bad ones. The pictures and paintings of the past are our link with the 
            present. This is our country. The place of our ancestors. You have to 
            know that way to understand Aboriginal way. The land gives us what we 
            need. Food, shelter, tradition, law, dance. They were put there in the 
            dreaming. That way we live. All things work together: the land, the 
            law, the culture, the heritage. That way things work.  <em>Tommy George 
      &amp; George Musgrave</em> (George &amp; Musgrave, 1995) </p>
      <p>Cape York, located in far North Queensland, Australian, is home to 
            'Quinkan Country' covering approximately 1000 square miles, located 
            on the Cape York Peninsula in the far north of Australia. A diverse 
            environment of barren Australian outback and lush tropical savannah, 
            it contains one of the largest collections of rock art paintings in 
            the world, dating back almost 36,000 years (Lissonnet &amp; Nevile, 
            2003) . The invasion of the land caused by the gold rush of 1873 led 
            to great conflict between the 'newcomers' and the Aboriginal people 
            who were defending their land. As a result, tribes were brutally massacred, 
            and many surviving people lost contact with their families. &#8220;It 
            is one the darkest moments in the history of this country&#8221; (George 
        &amp; Musgrave, 1995) . The locations of ancient rock art sites were 
        forgotten for many decades. </p>
      <p>Some rock art galleries were re-discovered among giant sandstones in 
            1960 by road building workers in the main community of Laura (Trezise, 
            1969) . Percy Trezise, a bush pilot, soon found more galleries while 
            on low-level flights over the Quinkan region. He began cataloguing sites, 
            paintings and interpretations passed on through generations by tribal 
            elders. Archeologists first started excavations at Mushroom Rock near 
            Laura in mid-1963. This led to further work by researchers in zoology, 
            botany, geology and geomorphology (Morwood &amp; Hobbs, 1995) . Annotations 
            from experts in such disciplines will not only enrich the resources 
            but will also allow for focused interrogation of the complete range 
        of information. </p>
      <h1>Scenarios</h1>
      <p>The following scenarios show how different user groups can include 
            interpretations and research information in annotations for a rock art 
            image. (The images and text are taken from a book written by Mr. Tommy 
            George and Mr. George Musgrave, two Aboriginal elders. They are used 
            here to illustrate the potential of the new technology.) The scenario's

          <h2>Example 1</h2>
          <p>Julia asks Mr. Tommy George, a Kuku-Thypan elder who lives at Laura, 
            to give his interpretation on Imjim. Mr. George tells his story: </p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">Imjim is a bad bugger. That Imjim came from up Battle 
            Camp way to look for a wife. He found that wife at Split Rock and that's 
            where he stayed. You can see him and his wife with that red dingo  (George 
          &amp; Musgrave, 1995) .</p>
          <p>Julia catalogues the above interpretation by creating an annotation 
            using Amaya (Figure 5 ). She later visits another tribe and some very 
            old people tell her about Imjim:</p>
          <p class="BlockQuote">They are called Anurra, spirit figures who bounced 
            about like kangaroos at night on their long knobbed penis; they can 
            bounce half a mile in one hop and live like frogs. The female Anurra 
            use their breasts to bounce around in the same way   (George &amp; Musgrave, 
            1995) .</p>
          <p>Julia takes the information and includes an audio/visual link which 
            directs a user to comments made later by children (Figure 6 ).</p>

          <p class="caption">Figure 6: Interpretation by the community</p>
          <h2>Example 2</h2>
          <p>Jim is browsing the World Museum catalogue and views the annotations 
            made by Julia. He remembers that he had collected data on a similar 
            image while excavating at Red Bluff near Laura (Morwood &amp; Hobbs, 
            1995) . He uses annotations as a means of publishing some of his findings, 
            including excavation notes, painting layers, colors and carbon-dating. 
            He does this without changing the original document or original annotations 
            made by Julia (Figure 7 ).</p>

          <h2>Example 3</h2>
          <p>Maria finds annotations extremely useful for locating additional information 
            about resources. She wants her students to include information inserted 
            by Julia and Jim for their assignment. Using Babel Fish (<a target="_blank"
href="http://world.altavista.com/">http://world.altavista.com/</a>) she decides 
            to make annotations that translate Julia's information into Italian 
            (Figure 8 ).</p>

          <h1>Richer Experiences: Personalisation using AccessForAll</h1>
          <p>The AccessForAll Metadata specification (<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility/">http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility/</a>) 
            was designed for use by institutions that have diverse users. To test 
            its effectiveness and set a new standard in accessibility, the Advanced 
            Technology Research Center (ATRC) at the University of Toronto developed 
            The Inclusive Learning Exchange (TILE) that uses the AccessForAll specifications 
            to allow students to create user profiles to specify control, display 
            and content accessibility preferences. Nevile and others (Nevile et 
            al., 2004) offer a use case showing Maria, a dyslexic student, using 
            the AccessForAll profile to have her learning environment adjusted to 
            her unique needs. The system presents her with a rich individualized 
            experience and enhances her learning environment by allowing her to 
            choose her own control preferences, device needs such as screen readers 
            and content modalities. WebForAll (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.web4all.ca/">http://www.web4all.ca</a>) 
            uses the AccessForAll profiles so a given user can load a personal profile 
            using Smart-Card technology and have the computer automatically configured 
            to suit their needs, and then have the computer returned to the original 
            state ready for the next user. Museums could create 'default' AccessForAll 
            profiles not only for their on-line users but also for visiting tour 
            groups: </p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <div class="listwithnumbers"> 
              Primary/high school and tertiary students: Museums can create AccessForAll 
              default profiles to suit groups visiting on field trips. For example, 
              there could be a simple display for young high school students and 
              a more academic display for university students and academics. Each 
              person could then tailor these profiles further based on their individual 
              needs. </div>
          </li>
          <li>Tourists: A group of young German tourists wants to visit World Museum 
            to view their famous cultural artifacts. Bill, the information technology 
            manager, creates an AccessForAll default profile to customize language 
            settings. This will allow any tourists seeking information to retrieve 
            information that is catalogued in German.  </li>
          <li>Mature/senior visitors: Larger text, and contrasting foreground and 
            background color combinations can help mature people viewing resource 
            material. </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="Section1">
          <p>The Matchbox system extends the utility of the <em>Content</em> element 
            of the AccessForAll profile for interaction with annotations. For example, 
            Lucas is visiting the 'World Museum'. He uses the AccessForAll service 
            offered by the Museum to load his personal profile. He then modifies 
            the content preferences so that he sees resources with annotations made 
            by Aboriginal Elders. His colleague is more interested in geology and 
            so wants to see the annotations made by the geologists. He also uses 
            a modified AccessForAll service.</p>
          <h1>Future Work</h1>
          <p>Our aim is to offer AnnoSource as a flexible annotation management 
            tool for educational institutions such as schools, libraries and museums. 
            Integration of FOAF will allow for rich descriptions of interpreters, 
            cultural social networks and knowledge domains. This information can 
            then be shared with other FOAF networks to create a rich semantic environment. 
            AnnoSource will also support the accessibility needs and requirements 
            of individual users by offering services to personalize control, display 
            and content of annotations. In addition, we are investigating how we 
            can create annotation Web servers that automatically create annotations 
            by exploiting metadata information about resources. For example, Lucas 
            can state in his AccessForAll profile that all information entered within 
            the period 1990-2000 is to be displayed and the rest is to be offered 
            only through annotations. Lucas can further streamline his preferences 
            to state that only annotations made by Aboriginal elders containing 
            interpretation of rock-art images are to be displayed. This will give 
            museums the ability to extend current information retrieval methods 
            by offering more relevant resource materials to their range of users 
            without having to change their existing content or metadata. </p>
          <h1>Conclusion </h1>
          <p>As users demand more information from the Web, annotation technology 
            can be used by Museums to enrich individual experience. The Matchbox 
            system adopts these technologies to catalogue interpretive information 
            on Quinkan cultural heritage. Various scenarios demonstrate how different 
            user groups such as Quinkan tribal elders, archaeologists, and teachers 
            can create annotations about a rock art image to contribute knowledge 
            through stories and academic information. The AccessForAll profile encourages 
            Museums to create a more 'user centric' environment by allowing users 
            to personalize display, control and content preferences. As new annotation 
            technologies such as AnnoSource emerge, Museums can offer their users 
            more relevant and accessible information.</p>
