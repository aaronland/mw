        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The <em>Pachyderm 2.0 Project</em> is a partnership led by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nmc.org/">NMC: 
          The New Media Consortium</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfmoma.org/">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA)</a>, 
          and funded by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imls.gov/">Institute for Museum 
          and Library Services (IMLS)</a>. The project brings software development 
          teams and digital library experts from six NMC universities together 
          with counterparts from five major museums to create a new, open source 
          authoring environment for creators of Web-based and multimedia learning 
          experiences. The new tool will be based on Pachyderm, the authoring 
          and publishing tool developed by SFMOMA to author its successful series, 
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfmoma.org/msoma/index.html"><em>Making Sense of Modern Art</em></a>.</p>
        <p>The original tool was custom-developed by and for SFMOMA and is 
          particularly suited to the needs of a modern art museum. Pachyderm has 
          a work flow that reflects the team-oriented style used by SFMOMA 
          to develop its innovative flash-based Web features. The success of Pachyderm 
          within the museum culture at SFMOMA led staffers to believe that the 
          extension of the Pachyderm tool &#8211; in a revised format &#8211; to the museum and higher education community, could transform the way 
          these key institutions present, share, and interpret content. To this 
          end, SFMOMA staff applied for and won a National Leadership grant to 
          create an open source version of Pachyderm that could be widely used 
          and adapted by a variety of different audiences.</p>
        <p>A tool with such a diverse user base presents a challenge in terms 
          of design and development. Obviously, the requirements for Pachyderm 
          2.0 would differ greatly from the original specifications and requirements 
          used by SFMOMA for the creation of the original tool. The team &#8211; 
          composed of museum professionals, software developers, pedagogy experts, 
          educators, and others &#8211; selected a user-centered approach for 
          gathering requirements, one that would help to ensure the final product 
          was as user-friendly as possible.</p>
        <p>The process, which can be easily adapted to other projects, begins 
          with collecting source documents and identifying gaps in the document 
          library. Gaps are filled by activities such as scenario development 
          and user observations. The sources are mined for requirements using 
          a simple but thorough procedure. Requirements are collected, sorted, 
          classified, prioritized, and finally assembled into a requirements specification 
          that guides development. This paper describes in detail how this process 
          was applied to the development of Pachyderm 2.0. </p>
        <h1>Gathering Requirements</h1>
        <p>Source documents for Pachyderm 2.0 included existing historical documents 
          such as the grant proposal, specifications for Pachyderm 1.0, and other 
          pieces that had been written as the project was conceived. New data 
          were gathered through user studies, persona- and scenario-writing exercises, 
          surveys, and user observations; the documentation of these efforts joined 
          the source library, and the bulk of the 300 or so requirements were 
          derived from these. Requirements were captured from the assembled documents 
          and recorded in a tracking database created for the purpose. For smaller 
          projects, requirements could be captured in a spreadsheet or simply 
          a text file instead.</p>
        <p>All of the project teams (programming, metadata, user interface, and 
          pedagogy) were involved in the requirements-gathering process. Each 
          person brought a unique perspective to the process that helped to ensure 
          a well-rounded set of requirements. </p>
        <h2>Envisioning The Product With Personae And Scenarios</h2>
        <p>Despite the existence of Pachyderm 1.0, it was not clear at first exactly 
          what Pachyderm 2.0 should look like. Very early in the project, the 
          team used personae and scenarios to help create a unified vision of 
          the product and to focus the development effort on making something 
          that would appeal to end-users. One of the first steps taken by the 
          requirements team was to identify primary user types for Pachyderm 2.0. 
          Four primary types were identified: students, faculty, museum personnel, 
          and museum visitors. Two secondary types were also identified: support 
          staff and librarians. Other types of users exist, but these are the 
          major groups. </p>
        <p>The 'typical' Pachyderm user may have a lot of computer experience 
          or none at all. The expected age range is anywhere from a grade school 
          student to a retiree. Note that there are two ways to use Pachyderm: 
          authoring a module or viewing a completed module. In other words, there 
          is no typical Pachyderm user &#8211; this can be almost anyone, at any 
          time, doing anything<em>. </em>The development team envisions authoring 
          as belonging not only to faculty or museum staff, but potentially to 
          students and visitors as well.</p>
        <p>Having identified these user types, the team developed several descriptions 
          of specific but imaginary people (personae) for each group. Each persona 
          includes the following elements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           Biographical information about the imaginary 
            person (name, age, occupation)</li>
        <li> 
           Brief sketch of a typical day or other 
            block of time</li>
        <li> 
           Personality traits that affect how the 
            person does work related to Pachyderm</li>
        <li> 
           Information about his/her level of experience 
            with technology</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>The personae were then used to focus scenarios, or descriptions of 
          activities that take place while someone is using a product or service 
          (in this case, Pachyderm 2.0). Keeping specific, familiar personae in 
          mind while writing allowed the team to consider details that might otherwise 
          have gone undiscovered. The background and experiences of each persona 
          influence the way each scenario activity plays out, revealing new requirements 
          for the end product.</p>
        <p>Scenarios can be as brief as one sentence or as long as several paragraphs. 
          Each scenario should include the following elements: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prerequisites (what has happened prior to this particular scenario?)</li>
        <li> 
           One or more personae (who is involved?)</li>
        <li> 
           Activities (what is happening?)</li>
        <li> 
           Results (what is the ending-state of the 
            scenario?)</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>Thinking through the scenarios helped the project team to think about 
          how actual people will really use Pachyderm 2.0. At the scenario-writing 
          stage, it is more important to focus on what the experience will actually 
          be like from the point of view of the people in the scenario, rather 
          than trying to pin down technical details of how the product will work. 
          This can be difficult for developers, who are very comfortable thinking 
          in terms of technical details; but it is essential to look at the product 
          from the perspective of end users, especially during the early stages 
          of requirements gathering.</p>
        <h3>Personae And Scenarios For Pachyderm 2.0</h3>
        <p>Sample personae developed during the requirements phase are included 
          below for each of the four major user groups. These personae are fictitious 
          and bear no intentional resemblance to any individual person.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Student</em></strong><em>: Liam C.,</em><strong> </strong>Freshman</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Liam is a freshman at a small liberal arts college. He has not decided 
          on a major yet, though he loves music and is an accomplished pianist. 
          Liam is visually impaired and cannot read normal text on a computer 
          screen. He can distinguish large shapes and can read if the type is 
          very large. He learns easily through auditory means and has a roommate 
          who will describe diagrams on the white board to him when they are in 
          the same class.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Faculty</em></strong><em>: Chris F.,</em><strong> </strong>Architecture 
          Professor &#8211; Early Adopter</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Chris is a professor of architecture and an early adopter of technology. 
          She has taught for seven years and is up for tenure at the end of the 
          year. She is always looking for better ways to teach and often uses 
          her weekends to go on-line to see what new learning objects are available. 
          She often uses MERLOT as a resource. She wants to pull together a strong 
          syllabus this year, using a variety of media, and really wants to author 
          her own presentation available on-line for others to use. (Giving back 
          to MERLOT.)</p>
        <p><strong><em>Museum Personnel</em></strong><em>: Charles H.,</em><strong> 
          </strong>New Media Director</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Charles is responsible for new media and works with curators who do 
          not want to be Pachyderm authors but want to have him make projects 
          for them. He needs to interpret the content delivered by the curator 
          and convert it into something that will be easily understood and appreciated 
          by the visitors. His technical skill level is high.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Museum Personnel</em></strong><em>: Jen T.,</em> Docent 
          Trainer</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Jen presents information about the museum's exhibits to her docents 
          prior to the exhibitions. She is familiar with the museum's kiosks (from 
          an end-user perspective) but does not use computers on a regular basis 
          otherwise.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Museum Visitor</em></strong><em>: Carl M.,</em> Retiree</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Carl is a sixty-eight year-old visitor who is retired and looking for 
          ways to use his time that stimulate and interest him. He has an Internet 
          account at the local library and does some limited e-shopping.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Museum Visitor</em></strong><em>: Marjorie R.,</em> Stay-at-home 
          Mom</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Marjorie drops her kids off in the art classes and likes to do something 
          in the Museum while she waits for the classes to be finished. She believes 
          in the arts and wants to have more information about the permanent collection. 
          She has limited technical skills and does not use a computer at home.</p>
        <h3>Sample Scenarios</h3>
        <p>The following scenarios are actual examples from the Pachyderm Scenarios 
          Document.</p>
        <h4>1. Creating a Module Using Placeholder Assets<br />
          Persona: Charles H.</h4>
        <p>Prerequisites: The museum for which he works is hosting a major international 
          exhibition on the Dukes of Burgundy. Can Charles organize all his assets 
          and use them to create a stunning presentation using Pachyderm? </p>
        <p>The museum Charles works for is hosting a major international exhibition 
          11 months from now. Charles is beginning to gather assets &#8211; photographs, 
          QTVR 360s of sculpture, interviews with curators &#8211; but he knows 
          that much of the actual physical assets of the presentation will not 
          be available until just prior to the exhibition &#8211; when the funding 
          will be made available for his team to go over to France and do blitz-kreig 
          photography of the objects in-situ and the landscape. </p>
        <p>Charles has physically story-boarded the entire Pachyderm experience, 
          but needs to actually build the system on the promise of photographs 
          and videos that may or may not be available at the 11th hour. To this 
          end, he has actually crafted two different story-boards, one with assets 
          he is sure he will be able to get in some form or other and a second 
          with the images he hopes to be able to get.</p>
        <p>Even though he may not get the assets until the last moment, the curator 
          he is working with is absolutely certain about the text he wants associated 
          with assets and with how he wants the experience structured. Thus even 
          though Charles cannot get the assets until the last moment, the curator 
          wants to see a functional working model and sign-off on the text prior 
          to his extended vacation in the Bahamas. Using the authoring tool, Charles 
          builds both structures, assigning place-holder images &#8211; clearly 
          indicated as such in the structure of the tool (for example sample.jpg, 
          sample.gif, sample.mov, sample.ani). The resulting presentation includes 
          all the appropriate text and layout, but the spaces for media have blank 
          grey placeholders. When Charles gets the digital images later, it is 
          easy for him to place them in the correct spots.</p>
        <h4>2. Returning to a Saved Work-in-progress<br />
          Persona: Chris F.</h4>
        <p>Prerequisite: Chris started work on her Winter quarter module in late 
          summer, but hasn't worked on it all Fall; it is now two weeks from the 
          start of the Winter quarter.</p>
        <p>Chris can't remember the URL to the Pachyderm system, so she goes to 
          her university home page and types in a Pachyderm search. It takes her 
          to the Pachyderm site at her school, where she is asked to log in. She 
          logs in, and she sees all of the departmental, shared modules as well 
          as the module she started over the summer.</p>
        <p>She clicks <strong>edit</strong> under the name of her module. She 
          gets to the module overview screen, where she sees a storyboard view 
          of her work in progress. She decides right away that she's ordered things 
          incorrectly, so she drags two of the segments around to reorder them.</p>
        <p>She then decides to review the section on <strong>Temples</strong>. 
          She enters it, and sees her side-by-side image comparison screen. She 
          remembers that she hasn't finished adding her text commentary, so she 
          pulls out her lecture notes from last year, and starts paraphrasing 
          as she types in the commentary field.</p>
        <h2>Conceptualizing Changes With User Observations</h2>
        <p>The Pachyderm 2.0 team was interested in testing both the usability 
          of a finished learning module, such as those found by visitors to the 
          SFMOMA Web site or galleries, and the usability of the production environment 
          previously experienced only by SFMOMA staff (who created the system). 
          Since 2.0 will be an open source widely-distributed product, it was 
          important for the team to test both sides of the 1.0 system outside 
          of the SFMOMA environment. As there was little time or money to hire 
          outside evaluators to conduct the studies, team members volunteered 
          to conduct observations and surveys in their own institutions, and in 
          this way were able to study a wide spectrum of users and use cases for 
          very low cost. </p>
        <p>One of the great advantages of developing a 2.0 product is that there 
          already exists a 1.0 from which to gather important information, and 
          in the case of Pachyderm, SFMOMA had already produced many learning 
          objects using the 1.0 platform (see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfmoma.org/">www.SFMOMA.org</a>). 
          The Educational Media Department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art ('the 
          Met') ran an assessment on the usability of the module created by SFMOMA 
          for their recent Philip Guston exhibition, primarily because that same 
          exhibition was on view at the Met at the time and recruiting museum 
          visitors for the study would be facilitated by visitors' interest in 
          learning more about this artist. </p>
        <p>The Met study included Museum staff and visitors of all ages and with 
          varying degrees of technical skill and familiarity with the Web. The 
          Met evaluation staff worked in pairs. One evaluator acted as facilitator, 
          asking each user or group of users to simply go through the feature 
          as if they had come upon it on a Web site or at kiosk in a museum. As 
          in standard usability test procedure, users were requested to 'talk 
          out loud' and explain what they were doing as they were doing it. The 
          facilitator-evaluator continually asked the user why certain actions 
          were taken in order to clarify the reason for decisions made by the 
          user. Users were forthcoming with feedback on what they liked and did 
          not like, and whether they found the features on each screen to be effective 
          and clear.</p>
        <p>The other evaluator in the role of scribe wrote down all comments and 
          actions taken by the user on a form that had pre-printed thumbnails 
          of all of the Pachyderm templates. Using this form the evaluator scribe 
          could quickly associate observations with the correct template screen 
          as the user navigated the site. At the conclusion of each session, both 
          evaluators went over the forms and filled in any other details that 
          were not captured during the usability session.(The templates can be found in the <a href="#Appendix">Appendix</a>.) </p>
        <p>After 20 usability sessions of approximately 45 minutes each, the observation 
          component was concluded. The evaluators concurred that users were repeating 
          mistakes, observations, and suggestions that previous users had already 
          made, and the evaluation team was recording very little new information. 
          As observation information had been recorded according to template type 
          (using the prepared form), the data was already sorted in a useful way 
          and therefore very easy to analyze and summarize into succinct descriptions 
          of usability findings for each of the 12 templates. Figure 1 shows an 
          example of one of the screens, followed by the description of the results 
          of the observations.</p>
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a><img src="smithR.fig1.jpg" width="400" height="188" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Pachyderm 1.0"/></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig 1: Pachyderm 1.0 Zoom Screen: one of the templates 
          examined in the user observations.</p>
        <p>The Zoom Screen presented several problems. Even with the directions, 
          many of our users did not understand that there was a zoom feature on 
          this template (1). However, once they did figure out how to work the 
          zoom, they liked the results. Many found the manner in which the audio 
          content was indicated and described to be confusing. They questioned 
          why there were two sets of controls, and felt that more descriptive 
          labels were needed (2). Also, many of our users were confused by the 
          location of the back button at the bottom of the page, as opposed to 
          the usual location on other screens at the top right (3).</p>
        <p>The report also included comments pertaining to overall look and feel 
          and suggestions for improvements. For example, users complained about 
          the small size of the window (dictated by an earlier incarnation of 
          Flash), and the frequent use of the decorative orange frame as a place 
          for important directions (<strong>drag the circles together</strong>…) 
          seemed too subtle for many visitors. Some navigational buttons were 
          difficult to find and understand as their placement was inconsistent 
          and their shapes were similar to buttons used for other kinds of information. 
          Users asked for a wide range of new features such as breadcrumbs (a 
          tracking system common to Web navigation by which visitors see a list 
          of the pages traveled and click on a page name to return there), an 
          index, and a print-friendly screen option. It was interesting to note 
          that although users were tested at a kiosk in a museum, they expected 
          the Pachyderm templates to operate as Web pages, with, for example, 
          a back button in the same place as on a Web browser and text characteristics 
          that allowed for cut, paste, and easy searching. </p>
        <h2>Deriving Requirements From Scenarios And User Observations</h2>
        <p>The process of transforming a group of documents into usable development 
          requirements is time-consuming but not difficult. Continuing with the 
          examples presented, this paper discusses how requirements were mined 
          from the scenarios and user observation records.</p>
        <h3>From Scenarios To Requirements </h3>
        <p>By reading between the lines of the scenarios, the team can start to 
          compile a list of <em>assumptions</em> about the product, user and system 
          <em>requirements</em> for the product, and <em>issues</em> that must 
          be resolved. </p>
        <p>Assumptions are basic facts or limitations that the development team 
          must work with. For example, some projects assume that all access will 
          be via a Web browser. Issues are unresolved questions: these questions 
          will need to be answered, either by finding a solution or by deciding 
          not to include a given feature in the current version of the product. 
          Both assumptions and issues should be noted in the requirements document.</p>
        <p>Requirements are the basic functions that a system needs to be able 
          to carry out in order to perform the task(s) for which it was designed. 
          The meat of a requirements document is, of course, the list of requirements. 
          <em>User requirements</em> are functions that someone using the system 
          will see or use. <em>System requirements</em> (also called technical 
          requirements) are behind-the-scenes technical functions that the system 
          must be capable of doing in order to support the user requirements. 
        </p>
        <p>The following questions are helpful when pulling requirements out of 
          scenarios:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What is the user trying to do?</li>
        <li>What part of that task is facilitated by the system or product?</li>
        <li>What part of that task is independent of the system or product?</li>
        <li>What has to happen 'behind the scenes' while the user does this task?</li>
        <li>
           What does the user see on the screen while 
            working on the task?</li>
      </ul>
      
        <p>The answers to these questions will lead to statements of user and 
          system requirements. For example, applying the questions to the second 
          scenario above:</p>
        <p><em>What is the user trying to do?</em> The user wants to open a module 
          she began some time ago and pick up where she left off.</p>
        <p><em>What part of that task is facilitated by the system or product? 
          </em>The system stores her incomplete module and gives her access to 
          it. (Implied requirements: there must be a way to save work in progress; 
          there must be a way to find and return to saved work.)</p>
        <p><em>What part of the task is independent of the system or product?</em> 
          Finding the URL or link to the Pachyderm system is not part of Pachyderm 
          itself and implies no system-related requirements. Often, scenarios 
          will include 'flavor text' that helps to set the stage but has no direct 
          bearing on requirements.</p>
        <p><em>What has to happen 'behind the scenes' while the user does this 
          task? </em>The system has to <strong>know</strong> who Chris is and 
          which modules are hers or accessible by her. The system has to allow 
          her to rearrange her screens somehow. The system has to be able to accept 
          text that she types into a field. (Implied requirements: there are persistent 
          user accounts with logins; users are associated with presentations they 
          have created and/or have access to; screens can be reordered in the 
          authoring system; the authoring tool allows users to type into text 
          fields.)</p>
        <p><em>What does the user see on the screen while working on the task? 
          </em>Chris sees a list of modules she can edit. When she picks one, 
          she sees all the screens in her module; later she looks closely at one 
          screen in particular. (Implied requirements: the system lists user-editable 
          modules; the user can select one module to edit it; the system displays 
          an overview of a module showing all screens; the user can select one 
          screen to edit; the system displays an editable version of the selected 
          screen.)</p>
        <h3>From User Observations To Requirements</h3>
        <p>It was very easy for the Pachyderm team to derive requirements from 
          the observation report written by the Met staff as it contained the 
          range of specific data (rationale, stakeholders, etc.) needed to complete 
          the requirement listing. In a day-long group meeting, team members took 
          portions of the report, translated every observation into a requirement, 
          and gave each a category and a priority. For the most part, correcting 
          navigational flaws were given high priority (&quot;essential&quot;) 
          while suggestions for new features was given a lower priority (desirable) 
          especially if it was perceived by the group to be a difficult task for 
          the Pachyderm platform to support. </p>
        <p>Working as a group allowed questions about categorization and programming 
          implications to be discussed by a wide range of team talents. For example, 
          the users' request to have cut and paste functionality within a module 
          seemed modest to an educator, but the programmers who are more familiar 
          with the limitations of the Flash platform and anticipated version enhancements 
          had another opinion. During the requirement building process, team members 
          frequently sought input from others so that each entry could be as complete 
          as possible. Having complete information about each requirement greatly 
          facilitated the next step of refining the list and establishing an overall 
          priority. </p>
        <h3>Sample Requirements</h3>
        <p>The following requirements are actual samples from the Pachyderm 2.0 
          Requirements Specification.</p>

          data that should be &quot;remembered&quot; by the system so users don't

        <h1>Dealing with Requirements</h1>
        <p>Once the requirements had been pulled from the sources and entered 
          into the database, they were carefully refined, sorted according to 
          which team would be dealing with each requirement, and prioritized. 
          This process took several weeks to complete, and the resulting document 
          (nearly 100 pages) served as the 'road map' during development. Naturally, 
          requirements evolve during development, and a change process was in 
          place to handle this. The requirements document also serves as a checklist 
          during post-development system testing.</p>
        <h2>Writing, Sorting, And Prioritizing Requirements</h2>
        <p>A requirement begins as a statement of something the system must supply 
          or be capable of doing: <em>The system must support persistent user 
          accounts.</em> As the requirement is examined, the original statement 
          may be refined to make it more specific. It is also useful to collect 
          other data along with the requirement, such as a rationale describing 
          why the requirement is needed, the name of the person who recorded the 
          requirement, the users who will be most affected by the requirement, 
          and so on.</p>
        <p>Most of the work of capturing requirements for Pachyderm 2.0 occurred 
          at a single face-to-face meeting. Using wireless connectivity and the 
          on-line requirements tracking database, the team divided the source 
          documents and worked in small groups to pull as many requirements as 
          possible from the sources. Each requirement was entered into the database, 
          along with the rationale, the name of the source, the names of the people 
          recording it, the desired priority of the requirement, and other information. 
          The team spent two days doing nothing but capturing requirements. At 
          the end of that time, over 200 requirements had been recorded.</p>
        <p>The next step was to sort the requirements according to the part of 
          the system to which they pertained. This was done at a distance over 
          a period of several days using the database. Each team was responsible 
          for one part of the system; the teams then went through their requirements 
          to classify them and assign official priorities. Requirements assigned 
          an <strong>essential</strong> priority are to be completed in Phase 
          One (by Oct. 2005). A draft requirements document was compiled, reviewed 
          by all the teams and discussed in detail at the 2004 Spring Meeting 
          (April 2004, see<a
href="http://www.nmc.org/pachyderm/docs/PachySpec1.5.pdf" target="_blank"> Pachyspec 1.5</a>).</p>
        <h2>Validating Requirements</h2>
        <p>Once the teams agreed on the draft document, it was submitted to volunteer 
          readers from each of the core user groups. The readers who were selected 
          had varying degrees of comfort and experience with technology. They 
          were asked to review some of the requirements (not all: many are very 
          technical in nature) and comment on the features that would be included. 
          Specifically, they were asked whether the included features were desirable 
          as written; whether any important features seemed to be missing; and 
          whether the priorities assigned to features matched with their needs 
          (i.e., were there any features the users thought were <strong>critical</strong> 
          that had been prioritized as lower than <strong>essential</strong>?). 
          Results of the validation were positive; the feature list in the requirements 
          specification matched users' expectations and desires.</p>
        <h2>Requirements Evolve</h2>
        <p>All good program teams recognize that requirements for a project are 
          seldom written in stone. As soon as actual development of a tool begins, 
          the requirements themselves begin to change. The challenge for the Pachyderm 
          team, as for any team, was to keep a handle on the evolving requirements 
          and to make sure that changes in requirements did not, in any significant 
          way, change the goal of the actual project: the creation of a flexible 
          tool that could be easily used to create content-rich presentations 
          with a simple but beautiful set of highly intuitive human interface 
          templates.</p>
        <p>One aspect of the requirements that has become increasingly apparent 
          as the beta test has progressed is the need for a common vocabulary 
          of both literary and visual terms to describe both the templates and 
          the actions encompassed by the templates. SFMOMA had developed an internal 
          vocabulary and work-flow which enabled them to work with the original 
          Pachyderm, but as the partners for Pachyderm 2.0 came from a variety 
          of museums and institutions of higher learning, use of SFMOMA's proprietary 
          phrases like <em>the artist-in-context screen</em> and the <em>phone-dial</em> 
          caused some confusion. This ultimately led to a discussion to determine 
          a more commonly agreed-upon set of names for the individual templates 
          in the major template set that reflected the broad scope of Pachyderm 
          2.0. This is just one example of an initiative that was not a requirement 
          coming out of the original scenarios but that evolved as the team needed 
          to find a common language to discuss this new tool being created.</p>
        <p>Other requirements evolved as the development team discovered limitations 
          to, or possibilities created by, the technology used to create the system. 
          Further testing of the new interface design revealed requirements that 
          were not uncovered in the first round, and these went through a screening 
          process before they were added to the requirement listing. Protecting 
          the integrity of the requirements document without being inflexible 
          is a delicate balance; having a specific change process in place, ready 
          for issues that might come up, helped a great deal.</p>
        <p>The change process used for Pachyderm 2.0 was relatively simple. The 
          proposer of the new or changed requirement wrote up a brief description 
          of the change, a rationale for making the change, and a list of affected 
          end-users. The requirement was classified and submitted to the appropriate 
          team (usually development/programming) for a feasibility review. Priority 
          for the change was assigned based on the importance of the change to 
          end users and the difficulty of implementation, and the accepted requirement 
          was included in an addendum to the official specification. In rare cases, 
          proposed changes or new requirements were determined to be out of scope, 
          in which case they were listed in that section of the addendum so as 
          not to lose the idea entirely.</p>
        <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
        <p>Apart from schedule adjustments that occurred as the process unfolded, 
          the project followed the plan for gathering requirements more or less 
          as intended. Over the course of the requirements writing period, the 
          team learned to work effectively at a distance. In addition, several 
          side benefits of the requirements specification became evident as the 
          project progressed.</p>
        <h2>Working Effectively At A Distance</h2>
        <p>Since the project team was distributed over North America, certain 
          challenges arose having to do with working remotely. Documents were 
          exchanged in electronic form, and wherever possible, collaborative technologies 
          were used to avoid duplication of effort. For example, the requirements 
          were captured in a database to which everyone on the team had access 
          so that the current listing of requirements was available at any time. 
          <strong>Wikis</strong> were used by the development team to keep track 
          of progress on requirements as well. </p>
        <p>Regular conference calls kept the participants in touch and aware of 
          deadlines and progress. The team found that having a steady <em>pulse</em> 
          for the project helped keep people on track even when other responsibilities 
          intervened. The difficult work of prioritizing requirements, which involves 
          balancing several factors for each requirement under consideration, 
          was done in conference calls so that all opinions could be heard.</p>
        <h2>Side Benefits Of Having User Requirements</h2>
        <p>The team found that the process of collecting requirements was valuable 
          in itself, because it provided a forum for everyone to think about and 
          discuss what the end product would look like. In the beginning, everyone 
          had a different idea about what would be built; working through the 
          process of capturing and refining requirements helped the team to come 
          together with a shared vision. </p>
        <p>Having the document to refer to during development helped keep the 
          team focused. When the question arose whether to adopt a new technology 
          (APOLLO; please see <em>Architecting the Elephant: Software Architecture 
          and User Interface Design for Pachyderm 2.0</em> for more details), 
          the decision-making process was framed in terms of whether the functions 
          added by APOLLO would conform to the requirements specification. A requirement-by-requirement 
          review was conducted to assess whether adopting APOLLO would be an appropriate 
          step.</p>
        <h1>The Take-Away</h1>
        <p>The process described here focuses on the user as the source for 
          most of the requirements. It can be adapted to projects of various sizes, 
          and because none of the methods involve great expense, it is appropriate 
          for small teams as well as large ones. The key elements are a strong 
          collection of source documents from which to pull requirements; a range 
          of user-based studies (scenarios and observations in this case; focus 
          groups, task analysis, or other methods may also be appropriate); a 
          requirements collection process anchored with a simple format for recording 
          requirements; and a thorough sorting, classifying, and prioritizing 
          effort. The time involved is considerable, especially for large projects; 
          but the end result is well worth the effort.</p>
