      <p id="abstract">Project Naming is a trilingual Web exhibition and searchable 
        photographic database available in English, French and Inuktitut on Library 
        and Archives Canada's Web site. It is a collaborative effort between Nunavut 
        Sivuniksavut, a special college program based in Ottawa, and serving Inuit 
        Youth from Nunavut; the Government of Nunavut's Department of Culture, 
        Language, Elders and Youth; and Library and Archives Canada. The goal 
        of this project is the identification of Inuit portrayed in the photographic 
        collections of Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa. It is an ongoing 
        initiative which enables Nunavut Youth to connect with Elders and to better 
        understand their past. It also helps to bridge the cultural differences 
        and geographical distances between the territory of Nunavut and the more 
        southern parts of Canada. </p>

      <p class="blockquote">Seen through the eyes of civilization, the good that 
        these purveyors of trade and religion did is incalculable. But the exploited 
        Inuit saw their once-strong traditional culture left to disintegrate and 
        flounder. For countless generations the Inuit had had an iron grip on 
        their culture; it took less than one generation for it to be put through 
        the government's cultural mill, never to be melded back to its original 
        form.  <strong> </strong></p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Alootook Ipellie 1992)</p>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Library and Archives Canada is the nation's largest repository of archival 
        and historical material. In its collection are thousands of photographs 
        depicting the North and the people who live there, ranging from the 1850s 
        to the present. Over the years, Library and Archives Canada has formed 
        partnerships with various communities, utilizing the latest communications 
        technology such as the Internet, to make its vast collections more accessible 
        to a wide variety of audiences, from the general public to academic researchers. 
        <em>Project Naming</em> is one of these initiatives. A trilingual Web 
        exhibition and searchable photographic database, it is available in English, 
        French and Inuktitut. </p>
      <p>The goal of <em>Project Naming</em> is to make these photographic collections 
        more accessible to the Inuit, Canadians and the world, and at the same 
        time enable Inuit to identify the people depicted in them. It is an ongoing 
        project, with the aim of fostering discussions between Nunavut youth and 
        Elders as a way to reconnect with the past. It also helps to bridge cultural 
        differences and geographical distances between Nunavut and the more southern 
        parts of Canada. </p>
      <p>It is helpful to clarify some terminology and the way the photographic 
        descriptions and community names are presented. Historically, Aboriginal 
        people living in Arctic Canada were described by the dominant white culture 
        as Eskimos and Natives, both terms now outdated. Today they are called 
        Inuit in the plural form, while Inuk refers to one Inuit person. Inuktitut 
        is the traditional oral language of Inuit in the Arctic. Spoken in Canada 
        and Greenland, as well as in Alaska, Inuktitut and its many dialects are 
        used by peoples from region to region, with some variations. In the late 
        1800s, a written system was developed for Inuktitut. Today, Inuit living 
        in different parts of the Canadian Arctic use Qaluijaaqpait (Roman orthography) 
        or Qaniujaaqpait (syllabics), or sometimes both. </p>
      <p>Until recently, Nunavut was part of the Northwest Territories, officially 
        becoming its own territory in 1999. The photographs digitized for <em>Project 
        Naming</em> were taken at a time when the English names were considered 
        the official community names as part of the Northwest Territories. Today, 
        with the creation of Nunavut and name recognition initiatives throughout 
        the Arctic, some communities, such as Iqaluit and Arviat, have officially 
        changed back to their original Inuit names. When locations are described 
        in this paper, communities are listed by their Inuit name or by the English 
        name, followed by the other in parenthesis. </p>
      <p>In terms of the photographic descriptions, the original title appears 
        first, followed by new information provided by Elders in square brackets. 
        Unless stated otherwise, all of the images are from the collections of 
        Library and Archives Canada.</p>
      <h1>Part I: Background</h1>
      <p>Describing the legacy of outside contact in the Arctic, Alootook Ipellie 
        (1992: 51) argues that the arrival of explorers, whalers, traders, missionaries, 
        scientists and others began irreversible cultural changes to every aspect 
        of Inuit life. Inuit experienced their first <em>contact</em> with the 
        outside world around 1840 when European and American whalers began making 
        yearly trips to Arctic regions, while explorers sailed the same waterways 
        in search of the Northwest Passage to the Orient (Fig. 1). These two groups 
        introduced the Inuit to guns, cloth, metal, tools and utensils, musical 
        instruments and dances, as well as alcohol and tobacco, and diseases.

      <p>As the whaling industry declined towards the end of the nineteenth century, 
        the Arctic fur trade began its expansion. By the early 1900s the Hudson 
        Bay Company was well established throughout the Arctic, building posts 
        wherever there was a concentration of Inuit. </p>
      <p>Whereas Inuit had been self-sufficient for centuries, the Hudson Bay 
        Company established a relationship in which the Inuit depended on the 
        company for their survival. Furs were traded by Inuit for European commodities, 
        items that they became accustomed to having (Ipellie, 1992). There exist 
        many examples in the collections that document the promotion of commercial 
        products, including this 1924 photograph (Fig. 2) from the Department 
        of Indian and Northern Affairs collection. Such images were taken as a 
        way for the federal government to exert its control and dominance over 
        the Arctic and its people.</p>

      <p>The late nineteenth century also witnessed the arrival of Anglican and 
        Catholic missionaries to the Arctic. As a way of introducing Inuit to 
        Christianity and the Bible, the missionaries began developing a written 
        system for Inuktitut. In 1876 in Baffin region, Anglican minister, E.J. 
        Peck, started translating the New Testament, and some hymns, into Inuktitut 
        by adapting Cree syllabics, developed fifty years earlier. In 1894, Baffin 
        Island's first permanent church mission was established near Pangnirtung 
        (Pangnirtuuq), where syllabics were taught to Inuit.</p>
      <p>The creation of a system of writing of Inuktitut had major repercussions 
        upon Inuit and the origins of their names (Brown, 2002). Traditional Inuit 
        names reflect all aspects of what is important in their culture: environment, 
        landscape, kinship, animals, birds and spirits. Elders named babies after 
        relatives or favourite people, so that the deceased may live forever, 
        and individuals were said to receive power from their names, especially 
        if named after a shaman (Brown, 2002). </p>
      <p>As a way of breaking with the traditional religious beliefs practiced 
        by Inuit, the missionaries renamed them, drawing upon the Bible for inspiration. 
        Thus, Matthew was transformed into Mathewsie, John into Joanasie, Elizabeth 
        into Ilisapie, Mary into Miali (Fig. 3) and so forth.</p>

      <p>It was not uncommon for the Inuktitut version of the biblical name to 
        be dropped completely and individuals to assume new anglophone identities, 
        as seen in Figure 4. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Many Inuit adopted Christian names as a demonstration to the Church that 
        they had put ancient traditions behind them (Brown 2002). Still, there 
        existed a form of resistance as many continued using their Inuktitut name 
        within their communities and their families. As Ann Meekijuk Hanson (1999) 
        recalls, "Among ourselves, we always used our ancient names. So when I 
        was baptized, I became Annie, but to my parents and elders, I was Lutaaq, 
        Pilitaq, Pallug, or Inusiq.&quot;</p>
      <p>In addition to the variations in regional dialects, missionaries and 
        other southerners had difficulty in pronouncing words in Inuktitut, as 
        the phonology differs greatly from English. Consequently, in documents 
        kept by the Church and other federal institutions, Inuit names were often 
        recorded incorrectly. Typically, "q&quot; was replaced with "k&quot; and 
        "r&quot; with "g&quot;. Nunavut Commissioner Peter Irniq (2005) describes 
        how insulting these misspellings could sometimes be. Ikualaaq is one name 
        that was often spelled incorrectly. Ikualaaq means <em>fire</em> in Inuktitut; 
        however, the "i&quot; and "k&quot; are regularly replaced by "e&quot; 
        and "q&quot;, reducing this name to a very vulgar meaning.</p>
      <p>By the 1920s and 1930s, fluctuating fur prices, epidemics and shortages 
        of wildlife made survival increasingly difficult for many Inuit (McGhee 
        and Crowe, 1999). Over the course of the next several decades, they continued 
        to experience other major upheavals, becoming more and more cut off from 
        their traditional way of life, and living in what many termed  'artificial' 
        communities where Hudson Bay Company posts had been established (Ipellie, 
        1992).</p>
      <p>Following the Second World War, the Canadian Government began to assume 
        full responsibility for the health, education and welfare of Inuit with 
        the introduction of a social welfare program that provided health care, 
        social assistance and family allowance benefits (Fig. 5). </p>

      <p>As a way of administering its recipient records, the Government initiated 
        a number system in the early 1940s in order to count and identify Inuit. 
        Thus, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) began registering Inuit 
        for statistical purposes, and gathered data from one community to the 
        next (Figs. 6-8). </p>

      <p class="caption">Figures 6, 7 and 8 were all taken in August 1945 at Pond 
        Inlet, N.W.T., [Mittimatatlik/Tununiq, Nunavut]</p>
      <p>The RCMP's progress was hampered by the fact that Inuit had no family 
        names, and further complicated by individuals often changing their names 
        as a result of a bad experience (Ipellie, 1992). Moreover, like the missionaries 
        before them, RCMP staff had difficulty in the pronunciation of Inuit names. 
        The Government, therefore, devised another identification system. Every 
        Inuk was assigned a number which was stamped on to a leather disk about 
        3 mm wide that had to be worn around the neck. From thereon, the Government 
        dealt with each individual on the basis of his or her number.</p>
      <p>Describing this complete and utter loss of individual identity, Ann Meekitjuk 
        Hanson (1999) writes:</p>
      <p class="blockquote">To the Canadian government, however, I was Annie E7-121!...E 
        stood for east and W stood for west. We were given a small disc looped 
        on a sturdy string, brown with black lettering. I only learned about the 
        last names when I went to school in Toronto in the early 1960s. My foster 
        parents let me use their family name, so in Toronto I went by Annie Cotterill 
        &#8211; E7-121 was not a very attractive name for a young girl! And when 
        I came back home, I certainly did not want to be Miss E7-121 as a secretary 
        in the government office, so I took my father's first name, Meekitjuk, 
        as a surname.</p>
      <p>This eradication of names, and by extension of personal identities, has 
        had a profound impact upon Inuit. By 2002, following the creation of the 
        territory of Nunavut, approximately 400 people from across the new territory 
        applied to the Nunavut Court of Justice to officially change back to their 
        original names (DeNeen, 2002). </p>
      <p>The number system ended in 1969. The Government then implemented a policy 
        requiring every individual to adopt a surname, despite the fact that this 
        was not part of Inuit tradition. This drive, which eventually became known 
        as Project Surname, was met with a mixed response, prompting confusion 
        and resentment amongst some Inuit (DeNeen, 2002).</p>
      <p>In the early twentieth century Inuit culture experienced yet another 
        assault with the establishment of five residential schools that removed 
        Inuit children as young as five years old from their families and the 
        whole context of Inuit culture, sometimes for years (McGhee and Crowe, 
        1999).  The first Inuit school on Baffin Island was established in 1955, 
        and by 1967,  the Government had erected sixty schools across the Arctic. 
        Children were removed from their communities and sent to these central 
        schools where they were taught in English and given uniforms that replaced 
        their traditional clothing. Thus, the gaps between the older and younger 
        generations were further widened.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the immense changes that Inuit have experienced in the 
        first half of the twentieth century, Inuk filmmaker  Zacharias Kunuk asks</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">4000 years of oral history silenced by fifty years 
        of priests, schools and cable TV? This death of history is happening in 
        my lifetime...What will I answer when I'm an elder and don't know anything 
        about it? Will I have anything to say?   (<em>Geller, 2004: 10</em>).</p>
      <p> As Kunuk's comments reveal, the losses of language, culture and tradition 
        experienced by the younger generations of Inuit have created considerable 
        generation gaps. Younger Inuit have become disconnected from their language, 
        their history and their past. One of the goals of <em>Project Naming</em> 
        has been to allow the younger generation to reconnect and understand their 
        past by sharing memories and stories with Elders.</p>
      <h1>Part II: Project Naming</h1>
      <h2>An Overview </h2>
      <p><em>Project Naming</em> started with the bold premise that past wrongs 
        could be corrected. The archival community and government officials from 
        Nunavut had long recognized that the majority of photographs of Inuit 
        in Library and Archives Canada's collections were not identified. However, 
        it was Murray Angus, an Instructor with the Nunavut Sivuniksavut Training 
        Program, an Ottawa-based post-secondary school for Inuit students, who 
        finally proposed <em>Project Naming</em> as a way to reclaim these <em>lost</em> 
        names. </p>
      <p>Each year students from the college visit Library and Archives Canada 
        to search the card catalogues for photographs of their families and communities 
        in Nunavut (Fig. 9). As part of their visit, the college pays for the 
        students to order a copy of one photograph to take home to their families 
        during the Christmas holidays. </p>

      <p>Similar to other images depicting Aboriginal peoples in the collection, 
        the majority of the Inuit in the photographs researched by the students 
        were either unidenstified or were generically labelled as <em>Eskimo</em> 
        or <em>Native</em>, as seen in Figures 10 and 11. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Frustrated by the lack of information and the anonymity of the people 
        depicted in the photographic collections, Murray Angus approached Library 
        and Archives Canada and the Government of Nunavut about the possibility 
        of collaborating on a joint project with the purpose of recording the 
        names of these anonymous people. The project assumed a sense of urgency, 
        as today's Elders are the only people left able to identify the individuals 
        in these photographs, many of which are now more than forty years old. 
      </p>
      <p>In the winter of 2001, <em>Project Naming</em> was initiated when a partnership 
        was established between Nunavut Sivuniksavut (a unique eight-month college 
        program for Inuit youth based in Ottawa - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nstraining.ca/index.html">http://www.nstraining.ca/index.html</a>), 
        the Government of Nunavut's Department of Culture, Language, Elders and 
        Youth (CLEY) and Library and Archives Canada.  Each institution has been 
        responsible for specific parts of the project. CLEY has provided the funding 
        to Nunavut Sivuniksavut to purchase laptop computers, and for salaries 
        of Inuit youth fieldworkers and student researchers. Nunavut Sivuniksavut 
        has played a pivotal role in coordinating the fieldworkers and students 
        who have worked their way across Nunavut in the identification of the 
        photographs. As people were identified, Nunavut Sivuniksavut entered the 
        data gathered into spreadsheets and sent it to Library and Archives Canada. 
        The work of Library and Archives Canada has focused on researching and 
        digitizing the photographic material, translating new information into 
        Inuktitut, updating and maintaining the databases, and creating and managing 
        the Web exhibition.  Since its inception, <em>Project Naming</em> has 
        progressed through three phases.</p>
      <h2><em>Project Naming</em>: Phase One</h2>
      <p>Phase One began in the spring of 2001 with the digitization of approximately 
        500 photographs by renowned photographer Richard Harrington. Dating from 
        1948 to 1952, these images depict the Inuit he met during his trips to 
        Arviat (Eskimo Point), Kugluktuk (Coppermine), and Igloolik (Iglulik), 
        Tayloyoak (Spence Bay). These scans were sent to Nunavut Sivuniksavut, 
        formatted by Angus into Power Point presentations, and taken on laptop 
        computers by Inuit Youth to the four Nunavut communities where they were 
        shown to Elders for identification. </p>
      <p>In this early phase of the Project, the meetings between Youth and Elders 
        took different formats, including one-on-one conversations and small gatherings 
        with several individuals. In some communities, such as in Arviat (formerly 
        Eskimo Point), everybody over the age of forty was invited to the community 
        centre where the pictures were projected onto a big screen. Audience members 
        called out names of individuals as they recognized their grandparents, 
        their parents and sometimes themselves. Sheba Awa was one of the fieldworkers 
        who visited many Elders in Igloolik (Iglulik), including Eugene Ipkangak, 
        during the winter of 2001 to 2002 (Fig. 12).</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="greenhorn_Fig_13.jpg" width="250" height="191" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Fieldworker Sheba Awa and Elder Eugene Ipkangak"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Figure 12: Fieldworker Sheba Awa and Elder Eugene Ipkangak, 
        Igloolik (Iglulik), winter of 2001 to 2002, Courtesy Nunavut Sivuniksavut 
        Training Program </p>
      <p>The visits between youth and Elders continued through the autumn of 2002 
        and were concluded that winter. Overall, the meetings were a great success. 
        Of the first 500 photographs digitized, Elders identified nearly three-quarters 
        of the individuals depicted in them, and very often, the names of family 
        members and friends. For many images, the Elders also provided anecdotal 
        information describing what life was like for Inuit fifty years ago or 
        the context in which the photograph had been taken. </p>
      <h2><em>Project Naming</em>: Phase Two</h2>
      <p>In the summer of 2003, new research began on photographs taken in the 
        Baffin Region, marking the next phase of the project. This was also the 
        period when I took over as coordinator of <em>Project Naming</em> at Library 
        and Archives Canada. Elisapee Avingaq, a second year student at Nunavut 
        Sivuniksavut, assisted me for several weeks with the research. </p>
      <p>Whereas the images in the first phase of the project were limited to 
        the work of one photographer from the mid-twentieth century, in phase 
        two the scope had greatly expanded in terms of both date and collection. 
        Ranging from the early 1920s to the 1960s, the images from Baffin Region 
        originated from various public and private collections. These include 
        the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, the National 
        Film Board of Canada, Health and Welfare Canada, and the Department of 
        the Interior, as well as the personal collections of Donald Marsh (Anglican 
        Bishop of the Northwest Territories), Charles Gimpel (a British art dealer), 
        William Harold Grant ( a participant in the Canadian Government Expedition 
        of 1922 to the Arctic), and Arthur Tweedle (an optometrist and amateur 
        photographer), to name a few. (see Project Naming: Photo Collections, 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.collectionscanada.ca/inuit/054304-e.html">http://www.collectionscanada.ca/inuit/054304-e.html</a>)</p>
      <p>Approximately 1,400 Baffin area photographs were digitized, described 
        at the item level, and added to the database. The majority of these images 
        had never been copied. Stored in the vaults of Library and Archives Canada, 
        they were largely inaccessible to people from Nunavut. Previously, the 
        only available information for most of these photographs was at the fond 
        (collection) level, making access to them  impossible without the time 
        and the resources to visit Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa to conduct 
        extensive research on-site. </p>
      <p>In December 2003, Mathewsie Ashevak and Tommy Akulukjuk, two students 
        from Nunavut Sivuniksavut, took approximately 500 images from the Baffin 
        region back to their communities of Cape Dorset (Kingait) and Pangnirtung 
        (Pangnirtuuq) during their Christmas holidays. Over a three-week period 
        they met with community Elders in order to identify the anonymous people 
        depicted in these pictures. During this time, other youth met with Elders 
        in the Baffin community of Pond Inlet (Mittimatalik/Tununiq). As with 
        the first phase of the project, these interviews produced very positive 
        results, yielding identifications for almost one-third of the individuals 
        in the photographs from all three communities. </p>
      <p>As with the first phase of the project, Elders provided anecdotal and 
        genealogical information for many photographs, including this picture 
        of Aulaqiaq Duval (Fig. 13). Although blind, she was still able to thread 
        a needle and sew. She was married to William Duval. </p>

      <p>In this next image (Fig. 14), the two women and the baby had never previously 
        been identified. However, with the knowledge of the Elders, we now know 
        that Annie Pijamini is the woman carrying her baby Mimi Pijamini, and 
        that Sowdluapik is the name of the other woman, and that she was married 
        to Josephie Sowdluapik.</p>

      <p>Recalling his experiences with the Elders in the recovery of names, Mathewsie 
        Ashevak (2004) writes: </p>
      <p class="blockquote">It was so exciting showing these Elders the pictures...when 
        I clicked onto each picture, I watched their eyes. As they recognized 
        an individual, they would have a big smile on their faces, and acted as 
        if these pictures were taken just yesterday...before now, I have not talked 
        much with Elders. This experience is new to me, which I really enjoyed. 
        Each time they named a person in the picture, it made me want to go back 
        to the time they started to remember.....While looking at the photographs, 
        the Elders were smiling like they were back in the old days. Pauta saw 
        his father and two sisters, and Kenojuak was able to see her son and husband. 
        When I saw the happiness in their faces, all I could do was smile back 
        at them and be thankful for doing this. </p>
      <p>Before the research of the Baffin area photographs, a consultation was 
        held with Murray Angus (an instructor in the Nunavut Sivuniksavut program 
        ), and it was decided that the emphasis should be placed upon photographs 
        from the 1940s, as there was a greater chance that today's Elders would 
        be able to identify individuals from this era. Many of the photographs, 
        however, were taken ten to twenty years earlier. Given the fact that most 
        of these collections had not been accessed in years, it was important 
        to scan as much material as possible to make it available on the database. 
        The information recounted by Elders exceeded expectations. In a number 
        of photographs dating from the early 1920s, they were able to identify 
        the names of individuals shown in photographs from almost eighty years 
        ago. One such example includes this picture of Atigilik from about 1924 
        (Fig. 15). </p>

      <h2><em>Project Naming</em>: Phase Two</h2>
      <p>As with most archival research and Web design, the second phase of <em>Project 
        Naming</em> met a number challenges, which I will briefly describe.</p>
      <p>Usually community names were recorded in the photo albums or on the backs 
        of photographs. However, many of the images were simply identified as 
        <em>Northwest Territories</em><em>,</em> <em>Eastern Arctic</em><em> Expedition</em>, 
        or even more vaguely, as <em>The Arctic</em>, as evidenced in the photograph 
        of unidentified men from the second series of Health Canada’s Eastern 
        Arctic Patrol files (Fig. 16). </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="greenhorn_Fig_17_e002216380.jpg" width="392" height="580" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Untitled, 1958"/></p>
      <p class="caption">Figure 16: Untitled, 1958, e002216380 <a target="_blank"
href="../../../external.gif?link=http://data2.collectionscanada.ca/e/e089/e002216380.jpg">http://data2.collectionscanada.ca/e/e089/e002216380.jpg</a></p>
      <p>Until 1999, the area of Nunavut was part of the Northwest Territories. 
        Where names of communities were available for photographs, they were recorded 
        using the English version and not the Inuktitut name. Since the creation 
        of Nunavut, some communities have changed back to their original Inuit 
        names. This meant the need to cross check historical atlases with a contemporary 
        map of Nunavut to compare and confirm photographs were actually taken 
        in Nunavut and not the Northwest Territories. To further complicate matters, 
        in a number of cases the names of locations in English provided by the 
        photographers do not even exist in historical atlases.</p>
      <p>The research of the Baffin Region photographs was greatly facilitated 
        with the assistance of Elisapee Avingaq: her knowledge of this region 
        proved to be an invaluable resource. From the central Baffin community 
        of Igloolik (Iglulik), she was able to identify photographs depicting 
        the various Baffin communities from those in Nunavut's other two Regions, 
        Central Arctic (Kitikmeot) and Keewatin (Kivalliq) (Fig. 17), and those 
        of the Northwest Territories by the physical features of the land. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="greenhorn_Fig_18_e_global_mapsmall.jpg" width="400" height="286" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Map of Nunavut's three regions"/></p>

      <p>For example, Elisapee knew that the following photograph (Fig.18) was 
        taken in Pangnirtung (Pangnirtuuq) by the landscape in the foreground 
        and the vista and inlet that lay beyond.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="greenhorn_Fig_19_e002394457small.jpg" width="400" height="271" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Untitled, no date"/></p>

      <p>Prior to this project, I had no in-depth knowledge of the geography of 
        this vast region, and what I did know had been informed and shaped by 
        images taken by photographers from southern Canada. Elisapee's knowledge 
        of the Baffin area landscape, coupled with the fact that she is Inuk, 
        were extremely helpful and time saving during the research of photographs 
        from this area.  This is good<strong> </strong>example of how the knowledge 
        and expertise from the Inuit community have greatly benefited the archival 
        research process.  </p>
      <p>While lack of information and community name changes posed some problems 
        during the research phase, the Inuktitut site raised a number of technical 
        difficulties during the design of the Web exhibition and creation of the 
        database. </p>
      <p>During the early stages of the project, we discussed with Nunavut Sivuniksavut  
        the logistics of making the <em>Project Naming</em> Web exhibition and 
        database available in syllabics and Roman orthography. In the end, we 
        chose to limit this phase of the project to syllabics, with the possibility 
        of making a version in Roman orthography available at a future date.</p>
      <p>Syllabics is a relatively new form of writing, with only a few fonts 
        that are compatible with both Macintosh and PC operating systems. In terms 
        of the database, there is one font that could be used, and it is only 
        accessible with the latest version of Macintosh systems. This presents 
        a series of technical challenges, with the risk of losing, even temporarily, 
        data and the valuable work it represented. It is also an example of the 
        barriers experienced by Indigenous or minority languages, and shows how 
        they have been excluded from the dominant culture. </p>
      <h2><em>Project Naming</em>: Phase Three</h2>
      <p>The third phase of <em>Project Naming</em> took place when the Web exhibition 
        (Fig. 19) was launched in October 2004. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="greenhorn_Fig_20_pn_splash_800X60_r1_c2.jpg" width="274" height="398" border="0" alt="Screen Shot: Project Naming splash page"/></p>

      <p>The Project Naming Web exhibition features essays about the history of 
        the project and the language of Inuktitut, as well as an overview of the 
        photographic collections in Library and Archives Canada. The highlights 
        of this site, however, are the searchable database to the photographs 
        and the section entitled <em>The Naming Continues</em> that contains an 
        electronic form inviting visitors to send Library and Archives Canada 
        information pertaining to individuals portrayed in the photographs. </p>
      <p>Since its launch, we have received new descriptions for approximately 
        twenty photographs that previously had not been identified. One the Web 
        exhibition, a visitor was able to provide the names of six people who 
        attended an event during the Governor General's tour of the North (Fig. 
        20), adding that the photograph was taken in the old garage in Apex, a 
        suburb of Iqaluit, where the community gathered for special events.</p>

      <p>Other responses have been quite emotional and personal. One visitor writes: 
        "For the first time, I saw a picture of the person I am named after, Qajaaq.&quot; 
        In addition to a photograph of Qajaaq, just visible on the far right (Fig. 
        21),  a photograph of his mother (Fig. 22) was also scanned during phase 
        II of the project.</p>

      <p>This past December, students from Nunavut Sivuniksavut returned during 
        their Christmas holidays with another several hundred images from communities 
        in all three regions in Nunavut, and additional images will be taken to 
        more communities later this spring. The new information given by the Elders 
        will most likely be available this coming summer. </p>
      <p>To date, progress on the <em>Project Naming</em> database has progressed 
        relatively slowly, hampered by language issues, geographical distance, 
        and the vastness of the territory. While there is still much work to be 
        done in this visual repatriation project, it is hoped that research and 
        the digitization of our immense photographic collections depicting Inuit, 
        together with our collaborations with Nunavut Sivuniksavut and the Government 
        of Nunavut, will continue in the years to come.  </p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>Important historically, culturally and socially, this project benefits 
        Inuit, the archival community, and all Canadians. It is an excellent example 
        of how the archival community can collaborate with and benefit by the 
        input of a cultural community. Through the pooling of resources and expertise, 
        the photographic collections in Library and Archives Canada have become 
        much richer and more meaningful with the identification of so many faces 
        that had remained anonymous for decades. </p>
      <p>Most Inuit do not own family photographs from their past. Through the 
        digitization of the photographs in Library and Archives Canada's collections, 
        they now have access to their 'family photo albums,' enabling them to 
        reconnect with their ancestors.  At the same time, these photographic 
        collections provide a legacy to be shared by all Canadians for generations 
        to come. Describing the significance of <em>Project Naming</em>, Peter 
        Irniq writes: </p>
      <p class="blockquote">[<em>It</em>] is very important for Inuit, as it is for all Canadians, 
        because it allows us to bring back the Inuit from the past to the present....to 
        see Inuit photographs from the past without names is insulting....[this 
        project] is a Project of the Century. It allows us to name the pictures 
        of the past to reconnect us with modern day Inuit. Most of all, it allows 
        us to reconnect with our relatives. In the naming of photographs, we are 
        ensuring that Inuit live forever through photographs.  (<em>Irniq, 2005)</em></p>
      <p>As with the birth of Nunavut in 1999, <em>Project Naming</em> marks another 
        significant chapter in the lives of Inuit through the reclamation of lost 
        names. </p>
