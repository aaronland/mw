<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Royal
    Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales is a Welsh
    Assembly-Sponsored Public Body based in Aberystwyth, Wales. It maintains and
    curates the National Monuments Record of Wales (NMRW) - the national
    collection of information about the archaeological, architectural and
    historical heritage of Wales, and provides a public information service,
    drawing on both archival and published sources and benefiting from the
  specialist knowledge of its staff. </p>
<p>Information held within the NMRW is made available to the
    public through the Coflein Web service (<a href="http://www.coflein.gov.uk/">http://www.coflein.gov.uk</a>).
    Coflein contains details of many thousands of archaeological sites, monuments,
    buildings and maritime sites in Wales, together with an index to the drawings,
    manuscripts and photographs held in the NMRW archive collections (an increasing
  number of which are being digitized and made available on Coflein). </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Pert-figure1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="400" height="339" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig1: Coflein
  Homepage <a href="http://www.coflein.gov.uk/">http://www.coflein.gov.uk</a></p>
<p>Through the
    Web-based portal Historic Wales (http://www.historicwales.gov.uk), the Royal Commission enables the public
    to search hundreds of thousands of records relating to archaeological
    monuments, historic buildings and artefacts held by a number of heritage
    organisations across Wales, including Cadw (the historic environment service of
    the Welsh Assembly Government) and Amgueddfa Cymru &ndash; National Museum
  Wales.</p>
<p>Mobile technology offers the potential to communicate, in a
    fresh way, the wealth of information held by museums, archives and libraries to
    users of all kinds, ranging from regular museum-goers to people who may be hard
  to reach or feel disconnected from formal institutions. </p>
<p>Over recent years the Royal Commission on the Ancient and
    Historical Monuments of Wales, with support from CyMAL, the Welsh Assembly
    Government Division for museums, archives and libraries, has pioneered the
    development of location-sensitive applications for the delivery of heritage
  information.</p>
<p>Until recently, mobile applications have been the preserve
    of specialist companies, but with software that is free or available on most
    home or office computers it is possible to create media-rich tours at a very
    small cost. The Royal Commission&rsquo;s applications have been developed without the
  expense of consultants or specialist companies. </p>
<p>The use of hand-held guides is not new &ndash; within the
    museums sector audio guides have been common for two decades &ndash; and
    multimedia guides are becoming more widespread. Mobile applications present the
    opportunity to deliver information and audio-visual resources in situations
    other than the confines of a museum or heritage site. By freeing the technology
    from the indoor environment, such applications can enhance users&rsquo; understanding
    of the &lsquo;real&rsquo; world beyond the doors of the museum, bringing new meaning to
  buildings and landscapes that they may have overlooked before.</p>
<h1>Case Studies</h1>
<h2>The Ruthin E-Trail</h2>
<p>The Ruthin E-Trail project was developed in order to
    research the potential for visitors to Ruthin&rsquo;s historic town centre to access
    Coflein, the Royal Commission&rsquo;s on-line database of historic sites and
    buildings, and selected archive material. The application was developed using
    ESRI ArcPad mobile GIS (Geographical Information System) software. It was
    deployed on Hewlett Packard (HP) iPAQ Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs),
    enabled via plug-in Compact Flash (CF) receivers to locate their position using
    the Global Positioning System (GPS). The GPS enables users&rsquo; positions,
    indicated by a cross-hairs symbol, to be displayed in real-time as they move
  around the town.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Pert-figure2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="358" height="525" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 2: The
  Ruthin E-Trail interface</p>
<h3>The Interface</h3>
<p>An
    application based on ESRI ArcPad software looks similar to an in-car satnav
    system. The screen shows a geographical background to the area for which
    the application has been developed &ndash; in this case, the background is
    Ordnance Survey large-scale mapping, but it is also possible to use aerial
  photographs or hand-drawn images. </p>
<p>Above the map window, two toolbars are visible. In the
    standard ArcPad interface there are around 60 controls on these two toolbars.
    Clearly, it is important that the application be simplified so that those who
    have no previous experience of PDAs or GIS can feel comfortable quickly. ArcPad
    customisation software makes it possible to reduce the number of tools and
    functions accessed through the toolbars. In the development of the Ruthin
    E-Trail, the number of buttons and options was reduced from 60 in standard
  ArcPad to 14, only three or four of which a typical user would need to use.</p>
<p>Information is delivered to users through their interaction
    with the mapping on display. Sites for which information is available are
    highlighted on the map using polygons that overlie the background (effectively
    colouring-in the building); they could also be indicated with a point symbol or
    icon. When users find themselves close to a site for which information is
    available, they simply tap the polygon on the screen using the stylus. This launches a Web page on which
    they choose Welsh or English, followed by a Web page containing Coflein
    information on the site selected, with a text description and images relating
  to it.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Pert-figure3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="358" height="525" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 3: The
  Coflein information page</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Pert-figure4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="358" height="525" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 4: The
  image display page</p>
<p>In the
    Ruthin E-Trail a second toolbar is related to the <b>proximity alert</b> function. Proximity alerts enable
    the automatic display of messages on the screen of the device, triggered by the user&rsquo;s proximity
    to a point in the mapping, as detected by GPS. The messages can convey
    information or directions or ask questions of the visitor. In Ruthin, proximity
    alerts developed in a small trial proved a very effective means of drawing
  attention to relevant information at the point where the visitor needed it.</p>
<h3>Partnership</h3>
<p>From the earliest stages of the Ruthin E-Trail project, the
    Royal Commission worked in partnership with Denbighshire Record Office, Dysg (a
    division within the Welsh Assembly Government&rsquo;s Department of Education,
    Lifelong Learning and Skills), Ysgol Brynhyfryd (Ruthin secondary school) and
  the local Civic Society. </p>
<p>The aims of the project were to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>deliver
    heritage information in new ways to a wider audience</li>
  <li>introduce
    Welsh Baccalaureate students to the fundamentals of GIS, GPS and mobile
    technology </li>
  <li>enable students to develop
    measurable key skills towards their attainment of the Welsh Baccalaureate</li>
  <li>develop understanding of how to
    deliver Coflein information to mobile devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>The partners applied to CyMAL under the Inspiring Learning
    Scheme and were awarded a grant of &pound;10,000. This enabled the purchase of six
    PDAs with copies of ESRI ArcPad mobile GIS software, GPS receivers and
    waterproof cases. It also provided a copy of ESRI ArcPad Application Builder
    (ArcPad customisation software), a day of Training in customisation with ESRI
    (UK), and a scanner for the Denbighshire Archives Service to digitize material
  for inclusion in the application.</p>
<p>As well as having PDAs with GIS software loaded onto them,
    Ysgol Brynhyfryd and Denbighshire Record Office were able to install GIS
    software on to six desktop computers. This provided further opportunities for
    the Record Office to begin experimenting with the spatial recording of
  archives, and for the school to use GIS in a wide range of subjects.</p>
<p>Imagery digitized and included within the application ranged
    from eighteenth-century engravings to early twentieth-century postcards, World
    War II photographs taken in case of bomb damage, and recent architectural
    recording by Royal Commission surveyors. As historic views or records of
    interiors or hidden elevations, many of the images offer a new perspective even
  for those familiar with the buildings.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Pert-figure5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig5: Student using ArcPad software</p>
<p>Delivery of
    the education element of the e-trail project to the Welsh Baccalaureate
    students was a core aim of the project, and Ysgol Brynhyfryd were given
    financial support by Dysg to enable them to participate. Students at Ysgol
    Brynhyfryd received training in the use of the e-trail developed by the Royal
    Commission, as well as instruction on how to create their own mobile GIS
    application and Web pages, digital image editing and archival research skills.
    Over the course of the academic year the students were assessed on the
  development of their Key Skills while they developed their own e-trails. </p>
<p>Within the school, the use of both the PDAs and GIS was met
    with remarkable enthusiasm.
    The school purchased additional PDAs and ArcPad software (at reduced cost
    through the CHEST agreement), and the availability of free Ordnance Survey
    mapping to the school meant that History, Geography and IT teachers were able
  to consider using mobile GIS software for other curricular activities.</p>
<h3>Public Availability</h3>
<p>The PDAs,
    pre-loaded with the Ruthin E-Trail, are held by the ticket office of the former
    Ruthin Gaol, which is an important heritage attraction in the centre of Ruthin
    and the home of the Denbighshire Record Office. Members of the public are able to borrow the devices free of
    charge, provided they fill in the consent forms and allow their credit or&nbsp; debit card details to be held until the
  PDAs are returned. </p>
<h2>The Blaenavon E-Trail</h2>
<p>Following the success of the Ruthin E-Trail, the Royal
    Commission was able to experiment further with the delivery of heritage information
    to mobile devices when CyMAL funded secondment of a member of staff to build
  upon the experience gained in the earlier project. </p>
<p>The aims of the project were to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>develop
    an e-trail application based on an Ordnance Survey MasterMap base, incorporating
    audio and video</li>
  <li>develop
    expertise and take into account diverse audiences</li>
  <li>train
    a Royal Commission member of staff in the production of PDA-based e-trails</li>
  <li>provide
    training to the museum, archive and library sector in the use of mobile devices
    and appropriate use of GIS in a public user context</li>
  <li>advise
    CyMAL and the sector on appropriate applications of this technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>The
    Blaenavon World Heritage Site was a natural choice as the next area for which
    we should develop an application. The Royal Commission has accumulated a great
    deal of information on the town and its surrounding industrial
    landscape, and was a major partner in the development of the bid to gain World
  Heritage status.</p>
<p>This time two methods of delivering information to
    GPS-enabled PDAs were developed, one based upon the ESRI ArcPad software used
    previously in Ruthin, the other using free software developed by HP Labs in
    Bristol. Initially this free software was the Mobile Bristol toolkit, but from May 2007,
    this was superseded and relaunched as Mscape Maker software.&nbsp; This software enables the authoring of
  location-based, multi-media applications called <i>mediascapes</i>, designed to be run on GPS-enabled mobile devices. </p>
<h3>Arcpad Application</h3>
<p>The ArcPad
    interface used for the Blaenavon was essentially the same as had been developed
    for the Ruthin E-Trail. The most significant difference lay in the content of
    the Web pages accessed by tapping on the building polygons. As at Ruthin, the
    various Web pages contain text and images relating to the selected site, but in
    the Blaenavon application, a greater range of media was made available.
    Hyperlinks embedded within the pages opened audio and video clips and
  additional imagery.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Pert-figure6.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="354" height="521" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 6:
  Blaenavon Town E-Trail welcome screen</p>
<h3>Mscape Application</h3>
<p>Users
    interact with the Mscape application in a very different way from the ArcPad
    system. The most significant difference is that the user no longer relies on
    the use of the stylus to operate the application. In fact, user interaction
    through the PDA is kept to an absolute minimum. The delivery of information is
  triggered wholly through GPS position.</p>
<p>Information is delivered in audio, video and image formats,
    and images can be grouped together and displayed as slideshows, removing the need for the user to choose to
  move to the next page by tapping on a link.</p>
<h3>The Interface</h3>
<p>When the
    device is turned on, the user is presented with a library page displaying the
    mediascapes available on that unit. In the system developed so far, these
    comprise the Welsh or English explorer e-trail and the Welsh or English guided e-trail. When the user selects
    a trail, a short description is displayed giving further information; the user
    can then choose to launch that application or return to the library to choose a
  different option.</p>
<p>As the
    application launches,
    the &ldquo;Welcome to the Blaenavon Town E-Trail&rdquo; image is displayed. The user is
    instructed to tap the screen to continue &ndash; done with the finger rather
  than the stylus.</p>
<p>At this
    point a video is played to explain how the devices work; it also provides a
    general introduction to the history of the town. This video is particularly useful as it allows time
  for the PDA unit to get a GPS position fix.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Pert-figure7.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="354" height="521" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 7: The
  map display screen showing user position and infozones</p>
<p>When the
    GPS has got a position fix and the introductory video has finished, the screen
    changes to map display,
    showing the location of the user and the sixteen &ldquo;infozones&rdquo; dotted around the
    town. Depending upon the type of trail chosen, the user either goes off
    independently around the town or is guided by audio instructions around a
  circular route.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Pert-figure8.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="273" height="400" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 8: The
  information screen</p>
<p>As the user enters an infozone, the
    information is automatically launched. An audio track starts playing, and this
    is accompanied by images, video or text that helps to explain the history of
    the current location. These audio-visual tracks usually run for around 30
  seconds - no longer than 1 minute. </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Pert-figure9.jpg" alt="Figure 9" width="273" height="400" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 9: The
  question screen</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Pert-figure10.jpg" alt="Figure 10" width="273" height="400" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 10:
  The correct answer screen</p>
<p>If the user
    re-enters an infozone already visited, a question page is displayed. This use
    of simple programming to alter the user experience offers the potential for
    this software to be used to deliver media in a much more intelligent way than
  could be achieved using the mobile GIS-based application. </p>
<p>With
    further development there could be a range of applications available from a &lsquo;library&rsquo; screen
    on the devices. These could offer a choice of tours based on a variety of
    themes, as well as applications designed for specific audiences such as school
  groups, families or adults. </p>
<h1>Public Availability</h1>
<p>From the
    outset, it was decided this project should adopt a multi-platform approach. The
    various digital components of the ArcPad and Mscape-based applications are
    suitable for deployment to a variety of devices: audio tracks have been compiled to produce an audio tour for MP3 players, video, images and audio
    combined to produce a video tour for devices with video players, all made
    available for download from the Royal Commission Web site. The enhanced
    interpretive information and archival material resulting from the development
    of content for the mobile devices will be fed back into the Royal Commission&rsquo;s
    Coflein system, improving the site and archive records for the two project
    areas and searchable by members of the public via the Coflein Web service. This
  enhanced content will also be shared with partner organisations.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Having seen the application, the new World Heritage Centre
    in Blaenavon (which opens in March 2008) has purchased 14 PDAs to run the
    application. These will be loaned to their customers free of charge, made fully
  waterproof and shockproof inside their protective Otterboxes. </p>
<p>The Centre&rsquo;s decision to invest in the application is thanks
    largely to the enthusiasm shown for the scheme from the local traders&rsquo;
    association. The town of Blaenavon, despite sitting at the heart of an
    industrial landscape with World Heritage Site status, does not currently
    attract many tourists. Well over one hundred thousand people per year visit the
    National Coal Museum at Big Pit on the outskirts of the town, but very few ever
    make the journey to the town centre. It is hoped that the opening of a new World
    Heritage Visitor Centre will attract 20,000-30,000 per annum into the town
    itself, and that the PDA tour will encourage many of them to explore the town
  centre and its various shops, pubs and cafes. </p>
<p>The applications will also be made available for free from
    the Mscapers.com Web site, along with the software necessary to run them.
    Anyone can download the Mscape freeware from the Mscapers Web site (<a
href="http://www.mscapers.com/">http://www.mscapers.com</a>), create their own
  mediascape and upload it back on to the site for others to experience.</p>
<h1>What Happens Next?</h1>
<p>There needs to be a period of information gathering: a
    customer survey will be conducted in Blaenavon, and should provide useful
  figures on the robustness of the system and user satisfaction with the content.</p>
<p>Further development is dependent upon obtaining additional
    funding;&nbsp; we are in the process of
    applying for various grants. If successful, we will broaden the existing
    applications to include the wider landscape around the town, bring in new
    interpretive themes such as biodiversity or geology, and develop new
  applications such as treasure hunt games.</p>
<p>We would also like to develop an education package, building
    upon our experience in Ruthin, and including different school-age groups and
  community groups.</p>
<p>According to HP labs, the next release of Mscape Maker will
    include the ability for triggering from a range of sensors, in addition to GPS.
    The use of these other sensors introduces the ability to use one device to deliver multi-media,
    location-specific interpretation in both indoor and outdoor space, and this
    device will handle the transition between these spaces without the need for
  user input.</p>

<p>The Royal Commission hopes to work in partnership with the
    Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales and Cadw to develop an indoor/outdoor
    application that offers enhanced interpretation and activities within a museum
    context, and can also be used to deliver multi-media interpretation for sites
  and monuments within a land/townscape.</p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>It is now possible for anyone to produce local-scale,
    location-triggered multi-media interpretation at very low cost. The flexibility
    and robustness of the Mscape software has meant that more time can be devoted
    to the development of content and user experience. Developers no longer need to
    worry about getting the software to work in the way they want it to. This
    confidence in the software also means that developers have more time to produce
  content and experiment with the user experience.</p>
<p>The Royal Commission&rsquo;s use of the software only scratches
    the surface of what it is possible to do. The ability to use flash or html
    interfaces instead of, or in addition to, a map display means that very
    attractive and creative applications have been developed. The software is being
    used by artists and film-makers in very innovative ways, creating mediascapes
    with genuine atmosphere. The possibility in the near future of developing
    indoor/outdoor applications will inevitably lead to even more creative uses of
  the software.</p>
<p>Mscape software is a fantastic tool for the development of
    local applications, but it is not suitable for the delivery of large datasets
    over large geographical areas. We are at a very early stage of our
    investigations, but there does seem to be potential to deliver our Coflein
  spatial dataset to mobile phones by making it available in KML format.</p>
<p>KML (Keyhole Markup Language) is the native file format for
    Google Earth and Google Maps. KML files can be hosted publicly on a Web server
    and made available for &lsquo;Earth&rsquo; browsers such as Google Earth or ESRI
    ArcExplorer. The GIS server used by the Royal Commission to run its Coflein Web
  mapping service is able to output directly in this format.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Once properly configured, the server can share the URL of
    the KML files, meaning that anyone can search for files using Google, and then view
  them through Google Earth or Google Maps. </p>
<p>Google Maps for Mobile requires that the KML file first be
    hosted on a Web site. You can then access the file by entering the full URL
    into your phone just as you would enter a regular business search. Google Maps
    for Mobile only supports a simplified subset of KML elements: Placemarks with
    snippets and simple HTML descriptions, but this is enough to provide a link
  through to individual Coflein records.</p>
<p>In the future it should be possible for any users, anywhere
    in Wales using Google Maps for Mobile, to identify their 10 closest
    archaeological or historic sites. The users can specify their locations
    manually, by positioning the cross-hairs at their current position, or this
    could be achieved automatically using built-in GPS or by identifying the
  locations of the cells where the phones are being operated. </p>
<p>As well as highlighting the technical difficulties that need
    to be overcome to deliver location-specific heritage information, the projects
    in Ruthin and Blaenavon have also highlighted the inadequacies of our site
  information. </p>
<p>It does not make sense to put a great deal of effort into
    providing mobile access to our information if that information is not very
    good! In both Ruthin and Blaenavon, most of the descriptions needed re-writing.
    The use of jargon, abbreviations and codes can make a site description almost
    incoherent to a member of the public, and whilst the use of technical,
    architectural or archeological language isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, there does
    need to be an explanation somewhere of what these terms mean. Most of the
    issues over the quality of our site descriptions arise from the fact that what
    is now displayed to the public over the Internet began life as an internal
  working database.</p>
<p>Recently, new guidance has been issued to staff on how to
    create better site descriptions. Key to this is the use of clear language and a
    hierarchical method of providing information, so that if you want basic
    information it is immediately available, and if you want more, it is possible
    to dig a little deeper. Over time this new approach should have the desired
  effect and greatly improve our Coflein site descriptions.</p>

<p>With the publication of the booklet, <em>History in your Hands:
    using mobile devices in heritage interpretation</em> which is being distributed free
    to all museums and archives within Wales, it is hoped that many more
    institutions will be inspired to follow the Royal Commission&rsquo;s example and take
  some of the enormous riches out of their archives and into the wider world.</p>
