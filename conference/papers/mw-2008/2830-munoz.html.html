        <p class="AbstractText">The Science and Technology Museum at Catalunya (mNACTEC)
    has developed a virtual exhibition from the documents and objects used for the
    exhibition <i>Experimental Physics Laboratory of the Mentor Alsina</i>. The main objective of the virtual exhibition is
    complementary to the current exhibition: to provide the information, lists of
    objects and operating proposals that were used to develop an exhibition in
    which the environmental sense dominates. The virtual exhibition offers
    information on all objects of the early twentieth century that form the
    collection of laboratory and interactive elements. As a basis for the
    interactives, it uses images of the objects; at the physical exhibition,
    viewers cannot touch them or operate them. Through a convenient menu, one
    hundred and twenty laboratory pieces of apparatus have been described,&nbsp; grouped into hydrostatic, electricity,
    mechanics, optics, acoustics and pressure topics. We have created twenty-five
    short interactives to help viewers understand the operation of all the
    apparatus.</p>
  <p class="AbstractText">The creation of a virtual exhibition allows for more
    comprehensive treatment, giving exposure to members of the public who could not
    likely visit the physical exhibit.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The objectives of the Museu de la Ci&egrave;ncia i de la
        T&egrave;cnica de Catalunya (Science and Technology Museum of Catalonia &#8211;
        mNACTEC) are to disseminate scientific culture and promote knowledge of it and
        of its repercussions for society; to promote the industrial heritage (see
        Figure 1) through the conservation of its collections and by bringing them
        before the public; and to organise a territory-wide system of museums
        throughout Catalonia (Mu&ntilde;oz &amp;
        Guasch, 2005). The Mentora Alsina permanent and on-line exhibition (<a
href="http://www.mnactec.cat/expo/mentora_alsina.html">http://www.mnactec.cat/expo/mentora_alsina.html</a>)
        projects bring to the fore a collection of 143 scientific instruments that is
        unique in Catalonia and pay tribute to Ferran Alsina for his valuable work in
        the dissemination of science and promotion of science as a career. The project
        has served to bring to the fore the scientific and technological heritage
        preserved in other private and
      university collections (Garcia &amp; Villada, 1998-2002 and Valentines, 2004).</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The goal
        of creating a physical exhibition has been completed with the development of a
        virtual project (Fig. 2). The challenge is to develop a virtual exhibition to
        recreate the characteristics of the exhibition and use digital multimedia
        resources that enhance the understanding and use of scientific devices. The
        virtual tour includes several topics: Ferran Alsina, the laboratory, the
        apparatus collection photo gallery, and a guestbook that permits comments from
      visitors. </p>

      <h2>Ferran Alsina i Parellada (Barcelona 1861 - 1908)</h2>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Son of a yarn manufacturer, he studied industrial
        technology and, when he was only twenty, formed a textile cooperative in Roda
        de Ter (province of Barcelona) and patented a loom with a new system for
        weaving corduroy (Cabana, 1993). In 1883,
        the prestigious Catalan businessman Eusebi G&uuml;ell bought the patent and
        contracted with Ferran Alsina first as manager of the Vapor Vell mill in Sants
        and later to organise and manage the Col&ograve;nia G&uuml;ell model textile village in
        Santa Coloma de Cervell&oacute; (Anonymous,
        1910). At this time Alsina was concerned about the regulation of work by
        minors (Alsina, 1892) and the
        reform of working conditions in the Catalan cotton industry. He was an activist
        in <i>Acci&oacute; Catalanista</i> and though he did not become involved in politics, he
        took part in the gatherings that led to the Bases de Manresa (Alsina, 1893), a document that was
      the road map for Catalan conservatism and protectionism. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">He published a book on experimental physics entitled <i>Novas
        Cient&iacute;fiques </i>(Alsina,
        1904), (based on work by the Anglo-Irish physicist J. Tyndall) that was sent
        to the Royal Society, in which he describes several physical phenomena, forms
        new theories and illustrates the experiments used to demonstrate them. Although
        he applied good methodology in the analysis of certain aspects of physics, his
        lack of appropriate training led him to lose, in some cases, some of his
        scientific rigour (Patxot, 1908). The
        Mentora laboratory of experimental physics was a didactic expression of some of
        the experiments and demonstrations described in <i>Novas cient&iacute;fiques</i>. Ferran
      Alsina died of tuberculosis at the age of 47.</p>
      <h2>The Mentora Experimental
      Physics Laboratory</h2>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">In 1904, in search of a suitable place to live to
        alleviate his tuberculosis, Ferran Alsina acquired a plot on a long lease from
        Do&ntilde;a Mar&iacute;a de la Consolaci&oacute;n Vidal de Moragas, marchioness of Morales, for 470
        pesetas per month over 30 years, on the east flank of the Tibidabo (Arxiu
        Administratiu de l&rsquo;Institut de Cultura de Barcelona, Ajuntament de Barcelona)
        and commissioned the architect Francesc de Paula Nebot to build a house for him
        there (Arxiu Hist&ograve;ric del Col.legi d&rsquo;Arquitectes de Catalunya). The ground
        floor of this house was reserved for the experimental physics laboratory that
      Alsina named the &ldquo;Mentora&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The official opening took place in 1907, but Alsina&rsquo;s
        premature death delayed its coming fully into operation. In accordance with
        Alsina&rsquo;s wishes, the entire patrimony, including the building, passed into the
        hands of Barcelona City Council and it was administered by a Board chaired by
        Josep Zulueta (Ajuntament de
        Barcelona. Comissi&oacute; de Cultura, 1922). It was at this time that the laboratory
        began to be known as the Mentora Alsina (Zulueta,
        1922). Alsina also left a considerable sum of money to enable the institution
        to continue its activities and instituted an annual prize for the best
      invention in experimental physics in Catalonia. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The Mentora
        Alsina laboratory made pioneering contributions in the Catalonia of the early
        20th century to the education of students and the demonstration of physical
        principles. It was a place that was open to all those with a passion for
        science and was an active centre of popular scientific education, where every
        year lectures were organised given by prominent scientific and cultural
        figures. The way the visits were organised, the development of new activities
        and correct use of the apparatus were coordinated by Ramon Llobregat, who kept
        up the original spirit of the Mentora (Par&eacute;s, 2006). From the 1960s, the laboratory could be
        visited only by arrangement, and it became a museum of itself. In 1991 the
        Mentora Alsina was definitively closed, and four years later the Barcelona City
        Council signed an agreement to donate all the scientific instruments to the
      mNACTEC. </p>
      <h2>The Collection Of
      Scientific Apparatus</h2>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Alsina began to assemble the collection of scientific
        apparatus in his house in Cantonigr&oacute;s, near Vic (Barcelona province), whence it
        was transferred to Barcelona to create the Mentora laboratory (Mart&iacute;, 1920). The first historical
        information on the collection is the list of the laboratory&rsquo;s activities (Anonymous, 1906), which also appears in
        an almost identical version in Ferran Alsina&rsquo;s legacy to Barcelona City Council
        (Ajuntament de Barcelona. Comissi&oacute;
        de Cultura, 1922). It lists 103 descriptions of experiments, associated
        with one or several pieces of apparatus. In apparently random order, it
        describes experiments in mechanics, pressure, electricity, sound, optics and
        magnetism. The organisation of the laboratory followed the classic divisions of
        the period into these six basic fields. During the period when the laboratory
        was administered by the Board (1908-1930), no new apparatus seems to have been
        bought (Arxiu Administratiu de l&rsquo;Institut de Cultura de Barcelona, Ajuntament
        de Barcelona); there were only a few donations, purchases of material to carry
      out experiments, and maintenance costs.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">In 1993, before the Mentora Alsina collection was
        transferred to the mNACTEC, the museum commissioned a basic inventory of the
        apparatus and analysis of its condition (Aramon
        &amp; Segura, 1993), to make it possible to ensure that the transfer of
        the apparatus could be performed correctly. The report contains 116 entries
        that represent a total of approximately 140 objects, 13 non-inventoried pieces
        of apparatus and the items for chemistry, consisting of a collection of more
        than 200 objects, dating from 1870 until the 1960s. Of the total number of
        objects, 60 were related to the experiments described in 1906, and the
        remainder were acquired or built subsequently, during the time when Ram&oacute;n
        Llobregat and subsequent directors were in charge. Most of the objects were in
        a good state of conservation, although their repeated use for didactic purposes
        and direct contact with chemical substances had left inevitable signs of use,
        particularly on the more delicate materials. Furthermore, in some cases it was
        found that modifications, repairs or home-made substitutions had been performed
        by the Mentora&rsquo;s staff. The mNACTEC&rsquo;s restoration laboratory followed two
        criteria when working on the collection to make it suitable for exhibition: to
        treat each item as part of a whole, and to preserve the marks left by time and
        use. The home-made items were respected and minimal interventions (which are
        always evident) that were needed for the interpretation of each object were
        performed. The items made of hardwoods and brass, etc., (basically the optical
        instruments) merely required cleaning. The mNACTEC has brought together all the
        available information through meticulous research, documentation and
      cataloguing in order to prepare for the exhibition stage.</p>
      <h1>Museological Criteria</h1>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Mentora Alsina project springs from and enriches
        the working philosophy behind the exhibitions held at the mNACTEC (Mu&ntilde;oz, Garc&iacute;a, Guasch, &amp; Font, 2005). It consists
        of an eminent museological heritage collection; it creates an atmosphere in the
        exhibition space suited to the needs of a diverse public; and it includes
        interactive museological elements that also enable educational workshops to be
        organised. The Mentora Alsina exhibition occupies a space of 130 square metres
      at one end of the Museum&rsquo;s central bay.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The scientific instruments are the main attraction of
        the exhibition from an historical and aesthetic point of view and, without
        reconstructing the Mentora, its design brings out the character of the former
        laboratories which were spaces for the demonstration of strange phenomena
        rather than characterless workplaces. The entire space is designed to transmit
        an idea of physics that is close to daily life and to do so in a comfortable
        environment. Special glass display cases have been used to protect the objects
        being exhibited, and one side of the exhibition has been used to recreate an
        historical setting containing objects related to the world of physics and the
        laboratory itself. The items from the laboratory have been chosen using
        historical criteria, with preference given to those items that certainly formed
        part of the original Ferran Alsina collection and all the instruments
        constructed or modified in the Mentora to demonstrate new phenomena. Of the 200
        items deposited at the mNACTEC, 143 are being exhibited. They are arranged
        according to the original, topic-based distribution gleaned from old
        photographs and descriptions of visits to the laboratory. Supervision by Ramon
        Pares, the former president of the Royal Academy of Arts and Science of
        Barcelona and someone who has been familiar with the Mentora since the 1940s,
        has made it possible to reconstruct some of the craft-produced instruments that
      could not be deciphered even by specialised physicists. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The exhibition project entails two lighting systems:
        one for the general visit that illuminates the display cases and creates the
        general ambience; and the other for the physics workshops that take place
        around a central bench, measuring five metres in length, which is of particular
      significance, being an original item from the laboratory. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The abundant documentation produced during the
        research phase has enabled us to adopt a three-pronged communicational
        approach. The basic information about Ferran Alsina, the construction of the
        building, and the history of the Mentora is located at the exhibition entrance
        on micro perforated vinyl separated from the rest by ambiental lighting. The
        creation and characteristics of the collection are described in succinct texts
        around the perimeter. The need to describe the 143 instruments without swamping
        the display cases with panels and texts which would have compromised the
        general aesthetic impression of the exhibition has been met with the use of six
        touch-sensitive screens corresponding to each section. Touching the photograph
        of each object on the touch-sensitive screen brings up a panel of descriptive
        text that illustrates the importance of the instrument in physics and other
        relevant information. In the case of some of the more complex items,
        understanding is aided by animated 3-D graphics, devised by the Polytechnic
        University of Catalonia. In order to help engage visitors on the route round
        the exhibition, they are confronted with six questions that lead to an answer
        that is not so obvious as it might seem. What colour is a red box in a dark
        room? Two interactive displays - the reflection of sound in acoustics, and
        holographic effects in optics - reinforce this view of the entertaining side of
      physics. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The educational resources are completed by an area to
        work on experimental physics, aimed at children and students in general.
        Experiments related with the equipment that forms part of the exhibition are
        performed using replicas. The aim is to communicate the original spirit of the
      Mentora as a laboratory for experimentation and demonstration. </p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The project to reclaim the Mentora Alsina has created,
        in a museum focused predominantly on industrial heritage (<a
href="http://www.mnactec.cat/">http://www.mnactec.cat</a>), an on-line
        exhibition that recovers a vision of science in which the demonstration and the
        development of new scientific theories is the basis of training and of leading
        students towards careers in science. In order to achieve this, &nbsp;the Ferran Alsina collection of scientific instruments has
        been brought to the fore by exhibiting more than 140 pieces of apparatus in a
        setting that recreates the old laboratory and incorporates new technologies to
        better explain how they worked. The exhibition area is complemented by a space
        for students to do practical work. In this way, the project contributes to the
        dissemination of scientific culture through heritage items, in a similar
      fashion to projects by eading science museums elsewhere in Europe.</p>
