      <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="AbstractText">Museums and archives have the goal of making available
        cultural heritage knowledge to more users. To reach this objective, it is a key
        challenge to integrate the information spread across many institutions. This
        information is related to cultural artifacts which bear witness to some
        circumstances relevant to a context: political, historical, social, etc. An
        integrated view of these common circumstances would give the final users a
        unique and rich experience. CONTEXTA/SR is a platform that takes advantage of
        the information resident in heterogeneous and distributed repositories of cultural
        heritage to enrich a common image of the world. This platform, based on
        Semantic Web technologies, is guided by some basic principles: extensibility,
        to allow new developments over a set of provided capabilities; progressive
        enrichment of original data through a series of transformations that use the
        Web as a source of information; and consideration of the final user as an
        information enrichment agent.</p>

      <h1>Cultural Repositories: How To Integrate Circumstances?</h1>
      <p>Archives and museums record information about artifacts that bear witness to a political, historical or social context. This information from several institutions is inherently interlaced by the mentioned context, although these links are not explicit because of institutional barriers.</p>
      <p>  Often, people who visit on-line museums and archives are more interested in the circumstances that artifacts are witness to, than in the artifacts themselves. Then, queries requesting &ldquo;pictures of Victoria Square at Gonz&aacute;lez Videla&rsquo;s government,&rdquo; &nbsp;referring to the context of artifacts, become more valuable.</p>
      <p>With the rise of Information Technologies, cultural institutions have started to digitalize the artifacts they keep, saving a digital representation of artifacts and also some metadata that describe their context. However, the fact that each institution uses its own technology and tools to manage the information makes inter-institutional contextualization a persistent problem.</p>
      <p> There have been varied efforts to integrate heterogeneous heritage repositories. A na&iuml;ve approach consists in a syntactic search engine that allows the search of keywords in the aggregated set of artifacts&rsquo; descriptions.</p>
      <p>In this article the CONTEXTA/SR platform is introduced. Its goal is to provide unified access to heritage digital repositories, boosting the circumstances in which the digital artifacts are immersed.</p>
      <p> The structure of this paper is as follows. The second section will introduce a case study that will act as a reference for the examples given throughout this article. The third section will expose the technological background and other projects that try to solve the presented problem using similar technologies to ours. The fourth section will present the CONTEXTA/SR platform and the key principles that guide its architecture. The fifth section will briefly describe the main repositories and components of the architecture. The sixth section will expose the platform as the nucleus of a software ecosystem. The next to last section will describe the processes of ingesting and auditing artifacts and their circumstances. Finally, the last section will present some conclusions and discussions.</p>
      <h1>Example for Discussion </h1>
      <p>To anchor our discussion and examples, we present a typical record (shown in Table 1) taken from the Margot Loyola Fund for Traditional Culture and Music (FML).</p>

      <h1>Technological Background and Related Work</h1>
      <p>The case study shows that in the cultural heritage domain it
        is very relevant to consider the circumstances of artifacts when answering
        interesting queries. A common strategy used to discuss a concept without
        ambiguities is to give it a unique identifier. Then, if the individual &ldquo;Margot
        Loyola&rdquo; has a unique ID, it would be possible to refer to her from anywhere
        without confusion. </p>
      <p>The infrastructure used to assign unique identifiers at a
        World scale exists: it is the Web. In the Web, each resource is identified by a
        unique global identifier known as a  URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). In the
        past years, this technological infrastructure has been considered as the
        enabler to describe relationships not just between digital documents, but also
        between concepts that do not necessarily have a digital representation. This is
        the key idea behind Semantic Web.</p>
      <p>The Semantic Web (Berners-Lee, 2001) is an initiative not
        only to use the Web as a medium to human consumption, but also to allow
        computer interactions. The more sites that make available their data in a
        machine understandable format, the more interesting the Web applications
        become. These applications benefit by the distributed and aggregated data.</p>
      <p>The key technological support to do this is the RDF data
        model. This model considers as an atom of information, a statement that
        contains a source node, a property arc and a target node. At least the first
        two must be identified by URIs.</p>
      <p>The Semantic Web vision also relies on artificial
        intelligence knowledge formalizations known as ontologies. An ontology is a
        specification of a conceptualization (Gruber, 1993). It can be viewed as a
        conceptual model that has logic formalizations which rigorously describe the
        world. However, heavyweight constructs of ontologies that enable complex
        inferences are not very helpful when there are high volumes of data dispersed
        across many geographical locations.</p>
      <p>In the last years, the Semantic Web is mainly considered as
        the &ldquo;glue&rdquo; to integrate heterogeneous data across the Web using the following
        metaphor: concepts of the real world - which may have or may not have digital
        representation - have URIs.  It is possible to create a network of concepts
        through the Web using &ldquo;semantic properties&rdquo; which also have URIs. This simple
        but powerful model, also known as the Web of Data, allows us to use the Web not
        just as a set of documents interrelated through hyperlinks, but also as a
        semantic network of concepts.</p>
      <p>DBpedia project (Auer, 2007; <a href="http://dbpedia.org/">http://dbpedia.org/</a>)
        demonstrates the power behind the Web of Data approach. In this project, the
        structured metadata that it is possible to extract from Wikipedia articles is
        consolidated in an RDF data store. It can even be integrated with other sources
        of RDF on the Web, such as Geonames, DBLP and others. Moreover, in Dbpedia,
        URIs are provided for the concepts that Wikipedia articles describe: these
        concepts have semantic relations to concepts also identified by URIs. These
        uniquely identified concepts can be referred to from any chunk of data, in the
        same way that we can refer to any Web page from any Web page. DBpedia follows
        principles of Linked Data initiative
        (<a href="http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/pub/LinkedDataTutorial/">http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/pub/LinkedDataTutorial/</a>), whose goal is
        to publish RDF data on the Web and to interlink data between different sources
        of information.</p>
      <p>In the context of cultural heritage, there are some
        interesting projects that use Semantic Web technologies. MuseumFinland
        (Hyv&ouml;nen, 2005; <a href="http://www.museosuomi.fi/">http://www.museosuomi.fi/</a>) is a semantic portal for publishing
        heterogeneous collections. It makes extensive use of Semantic Web technologies.
        One of the main contributions of this work was the idea of differentiating the
        syntactic interoperability from the semantic interoperability. Unfortunately,
        MuseumFinland does not expose the knowledge it integrates in a &ldquo;dereferenceable
        way&rdquo;. Thus, although it uses Semantic Web constructs, the concepts and
        artifacts it describes are not browsable or searchable in the Linked Data
        sense. The same group has recently made interesting contributions on how to
        model relevant content of cultural heritage using events and situations
        (Junnila, 2007; <a href="http://nsdl.org/">http://nsdl.org/</a>).</p>
      <p>The National Science Digital Library (NSDL) (Lagoze, 2005)
        has considered Semantic Web techniques to expose rich relationships among the
        artifacts they keep. It bases its platform on FEDORA, a digital object
        repository. FEDORA allows  the associating of  RDF metadata to each digital
        object it keeps. Moreover, the RDF data is indexed in a dedicated data store,
        and these statements are accessible through a provided component. However, this
        approach considers digital objects as first class entities. For this reason,
        any update to the RDF graph of relationships has to be done through the digital
        object API, with the overhead that this implies.</p>
      <h1>The Architecture of CONTEXTA/SR</h1>
      <p>CONTEXTA/SR is a platform whose goal is to semantically
        integrate cultural heritage heterogeneous information, using Semantic Web
        Technologies. To achieve this, there is  a series of phases that we consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Integration
          at a technological level: generally, each museum or archive uses its own
          technology and tools to manage its information. In this phase, it is
          necessary to execute a process that exports the original data into a
          technologically compatible format.</li>
        <li>Integration
          at a semantic level: even if the previous step was successfully made, it
          is possible that the contents of each original institution still remain
          isolated. Then, the more important step when integrating is to achieve
          semantic interoperability. In this phase, it is necessary to agree on a
          common vocabulary and map original constructs to it. </li>
        <li>Integration
          at a social level: once information is semantically integrated, it is
          the final user who could enrich it, as in the case of successful social
          Web applications such as last.fm, del.icio.us, flickr, among others.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are some
        basic principles we have defined in order to achieve the integration at the
        three above-mentioned levels. These principles guided the definition of the
        architecture of the platform:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Center
          on provision of services more than on particular applications</li>
        <li>Define
          circumstances of digital artifacts as first class entities</li>
        <li>Consider
          the user as an agent of information enrichment</li>
        <li>Use
          standard and not proprietary formats</li>
        <li>Give importance to auditing the integrated contents</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="caption"><a href="astudillo-fig1.html">Fig 1: The architecture of
        CONTEXTA/SR</a></p>
      <p>Figure 1
        shows a high level view of CONTEXTA/SR architecture. The main blocks
        are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Source repositories with digital representations and
          their metadata.</li>
        <li>RDF Catalog internally divided into several
          repositories, each of them for a particular task. This catalog
          could be viewed as a semantic graph, having some nodes out of the
          catalog control.</li>
        <li>Main auxiliary components: these are dedicated to
          specific functionalities. Some of the components of primary
          relevance are the Ingester, the Auditor and the Expert Feeder.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>First
        we describe the primary repositories of the RDF catalog and the
        ontologies that we use to model the information stored there. Then
        we briefly describe the components that achieve the integration of
        distributed resources.</p>
      <h2>The RDF Catalog</h2>
      <h3>How We Model Artifacts And Their
        Circumstances</h3>
      <p>Using
        Semantic Web technologies in CONTEXTA/SR implies that almost
        everything is a resource. This means both digital representations of
        artifacts distributed across the cultural institutions and the
        circumstances they witness are resources. Then, we deliberately
        concentrate our modeling efforts in three dimensions: ontologies to
        describe artifacts, ontologies to describe circumstances, and social
        ontologies.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Ontologies for digital artifacts.</b>These describe low-level features
          of digital documents, such as byte size and MIME type. In
          figure 2 it is possible to see the case study example
          represented using a simple ontology of artifacts.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig2" id="fig2"></a><a href="astudillo-fig2.html"><img src="astudillo.fig2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="395" height="128" class="caption" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="astudillo-fig2.html">Fig 2: Example of a unit of
        information that uses concepts from an ontology of artifacts</a></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Ontologies for circumstances.</b>These ontologies are related to
          the circumstances of an artifact. For this reason, the greater
          modeling efforts are related to these. There are efforts to
          develop a unified model for representing digital artifacts and
          their circumstances. CIDOC/CRM (<a
                 href="http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/">http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/</a>)
          is an ontology that we considered, but we did not choose it
          because its hierarchy of classes was very complex. Also, it is
          not linked with widespread ontologies such as FOAF
          (<a href="http://www.xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">http://www.xmlns.com/foaf/spec/</a>), W3C Geo Ontology (<a
                 href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/">http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/</a>),
          the Music Ontology (<a href="http://musicontology.com/">http://musicontology.com/</a>) or the Event
          Ontology (<a href="http://motools.sourceforge.net/event/event.html">http://motools.sourceforge.net/event/event.html</a>). We
          based our main ontology on the ISAD(G) (General International
          Standard Archival Description) standard (ISAD(G), 2000), which
          describes how to prepare archival descriptions. An ontology
          based on ISAD(G) constructs was combined with several
          widespread ontologies, such as Music Ontology, W3C Geographic
          Ontology, FOAF Ontology and others. ISAD(G) is a very detailed
          ontology specialized for the heritage domain. Also, it is
          possible to consider it as the glue between the other
          lightweight ontologies. The widespread ontologies we use allow
          us to reuse the knowledge of experts in each particular
          domain. Figure 3 shows the case study with concepts from
          ISAD(G) and other ontologies used to model circumstances.</span></li>

	<li><b>Social ontologies:</b>These ontologies model the
        context of the use of the artifacts and their circumstances.
        Some of the selected ontologies are FOAF for descriptions of
        persons and the Tag ontology for tags managing. Figure 4
        shows the case study enriched with social information.</span></li>

      <h3>The Repositories</h3>
      <p>We
        have explained how the data was modeled; it is possible to
        describe briefly the repositories where the instances are stored.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Repository of artifacts metadata.</b>This repository stores the low
          level properties of the digital representation of an
          artifact. It is in this repository that  the byte size or
          MIME type properties of a digital document are registered.</span></li>
        <li><b>Repository of circumstances.</b>The relations between the
          digital representation of an artifact, the artifact itself,
          and its circumstances are stored in this repository. In
          this data store the URIs for &ldquo;Margot Loyola&rdquo;, &ldquo;Talca&rdquo;, &ldquo;El
          Clavel&rdquo; (song) and their relations are stored.</span></li>
        <li><b>Pending repository.</b>The data that has been
          ingested but not yet audited is stored in this repository,
          while waiting to be integrated to the circumstances
          repository. The role of this repository will be better
          explained in the next section related to the ingesting and
          auditing processes.</span></li>
        <li><b>Repositories of statistics of use.</b>This repository registers the
          use statistics to provide the recommendation services
          which enrich the final user&rsquo;s experience. Unlike previous
          repositories, this one is relational. This is to
          facilitate the development of algorithms and calculations
          needed to compute recommendations. </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Above all these repositories, there is an abstraction
        layer called &ldquo;catalog access&rdquo;. This is implemented as a
        component that allows treating all the underneath data as a
        unique integrated RDF graph. It provides capabilities for
        executing SPARQL queries and performing semantic browsing
        through all the stored resources: digital artifacts,
        circumstances and social information.</p>
      <h2>The Main Components</h2>
      <p>As Figure 1 shows, there is a series of components
        above the RDF catalog. These components are fundamental for
        integrating the distributed repositories. In these
        components, the logic needed in order to achieve the semantic
        integration is embedded. Next, the more important components
        are briefly described:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Ingester.</b> This component generates RDF chunks of
          information from the particular data of an institution.
          It takes as input the XML files that contain the
          serialized data from the source repositories and
          produces as output an RDF graph connected with the
          already-stored circumstances.</li>
        <li><b>Auditor.</b> This component provides capabilities for
          approving the data stored in the pending repository and
          transferring the information to the circumstances
          repository. Also, it has features for rejecting some
          invalid data.</li>
        <li><b>Expert feeder.</b>This component provides
          capabilities for directly feeding the circumstances
          repository, without using the ingesting process.</span></li>
        <li><b>Social components.</b>The users,
          recommendations, tagging and evaluation components
          provide capabilities for accessing users&rsquo; profiles
          and the statistical information about the use that
          these users give to the data. This kind of
          information may complement the semantic information
          that is already stored with emergent social
          knowledge. In this paper, we do not deeply discuss
          this topic that is significant on its own. In &nbsp;the work of steve.museum (Wyman, et al., 2006)
          it is possible to see the potential of considering
          social information in the cultural heritage domain.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>The
        Ingesting and Auditing Processes</h2>
      <p>In Figure 5 it is possible to see the workflow of
        the ingesting process.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig5" id="fig5"></a><a href="astudillo-fig5.html"><img src="astudillo.fig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="400" height="179" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="astudillo-fig5.html">Fig
        5: Workflow of the ingesting process</a></p>
      <p>First there is an XML chunk of information exported
        from the database of a local institution. We assumed that
        local repositories have a method to export to XML as a
        precondition at a syntactic integration level. This is
        true in almost all current databases. </p>
      <p>Once the XML file enters the ingester component it
        is necessary to convert it into an RDF representation. In
        reference to the common ontologies described above, the
        vocabularies become semantically uniform. This is
        possible because the Ingester has a set of XSLT
        templates, one for each admitted data format. In other
        words, for each repository that wants to be integrated to
        CONTEXTA/SR, there has to be an XSLT template that
        transforms the data from its local format to the common
        vocabulary. The development of this XSLT template is a
        hard task that consists in mapping the original source
        constructs to the ontological constructs introduced
        previously. This task requires a great deal of human
        effort for successful integration.</p>
      <p>Once the transformation to RDF is realized, a graph
        is produced. This graph is totally disconnected from the
        circumstances registered in the platform repositories,
        and hence, to the world. In order to link the nodes in
        the output graph to existing nodes on the CONTEXTA/SR
        semantic repository, or even to nodes on the global
        Semantic Web, filtering stages are necessary. In this
        process each stage produces a more refined and richer RDF
        graph than the previous one. For example, next we describe
        two filters illustrated in Figure 5.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Filter of Equivalent Labels.</b>This filter recognizes
          all concepts that have rdfs:label or foaf:name
          labels identical to some concepts already registered
          in the circumstances repository. Hence, the new
          graph is attached to the existing circumstances
          graph.</span></li>
        <li><b>DBPedia filter.</b>This filter links some
          concepts of the incoming graph to global concepts
          of the DBpedia Project introduced in the Related
          Work section. For instance, if the graph has a
          concept of type geo:SpatialThing that has a label
          &ldquo;Talca&rdquo;, it is possible to ask the SPARQL Endpoint
          of DBpedia if there is something of type
          geo:SpatialThing called &ldquo;Talca&rdquo;. In fact, this
          query would return a resource with URI <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Talca">http://dbpedia.org/resource/Talca</a>. After
          identifying this fact, the incoming graph is
          connected to a DBpedia concept. This is an example
          of how by accessing structured data on the Semantic
          Web it is possible to integrate local data with a
          global knowledge of the world.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that input from museums and
        archives repositories enrich or feed an image of the
        world, maintained both in the circumstances repository
        and in the global Semantic Web. Once all the filters
        have been processed, the output of the ingesting
        process is an RDF graph connected with circumstances
        stored in CONTEXTA.</p>
      <p>All the described processes are
        automatically done. Obviously, this could generate some
        relevant semantic problems; for instance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the filter of Equivalent Labels
          is used, &ldquo;Margot Loyola P.&rdquo; would  be identified
          as a different person from &ldquo;Margot Loyola&rdquo;</li>
        <li>If the information in an original
          repository is not complete enough, as is
          expected, some completely false &ldquo;facts&rdquo; could be
          concluded: e.g. Linares is a city of Chile and
          also a city of Spain. If input data does not
          consider the country, then the filtering could
          result in erroneous conclusions. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are just two examples of a
        great number of similar situations that could happen
        when automating the semantic enrichment process. It
        would not be appropriate that all of these new
        possible confusing circumstances be stored
        immediately in the global repository of
        circumstances. This is when the pending repository
        and the auditing process become relevant.</p>
      <p>Once the new RDF statements are
        stored in the pending repository, these statements
        will not be validated until an expert human auditor
        approves them. When faced with this situation the
        auditing component provides capabilities to edit the
        pending RDF. In future stages of the project we will
        give Natural Language Processing (NLP) facilities to
        the auditing component. This way, the human expert
        will receive valuable help when evaluating
        statements, suggesting possible errors or
        redundancies. For instance, a similarity analysis
        could suggest that &ldquo;Margot Loyola&rdquo; and &ldquo;Margot Loyola
        R.&rdquo; could be, in fact, two names for the same person.</p>
      <p>Once the data are validated by the
        auditing component, they become linked to the already
        stored circumstances. It is at this point that
        persistent URIs for artifacts, digital representation
        and circumstances are created. Because we are
        following the principles of the Linked Data
        initiative, these new URIs become &ldquo;dereferenceable&rdquo;;
        therefore, they become part of the global Semantic
        Web.</p>
      <p>Another component that is relevant
        to ingesting and auditing processes is the Expert
        Feeder. When new data enter the Ingester, these data
        are enriched thanks to the filters that access extern
        sites and, mainly, the existing circumstances in the
        repository. This means that the more circumstances
        that are stored in the CONTEXTA/SR catalog, the more interesting
        relationships appear. We called Expert Feeding to the
        process of populating circumstances directly, without
        an ingesting process. Generally these circumstances
        correspond to thesaurus or ontologies instances
        available on the Web. For instance, the GeoNames
        service has made available all its RDF geographic
        data as a downloadable <span
                          class="HTMLconformatoprevioCar">dump (<a
                          href="http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/">http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/</a>).</span> Also, GeoNames provides an on-line service to access
        its data on-demand from the Internet. In terms of
        efficiency, maybe it is a good idea to download the
        dump and load it into the RDF catalog using the
        Expert Feeder component.</p>
      <p>There is another usual situation
        when analyzing the domain of a particular
        institution. Most of the time, cultural institutions
        have their own thesaurus or ontologies for their very
        restricted domain. However, this knowledge could be
        capitalized globally. For example, the MLF has
        developed a thesaurus of native dialects and
        languages from South America. This knowledge must be
        added to the circumstances base. Then if we want to
        query for music sung in &ldquo;Mapudung&uacute;n&rdquo; (a language of
        Chilean natives), we will obtain more relevant
        answers.</p>
      <h1>Towards
        an Ecosystem of Applications</h1>
      <p>CONTEXTA/SR is a platform that
        provides a set of services acting as semantic
        middleware for the integration of digital
        repositories. The architecture is flexible enough to
        allow the development of interesting applications
        serving as a core of functionalities.</p>
      <p>In particular, the provision of a
        SPARQL endpoint and dereferenceable URIs at the
        catalog level allows the development of &ldquo;semantic
        mashups&rdquo;. Semantic mashups are Web applications that
        use RDF data from several sources and combine the
        information  in useful ways. Figure 6 shows an
        example of a Web application that was developed using
        semantic mashups. In particular, the data from
        CONTEXTA/SR, DBpedia (<a href="http://dbpedia.org/">http://dbpedia.org/</a>), GeoNames
        (<a href="http://www.geonames.org/">http://www.geonames.org/</a>) and the Google Maps
        service (<a href="http://maps.google.com/">http://maps.google.com/</a>) were linked to support
        an application where the context of the artifacts is
        explicit. This rich application was developed in a
        simple way, reusing data and services that already
        exist.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig6" id="fig6"></a><a href="astudillo-fig6.html"><img src="astudillo.fig6.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="400" height="352" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="astudillo-fig6.html">Fig
        6: Screenshot of the web application based on
        semantic mashups</a></p>
      <p>As well as the facilities to make
        semantic mashups, other Web services are included for
        common tasks. This has great potential because
        CONTEXTA/SR&rsquo;s core has capabilities for high
        value-adding, such as recommendations, users&rsquo;
        profiling, among others. In a nutshell, CONTEXTA/SR
        provides a series of capabilities that developers of
        cultural applications can profit from. There could be
        a series of applications that &ldquo;survive&rdquo; thanks to the
        provided core, like a software ecosystem.</p>
      <h1>Discussion
        and Conclusions</h1>
      <p>We have presented the initial
        architecture of the CONTEXTA/SR platform as a
        solution for integrating distributed and
        heterogeneous repositories of cultural heritage. At
        this stage of the project, two archives have been
        integrated in our framework, acting as a proof of
        concepts. However, we are conscious of the complexity
        of the problem we are facing. We have to develop more
        filters and give more capabilities to the auditing
        and expert feeder components to prove that this
        solution work scales with more institutions.</p>
      <p>Also, we need to devote part of our
        efforts to developing rich clients that demonstrate
        the power of our approach. An ingester client, an
        expert feeder client and a heritage explorer Web
        application are in development. Particularly, the
        explorer Web application will demonstrate the power
        that the social dimension has in the domain of
        cultural heritage.</p>
      <p>In a nutshell, we have presented a
        very modular approach to integrate distributed
        repositories of cultural heritage. The edges of our
        development have been the extensibility of the
        platform and the semantic enrichment of the data. The
        former has been achieved by providing a set of
        services that any developer can profit from. The
        latter has been accomplished by clearly defining the
        ingesting and auditing processes. It is important to
        stress that although we could have a sophisticated
        automated process to semantically enrich the data, we
        still consider that  human intervention is absolutely
        necessary. In our architecture, the Expert Feeder and
        the Auditor reflect this.</p>
