  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>The Reciprocal
    Research Network (RRN) is being co-developed by the Musqueam Indian
    Band, the St&oacute;:l&#333; Nation/Tribal Council, the U&rsquo;mista Cultural Society, and the Museum of
    Anthropology at the University of British Columbia.&nbsp; A dozen cultural institutions, national and international,
    are also participating in the development process. They include the Royal
    British Columbia Museum, Burke Museum, Glenbow Museum, Royal Ontario Museum,
    Canadian Museum of Civilization, McCord Museum, American Museum of Natural
    History, National Museum of the American Indian, National Museum of Natural
    History, Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, and the Pitt
    Rivers Museum.</p>
  <p>The four co-developers have demonstrated leadership in
    diverse political, scientific and historical areas. Each of the three First
    Nations&rsquo; institutions already has long-standing relationships with the Museum
    of Anthropology (MOA) or the Department of Anthropology at UBC.</p>
  <p>The Musqueam Indian Band (Musqueam) is a leader in bringing
    issues of First Nations rights to national and international attention through
    legal processes, including groundbreaking Supreme Court cases (Guerin (1984)
    and Sparrow (1990)). The Museum of Anthropology is located on Musqueam
    traditional territory, and the community has co-curated several exhibits with
    MOA. Through the hard work of many band members, Musqueam has been instrumental
    in the fundamental shifts at MOA towards decolonizing its museum practice and
    engaging with originating communities (Ames, 1999; Holm and Pokotylo, 1997;
    Phillips, 2000).</p>
  <p>Situated up the Fraser River from the Musqueam Indian Band,
    the St&oacute;:l&#333; Nation and
    St&oacute;:l&#333; Tribal Council
    (St&oacute;:l&#333;) are pioneers
    in developing research protocols and internal licensing systems for outside
    researchers. They have consistently welcomed researchers, including
    undergraduate and graduate field schools in archaeology and anthropology, to
    their territory, and have used these opportunities to educate a new generation
    of scholars in collaborative research and applied anthropology.</p>
  <p>The U'mista Cultural Society (U&rsquo;mista) was founded in 1974
    to ensure the survival of all aspects of the cultural heritage of the
    Kwakwaka'wakw First Nations, of northern Vancouver Island. U&rsquo;mista has been
    instrumental in bringing questions of museum ethics and policies to the
    forefront.&nbsp; In 1921, with Canada&rsquo;s
    infamous anti-potlatch law firmly in place, the Indian agent seized the regalia
    of those attending Chief Dan Cranmer&rsquo;s potlatch. Coppers, masks, boxes and
    other treasures found their way into museums and to a few private collectors.
    U&rsquo;mista conducted successful negotiations for the repatriation of the items
    illegally confiscated at Chief Cranmer&rsquo;s potlatch. Along with running the
    U&rsquo;mista Cultural Centre, the Society supports artists, researches museum
    collections, and works on language programs.</p>
  <p>The Museum of Anthropology at UBC is renowned for the
    innovation of visible storage and its work on collaborative museology. &lsquo;A
    Partnership of Peoples&rsquo;, the largest grant given by the Canada Foundation for
    Innovation (CFI) to a social science project, was awarded to MOA and the UBC
    Laboratory of Archaeology (LOA) for the creation of physical and virtual
    research infrastructures to foster collaborative museology and the &lsquo;&hellip; belief
    that originating communities should have a major voice in shaping research
    questions and should benefit from the new knowledge produced&rsquo; (MOA, 2000:3a).
    Work on the physical infrastructure has commenced, and these facilities will
    include a First Nations Community Suite and reconceptualized visible storage.
    The RRN is the virtual research infrastructure of this project. It seeks to
    &lsquo;support interactive research partnerships among geographically dispersed
    researchers and across culturally distinct knowledge systems &hellip;&rsquo; (MOA, 2000:3a),
    thereby deconstructing silos of knowledge.</p>
  <p>Through the RRN, MOA is working to move beyond current notions
    of collaboration. Thus, in the original CFI grant application Musqueam, St&oacute;:l&#333; and U&rsquo;mista were named as
    researchers. The long-term relationships linking MOA to these communities made
    co-development the next logical step in redefining relationships between
    museums and First Nations and re-dressing issues of past power imbalances.
    Therefore, the RRN, while physically based at MOA, moves forward through the
    work of its Steering Group, composed of a member from each of the co-developers. </p>
  <p>All work on the RRN is based on the principle of respect for
    the cultural values, laws and cultural knowledge of originating communities.
    Through this network, communities and institutions will be able to build
    relationships and share knowledge. The RRN development team&rsquo;s intentions are to
    structure the RRN so that the information it contains and the way it is used
    respect originating communities&rsquo; cultural values, support the integration of
    clearer understandings of First Nations&rsquo; cultural knowledge into standard
    museum practices and philosophies, and further global discussions on cultural
    knowledge and intellectual property. In this way, the Reciprocal Research
    Network is being designed to facilitate a paradigm shift in the way research
    into cultural heritage is conducted, whereby community members will be active
    participants and one of the drivers of research.</p>
  <p>The first task of the RRN Steering Group was to create, and
    then have their respective institutions approve, a Project Charter. Outlined in
    the charter are the RRN development principles. These are to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Respect
      the intellectual property framework as laid out in the Research Guidelines
      document.</li>
    <li>Build
      on previous or existing research projects and technical infrastructure wherever
      possible.</li>
    <li>Interface
      with existing digital collections and/or digital asset management systems. This
      will require extensive research and work on bridging data.</li>
    <li>Deploy
      commonly available standards and tools where possible and appropriate.</li>
    <li>Adopt,
      wherever possible, established best practices and internationally accepted
      standards.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Recognize
      digital data will be owned and managed by original repositories; the RRN will
      reference data and make it accessible under the terms agreed upon in the
      Framework Document.</li>
    <li>Develop
      the pilot projects necessary for a number of components such as research and
      development for collaborative tools and interfaces.</li>
    <li>Be
      flexible enough to allow for anyone with an Internet connection, with the
      minimal requirements as specified by the RRN, to use it. </li>
    <li>Acknowledge
      that development will be ongoing &ndash; there will not be a &ldquo;finished&rdquo; network
      since sustainability will require on-going research and development. (RRN
      Steering Group, 2006:15)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The scope of the RRN is detailed within the Project Charter
    to ensure that all requirements, as agreed upon by the co-developers, are met.
    This section is used to measure progress and to respond to the requests of
    other interest groups with a unified voice. </p>
  <p>The scope is divided into three sections: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>items that are in-scope and funded, </li>
    <li>those that are in-scope but unfunded and </li>
    <li>those that are out of scope and unfunded. For example: </li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>In-scope and funded</b>:
      Support for multi-media products such as audio, video, and maps. </p>
    <p><b>In-scope but unfunded</b>:
      Technology to enable viewing of 3-D images. </p>
    <p>The ability to view 3D images was not a mandatory
      requirement at the time the RRN was initially proposed. However, subsequent
      advances in technology should be evaluated to determine how this item can be
      accommodated within the existing funding envelope. Many 3D maps are available
      through LOA, and some 3-D images are already available at MOA. It is expected
      more will be available from the partner institutions by the time the RRN is
      implemented. </p>
    <p><b>Out of scope and unfunded</b>: Providing 3-D content for the RRN (RRN Steering Group, 2006:9).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>For the RRN to succeed, a software design approach that
    meshed with the philosophy of the project was required. The Steering Group was
    concerned that projects taken out of house for production sometimes fail
    because of their inability to work within the operational mode of the home
    institution. They were also aware of the rapid pace of change in software and
    hardware. The Steering Group saw that some of the concepts&nbsp; originally seen as difficult, or too
    expensive in the &lsquo;A Partnership of Peoples&rsquo; grant application, were suddenly
    doable, while others were becoming dated. Therefore, a decision was made to
    actively pursue resources available at the University of British Columbia. This
    included the use of the RRN as a project in an undergraduate Computer
    Engineering course on requirements engineering for software-intensive systems. </p>
  <p>Additionally, the RRN software development process needed to
    be flexible and adaptable. Achieving the target of the RRN&rsquo;s adoption as a
    primary research tool by users with differing backgrounds and varying degrees
    of computer knowledge would require on-going input from potential users during
    the entire development cycle. It was simply not feasible to gather all data,
    hand the project over to software designers and engineers, and have them create
    a product. Many diverse players needed to be heard, and where possible,
    accommodated.&nbsp; Agile software
    development philosophy has proven to be the best &lsquo;fit&rsquo; because of its focus on
    collaboration, interaction, and quick response to change (<a
href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">www.agilemanifesto.org</a>). </p>
  <p>Scott W. Ambler has recently outlined 16 components for
    agile design philosophies; those most applying to the RRN software development
    philosophy are: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use
      emergent technologies, </li>
    <li>Use
      test-driven development, </li>
    <li>Designers
      should also code, </li>
    <li>Feedback
      is your friend and </li>
    <li>Iterate,
      iterate, iterate (Ambler, 2007). </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The purpose of the Reciprocal Research Network is to enable
    geographically dispersed users to access information from multiple institutions
    through a single interface, and to facilitate relationship building across user
    groups through the provision of a collaborative research environment. Ensuring
    uptake is possible only through a design process driven by feedback from potential
    users. Individual interviews, focus groups, testing, and an on-line form
    provide on-going feedback to the team. These are dealt with at daily
    development team meetings and bi-monthly Steering Group meetings. </p>
  <p>The RRN faces several challenges. One lies in developing a
    network capable of not only accessing but also combining the diverse collection
    management systems of all participating communities and institutions.&nbsp; Another is the requirement that the user
    interface support deep, comprehensive search explorations and yet be intuitive
    for users with little experience with computers, databases, and repository
    systems.&nbsp; </p>
  <h1>The System Architecture</h1>
  <p>A difficult problem in supporting research with museum-held
    data is to create and maintain a comprehensive view of objects and archives
    spanning a variety of different museums, access models, collection management
    systems (CMS), standards for terminology and data management. A plan has been
    developed to meet some, if not all, of these challenges.</p>
  <p>To understand the challenge simply of gathering the data for
    the RRN collection, consider the sources. Within the RRN, there are four
    co-developers, each with a collection and database, and twelve partner
    institutions, each with a CMS, only part of which is relevant to the RRN.
    Within that set, there are a variety of different SQL and non-SQL database
    systems to integrate. Additionally, a key constraint in developing the system
    was the realization that museums providing data must be able to do so at
    virtually no cost. Clearly the model for continuing integration is critical.</p>
  <p>To achieve this, a federated model in which a central RRN
    server is provided with data by mediators at each participating museum is
    proposed. Each mediator is responsible for monitoring the local CMS, mapping
    changes into the RRN&rsquo;s data model, and providing a local view of how each
    partner museum&rsquo;s collection appears and is being used. A diagram of this model
    is shown in Fig 1,
    with each of three partner institution&rsquo;s CMS&rsquo;s maintaining their connection to
    the RRN via a mediator. The mediators are each responsible for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>gathering
      and updating that portion of the host CMS that is relevant and to be shared
      with the RRN;</li>
    <li>translating
      the data from its local form into the RRN data structure; and</li>
    <li>gathering
      usage statistics and a feed of relationships established with the CMS&rsquo;s data
      back to interested parties in the partner institution.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this way, institutions can join at very low cost, and be
    provided with a valuable tool for relating their collection to other similar
    collections. Moreover, due to the reciprocal nature of the network, they will
    be provided with feedback about their collection data.</p>
  <p>Some institutions are XML ready, in the sense that they are
    able to dump their collection data to a transportable XML format. For these
    institutions, their XML standards can be mapped to the RRN data standards. This
    can be done either by the museum&rsquo;s regularly writing an update file, or by an
    update request sent by one of the RRN servers. </p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="Iverson.figure1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="282" height="239" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 1: RRN System Architecture and
    Federation Model</p>
  <p>The means by which each mediator gathers and updates local
    data to the RRN collection must be matched to that collection&rsquo;s CMS and data standards.
    Initially, we are manually developing customized data gatherers and creating
    the semantic and structural data mapping (crosswalk) for each collection.
    Eventually, with a library of existing mediators, one of the existing mediator
    implementations will be selected and minor adaptations made for each new
    partner.</p>
  <p>These crosswalks depend on the target data: the data
    structure and semantics relied on by the RRN itself. To that end, the data
    structure has been designed hopefully to provide a neutral, efficient &ldquo;common
    ground&rdquo; data structure for these systems. After considering the possibility of
    building on an RDF (Resource Description Framework) database and relying on the
    CIDOC CRM (<a
href="http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/">http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr</a>), this
    possibility was rejected because of the difficulty of building a fast,
    interactive&nbsp; application on top of
    an RDF database, and the additional difficulties of maintaining an accurate
    semantic mapping from legacy data to such a complex target with well-defined
    semantics. Instead, we decided to design a simple, adaptable data structure
    that would allow for efficient implementation and adaptable queries on a
    traditional RDBMS (Relational Database Management System). The ability to
    participate in CRM-mediated data systems is potentially important, so care was
    taken to avoid any obvious incompatibilities in the design; we intend to
    develop CRM-based RDF feeds of RRN collections in the future.</p>
  <p>The data design is based on the Entity Relationship diagram
    shown in Fig
    2: Basic RRN Data Structure. At the center of the of the diagram and the data
    structure is the <i>Item</i>, a &ldquo;collection
    item&rdquo; defined as &ldquo;an object (either physical or digital) subject to cataloguing
    as a separate artifact in a collection. It is the primary locus of information
    about specific items in a collection.&rdquo; Each Item has a name, catalogue number
    and <i>Site</i> (a record identifying
    its source), and then a set of associations with generic holders of certain kinds
    of related information (Notes, Categories, DigitalObjects and Events).</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="Iverson.figure2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="509" height="487" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 2: Basic RRN Data Structure</p>
  <p><i>Notes: </i>A set of
    textual annotations on this Item. Each Note has a type that identifies its
    relation with the Item (e.g. &ldquo;description&rdquo;), a block of text, and an associated <i>Event </i>that records an attribution
    of the Note.</p>
  <p><i>Categories: </i>A set of <i>Category </i>elements that represent all of the various
    categorizations of this Item. Each Category is related to an Item by an <i>ItemCategory</i> that describes the relation (e.g. &ldquo;made-of&rdquo;,
    &ldquo;kind-of&rdquo;) and links to an <i>Event</i> that records an attribution of this categorization (i.e. who made the
    categorization and when). This intervening association also allows the
    Item-Category relation to be many-to-many.</p>
  <p><i>DigitalObjects</i>: A set
    of digital objects related to this item. Each DigitalObject describes itself in
    terms of a title, description, MIME type and URL where the object may be
    accessed. Items and DigitalObjects are related by an <i>ItemDigitalObject </i>that describes this relation (e.g. &ldquo;self&rdquo;
    for Items that <i>are </i>digital
    objects, or &ldquo;depiction&rdquo; for images of the Item). Again, many DigitalObjects can
    be related to any Item and vice-versa (e.g.,. a photograph that shows a number
    of collection items on site).</p>
  <p><i>Events: </i>An event
    associated with the Item. Each Event has a type (e.g. &ldquo;creation&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;collection&rdquo;), start and end date, and optional associated <i>People</i> and <i>Locations. </i>These are used for all attributions, including provenance, and for recording
    the dates of any actions taken with respect to the Item (e.g. when it was
    entered into the CMS and by whom;&nbsp; when it was restored or repaired).</p>
  <p>It should now be clear that this structure is compatible
    with CIDOC-CRM. Each of the related attributes of a collection Item is defined
    as a generic holder of a <i>type </i>of
    information (e.g. Notes hold text, DigitalObjects hold media, Events hold time
    and place) and describes its relation to the Item by a textual type. This is
    essentially how RDF (on which CIDOC-CRM is based) works, and similar structures
    to this are used when storing RDF data in relational database systems.
    Therefore, one could build a fully functional CMS on top of this model. In
    essence, this was one of the fundamental constraints in the development of the
    model - that it could naturally represent any of the CMS data being imported.</p>
  <p>This model easily accommodates multiple categorizations of
    the collection items. Knowing that a variety of categorization standards exist
    for simply describing First Nations communities (e.g. by language or nation)
    and that the partner institutions subscribe to different standards, it becomes
    critical that these categories be represented not only as they are within the
    partner museums&rsquo; CMSes, but also that translations are provided to other
    standards. This will allow convenient access to users familiar with either
    standard. Therefore, Categories are organized into Vocabularies, each of which
    contains a hierarchy of Category elements and some restrictions as to what ItemCategory
    relations they may be used for. Multiple Vocabularies may represent the same
    attributes of an item, and we may be able to derive mappings that automatically
    relate categorizations in one Vocabulary to those in another (e.g. two
    different material classification models). The RRN data model can support
    multiple Category associations for the same attribute (e.g. an Item may be
    composed of multiple materials). Putting these two capabilities together, once
    there is a categorization of an attribute with a Category that can be mapped to
    a different vocabulary, we can simply associate the Item with the equivalent
    Category in the other Vocabulary and support users familiar with both
    Vocabularies simultaneously.</p>
  <h1>User Interface</h1>
  <p>In designing the user interface to allow researchers to
    explore and manage their own use of the aggregated collection data, there were
    a number of significant and sometimes conflicting imperatives:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Clearly, a traditional keyword-based search model is
      necessary in today&rsquo;s world, if only because it is the most familiar means of
      accessing any body of information in the post-Google world.</li>
    <li>Since the goal of the entire project was to consolidate a
      variety of research collections and make them available to researchers, it was
      important that complex, research-specific queries be supported, and that the
      results allow researchers to compare, analyse and find gaps and
      inconsistencies, not only in individual items, but also in the entire set of
      items returned.</li>
    <li>Given that the targeted research community includes a wide
      variety of formal education levels (from university faculty to youth) and of
      familiarity with computers, it is necessary to support these complex
      research-specific queries, especially for people with little or no experience
      with either computers or formal vocabularies.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To accomplish this, the interface was approached from the
    point-of-view advocated by Marchionini (2006): he defines the principle of &ldquo;exploratory
    search&rdquo;. In this model, we are searching not merely for &ldquo;a few most-representative
    examples&rdquo; (the criteria that lead&nbsp; to the Google PageRank algorithm [Brin &amp; Page, 1998]), but for an
    entire, complete collection of related information that is further
    contextualized by user interpretation and various relations to other items and
    other collections. A successful method for achieving this goal has been the
    hierarchical, faceted data browsing approach with embedded pivot points
    pioneered in Flamenco (English et. al. 2002).</p>
  <p>In this model, a user starts with an interface to the entire
    collection and a high-level description of the various &ldquo;facets&rdquo; available for
    filtering the current collection. For example, when shopping for electronics, a
    &ldquo;product type&rdquo; facet might hierarchically&nbsp; organize all products sold by their department, category, and finally by
    name. A parallel, &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; facet might simply have a non-hierarchical
    list of manufacturers in alphabetical order. Finally, a &ldquo;price&rdquo; facet would
    typically be divided into price categories such as &ldquo;&lt; $10&rdquo; or &ldquo;between $10
    and $20&rdquo;. The interface allows the user to select one of these facets and
    choose a restriction on that facet. The current list of products shown is
    immediately updated to include only those products conforming to the selected
    criteria. Furthermore, the range of values available in the parallel facets is
    restricted to only those values available within the newly restricted set. The
    simultaneous selection of restrictions in parallel facets has the desired
    effect of simultaneously restricting by all of the associated criteria. The
    result is a much more exploratory interface that allows even inexperienced
    users to build complex queries interactively.</p>
  <p>In implementing this basic principle in the RRN, the data
    facets have provisionally been organized into four groups: &ldquo;Who&rdquo;, &ldquo;What&rdquo;, &ldquo;When&rdquo;
    and &ldquo;Where&rdquo;. Each of these interrogatives groups together those attributes of
    an item (including associations) that have a particular data type and provides
    a set of questions that may be asked of the current set of items.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Who</i> implies an interest
      in the people associated with the item and presents a set of facets derived
      from Events (e.g. &ldquo;Who created the item?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Who collected the item?&rdquo;)</li>
    <li><i>What</i> implies an
      interest in inherent properties of the item, how it is described or, in our
      data terms, its various associated Categories (e.g. &ldquo;What kind of item is it?&rdquo;
      or &ldquo;What is the item made of?&rdquo;)</li>
    <li><i>When</i> implies an
      interest in the timeline of the item and again queries the Events associated
      with the item (e.g. &ldquo;When was the item created?&rdquo; and &ldquo;When was the item
      collected?&rdquo;)</li>
    <li><i>Where </i>implies an
      interest in geographical data and once again queries the Events associated with
      the item (e.g. &ldquo;Where was the item collected?&rdquo;)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Opening the &ldquo;Who&rdquo; tab in the interface presents the user
    with a list of questions that may be asked of the current set. Selecting one of
    these questions sends an Ajax call to the server to gather the range of values
    that answer the question within the current set and presents these values to
    the user in a fashion that 1) shows the range, and 2) allows the user to select
    a specific answer or range of answers representing&nbsp; restricted interest. In each case, an effort is made to
    display the range of answers in a natural fashion, clearly exposing the number
    of items available should the user select that restriction.</p>
  <p>An example is shown in Figure 3: RRN Query Formation: here
    the collection has already been geographically restricted through the selection
    of&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rdquo; and &ldquo;Creation Location&rdquo;
    and then &ldquo;Kingcome Inlet.&rdquo; Opening the &ldquo;What&rdquo; tab and choosing &ldquo;Materials&rdquo;
    creates a list of all the materials used to make the Kingcome Inlet items.
    These are shown as single-word &ldquo;top-level&rdquo; categories, alphabetically ordered
    and presented using a &ldquo;tagcloud&rdquo;-style (words are larger and bolder when they
    represent more items). In the example, the mouse hovers over the word &ldquo;fibre.&rdquo;
    A tool tip informs the user that there are &ldquo;103 items&rdquo; from Kingcome Inlet in
    this category. If the user clicks on &ldquo;fibre&rdquo;, the screen immediately updates to
    Figure 4: RRN Query Specialization. Note that the sentence describing the
    current restriction has been updated to include &ldquo;made of fibre&rdquo;; the header of
    the Materials section now shows &ldquo;Materials &quot; fibre&rdquo;; and alternative
    subcategories of fibre, namely &ldquo;cotton fibre&rdquo; and &ldquo;wool fibre,&rdquo; are listed.
    Unseen in the figure, the list of items below this query block has also been
    updated to display only those 103 items.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="iverson.figure3_thumb.png" alt="Figure 3" width="400" height="328" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 3: RRN Query Formation</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="iverson.figure4_thumb.png" alt="Figure 4" width="400" height="183" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 4: RRN Query Specialization</p>
  <p>This textual presentation of alternatives works well for
    many queries, but falls short when displaying or selecting in the &ldquo;Where&rdquo; and &ldquo;When&rdquo;
    tabs. When displaying a timeline for a collection, we display a linear,
    logarithmically-scaled histogram of item counts within a range of dates. When
    selecting &ldquo;Where&rdquo; an event occurred, we can display either a place name
    hierarchy (from standardized gazetteers) or an experimental Google maps
    interface that can select regions from geographical coordinates.</p>
  <p>We have demonstrated this interface to a wide variety of
    users and have been gratified by the results. For example, some First Nation
    elders with little computer background were easily able to find sets of items
    of interest to them. They began immediately to provide feedback as to the
    accuracy of the collection data. A formal usability study investigating
    presentation models, query labels (e.g. should we use the &ldquo;question style&rdquo;
    discussed above, or the simple headers shown in the figures) and other features
    will be conducted in conjunction with less formal methods for gathering
    feedback.</p>
  <p>One on the most important steps in engaging with potential
    RRN users will come with the testing of the collaborative tools. These include
    the ability to create collections of interest, annotate them, organize them,
    and engage in a dialogue related to the items. In order to accomplish this, we
    plan to integrate a separate, open-source social note-taking and annotation
    system called Opntag (Iverson et. al. 2008, <a href="http://opntag.net/">http://opntag.net</a>).
    This system provides social bookmarking, note-taking, tag-based organization,
    and awareness functionality with a deeply integrated privacy-control mechanism
    that supports an application class we are calling Social/Personal Information
    Management (SPIM). It has been deployed and used for a number of years by a
    group of users, and though it is still evolving and maturing, people are
    integrating this new tool into their day-to-day information processing
    activities. Once integration is complete, users will be able to annotate items
    or item sets derived from faceted queries, engage in conversations about those
    items, and see interest markers and tags applied to items by other users. They
    will also be able to set privacy levels and invite others to participate with
    them in research projects. Furthermore, the partner institutions will be able
    to gather records on this use and gauge interest in the items from their
    collections. We plan to complete a preliminary integration of these two major
    components in the summer of 2008.</p>
  <h1>Conclusions</h1>
  <p>The RRN pilot is available for testing at
    www.rrndevelopment.org. It exists as a Web-based sandbox and currently has
    access to three very different databases: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>a
      MimsyXG database of anthropological collections at the Museum of Anthropology,</li>
    <li>a
      FilemakerPro database of archaeological collections at the UBC Laboratory of
      Archaeology and </li>
    <li>an Access database of collections at the U&rsquo;mista
      Cultural Centre.&nbsp; </li>
  </ol>
  <p>It features an easy-to-use interface with faceted search
    capabilities and pivot points. Users have their own profiles and can
    create/share collections. Simple collaborative tools are being tested at this
    time. Community members, elders, experts in fields related to the RRN, and
    volunteers are regularly testing the RRN pilot.</p>
  <p>The co-development process so far has effectively modeled
    the vision for the RRN.&nbsp; When the
    Steering Group started, separate relationships with MOA were the main links
    between the four co-developers. Through this project, the ties between the
    co-developers have been strengthened, and the working relationships mirror the
    proposed functioning of the RRN.</p>
  <p>Feedback from multiple user groups, with very different
    objectives and perceived ways of using the system, is critical to this project.
    In many cases, it has forced a re-evaluation of priorities. When this project
    started, there were no equivalents for people to explore. The sandbox approach
    has been transformative in assisting potential users to see the system and
    imagine how they might use it. Workshops and focus groups inevitably lead to
    discussions of the RRN&rsquo;s research potential and the questions that can be posed
    and investigated. These range from explorations of stylistic change of an
    artist over her career, to discussions of the meaning of culturally sensitive,
    to opportunities to change the way exhibits are created. </p>
  <p>The provisional rollout date for the Reciprocal Research
    Network is October 2009. </p>
