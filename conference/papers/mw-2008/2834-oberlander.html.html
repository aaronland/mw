  <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
  <p>Second Life is a
    massive multi-user on-line environment; &ldquo;a 3D virtual world where users can
    socialize, connect and create using voice and text chat&rdquo;
    (<a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">http://www.secondlife.com</a>). It is therefore not surprising that both
    real-world museums and private individual &lsquo;residents&rsquo; and groups are building
    on earlier work on 3D virtual galleries, exploring the possibilities offered by
    Second Life and other virtual environments that provide similar facilities
    (Calef, Vilbrandt, Vilbrandt, Goodwin and Goodwin, 2002; di Blas, Gobbo and
    Paolini, 2005; Rothfarb and Doherty, 2007; Urban, Marty and Twidale, 2007;
    Wieneke, N&uuml;tzel and Arnold, 2007). In Web museums, visitors have become
    accustomed to clicking on images displayed in their browser to retrieve
    pre-written textual descriptions of cultural heritage objects (Sumption, 2006).
    It seems straightforward to adapt this to Second Life and allow a visitor (represented
    by an avatar) to click on an object to read a &lsquo;notecard&rsquo; attached to it
    (Rothfarb and Doherty, 2007).</p>
  <p>Such environments may
    have significant motivational advantages over more conventional Internet-based
    media (Urban et al., 2007). But we see a specific additional opportunity. The
    virtues of Second Life can be combined with those found in our earlier work on
    personalisation of the museum experience. In particular, user-tailored
    information can be delivered either through dynamic labels on objects or through
    embodied conversational agents - avatars representing virtual museum curators.
    In this paper, we record some of our first attempts to season Second Life with
    a hint of personalization. But first, we provide some detail on the
    ingredients. </p>
  <h1>2. Museums In Second Life</h1>
  <p>Urban et
    al. (2007) survey museum developments in Second Life, gathering evidence from
    more than 150 sites, and draw attention to a number of emerging trends. They
    emphasise that, although museums tend to be understandably concerned about the
    accurate representation of their artefacts, &ldquo;The social nature of Second Life is a critical component of
    understanding what it is and how it can, and should, be used.&rdquo; This confirms the view of di Blas et al. (2005), who previously pointed out
    that &ldquo;the strong point of shared 3D environments is not realism but
    rather virtual presence (i.e. 'I am engaged in an activity with someone else'),
    to which realism or high quality graphics are not relevant issues.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Urban et al. cite a
    number of features which help distinguish the new museums into groups.
    Regarding scale, they note that (because avatars can fly) artefacts can float
    in mid air or be attached high up on walls, and be much larger than is possible
    in physical buildings. Setting is linked to this: some sites (like the Second
    Louvre, <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Tompson/153/96/100/">http://slurl.com/secondlife/Tompson/153/96/100/</a>) do emulate specific
    physical buildings and interior decoration, but there is no necessity to
    display virtual objects &lsquo;under cover&rsquo;. They also note that, unless a museum
    builds its galleries on its own private island, there may be problems with the
    neighbours and the tone of the neighbourhood. Considering persistence, they
    note that the changeable nature of not just exhibitions but also of museum
    buildings can disorient repeat visitors, but can be managed by distinguishing
    permanent from temporary galleries. On media richness, they note that while
    video streaming into Second Life allows for mixed realities, the possibility of
    using &lsquo;holodecks&rsquo; within the environment is now being explored. Regarding
    visitor engagement, they note the importance of scheduled special events to
    draw visitors in at the same time, so that they can enjoy opportunities for
    social interaction. Commenting on the variety of intended purposes - ranging
    from artefact display to environment simulation to historical recreations -
    they note that there can be specific difficulties associated with the use of
    non-player characters to add realism. Clearly, a balance must be struck; while
    the Second Louvre &ldquo;does not provide much, if any, descriptive information about
    the artifacts on display,&rdquo; at the other extreme, the
    Computer History Museum (<a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/InfoIslandII/225/51/23">http://slurl.com/secondlife/InfoIslandII/225/51/23</a>/) &ldquo;features a slightly aggressive and somewhat insistent
    robot docent&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Rothfarb and Doherty
    (2007) observe that in the real world, a large amount of interpretive
    information accompanying an exhibit might satisfy one visitor but drive another
    away, while in the virtual environment, there are potential solutions to this
    problem: &ldquo;you can create rich textures adjacent to or on exhibit objects that
    contain visual or textual information, or you can attach notecard objects.&rdquo; Wieneke et al. (2007) note the success of the International
    Spaceflight Museum in Second Life (<a href="http://www.slispaceflightmuseum.org/">http://www.slispaceflightmuseum.org</a>), and
    observe that its design &ldquo;often cites and mimics real world museum
    features, like descriptive texts and even simulated audio guides.&rdquo; Notecard objects fit this mould, but we would go further, and
    urge the use of personalised, dynamically generated notecards, dynamic audio or
    even non-player avatars. Ellis, Patten and Evans (2005) explore a variety of
    more or less social museum media, and point to the continuing need to &ldquo;target personalised offerings at specific users.&rdquo; In the more traditional
    Web case, Aroyo et al. (2007) have recently explored personalization through
    the use of recommender systems. So long as they can avoid excessive aggression
    or insistence, avatars could be useful not just because they personalise the
    experience, but also because - returning to di Blas (2005) and Urban et al.
    (2007) - Second Life is about social interaction, and avatars can improve the
    social presence of the absent information providers who created the exhibit. </p>
  <p>Our adaptive gallery
    is designed in the first instance to address the problems presented by the need
    to cater to diverse individual visitors; we will shortly relate its specific
    features to those uncovered by Urban et al. (2007). The 3D gallery we are
    piloting in Second Life was initially developed in the project Xenios
    (<a href="http://www.ics.forth.gr/xenios">http://www.ics.forth.gr/xenios</a>) and is now being enhanced within the Indigo
    project (<a href="http://www.ics.forth.gr/indigo">http://www.ics.forth.gr/indigo</a>). Although Xenios was mainly concerned
    with real-world robotic guides, its Second Life gallery was used to demonstrate
    that some of the project&rsquo;s technology is also applicable to virtual 3D museums.</p>
  <p>The current Indigo
    project is directed at human-robot interaction in the real-world. As with
    Xenios, a robot is designed to act as a guide to places within the Hellenic Cosmos
    (<a href="http://www.hellenic-cosmos.gr/">http://www.hellenic-cosmos.gr</a>)
    cultural centre of the Foundation of the Hellenic World (FHW), now providing
    multi-lingual and multi-modal information about objects associated with the
    agora of ancient Athens. Compared with its immediate predecessors, the key
    aspect of Indigo is that it should support less restricted dialogues between
    people and a physical robot, using speech, gesture and facial expressions. But
    the human-robot dialogue techniques developed for the physical world would very
    naturally lend themselves to be being used by a &lsquo;robotic&rsquo; (machine controlled,
    non-player) avatar in a virtual environment like Second Life. Thus, we now
    sketch some details of the technology enabling the adaptive gallery under
    construction on the Virtual University of Edinburgh's Second Life archipelago.</p>
  <h1>3. The Technology Behind The Gallery</h1>
  <h2>3.1 Personalization</h2>
  <p>Our current gallery is
    based around two natural language generation systems: Methodius (Isard, 2007),
    developed at the University of Edinburgh; and NaturalOWL (Galanis and
    Androutsopoulos, 2007; Androutsopoulos and Galanis, 2008), developed at the
    Athens University of Economics and Business. NaturalOWL provides native support
    for Semantic Web standards (Antoniou and van Harmelen, 2004), such as OWL
    (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/">http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/</a>) and RDF (<a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF">http://www.w3.org/RDF</a>/); see also
    Ghiselli et al. (2005) and Ossenbruggen et al. (2007). In the Xenios project,
    NaturalOWL was embedded in a real-world mobile robotic guide, to generate
    spoken Greek and English descriptions of points of interest from an underlying
    OWL ontology in the premises FHW. Methodius was designed to be both robust and
    scalable up to millions of objects, and was used to demonstrate a test domain
    at the Royal Commission for the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland
    (RCAHMS, <a href="http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/">http://www.rcahms.gov.uk</a>). There are significant differences in the
    focus and implementation of these two generation systems, but discussions of
    these lie outside the focus of this paper.  We will therefore focus on their
    shared common heritage and underlying architecture, to give a background to the
    use of natural language generation in virtual museums.</p>
  <p>The gallery&rsquo;s
    personalization mechanisms are rather different from those underlying
    recommender systems. The basic idea is to create a new text for all individual
    users, each time they view an object, by taking account not only of the their
    preferences, but also the context in which they arrive at a specific object.
    The core of the personalization is the natural language generation system, a
    form of artificial intelligence which allows data (captured here from
    collections information management systems and from interviews with curators)
    to be presented in more user-friendly language.</p>
  <h2>3.2 Natural Language Generation</h2>
  <p>There are four main
    stages in natural language generation: content selection, text planning,
    microplanning, and surface realization. In the first stage, the system consults
    a model of the user (and in our case, a set of educational priorities) and a
    representation of the interaction history, in order to select a subset of the
    information stored in its knowledge base. In the next stage, this information
    is placed in a specific order, taking into account the entities and relationships
    mentioned in each piece of information. Then, again consulting the interaction
    history, the system&rsquo;s microplanner specifies the verbs and noun phrases, and
    how they are to be &lsquo;aggregated&rsquo; together, so that more than one idea can be
    expressed in a given sentence. Finally, the surface realizer converts these
    specifications into actual text (or a specification which can be converted to
    speech by a speech synthesizer).</p>
  <p>This means that the
    system can adapt its descriptions of museum objects to take into account what
    has been described before, thereby avoiding redundancy and enabling comparisons
    to be drawn with objects the visitor has already seen.  It can also highlight
    ways in which an object resembles or differs from the majority of similar items
    in a collection.</p>
  <h2>3.3 Previous Generation Systems</h2>
  <p>Two previous systems
    form the basis of our current natural language generation technologies. ILEX
    was developed at the University of Edinburgh, in collaboration with the
    National Museums of Scotland (Hitzeman, Mellish and Oberlander, 1997;
    Oberlander, Mellish, O&rsquo;Donnell and Knott, 1997; O'Donnell, Mellish, Oberlander
    and Knott, 2001). There were two main versions: a Web-based virtual gallery;
    and a phone-based system for physical gallery visitors. It was followed by the
    M-PIRO system (Isard, Oberlander, Androutsopoulos and Matheson, 2003;
    Androutsopoulos, Oberlander and Karkaletsis, 2007). This added support for
    Greek and Italian, along with improved authoring support, and with more
    sophisticated user modeling. Teams in Edinburgh, Athens, Trento and London (<a
href="http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/mpiro">http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/mpiro</a>) worked
    with FHW to provide written and spoken descriptions of ancient Greek artefacts,
    displayed both in a Web-gallery and in FHW's 3D virtual reality centre.</p>
  <h1>4. An Adaptive Gallery In Second Life</h1>
  <h2>4.1 Vue: The Virtual University Of Edinburgh</h2>
  <p>The VUE group is &ldquo;a
    virtual educational and research institute bringing together all those
    interested in the use of virtual worlds for teaching, research
    and&nbsp;outreach related to the University of Edinburgh&rdquo;
    (<a href="http://vue.ed.ac.uk/">http://vue.ed.ac.uk/</a>). It is independent of Second Life, in that its virtual
    presences are not confined to it. Nonetheless, Second Life currently provides a
    focal point for researchers from Schools such as Education, Architecture, and
    Informatics. The VUE archipelago houses meetings, tutorials, entertainment,
    artworks, temporary constructions, and various kinds of academic research,
    including our gallery (<a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Vue/205/53/30">http://slurl.com/secondlife/Vue/205/53/30</a>),
    which is currently available only to visitors participating in experiments.</p>
  <h2>4.2 The Adaptive Gallery</h2>
  <p>Referring back to the
    features isolated by Urban et al. (2007), our current adaptive gallery is
    conventional as to space and setting, being relatively small and located on a
    University&rsquo;s own island. It is relatively permanent, and does not currently mix
    realities for a richer media experience - unless we consider the avatar itself
    to be a &lsquo;medium&rsquo;. As yet, we have not mounted any scheduled events; this is
    because the continuous presence of a software-controlled interpreter, in the
    shape of a non-human robot, means that a visitor will always confront another
    social presence in the space. How social it is, of course, depends both on its
    appearance and on whether we can provide a smooth experience for users,
    avoiding excessively insistent behaviour, for instance; and this has yet to be
    demonstrated. </p>
  <h2>4.3 A Sample Visit</h2>
  <p>To give a flavour of a
    visitor&rsquo;s experience in the prototype gallery, we here provide a sequence of
    screenshots taken within Second Life. In each case, part of the text which the
    user sees is visible in the image, and the full text is given below it.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="oberlander-fig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="400" height="299" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 1: Gallery visitor views a prochous</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The avatar says:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">This is a prochous. A prochous is a vessel that was used to pour liquids. It has one handle, a large body , and a nib-like neck.  This particular prochous was decorated using the red-figure technique.  In the red-figure technique, the silhouettes have the red colour of clay, while the background and details are rendered in black.  This prochous was created during the classical period. The classical period is characterised by the initial political supremacy of Athens (its &quot;golden age&quot;), which was followed by the expansion of the Greek world under the rule of Alexander the Great of Macedonia. It covers the time between 480 and 323 B.C. This prochous dates from the second quarter of the 5th century B.C. It depicts a Greek hunting a Persian. Currently it is exhibited in the Museum f&uuml;r Kunst in Hamburg.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="oberlander-fig2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="400" height="280" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 2: Gallery visitor views a tetradrachm </p>
  <p>The avatar says:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">This is a
    tetradrachm.  Like the prochous that you saw earlier, it was created during the
    classical period. It originates from Attica and it dates from between 440 and
    420 B.C. It is made of silver and today it is exhibited in the Numismatic
    Museum of Athens.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="oberlander-fig3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="400" height="280" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 3: Gallery visitor views a drachma</p>
  <p>The avatar says:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">This is a drachma,
    created during the classical period.  Like the tetradrachm that you saw
    earlier, which is also on my left, this drachma originates from Attica and it
    is made of silver.  It dates from circa the 5th century B.C.  It has an image
    of Athena crowned with a branch of olive, her tree, on its obverse.  On its
    reverse, there is a picture of the goddess&rsquo; owl.  A drachma was enough for a
    &ldquo;metic&rdquo; (that is, a foreigner who stayed in Athens) to pay the &ldquo;metic tax&rdquo; each
    month.  Currently this drachma is exhibited in the Agora Museum of Athens.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="oberlander-fig4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="400" height="280" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 4: Gallery visitor views a stater</p>
  <p>The avatar says:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">This is a stater, a kind of coin.  It was created during
    the Hellenistic period.  The Hellenistic period is the chaotic period from the
    death of Alexander the Great and the subsequent dissolution of his empire to
    the victory of the Romans over the Greeks at the Battle of Actium, comprising a
    truly international range of artistic trends.  The Hellenistic period covers
    the time between 323 and 31 B.C.  This stater originates from the Aetolian
    League and it dates from between 220 and 189 B.C.  While all the previous coins
    that you saw are made of silver, it is made of gold.</p>
  <p>As can be seen, the
    system never repeats information which it has already expressed. The first time
    that the classical period is mentioned, in the description of the prochous
    (Figure 1), extended information about the period is provided. When the user
    then moves on to the tetradrachm (Figure 2), which was also created during the
    classical period, no information about the period is repeated.</p>
  <p>The drachma (Figure 3)
    has several similar attributes to the tetradrachm (Figure 2), and these are
    highlighted in the third text.  In the fourth text (Figure 4), we learn that
    the stater is made of a different material from both the previous coins.  The
    system also has some spatial awareness, and is able to refer to objects in
    terms of their position, demonstrated in the third text (Figure 3), where the
    tetradrachm is now to the left of the avatar.</p>
  <h1>5. Conclusions</h1>
  <p>We noted
    earlier that avatars can compensate socially for the absent information
    providers who created the exhibit. But even if well-designed, such avatars
    simply deliver personalised information to an individual visitor, so they run a
    risk already observed in the real world. There,
    Sumption (2006) points out that developers of wireless handheld guides must &ldquo;look
    for solutions that avoid the often socially isolating consequences of so many
    current electronic guides.&rdquo; This strikes us as a
    challenge relevant to the virtual as well as the physical museum guide, and we
    hope to address it as part of our programme of work.</p>
  <p>There are not yet any
    user evaluations for our virtual gallery, since it is still under development.
    However, studies of several of the previous systems mentioned above have shown
    that users both prefer and learn more from systems which use personalization
    than from those which do not (Cox, O&rsquo;Donnell and Oberlander, 1999; Karasimos
    and Isard, 2004; Marge, 2007).</p>
  <p>It is planned that the
    current gallery will be extended to allow the National Museums of Scotland to
    pilot new real-world gallery designs, and we intend to carry out evaluations of
    users interacting with more-or-less human-like avatars. In particular, we aim
    to exploit an evaluation technique piloted by Dalzel-Job, Nichol and Oberlander
    (2008): tracking the gazes of a human users as  they explore an environment
    within Second Life, and interact with the avatars within it. </p>
  <p>We also plan to extend
    our technology to support natural language generation from ontologies compliant
    with the CIDOC CRM standard (<a href="http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/">http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/</a>), which is now also
    available in OWL.</p>
