    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Since April 2007
        several research teams and heritage organisations in Flanders have been
        involved in a research trajectory that is called &lsquo;Heritage 2.0&rsquo;, in which
        problems regarding the on-line distribution of digital cultural heritage are
        analysed. Flanders possesses a rich offer of cultural heritage. However, as is
        the case all over the world, information and data about this cultural heritage
        is often hidden in archives and specialised documentation centres. Nowadays
        this information is increasingly available in a digital format. This creates a
        lot of new opportunities. Indeed, it becomes more and more possible to link
        on-line sources of data about cultural heritage. Out of this combination of
        information heritage professionals can create new cultural heritage stories and
        can distribute much richer information to their audiences. Moreover, the
        distribution of on-line information about cultural heritage can attract local
      and regional cultural tourists.</p>
      <p>The combination of
        different kinds of information about cultural heritage goes beyond the
        organisational and policy borders of the different heritage sub-sectors. Both
        movable and immovable, tangible and intangible cultural heritage are involved in
        this process. These different sub-sectors, and even institutions within the
        sub-sectors, often use different ways to describe their heritage content. In
        other words, they use different metadata (data to describe content) models. One
        of the main challenges of the project is to develop a generic metadata exchange
        model for the whole Flemish heritage sector. It is unique in that it spans the
        different heritage sectors. Nonetheless, the target is not to create a
        centralised database, but rather to facilitate communication between existing
        databases and metadata standards, removing a bottleneck much complained about
      by heritage experts.</p>
      <p>As well as&nbsp; connecting information from different
        kinds of data sources to construct new and rich heritage stories, the project
        is looking for new ways to distribute these stories. One of the possibilities
        is the use of mobile devices. Heritage institutions increasingly are
        experimenting with mobile technologies for presenting their heritage to the
        visitor. Devices such as PDA, MP3 and smart phone are no longer unheard of by
        common visitors. The question is however, are heritage institutions capable of
        taking this road? And maybe even more important, are they willing to invest in
      this new way of presenting heritage?</p>
      <p>The Heritage 2.0
        project intends to remove possible bottlenecks that might hinder the
        implementation of this process, starting with the search for heritage
        information and ending with the presentation of a heritage story. However, the
        mere translation of the heritage information into a story that is interesting
      for the visitor is not part of the research project.</p>
      <p>During the last
        months, researchers involved in the project conducted a range of focus groups
        with professionals from different heritage sectors. Qualitatively rather than
        quantitatively, focus groups were designed to get insight into the opinions of
        a limited number of selected participants. The aim was to unveil the needs and
        visions of these experts concerning this new way of searching and presenting
        heritage information. In addition, the research team interviewed several
        international experts to understand how they view the present and future of
        mobile heritage presentation. This paper aims to presenting some of the most
      interesting results following that research.</p>

      <h1>Researching The Needs And Views Of Flemish Heritage Experts Concerning
      Digital Cultural Heritage</h1>
      <p>We conducted a
        series of focus group conversations with professionals originating from
        different Flemish heritage sub sectors. It was our intention to cover a broad
        spectrum of the heritage sector since this sector is known by its diverse
        landscape. Hence we talked with, among others, representatives of heritage
        cells. Heritage cells in Flanders don&rsquo;t manage their own heritage; instead, it
        is their responsibility to promote heritage to a large public, to stimulate
        collaboration between heritage institutions, to map local heritage...
        Furthermore, we consulted museum representatives, delegates from archives and
        documentation centres, representatives of coordinating cultural heritage
        bodies, people working within the sector of the local heritage and
      representatives of heritage sites. </p>
      <p>It was our intention
        to find out more about their opinions concerning the two major components of
        the Heritage 2.0 &ndash; research project: the creation of a communication
        layer on top of existing databases, and the presentation of heritage by means
        of mobile technologies such as a PDA. Regarding the creation of a metadata
        layer, we asked about possible bottlenecks and added values. As to mobile
        heritage presentation, we were interested in knowing about significant issues
        as well as possible pitfalls, added values and wishes. By &lsquo;wishes&rsquo;, we meant
      what they would like to accomplish if they had unlimited resources.</p>
      <p>We begin this paper
        by uncovering the most important issues raised during the various focus group
        conversations concerning the creation of a communication layer. Next we
        summarize these matters into a general view of the heritage experts. We proceed
        by outlining their thoughts and reflections on mobile heritage presentation.
        Since the heritage sector in Flanders is very diverse, we decided to zoom in on
        the ideas of the different sub-sectors in the case of the creation of a layer for
        connecting these different sectors of movable, immovable, tangible and
        intangible cultural heritage. As for mobile heritage presentation, we chose to
        focus on the similarities among the different focus groups as the heritage
        experts reflected a more general point of view, taking into account the entire
      heritage sector.</p>
      <h1>Creating A Communication Layer: A Vision From Each Sub Sector</h1>
      <h2>Heritage Cells</h2>
      <p>Representatives of
        Flemish heritage cells mentioned a couple of bottlenecks concerning the
        construction of a metadata layer. They referred to the fear of certain heritage
        institutions of putting information on-line as well as to the lack of staff and
        priorities in the light of registering and describing heritage objects. There
        is still a lot of work to do regarding the digitising of objects. Also, different
        institutions describe their objects in a different manner due to different
      needs. This might hinder the connecting of databases, they argue.</p>
      <p>However, they are
        convinced that there are also advantages connected to this kind of
        communication layer. For example, this will spare the users a lot of time since
        they&nbsp; only need to ask one question
        instead of consulting every institution separately to find relevant
        information. This might even reveal information that was formerly unknown by
        the users. Moreover, such a layer creates the opportunity for heritage
        institutions to communicate and connect their content. This might lead to a
      mutual opening up of their collections.</p>
      <h2>Museums</h2>
      <p>The representatives
        of museums emphasized the importance of this communication layer since it
        doesn&rsquo;t exist at the moment, and they believe it is needed for building a broad
        heritage story. Furthermore, putting a layer on top of existing databases
        avoids the creation of a central database. This is positive since doubling
        databases only creates more work. But a lack of cooperation within the heritage
        sector might be an obstacle. Also, heritage institutions want to be sure that
        the data and metadata they send out are correct, so they want control. But maintaining
        control is very time-consuming. Moreover, the description of data is generally
      very basic. </p>
      <p>The advantages of this communication layer are, according to
        the museum representatives, both possible collaboration between heritage
        institutions and the connecting and easy retrieval of objects originating from
      different sources.</p>
      <h2>Archives And Documentation Centres</h2>
      <p>The experts we spoke to in this group highlighted a couple
        of concerns. They warned us not to create needless layers. They questioned
        whether museums and other heritage experts need this kind of layer since they
        already know their sources. In addition, they referred to the lack of
        digitalised data and metadata: in one word, input. Moreover, not everything is
        described in the same manner and with the same detail. There is also the danger
        of an overload of information as well as of the expert assuming wrongly that he
        will find all the information there is on a certain topic via this
        communication layer. These representatives fear that this project is too broad
      and too ambitious to be successful since the heritage sector is so varied.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, they acknowledged that this kind of
        communication layer might facilitate the retrieval process for the heritage
        expert. It is also a way for archives to unlock their data, and it offers the
        opportunity to cross the borders of different heritage sub-sectors. This could
        lead to a better understanding of the context of a certain topic since related
      objects are often kept in different locations.</p>
      <h2>Coordinating Bodies</h2>
      <p>The spokesmen within this focus group wondered whether this
        layer will actually facilitate the retrieval process since the users still need
        to translate the retrieved information into a story that is interesting for the
        visitor. In addition, they mentioned a couple of requirements for this layer to
        be successful. They talked about the need of user friendliness and the fact
        that it should be logical, reliable, complete, open and easy to use. Also, they
        emphasized the need for a long-term vision of a project like Heritage 2.0.
        Bottlenecks they pointed out were the lack of digitally registered data as well
        as the lack of expertise, resources, ICT-knowledge and a clear vision within
        heritage institutions. These shortages result, according to the representatives,
        in the fact that a lot of organisations are not yet ready to cooperate in this
        kind of communication project. Therefore, there is a need for support from a
        higher body. Lastly, they mentioned the importance of copyright. It should be
        made clear how this will work within the context of this new communication
      layer.</p>
      <p>The value of this layer is that it offers heritage
        institutions the opportunity to profile themselves and open up to the world.
        Additionally, it is a means of connecting the heritage sector and grouping
      relevant information for the users. This might result in new heritage stories.</p>
      <h2>Local Heritage</h2>
      <p>Representatives within this sub-sector focused on the lack
        of expertise, knowledge sharing, staff and digitally described content as the
        most important problems. However, they mentioned the possibility of retrieving
        local knowledge that is often overlooked or unknown and of connecting
        information originating from scientific databases with information coming from
      local organisations.</p>
      <h2>Heritage Sites</h2>
      <p>Whether institutions will be prepared to cooperate in this
        kind of project will depend upon the cost of this system, these heritage
        professionals argue. Copyright is not really a problem, so they say, since
        heritage institutions should decide about them. However, it is important to
      keep in mind that some information is not meant to be accessible to everybody.</p>
      <p>The biggest advantage of this layer is the fact that it
        offers the possibility to connect institutions that work with different
        database systems. This will also relieve heritage institutions since staff will
        have to answer fewer calls and e-mails from heritage experts in search for
        information on a certain topic. Finally, the mere existence of this
        communication layer might stimulate heritage institutions, the experts believe,
      to continue to make an inventory of their collections and unlock them.</p>
      <h2>Creating A Communication Layer: A General View From The Flemish Heritage
      Sector</h2>
      <p>The experts see a couple of pitfalls that could obstruct the
        creation of a communication layer connecting metadata from different heritage
        institutions that originate from different heritage sectors. To begin with,
        there is a lack of input within the heritage sector; namely, there is
        insufficient digitalised and digitally described data. And when there is no
      input, there will be no output, the experts warn. </p>
      <p>They also mention that different institutions use different
        systems for organizing their data because they all have their own needs. This
      makes it difficult to connect these data. </p>
      <p>Lastly, the experts refer to copyright issues. These issues
        are not insuperable, but it needs to be made clear what will be released by
        means of this communication layer and what won&rsquo;t be released. For certain
        experts this is not really a problem because it is the institutions that should
      decide in advance what can be made public and what can&rsquo;t.</p>
      <p>They also see some added values related to this
        communication layer. For the professional who wants to build a heritage story
        regarding a certain topic, it would be a lot easier to find information. It
        would no longer be necessary to consult different heritage institutions to find
        out whether they have some relevant data about this topic. Instead, the
        professional would be able to ask just one question and receive a lot of
        information. Furthermore, this layer offers the possibility to discover unknown
        and unexpected information. This is possible because the metadata of each
        institution are linked. Finally, by connecting data derived from different
        institutions, heritage professionals believe that the opportunity for
      stimulating collaboration within the broad heritage landscape is created.</p>
      <h2>Mobile Heritage Presentation: What Do Heritage Professionals Think Of It?</h2>
      <h3>Issues</h3>
      <p>To begin with, there are some issues about mobile heritage
        presentation that need&nbsp; thorough
      attention, according to the heritage experts we consulted. </p>
      <p>They mention the fact that it is important to guide visitors
        but at the same time to give them the freedom to choose. In particular, this
        means that heritage institutions should give visitors a story, a thread through
        the information that is delivered. On the other hand, visitors should be able
        to dig deeper into the information when they are&nbsp; interested in a certain topic. This combination is
      achievable by offering layered stories. </p>
      <p>Another issue is user-generated content. The experts believe
        this might be an interesting source of information. It offers the possibility
        of discovering information that cannot be discovered in another way. But at the
        same time, this kind of information gathering needs controlling, the experts
        argue. It needs to be filtered because not everybody will add valuable
        information. Since heritage institutions are responsible for the content of
        their databases, they have to be sure that content is of high quality. So there
        is a need for moderation, but this requires resources, and these are not always
      available.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, they note that it is important that a PDA
        should not be used as a replacement of other means of heritage presentation.
        The experts emphasize that a PDA should only be used when it offers real added
        value. In the case of a group visit, for example, they believe a human guide is
        more useful than a PDA. It is important to combine different means of heritage
      presentation. The technology is but a means to an end. </p>
      <p>The experts also stress the importance of content over
        technology. It should always be about the story, about the information that is
        delivered by means of a mobile device. That is the most significant, but also
      very time-consuming for the heritage institutions. </p>
      <p>Another piece of advice given by the experts is that the use
        of a PDA should always be carefully considered in advance. The heritage
        institution has to reflect on the long term. Will it be able to keep investing?
      Technology can become obsolete very fast.</p>
      <p>Lastly, the experts highlight the importance of the
        translation of heritage information into a story that is of interest to
        visitors. It doesn&rsquo;t work if the heritage institution just pours a huge amount
        of information on the visitors: visitors want a prepared story. At the same
        time, experts  realize that this translation will demand a lot of work from
      the heritage institution.</p>
      <h3>Bottlenecks</h3>
      <p>First, the experts mention the existence of a gap between
        big heritage institutions on the one hand and small and local institutions and
        organisations on the other hand. The latter are at this moment not capable of
        using mobile technologies for heritage presentation due to a lack of time,
        knowledge, money, resources and staff. By staff, the experts refer to both
        people who input data and people that translate this information into a story
      for the visitors.</p>
      <p>The experts point out some other problems. Some doubt that
        the visitor is ready for using this kind of mobile technology. They also talk
        about the danger of an overload of information when using this kind of heritage
        presentation as well as about the danger that the PDA will isolate the visitor
        from the exhibits. Moreover, they say that this causes a problem for the
        heritage institutions since they have to make sure to stuff the PDA with a
      sufficient amount of information. It is not always easy to find enough data.</p>
      <h3>Added Value</h3>
      <p>Nonetheless, the experts note several added values to the
      use of mobile devices for the delivery of heritage content to the visitor.</p>
      <p>To start with, they emphasize that a PDA offers more
        possibilities than the classical ways of presenting heritage. A PDA can be used
        to deliver both sound and vision as well as 3D reconstructions and can offer
        suggestions based upon the interests of the individual visitors. The experts
      also state that it can be very useful in outdoor situations.</p>
      <p>A PDA also creates opportunities for heritage institutions
        to deliver serious information in a pleasant way. This may result in opening up
        heritage to the larger audience and more specificly to a young public.
        Furthermore, it offers visitors the possibility of selecting information they
        are personally interested in. Mobile devices such as PDAs also have an added
        value for the heritage institutions themselves. They make it more feasible to
        collect data about the behaviour and interests of visitors. This can be useful
        information for developing future exhibitions. Furthermore, it is easier to
      change the content of a PDA than to rebuild an entire exhibition.</p>
      <p>Last but not least, visitors are able to collect and
        maintain information in an independent way. Before, during and after the visit
        visitors have access to a large amount of information. This is possible because
        information can be offered by means of different stories and different layers
      tailored to the specific interests of the visitor.</p>
      <h3>Wishes</h3>
      <p>We asked the experts about their wishes. What would they
      like to see happen if they possessed unlimited resources?</p>
      <p>The experts all emphasized the importance of information.
        There is a need to make an inventory of all the data in databases and to
        connect all these data. Only then it will be possible to realize all kinds of
        applications. In essence, it is about making all the data accessible to visitors
      in a way that holds added value for them.</p>
      <h1>An International View On The Present And Future Of Mobile E-culture</h1>
      <p>Since mobile heritage presentation is still in its infancy
        in Flanders, we decided to extend these focus group conversations by means of
        some in-depth interviews with international experts. Therefore we talked to
        several speakers who attended the 2007 ICHIM conference. We asked them to
      reflect upon 5 central issues regarding mobile heritage presentation: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>the content or information that is delivered by
          means of a mobile device </li>
        <li>the device or technology that is used</li>
        <li>the heritage institution </li>
        <li>the visitors, and</li>
        <li>the future of mobile
          e-culture. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>We were interested in unveiling their thoughts, reflections
      and remarks on possible bottlenecks, thresholds and added values.</p>
      <p>In the next sections we highlight some of the most
      interesting conclusions.</p>
      <h2>1. Content/information</h2>
      <p>It is possible to give visitors personalized information by
        means of a PDA. This is considered to be added value. However, a heritage institution
        should take into account some concerns. How will the visitor profile be built?
        It doesn&rsquo;t work well asking the individual visitor a lot of questions preceding
        the visit. Furthermore, one of the experts believes this to be a conservative
        way of thinking, offering the visitor something s/he already knows. A visitor
      likes to be surprised.</p>
      <p>Also the possibility of offering extra information is
        regarded as an advantage. But this needs to be done in a proper manner since
        there is a danger of cognitively overloading the visitor. Heritage institutions
        should avoid getting visitors confused. For example, some of the experts
        believe it might be interesting to link objects originating from different
        heritage institutions, yet&nbsp; visitors might start looking for objects that are actually present in
        another museum. Linking data is not as easy as it seems since different
      heritage institutions operate within different conceptual frameworks.</p>
      <p>Heritage institutions should also bear in mind that
        presenting content on a mobile device presupposes a specific adaptation of this
        content, taking into consideration the context of both the visit and use of the
      device.</p>
      <p>In sum, the experts have mixed opinions concerning
        user-generated content. Some believe it might be of interest for other visitors
        in certain cases, but others believe it&nbsp; only has meaning for the user himself or herself. Nonetheless, they
      emphasize the importance of contextualizing the use of this kind of content.</p>
      <h2>2. Device/technology</h2>
      <p>A PDA should be considered a refined audio guide. The
        experts point out the importance of keeping the use of this kind of device as
        simple as possible. The focus should be on the content and the interface
        instead of on the different technological possibilities. If the device is too
      complex for the visitor, he will give up, so it is argued.</p>
      <p>There are of course other possibilities besides a PDA. This
        shouldn&rsquo;t be forgotten. However, the same considerations apply. One of the
        experts notes the use of mobile phone tours in European museums and argues that
        this might cost a lot to the museum and to the visitors: the visitors need to
        pay roaming charges, and the museums invest a lot in the content but get no
      return since they don&rsquo;t rent the devices to the visitors.</p>
      <p>To conclude, the experts stress the importance of combining
        different ways of presenting heritage. Since technology evolves very fast,
      content should be delivered independent from the devices.</p>
      <h2>3. Heritage Institution</h2>
      <p>The experts believe that some heritage institutions are
        prepared to deliver cultural heritage in a more mobile manner. However they
      don&rsquo;t think this is a general stance within the heritage sector.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, one of the experts mentions that a lot of
        heritage institutions believe they can create a mobile heritage tour but underestimate
        the work and problems that accompany it. Nonetheless it is regarded as vital to
        involve the people working in the heritage institutions if these projects are
        to be a success. To get their genuine engagement,&nbsp; heritage staff should be initiated into the advantages of
        mobile heritage presentation. A bottleneck mentioned regarding the lack of
        cooperation between companies that create mobile content and heritage
        institutions arises because the latter often fear the loss of control over
        their content. One of the experts also emphasizes that heritage institutions
        should always question the usefulness of these mobile devices within the
        specific context of a heritage visit. The question whether or not these are
      appropriate shouldn&rsquo;t be ignored.</p>
      <p>A PDA offers the heritage institution the possibility of
        collecting information regarding visitors and the way they deal with the
        exhibits. This might be of interest within the light of future exhibitions.
        However it is mentioned that many institutions are not willing to actually use
      these data and make changes.</p>
      <p>To conclude, one of the experts says that heritage
        institutions should concentrate on the visitors instead of on their collection.
      Yet this is not what happens today.</p>
      <h2>4. Visitors</h2>
      <p>A PDA might hamper the communication between visitors.
        Nevertheless, one of the experts believes that these mobile devices have more
      advantages for the individual user than in the case of a group visit.</p>
      <p>Also technology alone will not seduce the visitor to visit a
        certain museum. Of course it might be an extra trigger, but in the end it is
        the content that matters most. Likewise, mobile technology per se will not
      enhance learning, so it is stated.</p>
      <p>One of the experts notes that mobile devices don&rsquo;t
        automatically imply an added value for every visitor or for every visit.
        Youngsters visiting a museum with their parents might be disappointed by the
        low image quality of the mobile device since they are used to the quality of
        games. However, in the context of a school visit these youngsters might accept
        this since they know the focus is on learning. Nevertheless, visitor needs
        should always taken into account. Hence experts mention the importance of user
      studies.</p>
      <h2>5. The Future</h2>
      <p>The future is in the hands of the visitors - literally
        speaking. The experts predict that visitors will increasingly make use of their
        own devices. Furthermore, they believe that mobile heritage presentation will
        not so much increase the number of visitors as&nbsp; augment the quality of the visitors&rsquo; experience and
      interaction with the heritage content.</p>
      <p>The experts believe that heritage institutions will adapt to
        this changing environment. The question however is how this will be done.
        Another question is whether they have to adapt. It is not always desirable. For
        example, within the context of a science museum, it is possible that the
        visitor is asked to interact actively with the exhibits. In this case it won&rsquo;t
        work well to let the visitor use a PDA at the same time. Furthermore it is not
        always possible for a heritage institution to invest in a mobile way of
        presenting heritage because of a lack of resources. That is why it is believed
        that different means of presenting heritage will have to coexist. Nevertheless
        museums and other heritage institutions shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of deviating from
      the habits of their visitors.</p>
      <p>To conclude, one of the experts highlights the fact that the
        next years will be crucial for the mobile heritage market. Whether or not the
        leaders within the heritage sector will successfully implement mobile heritage
        presentations will impact the entire sector. For if they succeed others will
        follow. This success will be highly dependent upon the way the implementation
        of these mobile devices within the context of a heritage visit takes place. It
        should be kept simple and focused on the content instead of on the technology.
      Otherwise, a lot of visitors will be disappointed.</p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <h2>A Flemish View</h2>
      <p>We can conclude that the Flemish heritage sector stands
        critical in relation to the Heritage 2.0&nbsp; research project. On the one hand, the experts that were consulted
        attached benefits to the creation of a communication layer to link existing
        databases as well as to the use of mobile devices for the presentation of
        heritage. On the other hand, they underlined the significance of reflecting
        about this in advance. They mentioned the importance of a long-term vision as
        well as the fact that there should always be added value. Otherwise, there is
        no need to use a mobile multimedia device to present information or to use a communication
      layer to search for information.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the experts talked about the fact that a lot of
        heritage institutions are not ready at this moment to start with a project like
        Heritage 2.0. For example, they referred to the lack of translators as well as
      to the lack of knowledge sharing and input projects.</p>
      <p>They all pointed out the gap between big and small cultural
        heritage institutions. It is believed that for the latter it is not realistic
        to expect them to deliver heritage related content by means of a mobile device.
        Because of this they will sit on the fence and await the results of projects
        undertaken by the big institutions. If the outcome of these projects is
        positive, then these small institutions will expect a sharing of knowledge. But
        at the moment they are unwilling to invest in something which they are not sure
        will be a success. A possible solution suggested by some of the experts is
      cooperation between small institutions or support from a higher body.</p>
      <p>To conclude, there was discord among the experts we talked
        to as to whether the heritage visitor is ready for mobile multimedia heritage
        presentation or not. Some experts argued the visitor is not. They mentioned the
        existence of a technological threshold. Others stated that visitors are quite
        capable of using this kind of technology since they already use it in their
        common lives. Yet other experts made a distinction between young and old
        visitors. The former will not have a problem with using these devices, while
      the latter certainly will.</p>
      <h2>An International View</h2>
      <p>It is notable that the international experts we consulted
        had clear remarks concerning the use of mobile heritage presentation. They
        emphasized that heritage institutions shouldn&rsquo;t act rashly regarding this kind
        of heritage presentation. It needs to be well considered whether this is the
        path they should follow. Mobile heritage presentation offers several
        opportunities for both heritage institutions and heritage visitors. However it
        is not just because something is possible technologically that it is desirable.
        Furthermore, they underlined the importance of considering the needs and views
        of both heritage professionals and visitors when implementing a mobile way of
      presenting heritage.</p>
      <h1>Next Steps</h1>
      <p>Keeping the outcomes of the focus group conversations and
        interviews in mind, the Heritage 2.0 project will continue over the next months
        with the creation of the common metadatalayer. This layer will be tested in a
        prototype setting by the beginning of 2009. At the same time a prototype of a personalized
        story will be created and distributed on a PDA. Evolutions and results within
        the project can be followed at the project Web site:
