      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The rapid growth of
        Internet video, and YouTube in particular, has opened up the possibility for
        museums to take part in the larger on-line visual discussion through the
        contribution of museum content. Previous papers and presentations at Museums
        and the Web have addressed how to create video (Incandela,  2007) and how this
        resource can be part of a larger community-building effort on-line <b>(</b>Caruth and Bernstein, 2007).
        In this paper, we focus on the results of experiments with video, particularly
        as featured on YouTube, that have been undertaken by several museums, including
        how these initiatives have changed since the initial phases of development and
        how these institutions intend to move forward. </p>
      <p>All statistics
        featured within this paper are as of mid-January 2008, and do not reflect
        changes in content, visits, or any other factors after that date. </p>
      <h1>Included Institutions</h1>
      <p>Our sample group
        consists of YouTube video channels that were created within the time frame of
        July 2006 through July 2007. The institutions included are the Exploratorium,
        the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Indianapolis
        Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, and the San Jose Museum of Art. This
        sample reflects diversity in institution size, focus, geography, and culture.
        All participating institutions completed a survey outlining background
        information on their projects as well as statistical data from YouTube about
        their videos and channel. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>It should be noted
        that many other institutions in the United States and internationally are
        creating outstanding content on YouTube and other video sharing sites,
        including the Brooklyn Museum and the Dallas Museum of Art. We encourage
        readers to explore these and other sites outside of the scope of this study. </p>
      <h1>Working Groups</h1>
      <p>Most of the museums
        originated their initiatives with their marketing or communications
        departments, usually in conjunction with one other department representing some
        segment of the museum Web team (i.e. Digital/New Media), or in the case of
        SJMA, the combined department of Museum Experience and Education. At the
        Exploratorium, the initiative began within the Moving Images department. These
        core working groups do not seem to have grown in size, though a greater range
        of departments seem to be featured or to have provided minor input. For
        example, at MoMA, the Education department has begun to help contribute
        guidance and input, and at the Exploratorium, there has been greater collaboration
        with the departments of the Exploratorium Teacher Institute, PIE (Playful
        Invention and Exploration), and Life Sciences. </p>
      <p>The story often told
        about digital video is that it takes fewer people to produce content than
        previously with analog video, and the results from our group prove this. In one
        institution, the production from end to end was created by one intern with one
        Web staff member posting the materials on-line; in two other institutions the
        working groups consisted of two staff members; and in one institution the
        working group was listed at four people, though not all of these staff would be
        working on the projects at the same time, nor were they dedicated only to video
        projects. Since the launch of these projects, none of the institutions reported
        an increase in the number of staff assigned to these projects, with only minor
        additional input from internal groups. </p>
      <h1>Technology</h1>
      <p>It appears that most
        of the productions were initially done using off-the-shelf Apple iLife software
        and consumer-grade digital cameras (still and video), sometimes with borrowed
        or rented equipment. A few of the institutions have since upgraded to more
        advanced software, more refined microphones, and HD cameras. </p>
      <h1>Production</h1>
      <p>There seem to be three types of production, which we&rsquo;ll
        refer to as agile, adaptive, and traditional. The <b>agile</b> type consists of video produced quickly using a
        small crew and with little pre-planning or post-production. Examples of this
        include the Exploratorium&rsquo;s videos demonstrating many of the installations
        within the museum space. This type allows for quick turnaround with little
        overhead, and results in the type of short and to-the-point video content
        normally associated with YouTube. The <b>adaptive</b> type consists of some pre-planning and an intended
        audience or message, but often captures extra footage and then refines the
        video in post-production editing. Examples of this include many of the &ldquo;artist
        in action&rdquo; videos which merge footage of artists, in the studio or creating an
        installation, with audio from the artist, curator, or visitor. As Chris
        Alexander from the San Jose Museum of Art explains:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">In regards to our
        technical methods, we try to interview artists and let them do all the
        talking.&nbsp; We have learned to try
        and keep this short and to the point; otherwise we have a lot of material to
        present.&nbsp; The editing process
        whittles the interview down into nuggets that become the basis for the
        video.&nbsp; We try to avoid doing a lot
        of writing because it is so labor intensive.&nbsp; Also, we have toyed around a lot with the length of the
        videos, but have not come up with the perfect length yet.</p>
      <p>The great majority
        of the videos tended to fall into the adaptive category. This may be due to the
        small set of people working on the videos and the need for rapid deployment for
        videos to coincide with events, or it could be due to the impermanent nature of
        YouTube traffic and the technical challenges of compression for the site. In
        the same way that many audio tours start with interviews with artists or
        speakers and then are later refined into a concise set of statements, it
        appears that many of the videos follow this production cycle. The <b>traditional</b> type includes a scripted message, a high level
        of preplanning, and a sizable crew. Few institutions have taken this approach
        in regards to YouTube, but have used this type more widely for content hosted
        on a museum&rsquo;s own site.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Production time
        (from shooting to editing to posting) was listed as between two days and a few
        weeks to up to a month or longer, depending on what the project is (size and
        length) as well as cooperation from within the museum. </p>
      <h1>Video Types </h1>
      <p>Videos can be
        created in multiple ways, and also for varying purposes. The institutions in
        this group were asked to categorize their videos within the following types,
        and could mark each video as belonging to as many as applicable.</p>

      <p class="caption">Table 1: Video Types </p>
      <p>As might be
        expected, most reported that a good number of videos were of a promotional
        nature or for archival purposes. In other areas, the focus and mission of the
        institution are evident; for example, the Exploratorium features a number of
        video demonstrations, as might be expected with the overall focus of the
        museum. At the IMA, one of the main goals for the YouTube initiative was to
        change the reputation of the institution and reach out to the community, so
        several of their videos are employee profiles which help expose audiences to
        the diverse human side of the institution. SJMA uses many of its videos to
        support the exhibitions (with some of these available to visitors within the
        museum), so the artist interviews help visitors hear what the artists have to
        say about their works and processes. Their tagging of 27 videos as &ldquo;Other&rdquo;
        refers to exhibition tours; in these cases, the video functioned as its own
        entity, giving greater knowledge of the artist, but also offered greater
        insight into the exhibition that it accompanied.&nbsp; </p>
      <h1>Community Interaction on YouTube</h1>
      <p>Much has been hyped
        about the community aspects of sites like YouTube and the opportunities for
        audience interaction and &ldquo;user generated content.&quot; How do museum channels
        reflect this ability, and how much interaction occurs? </p>
      <p>All of the museums
        allow comments and video embedding for outside sites, and all but one allow
        video responses. Half of the museums require a review before comments are
        published, and the other half maintain an informal review on comments as they
        arrive at the site. </p>
      <h2>Comments&nbsp;</h2>
      <p>For the combined 174
        videos on the five channels (as of mid-January 2008), there were 625 comments,
        and the per-video average was four comments. However, those figures may be
        inflated due to seven videos having over thirty comments each; when those seven
        videos are excluded, the total drops to 247, and the average number of comments
        drops to two. It should be noted that most of the institutions are quite
        aggressive in filtering out spam messages so the totals are reflective of
        actual comments and not of spam. </p>
      <p>It appears that
        overall, museum videos generate a small number of comments, and that the
        dialogue is not universally as active as the term &ldquo;social Web&rdquo; suggests, at
        least not at this stage and in this format.</p>
      <h2>Video responses</h2>
      <p>For the combined 174
        videos on the five channels, there have been a total of forty-two video
        responses, but only through two of the channels; additionally, the majority of
        the responses have come from one user. So it does not seem that users are
        actively submitting videos to these channels in direct, unsolicited response.
        The occasions on which responses have been effective seem to be when a direct
        call for submissions has occurred, as in the case of the MoMA project with The
        Residents art group (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=theresidentsmoma">http://www.youtube.com/profile? user=theresidentsmoma</a>) or the Brooklyn Museum&rsquo;s calls for Visitor Videos for a competition (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=3083AC21010A8F2E">http://www.youtube.com/ view_play_list?p=3083AC21010A8F2E</a>); the Walker has recently asked for submissions (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/walkerartcenter">http://www.youtube.com/walkerartcenter</a>) and it will be interesting to see the results of this project. </p>
      <h2>Views per Video</h2>
      <p>A great emphasis is
        often placed on the number of views per video for YouTube; however, this focus
        tends to be unrealistic for museums and can be slightly distracting from an
        institution&rsquo;s goals. Museums are probably never going to produce the same level
        of traffic as other types of YouTube videos; of the institutions surveyed, only
        one video broke the 100,000-view barrier, and some of that traffic might have been
        due to the fact that it involved celebrities, a well-known artist, and an
        extensively promoted exhibition. </p>
      <p>Certain trends are
        noticeable within the traffic, however. The following charts show total hits
        for each video for each institution, based on their own traffic scale for the Y
        axis; therefore the slope of each institution is relative only to itself.
        Further, the amount of traffic is cumulative, so earlier videos (to the left)
        may be higher due to results over time. </p>
      <p>The results imply
        that institutions tend to experience an initial, uncharacteristic spike near
        the beginning of the channel launch, and traffic thereafter settles into a more
        reliable average with occasional spikes.&nbsp; </p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 1: Views per video for institutions</p>
      <h1>Views by Time</h1>
      <p>There are many
        theories about how long the ideal length of videos on YouTube is, and what
        effects occur based on length. In our group, we&rsquo;ve correlated time with views
        to see if the time has a clear impact on the overall views.</p>
      <p>Overall, 124 (71%)
        of the total 174 videos were under 5 minutes in length and had 650,481 views
        (81%) of the total 806,426. The highest number of views and highest average
        fell in the 1:00 &ndash; 3:00 range, but good values were present at other
        levels. </p>

      <p class="caption">Table 4: YouTube views compared to physical visits and Web traffic </p>
      <p>As seen, the
        relationship between the size of views for an institution and its other types
        of traffic is variable. For example, the SJMA did not have the highest number
        of video views of the group, but their number of views in comparison to their
        physical traffic is highest. MoMA had the highest number of video views, but in
        comparison to total normal traffic to the museum's Web site, it had a lower
        rate than other institutions. This also highlights differences in traffic types
        within institutions. The Exploratorium has a significantly higher number of
        on-line visitors than physical visits to the institution, so in comparison to
        total Web traffic, the influence of YouTube seems to be lower than in
        comparison to physical traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p>It will be
        interesting to see how this metric develops and if this type of monitoring is
        valuable in evaluating the success of social Web projects. </p>
      <h1>Outcomes</h1>
      <p>There is much
        discussion about possible outcomes from the use of a social video sharing site
        like YouTube. However, after a year or more of participating in this experiment,
        do institutions believe that the potential has been realized? Below is the
        feedback assembled from the panel on the overall impact of the institutions'

      <p class="caption">&nbsp;Table 5: Outcomes of using YouTube </p>
      <p>In the end it
        appears that posting video content on YouTube benefits the institution, and
        that the potential risk of lost direct Web traffic has not necessarily
        dissuaded the participants. The purported benefits of generating income are not
        strongly agreed with, but the increase in traffic appears to be bearing fruit;
        however, this statistic is hard to quantify specifically. Visiting information
        for museums, and even more so for museum sites, tends to be influenced by a
        large number of variables. One way to track increases in traffic specific to
        YouTube is to track links on YouTube that are returning to the generating
        institution's site via site metric software. YouTube provides traffic
        information on where links are coming from, and this can help identify sources
        of traffic from an institution site as well as other sites and blogs. </p>
      <p>Often, it is more
        qualitative feedback that will prove useful. For example, at the SJMA, the
        videos are featured on YouTube and iTunes (like the other institutions) but are
        also featured on video iPods that are available for checkout within the
        galleries. Visitors have often made comments about wanting to see the artists
        whose videos they saw on-line, so the assumption can be made that physical
        traffic is being influenced by the on-line video initiatives. In another case
        at the SJMA, a catalog for an artist featured in their videos, including those
        on YouTube, was the first catalog to sell out at the institution during its
        exhibition run.&nbsp; Many of the sales
        were made over the phone, where the purchasers commented about seeing the video
        of the artist on-line.</p>
      <p>The chance to
        present the institution to visitors in a new and fresh way both on-line and in
        person cannot be understated, and all of the institutions featured highlighted
        this potential. For the IMA, one of the great draws of YouTube was combating
        their local image as a &ldquo;stuffy institution that did little to reach out to the
        community.&rdquo; As part of the larger mission, YouTube was a good way to for them
        to reach out, market, and educate in a very non-traditional way. </p>
      <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p >So what are some of
        the challenges this group has encountered with their YouTube initiatives?</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Internal/external restrictions</b><b>.</b> For example, the Smithsonian has institutional limitations on
          the production and usage of video. At many of the art institutions, rights
          issues are a concern for works featured, and many videos have to be abandoned
          or only posted with specific limitations of time and placement. These
          limitations can result in less emphasis being placed on creating new video
          content and devoting any budget or staff, thus limiting an initiative's ability
          to grow and develop fully.&nbsp; </li>
        <li><b>Compression and resolution</b>. YouTube has a very specific type of encoding,
          and video producers need to experiment to get the best results. Often, the
          suggested formats and specifications on the site will not produce the best
          results. Video producers should research specialty sites such as Ken Stone&rsquo;s
          Final Cut site <i>(</i><i><a href="http://www.kenstone.net/">http://www.kenstone.net</a>) </i>for more information. </li>
        <li><b class="listwithbullets">Managing Comments.</b> Many of the featured institutions lamented the
          amount of time and effort required to keep comments on topic, or at least
          spam-free. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comment management tools on YouTube are insufficient to deal with this
          issue, and the amount of spam is daunting. </li>
        <li><b>Getting traffic.</b> As we&rsquo;ve seen, there is no easy formula for getting
          traffic to your channel or to a specific video. Producers need to make sure
          that others are aware of expectations, based on previous traffic, and be
          realistic. Consider also the quality of the traffic; if your goal was to
          produce a video for use by teachers and you&rsquo;re hearing from the target
          audience, then the number becomes less relevant.</li>
        <li><b>Learning on the job</b>. Few museum professionals come to the table
          with an understanding of dealing with ambient noise, correcting white balance,
          or other film and video production techniques. Luckily, the tools are
          relatively easy to learn, and with experience you become better and better. If
          you can afford to purchase the better equipment, it will make your life a lot
          easier. Costs might be daunting initially, but in the long run it will save you
          hours of tweaking sound and video.</li>
        <li><b>Time</b>. As with any on-line initiative, time to create and edit content
          is valuable, and a luxury that many museum staff do not have in excess. </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Advice</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Find communities of interest for your content. </b>Realize that most visitors to
          YouTube aren&rsquo;t inherently going to search for the term &ldquo;museum,&rdquo; and are
          instead interested in topics and looking for contents around those topics. For
          example, when MoMA released videos of presentations by the artist Swoon,
          contact was made with the blog Wooster Collective to possibly promote it; when
          another blog was featuring videos on the nature of painting, links were sent
          for videos with artists discussing this question. For the IMA, one of their
          most successful series featured calligraphy artist Hirokazu Kosaka. Based on
          the comments (incidentally, their most commented-upon videos), the people
          watching this were not searching for &quot;museum&quot; content; they were
          searching for &quot;calligraphy&quot; content. While these searches for
          calligraphy content may not result in direct in-person museum visits to IMA,
          they do provide the IMA with good exposure, and provide the IMA staff with the
          information that people are going to YouTube to find &quot;How to...&quot;
          videos very specific to their interests. Because of this experience, they&rsquo;ve
          been able to consider other audiences (such as art teachers, college students,
          and donors) for later features and have adapted production techniques to focus
          on these audiences. For the Exploratorium, some of their most successful videos
          featured people solving Rubik&rsquo;s cubes: it began with a solid concept that was
          informed by the audience interest in videos of that type that were circulating
          on-line (including a few by film director Michel Gondry) and thus had a better
          chance of gaining momentum through viral marketing. SJMA has frequently
          targeted niche bloggers to get mention of their videos, thus driving traffic to
          their YouTube channel.&nbsp; In one such
          case with underground artist Camille Rose Garcia, a cartooning blog named Drawn
          (www.drawn.ca) and the well-known blog BoingBoing (<a
href="http://www.boingboing.net/">www.boingboing.net</a>) accounted for a large
          part of traffic to that series of videos. </li>
        <li><b>Integrate with
          your other sites and services. </b>The
          ability to embed videos opens up the possibility of easily adding content
          within your sites in a number of different ways. For example, MoMA has posted
          exhibition-related videos on exhibition pages, as well as trailers for films
          screening at the museum, within their on-line calendar. IMA has embedded their
          videos within a specific area of the site, but has placed visual links in other
          areas of the site to drive traffic. SJMA has posted YouTube players as well as
          links to podcasts within their exhibition descriptions. Use other e-news, RSS,
          or blogs that are traditionally connected to your audiences to promote this
          connection and to gain exposure. </li>
        <li><b>Build an internal
          base, and help your institution understand the project and process. </b>Inside the museum, work with people whom you
          feel comfortable with and who will be flexible and willing to experiment. Start
          quietly with a core group until you have the project in hand, and then build a
          broader coalition. There will be many people who have not heard of on-line
          video sites and/or do not know their capabilities and limitations, so be sure
          to spread the knowledge around.&nbsp; </li>
        <li><b>Start small and grow as needed. </b>Most of the institutions featured began with
          very little equipment and took a chance.&nbsp; One of the SJMA&rsquo;s first videos was a promotional video for an artist
          named Il Lee who creates large-scale abstractions with ballpoint pens.&nbsp; For the video, producers shot a
          close-up of a hand scribbling on paper, and later, during the editing process,
          interspersed still shots of the artist working and his artwork.&nbsp; For audio they found some legally
          available contemporary music that worked well with the &ldquo;flurry of scribbles&rdquo;
          going onto the page. MoMA launched with a series of videos created by artist
          Doug Aitken to promote an upcoming show, but continued to create videos using
          one camera, one laptop, one staff member, and one intern, and then built up
          production and technology as growth required. At the Hirshhorn, the videos were
          shot and edited by an intern. </li>
        <li><b>Be creative: try out new approaches to
          presenting the materials while using your institution&rsquo;s strengths.</b> The capabilities of video are quite dynamic,
          and the production times are much shorter with digital equipment, so innovation
          and experimentation can come easily. Use methods and processes that create a
          unique look and feel for your videos, but watch what other institutions are
          doing for inspiration. Take advantage of your institution&rsquo;s strengths; for
          example, SJMA has a close connection in the shared areas of Education and
          Experience, so it is possible to offer the videos in multiple areas and include
          the content in planning for exhibitions. At the Exploratorium, there is a great
          sense of experience and play in the layout and execution of the institution, so
          the on-line experience can be fluid and dynamic and capture the sense of
          excitement, </li>
        <li><b>When possible,
          assign one person responsibility. </b>As
          with any social initiative on-line, the daily work of maintaining the presence
          can take time. Determine what you want a YouTube channel to do for you, and
          dedicate a person or small group to the YouTube channel. This way, one person
          can make sure that the initiative continues, keep track of institutional goals,
          and build relationships while keeping up with comments, responses, etc. Keep
          your page up to date and add new content only when it makes sense for your
          goals and when video is the correct media for it. If you are adding more than
          one file at the same time, space them out over days or weeks - often only the
          last video posted will get traffic, and users will not backtrack to earlier
          entries in the series.</li>
