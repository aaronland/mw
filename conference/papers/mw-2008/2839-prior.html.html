        <p class="AbstractText">The year 2007 marked the 200th anniversary of the parliamentary
    abolition of the British slave trade. In order to provide on-line access to the
    wealth of material held by the UK Parliamentary Archives in London, a Web site
    was commissioned to enable users to interact with documents, works of art and
    museum artefacts, as well as to provide a legacy of an exhibition held at
    Westminster in the summer of 2007.</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The Parliamentary Archives has custody of the archives of
        both Houses of the United Kingdom Parliament. These records, which include all
        Acts of Parliament from 1497, records of proceedings, documents laid before
        both Houses, plans relating to public works, judicial and administrative
        papers, date from the fifteenth century and are stored in the Victoria Tower
      repository within the Palace of Westminster in London (<a
href="http://www.parliament.uk/archives">http://www.parliament.uk/archives</a>).</p>
      <p>The Archives pursues an active outreach programme which is
        designed to promote our activities and enable as wide as possible access to our
        collections. In particular, we are keen to make our collections accessible for
        learning, by both school children as well as adult learners. In addition, we
        have sought to diversify the ethnicity of our users. An important part of this
        programme of engagement has been the development of Web-based resources which
        have highlighted elements of our collections. In 2003 we launched, in
        partnership with the UK National Archives, a resource exploring the concept of
        citizenship (http://<a
href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship">www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship</a>). This was
        followed in 2005 by
        a Web site about the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 (<a href="http://www.parliament.uk/gunpowderplot">http://www.parliament.uk/gunpowderplot</a>),
        (Kennedy, Prior, Sawyer and Pratty, 2006). Both of these projects
        were important steps forward in broadening access to our collections and were
        accompanied by the launch of an on-line catalogue of our holdings called
        Portcullis (<a
href="http://www.portcullis.parliament.uk/">http://www.portcullis.parliament.uk</a>).
        The ability for our users to carry our remote searches as well as view images
        of certain of our documents has particular significance given our location in
        central London in a heavily guarded building with limited space for readers to
        consult archival materials. By 2007, on-line visits to the catalogue were
        approaching 17 times the number of personal visits we can accommodate in our
      Search Room at Westminster.</p>
      <p>The active pursuit of these outreach activities is not
        taking place in a vacuum. In recent years both Houses of Parliament have placed
        an emphasis on engaging the public with the work of Parliament. Central to this
        has been the development of the Parliamentary Web site as a core resource for
        the understanding of the activities of the House of Commons and the House of
        Lords (<a href="http://www.parliament.uk/index.cfm">http://www.parliament.uk/index.cfm</a>).
        The public are now able to participate in eConsultations or watch live video
        feed of debates in both Houses. The development of our historical resources
        supports this policy of engagement in that these resources draw on the enormous
        public interest in history. We hope that they  encourage people to explore
        Parliament&rsquo;s overall on-line presence, deepening their understanding of the
      work and history of Parliament at the same time. </p>
      <h1>The 200th Anniversary Of The Abolition Of The British Slave Trade</h1>
      <p>In assessing the future direction of our outreach
        programme, it was recognised that the 200th anniversary in 2007 of the
        parliamentary abolition of the British slave trade presented a range of
        opportunities, particularly in terms of diversifying our audience. At first it
        was planned that a microsite marking the anniversary of the passing of the Act
        of Parliament that abolished the trade should be built, and be broadly similar
        to the Web site which marked the 400th anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot. It
        was considered essential that the development of any on-line resource
        associated with the anniversary should have at its core our archival material
        that reflects Parliament&rsquo;s long engagement with that trade and which would
        support learning activities. The discovery of this material was greatly
        assisted by our catalogue; the full appreciation of the richness of our
      holdings on this subject was one of the many benefits of the project. </p>
      <p>In essence the story the archival record tells is how
        Parliament at first encouraged and fostered the slave trade, and then became a
        platform by which the trade&rsquo;s abolition could be secured. The documents
        therefore include Bills and Acts of Parliament which regulated the trade, and
        eventually ended it; the evidence during the parliamentary investigations;
        petitions supporting and opposing abolition; and other information collected by
        Parliament. The use of original documents provided an opportunity for us to
        address this difficult and sensitive subject in a totally honest and
        transparent manner, avoiding any sense of institutional self-congratulation. It
        was also intended that the archival material should be accompanied by items
        drawn from Parliament&rsquo;s collections of works of art, which are administered by
        the Curator&rsquo;s Office, in order to strengthen the site visually and provide
      context. </p>
      <p>However, the author&rsquo;s attendance at the Museums and the
        Web conference in Albuquerque in 2006, where the benefits for museums and
        archives of applying Web 2.0 techniques to projects were widely discussed,
        fundamentally altered the nature of the project. It was decided that the Web
        site should enable public interaction with the archival and museum content and
        that there should be an emphasis on explaining the work of the archives in ways
        that had not been attempted before. It was essential that the site should remain
        live after its launch, to facilitate the addition of more archival content, and
        content generated by users. This would mean that despite our limited staff
        resources, much more content could be added to the Web site than would have
        been the case using more traditional build techniques. This new approach to the
        project fitted particularly well with developments with respect to the
        parliamentary Web site which were demanding new content and fresh and
      innovative approaches to presenting that content.</p>
      <h2>The First Phase</h2>
      <p>In order to deliver the project, the Parliamentary
        Archives appointed the 24 Hour Museum (Culture 24) as producer of the
        microsite. This gave the project access to the expertise of the 24 Hour Museum
        team in terms of content development and the exploitation of cultural assets as
        learning resources.  Build and design was undertaken by Simulacra (Lexara) and
        System Simulation. It was decided that in order to maximize publicity for the
        site, a preliminary version of the Web site would be launched to coincide with
        the actual anniversary of the passing of the Act of Parliament abolishing the
        slave trade:  25 March 1807. The full version of the Web site would go live at
        the same time as the opening of the Parliamentary exhibition <i>The British
          Slave Trade: Abolition, Parliament and People</i> which was due to open in Westminster Hall in May 2007. The exhibition presented
        an opportunity for crossover between the two projects in terms of content and
        design and meant that the Web site would provide a legacy of Parliament&rsquo;s
        activities marking the anniversary. The appointment of a writer in residence to
        the exhibition meant that the Web site also had the potential to provide an
        on-line presence for a range of other activities associated with the
      exhibition.</p>
      <p>A major part of the campaign to abolish, and indeed
        defend, the slave trade had been the use of petitions, signed by objectors to
        the trade as well as by those with a vested interest in it. After 1780, large
        quantities of these petitions were presented to Parliament and many have
        survived amongst the archives. It was decided that the largest of these, a
        petition from the inhabitants of Manchester in 1806 in support of the Foreign
        Slave Trade Abolition Bill, would form the basis of the preliminary Web site.
        Over 5 metres long, and made up of nine sheets of parchment stitched together,
        the petition contained approximately 2,000 signatures of individuals and
      clearly had great potential as a resource for family historians.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="prior_figure1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="400" height="533" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: The 1806 petition from Manchester supporting
      abolition of the slave trade</p>
      <p>In order to maximise its accessibility, the Manchester
        and Lancashire Family History Society agreed to transcribe the names on
        the petition, using a network of volunteers. Once this had been completed the
        Society was able, in some cases, to provide further information about the
        signatories, such as their occupation and address. The same process was applied
        to a much smaller petition, this time from manufacturers and merchants in
        Manchester, which opposed the same Bill. Two days before the 25 March
        anniversary, the Web site containing the transcript of both petitions, which
      could be searched by visitors, went live, to considerable media interest. </p>
      <p>The response to the petitions was immediate and came
        through the <i>Your Voice</i> mechanism on the
        site, an area designed to facilitate moderated feedback. Not only did
        genealogists report that they had been able to identify ancestors amongst the
        names, but also in many cases they were able to supply information about them.
        It was clear that for many, this had hit an emotional and very personal chord.
        One individual reported, &ldquo;Thank you very much for publishing this. I feel very
        proud and humble now&rdquo;. Taken together, these submissions represented a valid
        and significant community history contribution that would have been difficult
        to achieve in any other way, and one which originated from outside mainstream
      academic research. </p>
      <h2>The Second Phase</h2>
      <p>The build of the second phase of the Web site represented
        a major challenge, involving as it did contractors in three different locations
        in addition to the archive staff in London. In order to provide expert text to
        support the archival and museum content, a recognised academic authority on the
        subject, Professor James Walvin from the University of York, was employed to
        author sections of text. This was one of several links between the project and
        the Westminster Hall exhibition, for which Professor Walvin was consultant
        curator. Of the other links, design formed a very visual connection: the colour
        palette for the exhibition was successfully used to inform the design of the
        Web site, and the Web site carried information about the exhibition in order to
      try to increase footfall. </p>
      <p>The most direct link was, of course, the content. Most of
        the exhibits in the exhibition were included in the Web site, including
        paintings, engravings, documents and other artefacts. Audio content was also
        used in this way. Of the museum artefacts, the most notable was the chest
        belonging to the abolitionist Thomas Clarkson. That chest, which is to be found
        in the Wisbech and Fenland Museum, proved to be ideally suited to the asset
        viewer technology employed on the Web site as a means of exploring all the
        items of content, whether they be paintings, documents or museum objects. In
        the case of Clarkson&rsquo;s chest, images of specific items, such as an African loom
        or a quiver, were captured so that the chest&rsquo;s contents could be explored in a
      way not possible in the exhibition (<a
href="http://slavetrade.parliament.uk/slavetrade/assetviews/objects/thomasclarksonsafricanbox.html?ref=true">http://slavetrade.parliament.uk/slavetrade/assetviews/ objects/thomasclarksonsafricanbox.html?ref=true</a>).</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="prior_figure2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="400" height="266" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Figure 2: Thomas Clarkson&rsquo;s chest</p>
      <p>In order to tell the story of Parliament&rsquo;s relationship
        with the slave trade, the content is divided into nine history sections, each
        sub-divided into chapters illustrating a particular theme. There is, however, a
        deliberate attempt not to resort to large amounts of narrative text, but to
        instead simply present the asset or learning object in question. For instance,
        an account of the sales of enslaved Africans at Jamaica in 1713,
        with contextual information, provides users with enough information to begin to
        explore the item and to ask questions and make comments, hopefully in a wider
        user enivironment. In some cases, brief notes by an archivist or curator
        provide insight into the provenance of the item, or the manner in which it is
        stored. Where possible, transcripts and the abilty to print high resolution
      files have been provided.</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 3: Home page, Parliament and the British
      Slave Trade 1600-1807</p>
      <p>The second phase of the Web site was
        launched at the same time as the exhibition: 23 May 2007. Between then and
        January 2008, the site has generated over 153,000 page views (Google analytics,
        29 January 2008). : Visitors to the exhibition were 
        encouraged to record their reactions to it in a specific section of <em>Your 
        Voice</em> on the Web site, if possible by using PCs mounted in kiosks adjacent to the
        exhibition structure. This is, however, just one of several <i>Your Voice </i>threads which were designed to receive
        content generated by users (<a href="http://slavetrade.parliament.uk/slavetrade/yourvoice">http://slavetrade.parliament.uk/slavetrade/yourvoice</a>). One entitled <i>What do you think?</i> uses an
        audio recording to stimulate reactions to the material on the Web site, whilst
        another focuses on the Manchester petitions, and another on the content of
        Clarkson&rsquo;s chest. This approach recognises that it is important to provide
        users with various ways of accessing the content; hence the use of the <i>Explore </i>area to highlight the
        favourite assets of those involved with the project, or categories of material,
        such as pictures, documents or sound. A later addition to <em>Explore</em> were
        the quilt squares which were designed by visitors to the exhibition
        during the UNESCO International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade
      and its Abolition on 23 August 2007 (<a
href="http://slavetrade.parliament.uk/slavetrade/explore/authoredpages/commemorativequilt.html">http://slavetrade.parliament.uk/slavetrade/explore/authoredpages/ commemorativequilt.html</a>).</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="prior_figure4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="400" height="304" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Figure 4: A quilt square</p>
      <p>Underpinning the Web site is a commitment to
        ensuring that it operates as an effective learning resource.  The potential of
        the resources to support learning is outlined in the <i>Learning</i> area (<a href="http://slavetrade.parliament.uk/slavetrade/learning">http://slavetrade.parliament.uk/slavetrade/learning</a>), where there are  suggestions of specific ways they can support
        classroom activities.  In the interactive studio, an on-line space has been
        provided where teachers can use the source material contained within the Web
        site to create a wide range of interactive resources, using simple tools. The
        capability of the Web site to support learning has been fully demonstrated by
        the work of the exhibition&rsquo;s writer in residence, the poet Rommi Smith.
        Workshops led by Smith, involving children at a London school, produced poetry
        and prose inspired by the slave trade; this work has been included on the Web
        site, and an education pack which can be down loaded explains more fully how
      the subject of the slave trade can be explored in schools. </p>
      <h1>Conclusions</h1>
      <p>The use of documentary source material in
        on-line resources presents the custodian of those materials with a number of
        challenges.  In some instances the documents, because of their visual
        appearance and layout, speak for themselves and offer themselves readily for
        interpretation. In other cases the items may be illegible, or unappealing to
        the eye, or difficult to capture digitally. In order to bring them to life and
        make them accessible, interpretative text is required, often written by expert
        historians and accmpanied by transcripts. As is demonstrated by the petitions
        from Manchester, imaginative approaches to the unlocking of manuscript
      resources can yield results that make the task well worth the effort. </p>
      <p>There is no doubt that this resource worked
        very effectively in meeting the objectives of the Parliamentary Archives as
        well as functioning as a tool for marketing the exhibition and collecting
        feedback from visitors. The content of the Web site was considerably
        strenghtened by being able to draw on the exhibition content as well as the
        curatorial expertise that resided there. In turn, the Web site has become the natural
        home for the legacy of the exhibition, such as the educational activities and
        the quilt squares; it also provides a record of how Parliament commemorated the
        anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade. In a wider sense the project
        has reinforced the part that historical content has to play as part of the
        broader institutional picture, and future developments on the parliamentary Web
      site will reflect this.</p>
      <p>The collection of user-generated content
        represents a step in a new direction for Parliament&rsquo;s activities on the Web,
        but one which is now recognised as an essential component of those activities.
        Experience with this project suggests that if this is to work to its maximum
        potential,  resources are required to nurture and encourage this interaction
        using specific groups of users, and to examine ways of integrating it with
        other social networking activities on the Web. This is is something that we
        will be exploring in future. There is no doubt that archives, because of their
        often direct connection with individual lives, contain the power to elicit a
        strong emotional response from those who come into contact with them, and
        thereby have the strenght to engage people with the subject matter. The power
        of Web 2.0, with its capability to connect communities of users, presents
        archivists with enormous possibilities for enabling access to the material in
      their care and for interpreting it in new ways.</p>
