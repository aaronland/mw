      <p class="AbstractText">With many collections available on-line, art museums face
        new opportunities in digital collaboration, service and scholarship. In this
        paper, we will provide an overview of one project to integrate images and data
        from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston with Visualizing Cultures&rsquo; scholarly
        materials to create rich collaborative content on focused topics in Japanese
        history. While the technical approach is expected to evolve, it serves as a
        model for a relatively simple and &ldquo;hands-off&rdquo; method of collection integration
        that is easily maintained and easily extended, allowing the Museum to provide
        content for multiple on-line projects without significant extra investment. This
        paper will also discuss lessons learned and future opportunities for art museum
        collection integration, including the emerging standard of CDWA Lite. </p>

      <h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
      <p>Soon after the Museum of Fine Arts made its collection of
        more than 350,000 objects available on-line, MIT&rsquo;s Visualizing Cultures team
        approached the Museum with a proposed project to integrate with the Museum&rsquo;s
        on-line collection. Within a relatively short time, mechanisms had been built
        to allow a low-maintenance integration of data to be featured in Visualizing
        Cultures learning units on the Web. </p>
      <p>Visualizing Cultures (<a
href="http://visualizingcultures.mit.edu/">http://visualizingcultures.mit.edu</a>)
        weds images and scholarly commentary in innovative ways to illuminate social
        and cultural history. Founded in 2002 by MIT Professors John Dower and Shigeru
        Miyagawa, Visualizing Cultures exploits the unique qualities of the Web as a
        publishing platform to enable scholars, teachers, and others to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Examine
          large bodies of previously inaccessible images. </li>
        <li>Compose
          original texts with unlimited numbers of full-color, high-resolution images.</li>
        <li>Use
          new technology to explore unprecedented ways of analyzing and presenting images
          that open windows on modern history.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Visualizing Cultures has
        positioned itself as a nexus between the institutions that house image
        collections and the scholars who would like to use them for research purposes.
        Publishing on MIT&rsquo;s revolutionary OpenCourseWare - making MIT courses freely
        available on the Web - Visualizing Cultures has worked with many institutions
        to negotiate on-line publication of images for educational purposes using a
        creative commons license. Visualizing Cultures offers a growing number of
        titles, referred to as &ldquo;units.&rdquo; This first pioneering set of units visualizes
        diverse aspects of Japan in the modern world. Units in development move into
        China and beyond. </p>
      <p>The MFA is home to one of the finest and largest collections
        of Japanese art outside Japan, making it an important source of content and a
        key relationship for Visualizing Cultures. Now numbering over 100,000 objects,
        the Museum&rsquo;s holdings encompass Buddhist art from as early as the eighth
        century; medieval narrative scrolls; ink paintings from the fifteenth century;
        masks for the stately No drama; remarkable swords and sword furnishings;
        unparalleled screens and scrolls, including important works from virtually
        every important school of painting from the sixteenth to the nineteenth
        century; and outstanding textiles. About 80 percent of the Japanese art in the
        MFA is made up of Japanese woodblock prints and books, including works acquired
        in Japan in the late nineteenth century and the fabled collection of John and
        William Spaulding, given in 1921. More recently, Jean S. and Frederic A. Sharf
        donated prints and photographs depicting the emergence of Japan as a
        modernizing nation, and Leonard A. Lauder presented the Museum with his
        collection of 20,000 postcards.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="fleming.fig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="400" height="407" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: A selection of the MFA&rsquo;s strong Japanese art
        collection, which includes over 100,000 objects. <a href="http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?coll_package=26169">http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?coll_package=26169</a></p>
      <p>Visualizing Cultures approached the MFA shortly after the
        development and publication&nbsp; of its
        first unit, <i>Black Ships and Samurai</i>. For
        that unit, Visualizing Cultures cleared more than 200 graphics (all in the public
        domain) through more than 40 institutions, both public and private. The MFA
        offered the advantage of being a single institution with strong and relevant
        collections related to Visualizing Cultures&rsquo; scholarly interests. Working with
        one institution in this manner helped truncate the onerous process of IP rights
        and clearances. </p>
      <p>The value of the collaboration between the two institutions
        was clear. Visualizing Cultures had a relationship with the Museum that allowed
        a very forward-looking collaboration to take place; that is, to augment the
        current understanding of the MFA&rsquo;s vast collection through the work of noted
        scholars and to make that understanding available on-line through the &lsquo;portal&rsquo;
        of the Visualizing Cultures framework. Visualizing Cultures is in the top 10%
        of all MIT OpenCourseWare sites (based on usage); with millions of unique
        visitors to OpenCourseWare each month, Visualizing Cultures&rsquo; reach and impact
        &ndash; and by extension, the Museum&rsquo;s &ndash; is substantial.&nbsp; </p>
      <h1>Data to Content: Transforming the Collection into On-line Education</h1>
      <p>The Museum provides both a searchable collection database
        and specific &lsquo;collection tours&rsquo; which allow for a more selective and guided
        experience. Providing Visualizing Cultures with access to the collection
        additionally promotes deep and rich outlets for image-driven scholarship. The
        goal of Visualizing Cultures is to transform the manner in which scholars
        approach research when using images, and in turn transform the way&nbsp; audiences view historical imagery. One
        of the key missions of Visualizing Cultures is to promote image-driven
        scholarship; in other words, the research and subsequent scholarly text is
        guided by the exploration of images and does not rely solely on textual
        information. There is an important distinction between an illustrated essay and
        a scholarly text based on images. </p>
      <p>To do the research, analysis and interpretive work, the
        Visualizing Cultures team and lead scholar on the project sort through
        hundreds, if not thousands, of images, augmenting digital image searching with
        study in the Museum archives if needed. This process results in categories and
        groupings that begin to inform and shape the historical narrative for a unit.
        All supporting media at this point is digitized, allowing scholars to examine
        extreme details and delve even more deeply into the exploration of these often
        complex graphics.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="fleming.fig2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="400" height="428" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig. 2: The unit &ldquo;Asia Rising: Japanese Postcards of the
        Russo-Japanese War&rdquo; uses images from the MFA&rsquo;s Leonard A. Lauder collection of
        Japanese postcards. Images in the Image Database are returned in real time from
        the MFA. <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/21f/21f.027j/asia_rising/index.html">http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/21f/21f.027j/asia_rising/index.html</a></p>
      <p>The core content of a unit includes an essay and images, the
        visual narrative that expands themes from the essay, and other media components
        (video, animation or interactive content). As part of a unit, the databases
        that contain all the original images used to develop the unit content are
        created. This varies from 100 to 2000 graphics. </p>
      <p>Once a unit&rsquo;s image collection is defined, a very specific
        set of images is brought into the Visualizing Cultures Image Database (VCID).
        This is done live and in real-time; in other words, when a Visualizing Cultures
        user looks through a unit&rsquo;s database, the resulting search is returned in real
        time from the MFA. The advantage is that this allows a very specific collection
        of images to be returned in a highly contextualized manner within a scholarly
        framework, an experience that clearly differs from a straightforward collection
        search. This provides users with a guided and deep way to explore a larger
        selection of materials on a subject such as the Sino-Japanese War. </p>
      <p>The MFA is not the only institution to be collaborating with
        Visualizing Cultures in this manner. Visualizing Cultures also works with the
        Smithsonian Institution (the unit &ldquo;Yokohama Boomtown, Foreigners in Treaty Port
        Japan&rdquo; is one example of this collaboration). Other institutions that have
        engaged with Visualizing Cultures include The Hood Museum at Dartmouth, the Smith
        College Museum of Art, The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, Allentown Art
        Museum, Bard Graduate Center, Chicago Historical Society, Chrysler Museum of
        Art, George Eastman House, Harvard University, Bishop Museum, Kobe City Museum,
        the Library of Congress, Nagasaki Municipal Museum, Nagasaki Prefectural Art
        Museum, New Bedford Whaling Museum, Shimura Toyoshiro collection, Shiryo
        Hensanjo-University of Tokyo, Smithsonian Institution Division of Photographic
        Resources, Tokyo National Museum, US Naval Academy Museum, US Naval Historical
        Center, White House Historical Association, Yokohama Archives of History, and
        Yokohama Museum of Art.</p>
      <h1>Opening Doors to Collaboration: The Open Knowledge Initiative (OKI)</h1>
      <p>The collaboration between the MFA and MIT&rsquo;s Visualizing
        Cultures project is based on standards produced by the Open Knowledge
        Initiative (OKI), a consortium of MIT, Stanford and many other institutions.
        The Initiative develops and promotes specifications that describe how the
        components of a software environment communicate with each other and with other
        enterprise systems. OKI specifications enable sustainable interoperability and
        integration by defining standards for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). </p>
      <p>OKI identified an opportunity to develop a relationship with
        Visualizing Cultures in which OKI standards and functionality could be
        implemented and tested while allowing Visualizing Cultures to open access to
        vast archives of images from the MFA and other institutions. </p>
      <p>The MFA was the first test case. OKI &lsquo;hooks&rsquo; were built into
        the Museum database, allowing Visualizing Cultures to link directly to it with
        specific controls. This link opens&nbsp; up the MFA content not only to the Visualizing Cultures database but
        also to any other environment that can use the OKI standards. Through this
        integration, users in other environments can search the MFA database (and any
        others integrated in this way) directly from the Web site they are browsing,
        instead of laboriously searching multiple archives one at a time.&nbsp; This seemingly simple distinction
        begins to fulfill the promise of federated image searching. </p>
      <h1>How It Works: Technical Approach</h1>
      <p>The data integration between the MFA&rsquo;s collection and
        Visualizing Cultures is simple; this has been one of its greatest benefits in
        terms of maintenance. A standard HTTP request is sent by Visualizing Cultures
        to the MFA Web server. The requested URL contains search parameters that
        execute a query against the collections on-line database. The results are
        wrapped in XML that conforms to the standard agreed upon by OKI for this
        project.</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 3: A fragment of unformatted XML data generated from the MFA database representing the kind of output used by the Visualizing
        Cultures site. </p>
      <p>Setting up this system was as straightforward as using the
        existing queries and logic for the Collections Online portion of mfa.org and
        redirecting the output to XML. The maintenance burden is light, requiring only
        a handful of fixes per year to conform with database changes. There is a small
        library of functions that retrieves data from the Collections on-line database.
        If there are structural changes to the database, or if OKI makes a change to
        the schema, the functions need to be updated to reflect those changes. </p>
      <p>Overall, the system functions well, but there are some
        improvements that would be useful. Anomalies in MFA data accessed through
        Visualizing Cultures often result from holes in the MFA&rsquo;s indexing of the data.
        Until the Museum can revisit and refine its data, it will be difficult to
        correct this.&nbsp; An extremely useful
        enhancement would be a designation in between a scholarly description and a
        layman&rsquo;s description of an object. For example, curators might not describe a
        painting as &ldquo;Impressionist&rdquo; because that is understood from looking at the
        image and considered to be unnecessary. However, since it isn&rsquo;t possible to
        search data visually, general Web browsers will be unable to find Impressionist
        paintings unless they are already aware of applicable artists to search for.
        These descriptors could be addressed formally by curators or informally as
        keywords applied by other museum staff and the public (through folksonomy, in
        the latter case). </p>
      <h1>Future Directions and Related Integrations</h1>
      <p>Going forward, the MFA is interested in continuing to
        explore emerging standards and solutions in low-risk ways to help further the
        goals of projects such as Visualizing Cultures and the general goals of greater
        intra-museum collaboration and exchange. One of those methods is Categories for
        the Description of Works of Art (CDWA) Lite. </p>
      <p>Thanks to pioneering work by the J. Paul Getty Trust, CDWA
        Lite is poised to become a popular XML schema for facilitating museum data
        exchange. The CDWA Lite schema has only nine required elements. This
        substantially reduces the burden on an institution when attempting to map data
        from its collections management system (CMS) to the schema. However, the
        reduced set of core elements is still substantive enough to enable meaningful
        discovery information.</p>
      <p>The MFA is participating in two projects that make use of
        CDWA Lite:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A
          Research Libraries Group (RLG) project to build a tool to easily export data
          from The Museum System CMS to CDWA Lite. </li>
        <li>A
          collaboration between the George Eastman House and the Metropolitan Museum of
          Art with the goal of aggregating data about daguerreotypes produced by the
          studio of Southworth and Hawes. The project team, including a representative
          from the MFA, is currently investigating the use of CDWA Lite for exchanging
          the core object information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The MFA has great hopes for projects of this kind, but
        realizes that for many museums this goal remains unreachable. For some,
        digitization is still a future promise. For others, funding and resources to
        implement and maintain the tools that open the collection are often
        lacking.&nbsp; Curators may be guarded
        about the data pertaining to their collection and worry about making seemingly
        incomplete data available to the public or to scholars. The MFA/Visualizing
        Cultures collaboration has helped to crystallize the shared team understanding
        that making available even incompletely described images can have great value
        to scholars and to the public, if only as a way to stimulate a larger community
        to participate in the task of description. </p>
      <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
      <p>From this and related integrations (both current and
        planned), a number of lessons have emerged. Many relate to the positive
        benefits of this type of project, while others represent suggestions to avoid
        negative consequences. </p>
      <p><b>Selecting an Approach</b> &ndash; In assessing solutions to problems of data integration, a range of
        options exists, from simple to complex. We have seen great benefits from a very
        simple technical approach. A more complex one may or may not let us do more.
        There is much to suggest that a small but effective implementation may carry
        less risk than a large and sweeping one, especially in view of the pace of
        technology change. With the spirit of continued experimentation and evolving
        standards that marks the on-line collections space, a simple approach can offer
        a flexible solution that can be extended or overhauled without prohibitive
        cost.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>Data Normalization</b> &ndash; A museum wishing to participate in this kind of integration must have
        an accurate electronic catalogue of its collection with clean, normalized data.
        For example, artists&rsquo; names must be standardized, and methods for communicating
        date ranges must be agreed upon across curatorial departments.</p>
      <p><b>Long-Term Commitment</b> - Once a museum opens the doors to its collections data in this manner, it must
        be committed to keeping those doors open indefinitely, or at least for the
        duration of the project at hand. </p>
      <p><b>Willingness to Adapt</b> &ndash; A participating museum should also accept that technological changes
        during the project&rsquo;s timeframe may necessitate data migrations and upgrading of
        both hardware and software. If there is internal restructuring of how the data
        is housed, the organization will need to make sure the new structure will mesh
        with the access methods it has provided for the project.</p>
      <p><b>Performance and Reliability</b> - At the practical level, museums need to take into consideration the
        hardware they have and the hardware they&rsquo;re capable of putting in place to
        reliably serve up this information. What loads are expected as a result of the
        new project? What are the potential bandwidth needs? Are those sustainable? Are
        qualified staff members available to run the servers needed? How reliable is
        the institution&rsquo;s hardware, and to what degree has that been tested? </p>
      <p><b>Large Files</b> &#8211;
        In the current system, large files needed for some of the graphics in
        Visualizing Cultures are still &ldquo;sneaker-netted&rdquo; on DVDs between the two
        organizations. While it is not uncommon to find this happening, it is ripe for
        a standardized solution, whether that is a standards-oriented image extranet or
        another similar approach. A museum getting started with data integration may
        find that a solution to this part of the workflow is best as a second phase of
        work, somewhat separate from collections integration and more closely aligned
        with the needs of licensing departments.&nbsp; </p>
      <h1>Can There Be a &ldquo;Meta Museum&rdquo;?</h1>
      <p>The adoption of a ubiquitous, open-source protocol such as
        OKI or CDWA Lite that provides a shared schema is a key step in more universal
        collection integration &ndash; both among museums and between museums and external
        projects. This promise of federated searching and data delivery has been a holy
        grail, to some degree, through the last several years of museum collection
        digitization. </p>
      <p>As a collaborative team from a forward-thinking museum and a
        revolutionary technology institution, we are increasingly of the opinion that
        the path to this state of collection-sharing grace may be through evolution: by
        focusing on highly contextualized projects with clear ownership and outcomes,
        we build the smaller connections that, over time and with improving standards,
        become our shared virtual network of knowledge. </p>
      <p>If a museum (with a digital project under its belt) can
        &ldquo;open a door&rdquo; to its digital collection using a standard data exchange method
        such as CDWA Lite or OKI, then tapping into one, some or many collections
        becomes far more technically feasible than ever before. The MFA or another
        museum could augment its on-line tools (such as custom collection building) by
        expanding the available artwork data to include other large collections. Any
        museum could become a meta art museum of sorts, in that sense, given the
        underlying organizational partnerships that would need to occur. An external
        project such as Visualizing Cultures could tap into a vertical slice of data,
        utilizing the sub-collections it needed from across organizations with accuracy
        and, ideally, with improved productivity and speed.&nbsp; And while it may be controversial, an aggregator such as
        Google or iTunes could treat a museum database as it would any other rich source
        of content, returning results through a Web search engine or other delivery
        interface. </p>
      <p>While we don&rsquo;t pretend to know what the answer is (though we
        hope our experience may help provide data points), we believe there is an
        important benefit to engaging in this type of project-based integration for the
        purposes of learning about one&rsquo;s own collection. With any project like this, a
        museum should create avenues for gathering feedback from the external
        institutions, with an eye to improving the data and responding to obstacles
        encountered by people accessing that data in new ways. Because MIT and
        Visualizing Cultures have a different perspective on the data than the MFA has,
        they may see flaws in data organization that the Museum is blind to or that its
        users have learned to work around. By gathering project feedback and
        establishing a plan to respond to it, a museum can make the data it exchanges
        with other institutions more accurate, complete and valuable for future
        collaborative projects.</p>
