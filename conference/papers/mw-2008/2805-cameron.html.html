        <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText">Museum collections are increasingly linked to global
    networks and flows of information. Google-enabled initiatives and the placement
    of collections information and images in social spaces (YouTube, FlickR,
    MySpace) allow them to be linked to wider social, cultural contexts, used in
    unexpected ways in debates, and for political agendas within public culture
    . Interactions with collections, some planned, others
    serendipitous, are now happening through these multiple and extended
    connections of people, ideas and objects, across long distances and national
    boundaries. Collections space and the meanings, values and significances
    attributed to them can no longer be considered fixed, given or separate. It is
    now dynamic, less predictable and networked (Cameron and Mengler 2007).</p>
<p class="AbstractText"> This paper discusses conceptual
  work undertaken for the Australian Research Council research project
  Reconceptualising Heritage Collections with the Centre for Cultural Research,
  University of Western Sydney and the Powerhouse Museum. It offers some possible
  solutions on how museums and collections might operate as complex systems
  according to Latour&rsquo;s (2005) idea of object-orientated democracies. Here I draw
  on the results of qualitative research, conversations and workshops with
  curators, and globally networked communities presenting models for
  transdisciplinary and socially embedded practices in collections documentation.</p>

<h1>Democratising The Object: Revisiting The Concept Of Access</h1>
<p>Museum metaphors as
    they currently stand use collections to produce stable, certain meanings,
    ordered categories and unified heritage values. In museum space, the curator is
    regarded as the main entrance to a qualified interpretation of the object.
    Audiences are directed to read and use these texts in certain ways. According
    to these metaphorical tools, an object&rsquo;s narrative is sustained around detailed
    descriptions of its physical form and production notes. An object&rsquo;s
    significance lies more in its role in sustaining a socially symbolic meaning
    such as local or national identity rather than its contexts of use or
    consumption. Essentially, museums have striven to create a world of factual
    objects almost completely separate from human concerns, desires and conflicts
    through systems of classification, acquisition, and documentation
  procedures.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While museums<b> </b>are placing more emphasis on their experiential
    and performative aspects in exhibitions (Henning 2006), the same consideration
    has not been given to collections. The experiential dimension accorded to
    collections tends to be orientated to access: the ability to detach objects and
    collections information from their fixed place in time and space allows them to
    circulate as multiples and reproductions via on-line collections interfaces.
    This parallels with claims that technology is democratic and neutral. While the
    idea of the democratic object is linked to access in theory, in practice museum
    classifications remain hierarchical, and museum-specific interpretive paradigms
  remain predominately closed. </p>
<h1>Networked Collections And Its Transformations</h1>
<p>The networked object
    overturns all this. By programming museum collections into Google and other
    social spaces like YouTube, Flickr and MySpace, and with the advent of Web 2.0,
    collections and information are now entering global flows. For example, in
    2006, the Powerhouse Museum launched OPAC2 (Open Collections Access V2) linking
    its collections searches to Google, with users able to add their own
    folksonomies (descriptive terms) to searches and make search recommendations
    (Chan 2007b). The Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA - Los Angeles), the Walker
    Art Centre and the Brooklyn Museum, for example, have presences on MySpace
    showcasing their collections and advertising upcoming exhibitions and events.
    Users interact and arrange to meet at virtual events and discuss memorable
    exhibitions to, as one MOCA user wrote, &lsquo;revive the experience.&rsquo; Numerous
    museum visitors post photographs of their favourite objects and artworks to the
    photo sharing site Flickr. The National Library of Australia is harvesting
  images of telephone technology from Flickr to be archived in its collection.</p>
<p>Collections
    information now operates within networks that transcend their immediate
    location, placing them in wider flows of interconnected cultural, political,
    economic and technological ideas, agendas and resources. Through these public
    spaces, collections are able to garner greater interest and cultivate meanings
    within wider cultural and social contexts. Social actors in various locations
    and contexts are acting on and modifying collections information according to
  their interests.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig 1: Powerhouse Museum Collection object 93/391/66
    Brassiere, womens, &lsquo;Nu-U&rsquo;, nylon / cotton / metal, Berlei, Australia, 1957 and
  advertisement for the 2006 Ubra.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example, the
    1950s <i>Ubra,</i> in the
    Powerhouse collection, became one of the museum&rsquo;s most viewed on-line objects
    late last year, in contrast to its previous relative obscurity (Chan 2007, personal communication). This can be
    explained through Google searches linking objects to a consumer culture of
    shopping. Its popularity coincided with the re-invention and launch of the 2006 Ubrain
  stores, with media coverage, and the efforts of consumers to purchase the item. </p>
<p>In some instances,
    objects are taking an active role in social networks and political agendas. Via
    Goggle, collections of Persian objects used as signifiers of Iranian cultural
    identity were mobilised to counter negative representations of ancient Persia
    following the 300 movie controversy about the battle of Thermapylae between the
    Persians and Spartans in 480BC (Jones 2007). Searches for the film 300 were diverted
    away from the film to a Web site Project 300 that displayed contemporary
    Iranian art, documentaries, and links to the British Museum&rsquo;s <i>Forgotten
    Empire</i> exhibition of Persian
    artefacts (Jones 2007, 6). Art works were used as tools to project positive
    representations of Persian civilisation and bolster contemporary national
  narratives.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Collections data
    from the Powerhouse Museum collection on Australian swimmer&nbsp; Annette Kellerman, the &ldquo;Diving Venus&rdquo;
  who was arrested in 1907 for indecent exposure for appearing in her bathing
  suit, appeared on the porn blog, Silent-Porn-Star (Chan 2007, personal
  communication,
  <a href="http://silent-porn-star.blogspot.com/2007/12/kellerman-nude-mermaid.html">http://silent-porn-star.blogspot.com/2007/12/kellerman-nude-mermaid.html</a>)</p>
<p>How heritage
  significance is ascertained is also being challenged. </p>

<p class="caption">Fig 2: Powerhouse Museum Collection object 2005/1/1 Evening
  dress designed by Lisa Ho and worn by Delta Goodrem, 2003. </p>
<p>For example, a dress
    designed by Australian designer Lisa Ho and worn by singer Delta Goodrem has
    remained the most viewed object in the Powerhouse Museum&rsquo;s OPAC, probably
    having currency because of both her celebrity status and associated
  controversies around her personal life.</p>
<p>Interactions with
    heritage collections, some planned, others serendipitous, are now being
    conducted through these multiple and extended connections of people, ideas and
    objects, across long distances and national boundaries. Collections information
    is fluid, without&nbsp; boundaries,
  enabling all these things to be used and reconfigured within flows </p>
<h1>Global-Local Dialectics: Blurring The Boundaries Between Local And Global</h1>
<p>Although museums
    tend to be locality-bound and represent that community, they simultaneously
    operate in a global network as a dominant node in heritage regimes. The global
    offers a different set of competing dynamics, no longer territorially defined
    and community based. In considering museums as global, this aspect works with
    the potential to integrate a multiplicity of political, economic, social, and
    cultural economies, linked to various communities, histories and geographical
    regions of the globe. All these have the potential to create and re-create
    meanings around collections in complex ways. While some collections have
    greater local resonance, many express global connections. Because the space of
    information flows is flexible and interactive, protocols of communication
    between cultures in networks, according to theorist Manuel Castells (2004a),
    are not necessarily based on shared values, but on sharing the value of
    communication. Therefore, collections now operate in an open-ended network of
    meanings and within many-to-many communication regimes that coexist but also
    interact and modify each other on the basis of exchanges. Here objects are
    simultaneously connected to locality and institution, and taking on a role in
  mapping out a public space beyond the museum.</p>
<p>Clearly, museums need to consider the
    changing and fluid nature of heritage significance in the context of these
    broader cycles of consumption and information flows. In referring to other
    dimensions, and drawing on Castell&rsquo;s work, theorist Felix Stalder (2006) argues
    that the mainstream and single accepted way of representing reality is being
    fragmented into an ever-growing multiplicity of culturally specific symbolic and
    material discourses. The same is true for collections interpretative regimes.
    Clearly, the more technology facilitates a networked social structure and
    individual cultural expression, as seen most recently with Web 2.0, the more
    difficult it becomes for museums to produce universal or consensual meanings
    for their collections. Theorist
    Jordi Borja (2003) expands on this, arguing that the advent of technologies
    allowing participation in global networks also encourages people to assert
    their own culture and experience in their immediate localities. The
    ramifications of this for museums is indeed great in terms of how they relate
    to and interact with their constituencies, resulting in potentially greater
    interest by both local and more far-flung constituencies in how collections are
  considered and valued. </p>
<p>How to interface the
    variability, and at times the contradictory nature and clash of museum symbolic
    codes, multiple user values and significance, becomes an important
    consideration. Decisions about how collections are accorded meaning and
    significance cannot be understood only according to geographical location;
    position within overall global networks and the fuller range of expressions and
    desires this entails play a part. In short, collections space and the meanings,
    values and significances attributed can no longer be considered fixed, given or
  separate. They have become dynamic and less predictable. </p>
<h1>Object Orientated Democracies: An Emergent Paradigm</h1>
<p>These examples are
    more closely aligned to what Bruno Latour (2005b) calls object-orientated
    democracies rather than to the notion of the static object. The
    object-through-networks is enabled as an actor in these events, thus
    challenging museum canons. Many collections have implicit political tensions
    that are often denied and subsumed within the documentation process. Few
  exhibit a seamless knowable narrative in a real world context. </p>
<p>According to Latour
    (2005b, 15) and in referring to contemporary issues such as the Islamic veil in
    France or the latest beheading of fanatics in Falluja, each of these &lsquo;objects&rsquo;
  generates a different pattern of emotions, passions, opinions, disagreements
  and agreements while drawing together an assembly of people, each with their
  own agendas and ways to bring about a resolution. Networked objects such as the
  above-mentioned accordingly generate changes in conceptions of what objectivity
  is and what the &lsquo;facts&rsquo; are as competing assemblies of people and ideas
    coalesce. Latour argues that, &ldquo;For too long, objects have been wrongly portrayed
  as matters of fact.&rdquo; (19). </p>
<p>In a museum context,
    collection items are seen as matters of fact. This factual equivalent is made
    tangible through materiality (the inscribed objective nature of an object based
    on its material form and auric links to locations, events and people), museum
    significance and classification. In a networked environment, Latour (2005b, 19)
    posits that there is a shift from matters of fact, to one of matters of concern
    or matters of interest as the various agendas and opinions are brought together
    through networks. This shift is clearly evident in two of the examples
    discussed. The Ubra example shows how matters of interest; such as consumerism,
    shopping, sexuality, concepts of beauty, sit side by side with museum
    significance, demonstrating how objects might be used for a completely
  different intent. </p>
<p>Persian objects from
    the British Museum exhibition <i>The Forgotten Empire</i> were drawn into the object-orientated
    democracy around Persian nationhood and identity that emerged around the 300
    movie. Here collections were used as players in international relations
    specifically to foreground and assert the matters of concern and interests of
    contemporary Iranian artists, activists and media about how the Persian empire
  was portrayed. </p>
<p>This event also
    highlights the fluidity of museum fact, how it becomes blurred and conflicted
    as competing notions of the past, good and bad, clash. The <i>Forgotten Empire</i> exhibition narrative extolled the Persian
    empire as advanced, civilized and glorious while countering other views by
    omission. This event also emphasises the power of &lsquo;factual&rsquo; representations in
    a museum context and shows how this is increasingly used for political and
    identity purposes, because technology makes it easier. New technologies are
    mobilised to counter the effects of disagreement, produce different readings of
    events, enable people to challenge established orthodoxies, facilitate
    object-orientated democracies and group concerns and interests while drawing
  museums and collections into debates.</p>
<p>By the gathering
    together of different assemblies of relevant and interested people around an
    object, Latour (2005b) argues that the public space and the readings of the
    object that emerges are profoundly different from those usually recognised under
    the label of the political. Here the analogy for the museum object lies in how
    some collections are operating, read and used in networked public space by
    different individuals and groups, often in entirely different ways from those
    imaged under the guise of curatorial authority or heritage significance, value
    and certainty. For example, the space of the Ubra brought together an assembly
    of unlikely parties, heritage values, and an authorised museum significance
    with mobile worlds of consumer consumption and on-line shopping. The
    photographs of Annette Kellerman were read as both the iconic Australian
    swimming sensation and, in a different realm, as early twentieth century porn.
    How might these competing readings be acted out in the collections documentation
  context?</p>
<h1>Object-Orientated Democracies: The Palestinian Example</h1>
<p>To consider ways an
    object-orientated democracy might operate in the real world context of
    collections documentation, as part of the <i>Reconceptualising Heritage
    Collections</i> project we constructed
    this dynamic around two objects, a Palestinian <i>thob
    abu qutbeh</i><b> (</b>wedding
    dress) and a British Mandate coin. Here we assembled curators from the
    Powerhouse Museum together with a group of Palestinian Australian people and
    networked them with curators from museums and cultural centres in Ramallah,
    Palestine and Israel. The project involved interactions through a collections
  wiki and discussions in real time. </p>
<p>Both objects chosen
    are politically charged for different reasons, one a Palestinian object made by
    women, the other produced by a colonial power. Each had an implicit
    object-orientated democracy activated through this network. These items
    operated as a juncture where matters of fact and the interests and concerns and
    agendas of these various assemblies of people could gather, and as a point
    where shifting meanings and significance attributed to these objects might be
  articulated. </p>
<p>For Palestinian
    nationals, for example, the <i>thob abu qutbeh</i><b> </b>acts
    as a marker of identity; as a regional and national symbol; as a statement of
    resistance against the Israeli occupation; and a political map of the landscape
    to which style and colour of each talks of its specific location and to land
    lost in the occupied territories. As one focus group participant stated, &ldquo;after
    the occupation the <i>thob</i> becomes a flag &ndash; while the flag cannot be displayed, the dress takes it
    place.&rdquo; (Palestinian Focus Group 2008). The shifting ground of significance and
    meaning is expressed by the meanings played out prior to occupation where an
    emotional resonance around happiness and marriage was fore-grounded, with the
  former reading emerging since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. </p>
<p>Diasporic readings
    (those of Palestinian Australians) of the <i>thob abu
    qutbeh</i> speak to it as
    symbol of identity but less as a political tool, and converse more directly of
    the emotional links to homeland, women&rsquo;s culture, marriage, love and happiness
  and the skill and beauty of the hand-made stitch. </p>
<p>The Powerhouse
    Museum curatorial reading of the <i>thob</i> operates as a symbolic stand-in for Palestinian women and
    culture. Here the object as an isolated entity speaks through the description
    of its physicality and production, links to other wedding dresses, and connects
  to hippy parties in the 1960s. </p>
<p>Palestinian
    curatorial readings of the same object talk to the <i>thob</i> as a living tradition worn by women in
    villages and refugee camps, as a national symbol - marker of identity, social
    class, marital status and origin. A Jewish reading, on the other hand, seeks to
    challenge the uses of material culture and the <i>thob</i> as statements of resistance and occupation and
    the deployment of collections data as political tools, as well as an assertion
  that the thob has a Judeo-Christian origin.</p>
<p>The
    object-orientated democracy that emerged around the British Mandate coin c1927
    in which Palestine is expressed in three languages, Arabic, Hebrew and English,
    illustrates how readings of significance differ, and conceptions of what facts
    are and what objectivity is clash according to these assemblies and competing
    agendas. One point of dispute was reference to the British Mandate as a
  &ldquo;prosperous and stable period&rdquo; in the Powerhouse Museum curatorial record. For
    many Palestinians, a reading of the British Mandate coin symbolized the British
    occupation and the destruction of Palestinian culture. To them, the British
    Mandate was a period of instability and hardship with clashes involving the
    British army, Palestinians and the Jewish terrorist gangs, and prolonged
    strikes. For others, the symbolism of the three languages reflected equal
    representation, the ability for the sides to work together, and optimism about
    future peace. These debates also highlight how the language of documentation in
  many instances has inherent political tensions.</p>
<p>Disputes also arose
    over status of the various languages prior to the British Mandate, underlying
    assertions about legitimate claims to land and a sovereign state. A Jewish
    lobby argued that Hebrew was an official language before the Mandate, whereas others
    refuted this, suggesting that this status was conferred under the Mandate as
  part of the process towards the establishment of a Jewish state.</p>
<p>A fuller expression
    of the complex meanings, passions, agreements and disagreements in a networked
    world will be played out when this wiki is made public. This, however, is seen
    as problematic. Tensions arise between an older idea of the political as part
    of a dominant museum culture, and newer ideas of the political and of
    governance as emergent, open-ended and unpredictable, enabled through
    open-source collections interfaces within networked contexts. Surprisingly,
    many articulated the need for museums to act as apolitical gatekeepers to
    protect Palestinian interests and material culture as a cultural symbol against
  &lsquo;other&rsquo; interpretations and political subversion, particularly by Israeli
    interests. Here governance, for the majority, is deemed as previously expressed
    to mean taking an active role in providing safe interpretations for particular
    interests by limiting the associations and resonances that can be built around
    objects, especially those that are disputed or sensitive. These assertions led
    to questions about maintaining the authenticity of information for political
    and academic purposes and the legitimacy of other expertise and knowledge in
    this process. Strongly disputing this<b> </b>approach, one focus group participant stated, &ldquo;competing
    knowledges are symbolic of life, blood and death, the interpretation of
  collections needs to reflect the real world&rdquo; (Palestinian Focus Group 2008).</p>
<h1>Networks, Significance And Visibility </h1>
<p>The<b> </b>visibility or significance of objects also
    fluctuates in networks. Some objects have a higher visibility at times.
    Therefore significance is defined by the matters of interest and concerns of
    the actors and networks to which an object is connected. This is in sharp
    contrast to museum significance, where significance is directly related to why
    the museum considers an object important to collect, primarily for symbolic
    reasons. While museum disciplinary significance, presented as static unchanging
    statements, is authorised in this context, other significances are not given
  space.</p>
<p>Matters of fact,
    concern, interest, the fluctuating visibility of objects as significance,
    operate simultaneously in the way they are consumed. This could be fleeting or
    involve deep epistemological questions. The question is, how can the rigid
    structures in which collections and information reside take account of these
    new formulations of the networked object in which matters of fact operate at
    times in conflict and sit alongside the concerns and interests of diverse
  communities? In networks, objects operate as all these things. </p>
<p>Put simply, and
    drawing on Latour&rsquo;s words, objects are more interesting, complicated, uncertain,
    open and risky, far-reaching, heterogeneous, historical, local and networked
    (Latour 2005b) than in the limited way presented by museums. Collections
    information can no longer be managed; expertise has broadened. Latour (2005,
    21) refers to this as a new eloquence. That is, interpretation can no longer be
  considered as a unified stabilizing pattern. </p>
<p>Network metaphors
    are also used to explain and conceptualise the weakening of the hierarchy
    principle to which museums subscribe as both a general organisation model and a
    political technology of action (Stalder 2006). Media theorist Georgie Born
    (2004) in discussing the notion of expertise at the BBC suggests that there is
    less emphasis on expertise as a form of management but more on interpreting lived
  realities.</p>
<p>Despite all this,
    collections documentation tends to continue to produce a certain and stable
    material world with clearly defined inscribed cultural categorisations. The
    complexities of objects, their lived realities, their use and consumption
    contexts are seen as problems to be removed by classification, although this is
    changing.&nbsp; This museum order has
    begun to sit uncomfortably with the increasingly complex interactions with
    collections. To date, complexity practices have not been given sufficient
    attention in the way museum heritage documentation and engagement operate. The
    emphasis has been on applying technical solutions rather than on giving close
  examination to the social contexts in which museums operate. </p>
<h1>Collections And Disciplinary Dilemmas</h1>
<p class="caption"><img src="Cameron_Fig3.jpg" alt="figure 3" width="350" height="231" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 3: Conceptualising current museum collections
  documentation systems: the disciplinary context. &copy; Fiona Cameron</p>
<p>Museum objects have
    always been more complex than their classificatory or heritage demarcations
    suggest. The museum system uses disciplines such as art, history, science and
    natural history as vantage points to describe all human knowledge and culture
    in an orderly fashion. The analytical dimensions of these disciplines reduce
    the complexities of objects so they can act as privileged symbols of culture
  and nature, and of national identity.</p>
<p>The limitations of
    disciplinary knowledge and heritage ascription has been acknowledged with a
    move to engage with post structuralist ideas such as object meaning as
    constructed and post-modernist ideas about plural voices (Cameron, 2005; Cameron and Mengler, 
    2007). These approaches have been widely embraced in museums, in exhibitions,
    in programs and increasingly, in collections. Plural approaches are still
    problematic in terms of ascribing heritage value. They use the various
    perspectives to&nbsp; represent a
    cohesive story, to illustrate difference and act as separate non-interacting
    narratives. Considerable progress has been made in incorporating human stories
    into documentation. For example, curators at the Birzeit University
    Ethnographic and Art Museum, Ramallah, Palestine, base collections
    documentation largely on consultation and field research, gathering information
    about collection items from communities and antique dealers (Palestinian Focus
    Group transcription, 2008, 5). While innovative, these approaches still place
    the museum at the centre of the dialogue, controlling and directing the
    meanings and values ascribed in collections documentation and placing them into
  a cohesive narrative.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig 4: Museum collections documentation systems: engaging
  multi- and inter-disciplinarity. &copy; Fiona Cameron</p>
<p>More recently
    multidisciplinarity has been seen as a solution to contextualise the complex
    object (Hooper-Greenhill 1992, 7). This, however, is a form of pluralism where
    the different disciplines are used as separate non-interacting entities to
    describe the object. Folksonomies, or object search descriptions in the
    Powerhouse collection by users, act as kind of in-between spaces between
    disciplines and formal museum nomenclatures - to engage the more nuanced social
  understandings of objects.</p>
<p>Interdisciplinarity,
    on the other hand, might be more useful as it is an approach that attempts to
    create bridges across disciplines, bringing them together and integrating their
    various aspects (Meek et al. 2005). It acknowledges that the different aspects
    of an object can be seen from different perspectives, each contributing
  insights that require integration to produce new meanings.</p>
<p>None of these
    discipline-based solutions, however, should be considered wholesale solutions
    for grasping object complexity. Nor should they be<b> </b>confused with real engagement with the social,
    spatial, political, economic and historical realities to be observed in the
    contemporary world and in which heritage collections now operate and arguably
  always have. </p>
<h1>Museum Order: The Current System </h1>
<p class="caption"><img src="Cameron_Fig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="350" height="228" /></p>
<p class="caption">&nbsp;Fig 5: Mapping
  museum collections documentation in a complex chaotic world. &copy; Fiona Cameron</p>
<p>This map shows the
    current system and how relations between the different orders operate in a
    complex chaotic world. The museum system of disciplinary knowledge sits
    separate. Museum order is bounded from the outside world but networked into
    wider public culture.&nbsp; Interactions
    are mediated via Google, YouTube, Flickr and other avenues that permeate the
    museum walls: most pass through; few stay or are captured. Many of these
    interactions are momentary. Disciplinary vantage points remain as the
    predominant means for defining the object. Multidisciplinarity and
    interdisciplinarity as practices bring the museum world closer to
    contextualising heritage collections in a more complex manner, but these are
  still separated from the chaos and unpredictability of lived realities. </p>
<p>Clearly, existing
    museum collection metaphors and newer ones such as multi- and
    inter-disciplinarity are inadequate to grasp the dynamics, complexities and
    disorder of the contemporary world as described and the interfaces between the
    museum and material objects. The challenge of the <i>Reconceptualising Heritage
    Collections</i> Project is to move
    from the &lsquo;plural&rsquo; to conceptualising museum collections practice as complex and
    networked; that is, from a predominantly closed to an open system of
    meaning-making (based on analytic forms characterised by unity, universality
    and certainty) to incorporating other aspects as mentioned by Tilley (2006,1)
    such as relationality, unpredictability, ambiguity, openness and emergence. The
  aim here is to put the complexity back into museum records. </p>
<h1>Imagining A Complex Collections Systems</h1>
<p>So what might a
    complex collections system look like? How might cultural relationships be
    formulated around collections in public culture? According to Hodge (2007), the
    basis of the complexity approach is that real life problems will always be too
    complex to be reduced to one approach or discipline. Clearly the complexity of
    objects requires equivalent complexity in responses regarding the way
  documentation is handled </p>
<p>A complex system
    acknowledges that objects derive their meaning and significance from a large
    number of elements; for example, from curatorial disciplines, from their
    production and consumption contexts, from their practical use in everyday life
    and within networks as technical, social or political entities. There is no
    division between the material and social world, and no definitive categories
    exist that can capture all that can be known about an object (see Dant 2006;
    Latour 2005a). As objects are increasingly taking a role in mapping out public
    space beyond the museum, they assemble people and ideas, many of which cannot
    be completely known or predicted, and some that might be momentary or fleeting.
    Collections information also becomes more discursive and playful, rather than
    solely based on deep ideological symbolic constructs about heritage, history or
  culture. </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Cameron_Fig6.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="350" height="242" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 6: Complexifying
  museum collections systems in public culture. &copy; Fiona Cameron</p>
<p>As demonstrated in
    this map, museum collections interfaces act as an open system. It is
    non-linear, made up of a large number of elements that interact dynamically
    through exchanges with both direct and indirect feedback loops between
    institutions and users, and have known but also emergent properties. This map
    shows the large number of interactions coming from many sources. This enables
    exchanges between the museum and users, and between user exchanges (links to
    wider debates and events) and communities of practice. Collections become more
    embedded and connected to their use and consumption contexts and are in a
  constant state of translation.</p>
<p>A complex approach
    will still retain rigour and respect for museum expertise. That is, because
    complex systems are based on groups and sub-groups of individuals that interact
    according to sets of rules, various forms of exchange create their own various
    knowledge properties in the cultural realm (Cilliers 2000, 4-5). So curatorial
    disciplines, as illustrated in this map, remain expert communities but involve
    interactions across curatorial areas, different forms of exchange, and at times
    spaces where new knowledge is generated. The boundaries are opened and
    permeable among the different types of knowledge, groups of users, and public
  culture, and these links involve movement. </p>
<p>Multi/inter/metadisciplinary
    (arts, science, humanities) engagement can be seen as a series of vantage
    points that produce a range of properties and knowledge of different types. The
    use of collections for consumption and translation in these different spaces
    cannot be entirely predicted. By engaging chaos theory, for example, we can
    interpret museum heritage properties as operating close to equilibrium. They
    are more predictable; whereas others operate further from equilibrium, are more
    chaotic. The benefits of a complex approach are that the scope and reach of the
    museum are expanded, linking heritage collections to debates, communities and
    other expertise within public culture, a process already observed. Previously
    static documentation categories become more ambiguous as objects are
  interpreted in unexpected and interesting ways. </p>
<p>This process offers
    a sense of indeterminacy, fluidity, and uncertainty, but also of becoming or
    emergence. It offers an opportunity for museums to realise something greater and
    more useful for their collections than was previously possible. Objects are
    able to perform at a higher level of complexity. The museum becomes open to the
  different ways the object is translated and consumed.</p>
<p>The idea of museums
    as places to access information denotes an authoritative position and static
    notions of producer and consumer. This idea is largely superseded as
    interactions between users and information increase, and collections
    information is linked to other social spaces. Therefore, it is more productive
    to conceive of collections interfaces as spaces for translation and consumption
  as part of a network. </p>
<p>Simplistic divisions
    between the serious scholar and the casual researcher are also no longer valid,
    nor are direct and predictable translations between the internal museum and
    external user. The object in translation also renders divisions between
    internal and external descriptions and significance less demarcated; in
    networks and flows of culture of which museums form part, there is no centre
    and no periphery.&nbsp; In current
    museum culture, documentation operates as the central repository where meaning
    and significance is formed. In networks, however, documentation as a repository
    is a node in a much larger and more complex public space for the circulation of
    object meaning and significance. All this requires a mind-shift. A complex
    collections system cannot be completely designed, controlled, understood or
  predicted in the way documentation systems have been in the past.</p>
<h1>Considering Transdisciplinary Collections Interfaces</h1>
<p>Clearly, we need to
    realign the cognitive and practical ordering of museum heritage collections
    documentation practice to express these complexities and interactions on a
    global and networked scale. Collections space becomes open, dynamic and
    relational for the interaction and ongoing translation of the object.&nbsp; The aim here is to expand the
    significance and meanings of objects beyond disciplinary boundaries that seek
    to close meaning off, and instead to build the social relationships and
    associations around collections rather than describing them as factual
    statements of the social (see Latour 2005). The museum can take a role in
    translating and integrating the various elements and seeing each as part of a
  chain that makes up the complex object. </p>
<p>There is a need to
    deal with expertise in three aspects: museum, participatory and local
    knowledge. There is also a need to think of material, emotional, social and
    symbolic and experiential knowledge (as demonstrated with the Palestinian
    collection examples) in a non-reductionist way, in addition to capturing the
    emergent or transitional state of object meaning and the fluidity and
    interactivity of these categorisations. Complexity will also need to be
    managed, to sort out the desirable and undesirable effects of its increase and
    to acknowledge the different levels of interaction. The aim is not to do away
    with disciplinary-based documentation and accumulated knowledge, but to add a
  level of complexity.</p>
<p>Transdisciplinary
    practice offers one model. (For a description of transdisciplinary practice see
  Guimaraes and Funtowicz, 2006; Nowotny, 2003). </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Cameron_Fig7.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="350" height="265" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 7: Imagining a transdisciplinary collections interface
  and practice. &copy; Fiona Cameron</p>
<p>In applying this to
    museum collections, museum order is hybridized where the boundaries of
    classification and description, contextualisation and significance become
    permeable. It acknowledges that there are multiple stances:
  museum/disciplinary, local, and participatory knowledge. </p>
<p>Moreover, it enables
    the bringing together of a range of properties not necessarily known or certain
    but which may emerge as part of the interaction, and where the meaning and
    significance of objects could take a number of forms. The transdisciplinary interface
    acts as a relational system, allowing for knowledge coherence rather than unity
    while enabling some elements of uncertainty and complexity to operate. There is
    also the potential to bring these knowledges together as jointly generated
  knowledge.</p>
<p>Structuring this
    interaction requires rethinking interfaces on the basis of a range of multiple,
    mobile metaphors of material (solid and linguistic) using different media forms
    to which various people can contribute. Solid metaphors refer to how an object
    is produced, its sources, raw materials, exchange and consumption contexts,
    uses, sequence of events or factual qualities (Tilley 1999, 263-6). For
    example, in terms of the <i>thob abu</i> <i>qutbeh,</i><b><i> </i></b>this could include how it is made, a description of its form from
    a curatorial perspective, and Palestinian readings about location, colour and
    stitching. Conceptual metaphors are the meanings that frame an object&rsquo;s
    activities and might include descriptive and emotional resonances to do with
    women&rsquo;s culture, love and marriage. Linguistic metaphors are significance
    statements and are often opinion-based. This information might include a
    discussion of the political uses of the <i>thob </i>in a Palestinian context, diasporic readings of
    identity, museum significance as symbolic stand-in markers of women&rsquo;s culture,
    and Israeli interpretations of the <i>thob </i>as a political tool and of Judeo-Christian origin. While museums
    are now in the habit of soliciting comments from community interests, this
    model offers new opportunities for interactions and exchanges. All these
    metaphors once discussed, for example, might be brought together as jointly
    generated knowledge. Citations or quotes bridge the distance between these
    views and exchanges and connect the more ephemeral and fluid nature of object meaning
    (Cameron 2007) while allowing for more momentary exchanges. A space for
    emergent knowledge and for what is uncertain and formed through dialogues and
    exchanges, according to this research, is also considered a desirable quality
  that could eventually feed into the other discourses.</p>
<p>All this challenges
    existing documentation and heritage structures. The emergence of museum
    knowledge in a complex world will lead to discussions about the authenticity of
    information, the legitimacy of other types of knowledge, ways of regulating
    exchanges, together with museum authority and expertise and where it sits in a
    complex, networked scheme. Tensions will also emerge over how the
    organisational structures of institutions might accommodate flexible networks
    within their hierarchy. Anxieties over the permanency and certainty of museum
    information, as opposed to its operation in an unstable and unpredictable field
    - including questions about sustainability in terms of museum documentation
  practice - will also emerge.</p>
