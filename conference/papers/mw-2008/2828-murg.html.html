        <p class="AbstractText">Over the last few years, digital content has gained
  importance in cultural heritage institutions. Video and picture material is
  being digitized in order to manage the large amount of content with ease.
  Digital data can be administered using databases that allow the addition of
  meta information as well as manipulation of certain media (e.g. dust and
  flicker reduction on historic film material). Digitized versions of film and
  audio documents and digital images of objects (paintings, statues, architecture
  &hellip;) can also be used to attract a larger audience by making available previews
  of exhibitions on the Web.</p>
  <p class="AbstractText">One step further would be to allow walk-through virtual
  tours on-line. Those tours represent the real world exhibition to a certain
  extent. Visitors at </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">home can experience a guided tour as though they were at a
    museum. In order to make those 3D worlds as accessible as possible, the use of
    standard methods is recommended.</p>
  <p class="AbstractText">This paper gives an overview of standards currently in
  use and their relevance in the presentation of cultural heritage. Also, one
  method is chosen for representing the digital content of a special exhibition
  at the Technical Museum Vienna. An important standard format for
  three-dimensional content on the Web used to be VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling
  Language). This has evolved into the XML based X3D. Another method of bringing
  three-dimensional content on the Web is Shockwave3D. These technologies are
  compared in terms of flexibility and usability.</p>
  <p class="AbstractText">To allow a curator easy development of virtual tours, an
  application was developed to support the procedure. The development process
  will be outlined, as well as how a prototypic client is used to access virtual
  exhibitions. The client uses standardized methods for the rendering of the
  three-dimensional scenes and also allows for interactivity.</p>

 <h1>Virtual Exhibitions</h1>
  <p>Digital media have grown to be an important factor in
  enhancing the didactic spectrum used in museums and exhibitions over the last
  years. They are used in various ways, from terminals acting as media stations
  indoors, to cultural heritage institutions providing additional information on
  Web sites on the Internet. The advantages of content in digital form are
  considerable as different media types can be made accessible on a single
  platform. The interested audience can benefit from the combination of textual
  information with images, audio, and video, and even three-dimensional
  animations, all at the same time.</p>
  <p>Based on the three-dimensionality of the physical space, the
  same concepts can be used for virtual exhibition spaces in order to present the
  various digital objects adequately. Further, the availability of digital
  content opens up the possibility of presenting it on-line as well. These
  requirements necessitated an easy way for exhibition designers and curators to
  build virtual rooms to house the digital content that was available in the
  museum.</p>
  <p>The &lsquo;Technisches Museum Wien&rsquo; wanted an application that
  would allow exactly this. They approached software developers at the Institute
  of Information Systems &amp; Information Management of the Graz-based research
  company JOANNEUM RESEARCH to help them with this task. Prior cooperation in
  similar fields has fostered a professional relationship between the
  organizations, and thus the project to build an easy-to-use editor for
  three-dimensional content was started.</p>
  <p>The application is meant to build bridges to connect digital
  content such as images, audio and video, and three-dimensional representation
  of this content. The software allows filling virtual rooms with objects that
  can be built from various media formats and positioning those exhibits in the
  three-dimensional space of those rooms. With the help of a player, which is
  available as a stand-alone application, as well as a browser plug-in for
  on-line purposes, the target audience can view the exhibitions and even
  interact with the virtual objects.</p>
  <p>Out of this project emerged the software product eXhibition:editor3D
  which is currently being used at the &lsquo;Technisches Museum Wien&rsquo; to enhance the
  permanent exhibition &lsquo;medien.welten&rsquo; by adding additional content and value.</p>
  <h1>eXhibition:editor3D</h1>
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>At first the intended purpose of the software was to provide
  an easy way for curators to offer additional information in digital form. As
  supposedly the most exciting possibility for the visitor would be virtual
  showrooms, the developers went for this strategy. The audience should be
  captivated by the use of digital media, its presentation in three-dimensional
  space, and the opportunity to walk and interact freely within the given surroundings.
  The combination of various media formats allows for an especially rich
  experience. Textual information can be presented at the same time a video is
  shown, and pictures of objects can be enhanced with&nbsp; appropriate sound effects. The digital image of a typewriter
  in combination with the clicking sounds of the keys can enliven the whole experience
  as someone is learning about H.G. Wells, for example.</p>
  <p>These little extra aspects add enormous value to exhibitions
  as they used to be. Almost all of the visitors&rsquo; senses (apart from olfactory
  sensation)can be stimulated at the same time for extra effect. By presenting
  the content and interactive animations on touch screens and using sound and
  moving images as well, the experience attains a new level of quality.</p>
  <p>As there was no data presentation software that allowed for
  this variation in media use, and also as developers wanted to provide free
  navigation, a new application had to be developed with these aspects in mind.</p>
  <h2>Entering The Third Dimension</h2>
  <p>Choosing an appropriate format for visualizing
  three-dimensional content was important at the start of the development
  process. The possibilities ranged from proprietary 3D engines used by game
  developers to established standards for providing 3D content on the Web. The
  idea of using&nbsp; game engines ( i.e.
  letting the user change the virtual rooms at will and without the knowledge
  necessary to use 3D modeling software like Maya or 3D Studio Max) was declared
  useless for the goal. This left us with the technologies that are used to show
  3D worlds on Web sites. The files used on the Web are relatively small, a
  distinct advantage.</p>
  <p>The big player on this field seemed to be Shockwave 3D.
  Flash technology use is widespread, and the necessary plug-in for displaying
  flash content is well accepted and installed on the majority of personal
  computer systems. This led to the conclusion that the Shockwave 3D plug-in
  would also meet good acceptance from users. However, we decided against using
  Shockwave because it is a closed format. It does not allow alterations of its
  code (even though the possibility of injecting XML data in a Shockwave
  application exists).</p>
  <p>The goal of the application was to provide a &lsquo;one-stop&rsquo;
  solution. It should not be dependent upon other software, which would make it
  necessary to own and use the powerful software suite, but should be an easy to
  use tool on its own. </p>
  <p>The necessity for alterations to the code and, preferably,
  the use of human readable characters was the main reason the successor of VRML
  (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) was chosen. This format is named Extensible
  3D, or X3D for short, and was declared an international standard by the
  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 2004. It is based on
  XML (Extensible Markup Language, a format mainly used for data exchange between
  different systems) syntax, and therefore the code is understandable not only by
  computers but also by&nbsp; humans as
  well.</p>
  <p>VRML is well established in the realms of creating
  three-dimensional content for the Web, and X3D as its successor has some
  additional advantages. Yet the main argument for using X3D is its clear
  structure and the ease of altering the resulting code. Because of its use
  of&nbsp; XML concepts such as nodes,
  children, properties and such, it is relatively easy to use data input in any
  other form and transform this data into valid X3D by using stylesheets (XSLT
  Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation).</p>
  <p>Take a look at the example below to get an idea:</p>
  <p class="code">&lt;?xml
    version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">&lt;!DOCTYPE X3D PUBLIC

  <p class="code">&lt;/Scene&gt;</p>
  <p class="code">&lt;/X3D&gt;</p>
  <p>The part in bold defines an object, in this case a box with an
  image attached as a texture to it. The surrounding code defines the world and
  provides meta information about the scene. You can also see that there is a
  node for a viewpoint. This is the representation of a camera object in the X3D
  world. </p>
  <p>However, there is no need to go into more detail with this
  code. The main point is that this is the code a computer uses to render a
  three-dimensional object at its given coordinates on the screen. Changing the
  appearance of the object is easy to accomplish and requires no special training
  in a programming language.</p>
  <h2>Getting Technical</h2>
  <p>JOANNEUM RESEARCH built an application that uses common
  elements of user interaction like drag and drop and menus to achieve the same
  effect as altering the code in a text editor. The software comes with
  easy-to-use concepts and allows creating, saving and reopening projects
  containing the virtual rooms. An export mechanism allows the publishing of a
  finished exhibition with one single click.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a><a href="murg-fig1.html"><img src="Murg_Figure1_thumbnail.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="320" height="256" /></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="murg-fig1.html">Fig 1: Screenshot of the user interface
  (eXhibition:editor3D)</a></p>
  <p>The application is based on Java and the Eclipse framework
  which allows for platform independence. </p>
  <p>More specifically, it is based on the Eclipse Rich Client
  Platform (RCP). This provides certain features that have been incorporated into
  the program, like on-line help and undo mechanisms. Additionally, the use of
  the Graphical Editing Framework makes it possible to create a clear user
  interface which consists of several sub-windows and tabs. The main part of the
  user interface, the drawing area, is built with this framework. The drawing
  area, along with the repository, constitutes the heart of the editor. Digital
  media (audio, images and sound files) are managed with the so-called
  repository, a special container which provides access to folders on the system,
  on the local network, or even on the Internet. From these folders the necessary
  files are chosen and managed in the content area. It is as easy as grabbing a
  file with the mouse and dragging it to the drawing area to create an object in
  the three-dimensional space of the virtual room.</p>
  <p>The object can, of course, be scaled and re-positioned at
  any time, and also the content of the object can be altered later on. This
  allows for maximum flexibility when building a virtual exhibition.</p>
  <p>In order to make objects visible, viewpoints have to be
  positioned around the room. Connecting them creates paths along which the
  visitor will navigate later. These paths can act like virtual tours. As it is
  not always advisable or feasible to allow the viewers to navigate on their own,
  the navigation can be formed entirely by the use of viewpoints. This, of
  course, gives a lot of power to the designer as the order in which the exhibits
  are met is laid down during the creation process.</p>
  <p>The use of a plug-in system guarantees a high degree of
  flexibility. Because of the modular nature of the software, future additions of
  features can be realized as plug-ins. Basically, each&nbsp; would be an additional folder in the file-system and would
  adds features to the application without the need to change anything in the
  core files. A possible use of a plug-in could be to connect the media
  management part of the editor with a content management system. </p>
  <p>During the development stage a bug-tracking tool was used to
  keep record of bugs and enhancement requests. Additionally, a wiki was set up
  to collect information about the development process in general. In order to
  keep control of various versions of the software, designers used the tool
  Subversion as a version control system. The system also allows going&nbsp; back to older versions should a bug
  destroy the current line of development. This adds a lot of security to the
  development process. When building a demo version which incorporated some
  restrictions, designers found this system of utmost importance as it allowed
  building different parallel branches of the same project.</p>
  <h1>The Virtual media.worlds</h1>
  <p>In the context of the comprehensive permanent exhibition
  &lsquo;medien.welten&rsquo; at the &lsquo;Technisches Museum Wien,&rsquo; a digital exposition is
  currently being created to extend the experience. This can be understood as a
  step towards a museum of the future. Extraordinary virtual exhibition spaces arise
   and focus on special aspects of exhibits. The digital representations are not
    meant to substitute for the original physical objects on display. They rather
    allow the visitors to experience other facets as well, facets that used to be
    inaccessible with established forms of exhibitions. The support of digital
    formats makes it possible to bring historical media exponents to life. For
    example, rotating images combine to produce a movie-like experience, and the
    pages of richly decorated books can be flipped through. The visitor can even
    listen to original sound recordings of shellacs or other historical media while
    looking at a representation of the object. </p>
  <p>Imagine the attraction of a phenakistoscope &ndash; still
    images which, put into rotation, suggest the impression of seeing a movie; or
    the animation of an early electric telegraph -&nbsp; enabling visitors to hear Morse code while watching the
    message coming in.</p>
  <p>A special treat is an animation of the mysterious encryption
    machine &lsquo;Enigma&rsquo; from the Second World War: it can be used by the museum&rsquo;s
    visitors to decode messages. This playful approach allows the audience to
    experience history hands on. </p>
  <p>Combined, these different aspects of media can provide a
    holistic view of media history.</p>
  <p>The museum of the future can present material interactively
    and with the help of multi-media without sacrificing the real exhibits.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="fig2" id="fig2"></a><a href="murg-fig2.html"><img src="Murg_Figure2_thumbnail.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="320" height="256" /></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="murg-fig2.html">Fig 2: Screenshot of the Client as used at the museum</a></p>
  <p>Additionally, visitors to the museum are able to create
    their own &lsquo;digital backpacks&rsquo;. By using a smart card which can be purchased at
    the museum&rsquo;s entrance, views can save the contents of the exhibition
    &lsquo;medien.welten&rsquo; and take material home for future reference. The smart card can
    be placed in a card reader that is incorporated at the terminals, and images
    and textual information will be stored into a database. With a unique login,
    the card can later be recognized by the system, and the data becomes available
    over an Internet connection. This concept allows visitors to revisit the parts
    of the exhibition they were most interested in.</p>
  <p>The look and feel of the user interface is modeled upon the visitor&rsquo;s
    real experience at the museum, and the structure of the exhibition is
    maintained. </p>
  <p>Basically this technology would allow the whole virtual
    museum to become available on-line for everyone. Yet the amount of data would have
    to be adapted, as current bandwidth would not suffice for the massive data
    traffic necessary.</p>
  <h1>Conclusion and Outlook</h1>
  <p>The software is capable of a wide range of uses. For
    museums, it allows realistic planning of exhibitions by providing previews of
    the various show rooms. Digital representations of real objects can be
    positioned within the available room and the exhibition designer can compare
    different layouts. The impression of wandering through the exhibition and thus
    approaching objects is realistic and helps with finding the perfect positions
    for the various items on display.</p>
  <p>In future releases, the editor will support 3D modeled
    objects as well - a virtual showroom can then consist of all the facts in
    textual form, with pictures, movies, sounds and interactive lifelike models as
    well.</p>
