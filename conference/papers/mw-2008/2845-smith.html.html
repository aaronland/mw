<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This mini-workshop explores the issue raised in my work with
    organisations such as the National Museum of Australia and the National
    Archives of Australia, the History Trust of South Australia, and my research
    into Web site usability issues. The paper is also based on a study I conducted
    for the Australian Government in 2007, in conjunction with International
    Conservation Services (<a href="http://www.icssydney.com/">http://www.icssydney.com</a>), on the Australian cultural
  and creative sectors&rsquo; technical capabilities in the digital environment. </p>
<p>The research for that project and my other work suggest that
    over the next few years we will see user expectations and behavior alter in the
  following key ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Audiences
    will expect and want to interact more and more with museums on-line.</li>
  <li>The
    sharing of information and knowledge will not be restricted to the old model
    where the staff member is the sole repository of information and where the
    communication channel was largely one-way.</li>
  <li>Visitors
    will expect museum Web sites to know/remember who they are, and to be able to
    personalize their on-line experience.</li>
  <li>Improvements
    in the speed and access to the Internet will put information, and therefore
    power, into the hands of the users.</li>
  <li>An
    increasing number of regional and remote on-line users will have access to a
    broadband connection which will make the provision of interactive features and
    content in video and audio formats more and more relevant and increasingly in
    demand.</li>
  <li>The
    domination of search engines as the means of finding information on the
    Internet will increasingly force museums to present content in a manner
    friendly to search engines. </li>
</ul>
<p>Three or so years from now, on-line interactivity will be
    more sophisticated, utilizing new high-definition transmissions and 3-D
    modeling; e.g. high-definition, interactive, live presentations featuring
  museum curators explaining objects or issues.</p>
<h1>What Influences Users&rsquo; Expectations?</h1>
<p>The expectation that users have of a museum&rsquo;s Web site will
    be influenced by a number  of factors; the degree of influence that each factor
  exerts on the user will differ from user to user. </p>
<h2>User Background Factors</h2>
<p>These factors include users&rsquo;:</p>
<ul>
  <li>level
    of experience using the Web and the Web conventions to which they have been
    exposed - to illustrate this point I will demonstrate the chief characteristics
    of successful Web sites based on our Web site Best Practice Database </li>
  <li>age,
    cultural and religious background</li>
  <li>understanding
    of the museum&rsquo;s role and purpose</li>
  <li>appreciation
    of the culture and purpose of museums and of the difference between museums and
    other cultural organisations </li>
  <li>personal
    experience as a physical visitor to the museum</li>
  <li>level
    of experience with cultural Web sites </li>
  <li>reason
    for visiting the museum&rsquo;s Web site; e.g., for research, interest or visit 
    planning </li>
  <li>level
    of understanding of the history and culture of the material presented in the
    museum</li>
  <li>speed
    and quality of access to the Internet</li>
  <li>intention
    to visit the Web site; e.g., the visit may be totally accidental. </li>
  </ul>
<p>These factors in turn influence the expectations users have
  of a number of aspects of a museum&rsquo;s Web site.</p>
<h2>Major Areas of User Expectations </h2>
<p> Chief among these are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Scope
    and depth of its content</b> - from no
    expectation to those who have visited similar Web sites and expect the same
    scope and depth. </li>
  <li><b>Accuracy
    and quality of the content</b> - researchers
    who expect the content to be absolutely accurate, complete and up-to-date to
    those who just want brief information quickly. </li>
  <li><b>Design</b> - from the expectation of those whose experience
    with museums is that of buildings stuffed with animals, to those who have
    visited the museums and expect to see the design and edifice of them reproduced
    in the Web site. </li>
  <li><b>Usability</b> - experienced Web surfers and users of museum Web
    sites expect it to be very user-friendly, whereas novice users have lower
    expectations and even blame themselves if they can&rsquo;t find content or use a
    functional element.</li>
  <li><b>Level
    of interactivity</b> - from students who have
    their own MySpace site and contribute content to YouTube, to people who have no
    expectation of interacting with Web sites.</li>
</ul>
<h1>User Habits And Behaviour</h1>
<p>On-line audiences are becoming far more Web savvy and
    demanding. They are using the Internet to book airline tickets, do their
    banking, research products and services and for social networking and gaming.
    Older age groups are becoming more at ease using on-line technologies. They are
    accessing on-line videos on entertainment and news Web sites, and audio files
    through iTunes, and having video-conferences with friends using Skype. The
    libraries offering wireless access to the Internet are finding that on closing
    their physical doors at 5.00pm, the laptop users sit outside the building to
  continue their access to the Web via the virtual front door. </p>
<p>The Internet and mobile technologies are increasingly
    important tools in the day-to-day lives of more and more people. The boundary
    of their working day is blurring due to more readily available and ever-present
    access to computers and the Internet. The &lsquo;working week&rsquo; is stretching across
    the whole week and across the day. More and more people are working from home
  and operating from home offices.</p>
<p>People are increasingly more impatient users of technology;
    less in awe of it and more likely to provide informed criticism when it is not
    easy to use. If it is not on-line, they are less likely to access the
    information, product or service. In addition, there is an expectation that they
    will be able to conduct business on-line, such as purchasing a concert ticket,
  whenever it suits them.</p>
<p>The number of hours people are spending on-line is
    increasing while the number of hours they spend watching free-to-air television
  is declining. </p>
<p>The cultural and creative sector is affected by this trend
    as much as any other sector in the economy. Simply providing a Web site with
    text and images is fast becoming a liability, as the informed and expectant
    on-line audiences search for information and objects, download podcasts and
    videos, book tickets, participate in social networks and register for
  e-newsletters.</p>
<p>Whereas once on-line audiences would accept without question
    whatever was delivered to them on-line by cultural and creative organisations,
    they are now demanding and discerning users with their own agendas and with heightened
    expectations, borne of experiencing the on-line offerings of global
  entertainment companies.</p>
<h1>User-Generated Content</a></h1>
<p>There is an increasing demand by users for interaction with
    cultural and creative content rather than passive reading of a Web page. For
    museums, this may mean providing functions in the long term such as user
    commentary on content, allowing users to create and curate their own
    exhibitions, enabling users to tag content, and providing an &lsquo;ask an expert&rsquo;
  functionality. </p>
<p>The enormous popularity of sites such as MySpace, Flickr,
    YouTube and Second Life points to users&rsquo; desire to generate their own cultural
    and creative content. It also challenges what we understand to be cultural and
    creative on-line content. Up to now, it has been understood, implicitly if not
    explicitly, to be content generated by professionals employed by cultural
    organisations. The rise of user-generated content challenges this
    understanding, as does the popularity of Wikipedia. As a result, the position
  and role of researchers and curators in the on-line environment is changing. </p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s consumers of cultural content are not willing
    passive recipients of content chosen for them by others. They can create and
    are creating their own content. The under-twenty generation is less afraid than
    older age groups to create content and show it to the world. Their members seem
    less inhibited by creative and intellectual modesty and more relaxed about
  sharing their creativity. </p>
<p>Creative content born in these on-line spaces is considered
    temporary. Its creators are more relaxed about the shelf-life of their creative
    output and more likely to discard it themselves as they move on to something
    new. This approach is in stark contrast to the way in which professionals in
    the cultural and creative sector have been trained to  conduct their work.
    Indeed, government owned organisations in the sector are subject to various
    laws that require them to preserve and archive certain information and
  transactions. </p>
<p>Social media have redefined the famous notion that everyone
  gets fifteen minutes of fame: it is now closer to fifteen weeks. </p>
<p>Organisations in the cultural and creative sector need to
    provide the necessary on-line tools and support for social media, and embrace
    its interactive philosophy, if they are to remain relevant in the digital
    environment. For museums, this means considering ways users can generate and
    publish content on the site and ways museums can support their  associate
  organisations in doing so. </p>
<h1>The Google Factor</h1>
<p>Nielsen NetRatings
    (<a href="http://www.netratings.com/">http://www.netratings.com/</a>) reported that Google was the most visited Web site
    in the USA and UK in the week ending 14 January, as it was in Australia in
    December 2007. Yahoo was not far behind it. For museums, this means they must
    ensure their Web site content ranks highly in search engine results or they
    will be bypassed by users. The ranking needs to be high on the first
    results, as research indicates that 97% of users only look at the first search
    engine results page, and only 47% of those  scrolled to the bottom of the page
  (Nielsen, 2006). </p>
<p>This requires content authors to consider the way in which
    Google ranks pages when they compose on-line content, and it requires the Web
    site to be optimised for visibility to search engines. Neither of these considerations
    is always at the forefront of curators&rsquo; minds when composing content for
  exhibitions.</p>
<p>The Museum of Victoria, Australia, has reported that only
    five percent of its on-line visitors entered its Web site via the home page.
    Most of their virtual visitors came through a link found in a Google search.
    This percentage would be repeated in most major cultural organisations in
    Australia and elsewhere. If an organisation&rsquo;s on-line content is to be found
    via Google, then it must be structured, written and presented in a manner that
  maximises its visibility to Google. </p>
<p>The rewards for achieving a high ranking on Google are high.
    The Australian War Memorial ensured its Web site was Google-friendly; the
    result was a ten-fold increase in visitation to the Web site. The Powerhouse
    Museum in Sydney achieved similar success by heeding the way Google ranks Web
  pages.</p>
<p>Google is changing the way people think about information
    and search for information on-line. Users are increasingly searching for a
    phrase rather than a single word. They are asking Google the question, as they
    once did of the librarian. This trend will grow as Google&rsquo;s search technique
    becomes even more sophisticated. This will make the need for cultural
  organisations to be Google-friendly even more compelling. </p>
<h1>Social Networking</h1>
<p>This conference will feature many presentations on social
    networking in the museum on-line world. Suffice it to say here then, that the
    increasing take-up of social media and of social networking on-line (e.g.
    MySpace, FaceBook) creates an expectation amongst some in the target audience
    (e.g. students) that a Web site will be a many-to-many interactive space, not a
  one-to-many space. </p>
<p>For museums, this means providing on-line tools that allow
    and encourage interaction between the user and museums and between
    users/visitors; e.g., they facilitate interaction between school groups that
  have visited a museum, and the museum itself. </p>
<p>It also means having appropriately trained staff with the
  resources and time to attend to sustaining a growing the social network.</p>
<h1>Users&rsquo; Improved Access To The Web </h1>
<p>The variety of methods by which people access the Internet
    is increasing (e.g., via wireless connectivity in cities), as are the
    technologies by which they experience Web site content - laptops, PDAs, mobile
  phones and MP3 players. </p>
<p>The National Archives of Australia report that by mid-2007
    they were logging up to 800 mobile phone accesses of their Web site per month.
    If a museum is to cater to its audiences and their needs and expectations, it
    needs to consider providing content in multiple formats or specifically for a
  format that suits the nature of the content; e.g., a podcast or RSS feed.</p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>A museum that fails to ascertain and monitor the habits,
    preferences and requirements of its on-line audiences and fails to meet those
    expectations will ultimately lose audiences, and in this digital environment,
  will most likely fail to fulfill its mission. </p>
