        <p class="AbstractText">The Living Museum&reg; is an on-line application and
    curriculum that enables students and teachers in Jewish schools to create
    virtual exhibitions of artifacts that represent their individual and collective
    Jewish heritage. Our site went live a year ago, and now that we have posted
    on-line exhibitions from a number of schools, several challenges have emerged
    with the quality of our user-generated content. For example, how do we support
    students to write thorough and thoughtful artifact descriptions? What sort of
    mechanisms will both encourage and enable teachers to review and edit student
    submissions? How do we ensure that students and teachers submit quality
    photographs that meet the high standards visitors expect from on-line museums?
    How do we manage staff resources invested in reviewing and editing user
    submitted content?</p>
        <p class="AbstractText">Our initial questions raised new questions: How rigorous
    should the Museum&rsquo;s review process be? What standards should we maintain? How
    do we communicate these standards? What do we do when we receive an exhibition
    that does not live up to our educational standards? </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">This paper presents the Living Museum&rsquo;s
    on-line protocols and the instructional module we built to support the creation
    of quality exhibitions. We discuss how demonstrating high expectations, sharing

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>About a year ago, staff of the Education Department at the
        Museum of Jewish Heritage &ndash; A Living Memorial to the Holocaust (the
        &quot;Museum&quot;) held an intensive three-day training session for teachers
        in Jewish schools on how to use its Living Museum Web site and curriculum. The
        Living Museum is an in-class and on-line curriculum for fifth and sixth grade
        students in Jewish schools. Through this curriculum children examine their
        Jewish heritage through the study of family heirlooms. They create on-line and
      in-school exhibitions of artifacts that represent their families' Jewish experience. </p>
      <p>The training seemed to go well and the teachers appeared to
        understand the  Web site (Berman Center for Research and Evaluation in Jewish
        Education, 2007). During the seminar we talked at length about the educational
        value for students to create complete, grammatically correct, and stylistically
        consistent artifact labels for inclusion in the exhibition. We discussed how
        important it was for teachers to thoroughly review the students&rsquo; work.
        Additionally, we showed the teachers where they could find criteria for
        creating quality exhibitions in our on-line Teacher&rsquo;s Guide, and we spoke about
        how they could revise and comment on their students&rsquo; work in order to get the
      best quality results. </p>
      <p>In an internal survey, the teachers wrote that they
        understood the process of creating an exhibition and they felt ready to work
        with their students to post their efforts on-line (Berman Center for Research
        and Evaluation in Jewish Education, 2007). However, when the teachers submitted
        their exhibitions for review, we were largely disappointed with the quality of
        their work. One teacher submitted an exhibition that was full of egregious
        grammatical mistakes. Two teachers submitted their exhibitions several months
        after they intended to finish them, and one of these exhibitions included many
        incomplete artifact labels. We were left wondering what happened and how we
      could improve the quality of Living Museum exhibitions in the future.</p>
      <h1>Living Museum Background </h1>
      <p>In order to explore our dilemma, we must explain more about
        the Living Museum. In December 2005, the Museum received a grant from the
        Covenant Foundation to support expanding what had been a local program to a
        national one. The Museum and Dr. Karen Shawn of the Moriah School collaborated
        on an early version of the Living Museum for Moriah's Heritage Fair. Following
        this initial partnership, the Museum developed a Living Museum tour for
        students in Jewish middle schools. Generous funding from the Covenant
        Foundation allowed us to build the Living Museum Web site and reach out to
        bring out-of-state teachers to the Museum to learn how to implement the Living
        Museum curriculum in their classrooms. One important goal of the expansion of
        the Living Museum is to serve students in remotely-located Jewish communities,
        particularly those that do not have access to a local Jewish museum or many
      resources for learning about their heritage. </p>
      <p>The following is a basic outline of the Living Museum.
        Students visit a local museum where they learn about artifacts and observe how
        a museum is organized. Afterward, the students return to their classroom where
        they learn about the components of an artifact label. With the help of their
        parents, students choose an artifact from home to research. This artifact
        should be one that represents their family history and heritage. In class,
        students write their own artifact labels based on the research they did with
        family members, and their objects are photographed. After the students&rsquo;
        artifact labels are reviewed by their teacher, the class works together to
        create a list of galleries (thematic groups) into which their artifacts could
        be placed. Then as a class they decide in which galleries their artifacts will
        be placed. The students with artifacts in a particular gallery collaborate to
        write a gallery text panel, which describes the themes of the artifacts in that
      gallery. The class then creates a title and an introduction to the exhibition. </p>
      <p>Once a class has finished creating artifacts, galleries, and
        an introduction to the exhibition, the teacher and students create their
        on-line exhibition. First, the teacher uploads the introduction and creates the
        on-line galleries which constitute the framework of the exhibition. Then the
        students login and add their artifact images and label text to the appropriate
        galleries. Next, the teacher edits, accepts or returns the students&rsquo; artifact
        labels. Once all students have completed their artifact labels to the teacher's
        satisfaction, the teacher submits the exhibition to Museum staff for review and
        publication on-line. Additionally, the class creates an in-school exhibition in
        which the artifacts are displayed, and parents, teachers, and other classes are
        invited to view the students&rsquo; artifacts, labels, and galleries, and hear about
      the exhibition from the students themselves. </p>

      <p>There are several educational and institutional goals for
        this project. The educational goals include helping students understand their
        place in Jewish history; learning about museums and the ways they are
        organized; providing opportunities for improving writing and categorization
        skills; involving parents in their child&rsquo;s Jewish education; and posting
        exhibitions that are relatively consistent in structure so that together they
        form a cohesive on-line museum. Institutional goals (the goals of the Museum)
        include expanding a successful local program into a national one through an
        on-line Web site; providing resources and lessons for teachers in Jewish
        communities across the country who might not have access to many resources for
        teaching and learning about Jewish heritage and history; and positively and
        fairly representing the Museum, students, and teachers who have contributed to
        the Living Museum while keeping the safety and privacy of the students
      paramount.</p>
      <h1>User-Generated Content</h1>
      <p>Many of the most visited  Web sites today feature extensive
        user-generated content. These  Web sites include Wikipedia (<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">http://www.wikipedia.org/</a>), YouTube (<a href="http://youtube.com/">http://youtube.com/</a>), and Facebook (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/">http://www.facebook.com</a>). The accuracy, originality,
      and value of the user-generated content on these  Web sites vary.</p>
      <p>The current trend in popular  Web sites that feature
        user-generated content is the publication of material that is not subject to an
        initial review process. Generally, users are given the task of deciding whether
        or not content merits viewing. On  Web sites like YouTube and Facebook, content
        is typically taken off these Web sites only if it is violent, graphic, or
        offensive or if it breaks copyright. On other Web sites like Wikipedia, the
      content is modified by the public with limited input from the original author. </p>
      <p>Our Web site runs contrary to this trend. We exert a degree
      of control over the content for several reasons, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The
        Web site is dedicated to meeting our educational goals </li>
      <li>We
        have very specific users and a very specific audience </li>
      <li>The
        content is written primarily by children </li>
      <li>The
        content is personal and should not be subject to public commentary posted by
        users</li>
      <li>The
        user-generated content should not be modifiable by the general public </li>
    </ul>
      <p>The Internet is a vast resource, and there is a demand for
        both Web sites that accept most user-generated content, like Wikipedia, YouTube
        and Facebook, and Web sites that regulate the content that users submit before
        it is posted, like the Living Museum. Both types of Web sites serve a purpose.
        Web sites that accept most user-generated content encourage creativity and may
        allow users to share their work with the public at all stages of development.
        The stricter rules of the Living Museum Web site serve a different purpose: to
        ensure a successful educational outcome for the participating students,
      classes, and visitors.</p>
      <h1>Clarifying Educational and Institutional Goals </h1>
      <p>One of the most important educational goals of the Living
        Museum is to motivate students to learn about their Jewish heritage. We have
        employed several strategies to meet this goal. To encourage the creation of
        exhibitions that reflect students&rsquo; Jewish heritage, we must first ensure that
        students and teachers are the sole contributors to our Web site. Although
        anyone is welcome to view the exhibitions, only approved users may contribute.
        Consequently, we carefully monitor whom we allow to register as users on the
        Web site. This strict registration process is meant to prevent disappointment
        in other visitors who might otherwise go through the work of completing the
        project, only to find themselves unable to post their exhibitions. Although we
        currently limit use of the Web site to classes in Jewish schools, we are
        considering the possibility of allowing other schools, interfaith groups, and
        community groups to post their exhibitions in a future version of the Living
      Museum Web site. </p>
      <p>Another goal of the Living Museum is to involve parents in
        their child&rsquo;s religious school education. Parents and families of the students
        are encouraged to work with their child to choose an artifact that is related
        both to the history of their family and their Jewish heritage. We have seen
        that because of the personal nature of these artifacts, parents tend to become
      involved in this project. </p>
      <p>Another objective is ensuring that the artifacts on display
        have a connection to Judaism or Jewish life. This may raise questions of
        interpretation for the teachers and students. Many students have family
        backgrounds that are not solely Jewish. Other students come from secular Jewish
        households. Still other families may have few heirlooms, because, for example,
        they recently immigrated to the United States or Canada and may not have been
        able to bring many objects with them. Our solution is that the artifacts  students choose do
        not have to be religious objects, such as a prayer book or a Passover Seder
        plate; they may also be common objects that tell a Jewish story. For example, a
        pair of sewing scissors can tell the story of a Jewish family that moved to the
        southern United States and opened a custom drapery business which flourished
      during a time when there was rampant anti-Semitism in the area.</p>
      <p>Providing opportunities for improving writing and research
        skills is an important aim of the Living Museum. For this reason, Living Museum
        artifact labels are longer than traditional museum artifact labels. We ask
        students to create labels which contain a title, the dimensions of the
        artifact, materials, place of origin, approximate date the artifact was made,
        and the artifact &ldquo;donor&rsquo;s&rdquo; name. Most importantly, we ask the students to tell
        the story of the artifact, as well as show the significance of the artifact to
        the student&rsquo;s family and Jewish heritage. The label should articulate these
        connections as completely as possible and should be free of spelling, grammar,
      and factual errors. </p>
      <p>Another goal of the Living Museum is for the students to
        learn how a museum is organized. This is accomplished by having the students
        arrange their artifacts into galleries and organize those galleries into an
        exhibition. The gallery is the critical organizational device of a museum. The
        content of the galleries, how they are introduced, and even the way they are
      arranged will transform a group of artifacts into a coherent story. </p>
      <p>A part of the Teacher&rsquo;s Guide that requires special comment
        is the section on creating and uploading images. Web sites with clear, crisp
        images draw in visitors. Therefore, we have written and video tutorials which
        show teachers and students how to photograph objects with digital cameras and
        how to crop, sharpen and enhance the images on Google&rsquo;s Picasa (<a
href="http://picasa.google.com/">http://picasa.google.com</a>). From anecdotal
        evidence we believe that our tutorials are encouraging teachers to work harder
        on the photographs than they would ordinarily. However, we feel the photographs
        on our Web site could be more inviting. Therefore, we are thinking about ways
        to encourage our users to take better photographs, and are considering
        different tools to allow them to edit their photographs more easily. Displaying
        high quality photographs on the Living Museum accomplishes the goals of
        representing the schools and the Museum well and providing a fairly consistent
      level of quality throughout the Web site. </p>
      <p>Another important institutional consideration is protecting
        the privacy of students who use the  Web site. Accordingly, we ask teachers and
        students not to include photographs of students in their exhibition. We also
        ask that students use only their last initial rather than their full last name
      in their artifact labels.</p>
      <p>After laying out what is expected of teachers, the Living
        Museum staff needed to discuss how far we were willing to go to ensure that our
        educational and institution goals were met. We weighed the value of publishing
        high quality exhibitions against a desire to publish every student's submission
        as an acknowledgement of the real, if sometimes flawed, work that the student
        completed. We also discussed how much time and effort we can expect of busy
        teachers before they become unwilling or unable to carry out the Living Museum
        project. Additionally, we talked about what our policy would be on
        controversial material, and we discussed the amount of staff time we were
      willing to dedicate to reviewing and editing exhibitions.</p>
      <h1>Ensuring Achievement of Educational and Institutional Goals</h1>
      <p>Part of our conversation focused on how we can support
        teachers, students, and parents to ensure that our educational and
        institutional goals are achieved. The Living Museum  Web site has instructional
        materials for students and parents, but the primary instructional module on the
        Living Museum Web site is the Teacher&rsquo;s Guide. It includes detailed written
        instructions and twelve short videos explaining how teachers can implement the
        curriculum in the classroom, and demonstrates how they can complete the
      technical aspects of the Living Museum. </p>
      <p>We provide guidelines for choosing artifacts, but we leave
        it up to the teachers and the students to decide whether or not an artifact is
        acceptable for on-line display. As long as the artifacts do not disparage any
        person or group, nor contain text that is under copyright, we will not ask the
        teacher to remove an artifact. This issue came to our attention after we
        received a controversial artifact label which led to a lengthy internal debate,
        after which we decided to allow the label to be published because it reflects
        the thoughts and opinions of the child who created it. The artifact label in
        question was considered potentially controversial because it was critical of a
      government's policy. </p>
      <p>We have frequently found that exhibitions submitted for
        publication include artifacts that have no relation to Judaism or Jewish
        heritage. Although the Living Museum specifically posts exhibitions built
        around the theme of Jewish heritage, we have published exhibitions that contain
        artifacts where the connection to Judaism was not explicitly stated or even
        alluded to. Our decision to include these artifacts was based on the fact that
        the exhibition contained a majority of artifacts that  told Jewish stories.
        We made the decision to allow a small number of artifacts that did not have an
        explicit Jewish story because we do not want to exclude children by rejecting
        their artifacts. On the other hand, if a submitted exhibition contained a
        predominant  number of artifacts that did not reflect Jewish heritage, we would
      have to revisit this issue. Thus far, this has not occurred.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="Farber_Fig4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="400" height="268" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 4: Artifact label unrelated to the theme of Jewish
        heritage <a
href="http://living-museum.org/index.php?option=com_nex&amp;task=sectionitemview&amp;Itemid=38&amp;nx_pageid=1056&amp;nx_itemid=941">http://living-museum.org/index.php?option=com_nex&amp;task=sectionitemview<br />
      &amp;Itemid=38&amp;nx_pageid=1056&amp;nx_itemid=941</a></p>
      <p>Another issue is the submission of exhibitions which contain
        errors in spelling and grammar. If an exhibition has minimal grammar and
        spelling errors, Living Museum staff will correct the errors and will post the
        exhibition on-line. If the exhibition has numerous errors which would take our
        staff many hours to correct, we return the exhibition to the teacher and
        suggest another adult review the exhibition before resubmitting it. We plan to
        add a spell check feature to our  Web site to minimize the amount of teacher
      and staff time spent reviewing. </p>
      <p>It is not possible for us to devote enough staff time to
        ensure that each artifact label is totally accurate; however, if we believe
        there is a factual error in a particular artifact label, we e-mail the teacher
        to request verification of accuracy. In one case, we received an artifact where
        a student listed the materials of <em>tefillin</em> (ritual objects worn by religious
        Jewish men when they pray) as cardboard and paper. Since <em>tefillin</em> are
        traditionally made from leather and parchment, we asked the teacher to confirm
      the student&rsquo;s description or to correct it.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that we review exhibitions to check
        that there have been no breaches of children&rsquo;s privacy. We check that students
        identify themselves with only their first names and last initials. If an
        artifact is submitted with a student&rsquo;s last name, or with the last name of
        someone in the family, we change the entry so only the last initial of the
        student is used. We allow exceptions only if the last name is necessary to the
        story of the artifact. For example, if the artifact is a change
        of name certificate that a child&rsquo;s grandfather received when he changed his
        name to make it seem &ldquo;more American&rdquo; upon immigration to the U.S., we would
        allow the child to leave the grandfather&rsquo;s last name in the text if it was
        different from the child&rsquo;s last name. In another measure to protect privacy, we
        do not allow photographs of the students to be posted on-line. If an exhibition
        contains a picture of a student, we return the exhibition to the teacher and
      request that the picture be replaced.</p>
      <p>Despite the numerous instructions, guidelines and worksheets
        we have put in place to facilitate the production of what we consider
        appropriate artifact labels, we have nonetheless received many artifact labels
        which fail to include a depth of information that meets our desired standards.
        In these instances, we weigh the number of problematic labels in a given
        exhibition against requiring a class to re-do its exhibition and the likelihood
        that the class would not re-submit their exhibition. Nonetheless, if the
        majority of the artifacts in the exhibition are incomplete, we return the
        exhibition to the teacher with a request to have the artifact labels developed
        more fully. To ensure the production of fuller labels in the future, we plan to
        put more required fields on the form that students fill out in order to submit their
        artifacts. We also plan to state our criteria for acceptable exhibitions more
      explicitly. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="Farber_Fig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="400" height="269" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 5: Incomplete artifact label <a
href="http://living-museum.org/index.php?option=com_nex&amp;task=sectionitemview&amp;Itemid=38&amp;nx_pageid=1055&amp;nx_itemid=664">http://living-museum.org/index.php?option=com_nex&amp;task=sectionitemview &amp;Itemid=38&amp;nx_pageid=1055&amp;nx_itemid=664</a></p>
      <p>One of the more challenging tasks in creating a Living Museum
        exhibition is drafting the introductory text panels for the galleries. These
        text panels present the unifying theme for the artifacts in the galleries, and
        they are often the product of a fair amount of group work by the students.
        Consequently, we refrain from making significant changes to the gallery text
        panels, and generally only correct for spelling and grammar. The only exception
        is a gallery which contains only one artifact, which means that the gallery
        fails to meet our goal that exhibitions be consistent, and artifacts be divided
        into meaningful galleries. Here we recommend to the teacher that this artifact
        be included in another gallery, or that more artifacts be added to the gallery.
        To counteract this possibility, in our Teacher&rsquo;s Guide we added a recommendation that each gallery contain
      at minimum three artifacts.</p>
      <p>The inclusion of clear photographs is also a goal of this
        project, and accordingly we check the photographs when exhibitions are
        submitted. In general, we do not comment on the photographs because they are
        difficult for teachers to re-take. However, we do intervene in cases where the
      artifact is absolutely impossible to decipher. </p>
      <p>We discussed how we evaluate exhibitions above, but how do
        we decide whether an exhibition will be accepted, revised or returned for
        revision? A high-quality exhibition contains artifacts that reflect Jewish
        heritage and/or experience, has well-developed labels, correct spelling and
        grammar, accurate content, clear photographs of artifacts, and no photographs
        or last names of students. Exhibitions meeting these expectations are easily
        accepted. So far, very few of the exhibitions that have been submitted fall
        into this category. But most exhibitions are acceptable with revisions made or
      suggested by Living Museum staff. </p>
      <p>Exhibitions that are returned to the teacher for revision
        have a majority of incomplete artifact labels, a significant portion of
        artifacts are not related to Jewish heritage, a substantial number of spelling,
        grammatical errors, or content errors, or photographs of students. It should be
        noted that we rarely return exhibitions. In the one case where we did not
        accept an exhibition, the teacher did not modify the exhibition and it remains
      unpublished.</p>
      <p>Another common problem we have found is that teachers
        underestimate the time and effort involved in putting together an exhibition.
        In the beginning of the Teacher&rsquo;s Guide, we inform teachers about how much time
        and energy this project will require while trying not to discourage them from
        undertaking the project. Despite posting these expectations, we have found that
        teachers consistently underestimate the amount of time and effort it takes to
        complete this project. To remedy this ongoing problem we plan to include this
        information in the email teachers receive when their registration is approved
      so they can set realistic timelines before they begin.</p>
      <p>We continue to work on the Living Museum Web site in order
        to put mechanisms in place that will facilitate the development of quality
        user-generated content. Because of this, we have not widely promoted the
        project, and most of the teachers presently using the site are teachers we 
        trained to do the Living Museum in an on-site seminar that is part of our
        Covenant Foundation funded pilot project. There are usually fewer than six
        classes working on the  Web site at a given time. With such a small number of
        current users, we have had not encountered difficulty dedicating staff
        resources to answer questions from teachers or to review exhibitions. Most exhibitions
        are assessed and posted on-line in less than one week, though we anticipate a
      longer review process for larger exhibitions. </p>
      <p>The average exhibition on our  Web site contains twenty-one
        artifacts. Once the pilot stage has ended, we will include a message on our Web
      site notifying potential users that:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Exhibitions containing fewer than 25 artifacts will be
        processed within one week. Exhibitions containing between 25 and 75 artifacts
        will be processed within two weeks. For exhibitions containing more than 75
        artifacts please contact us before beginning the Living Museum to ensure that
      we can dedicate staff time to review your exhibitions.</p>
      <p>We may also re-evaluate our standards as our site grows
        larger; we want to keep review time short so as not to discourage teachers from
      doing the project.</p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>To
          guarantee that both participating schools and the Museum that created the Web
          site are represented well, we have established a set of minimum requirements
        which must be met to have an exhibition posted on-line.  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The majority of the artifacts must relate to the topic of the exhibition, in
        this case, Jewish heritage. </li>
        <li>Artifact
          labels should be free of grammar and spelling errors. </li>
        <li>Artifact
        labels must contain no egregious factual errors. </li>
        <li>The
        viewer should be able to decipher the object in a photograph. </li>
        <li>Student
          privacy must be protected. Therefore, no photographs of students may be posted
        and no last names of students may be used. </li>
        <li>We aim for organizational consistency between exhibitions.
          Therefore, the majority of artifacts in an exhibition must be complete and the
          artifacts must be divided into galleries, each  containing more than one
          artifact. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We continue to think about how to facilitate the production
        of quality user-generated content without overwhelming the user with rules and
        time-consuming procedures. We strive to encourage teachers, and through them,
        students, to devote ample time to creating their exhibitions. The greater our
        success in conveying the value of the Living Museum's educational goals, the
      better our Web site will be. </p>
