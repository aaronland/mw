      <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="AbstractText">Despite the relative ease of implementing Web 2.0
        technologies, a wide range of issues need to be addressed at the start of a project,
        such as security, in-house or out-of-house software application management,
        whether or not to monitor user-generated content (and if so, how) and
        assessment. Identifying different initiatives, tools and processes as well as
        reviewing select learning theories can assist museum professionals to create
        new collaborations that improve our best practices as well as to create new
        forms of museum content that engage and enhance visitors&rsquo; experiences.</p>
      <p class="keywords">Keywords: Web 2.0, social networking, collaboration, education,
        visitors experience, user created content</p>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>At the 1997 Museums and the Web conference, I presented a
        paper titled &ldquo;Contextual Links and Non-linear Narrative: A Virtual Rashomon&rdquo;.
        The paper described a project I was developing to enable cultural institutions
        to create Web sites about stories of their community members and link those
        stories at their overlap with the stories of other communities at other
        cultural institutions. The basis of this project was to create a virtual
        neighborhood similar to the real one that I had grown up in. It seemed like a
        relatively easy project to develop, but the reality was that <i>Virtual Kitchen
        Stories</i> was very labor-intensive, and
        difficult to coordinate; it also required a lot of Web production skills (both
        technology and design) and a high level of institutional commitment to access
        limited resources. </p>
      <p>At that time I was not aware that I thinking about social
        networking, along with looking for tools to facilitate user-generated Web
        content. But since then, Web 2.0 has developed sufficiently that at the closing
        plenary of the 2005 Museums on the Web, David Bearman presented a substantial
        list of Web 2.0 tools to the conference. Bearman challenged the participants to
        use these tools &ldquo;to envision and build a community of museum professionals&rdquo;. </p>
      <p>Bearman&rsquo;s list illustrated several important principles
        associated with social networking: the Web is awash with tools and processes
        that can inspire and more fully engage users to interact and learn; content is
        core in being able to make the Web a participatory experience; collaboration is
        relatively easy and requires no special technical abilities or skills, only
        imagination and creativity; and finally, if you can think it, you can do it. </p>
      <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p>The list of Web 2.0 tools has grown exponentially since then
        as new tools seem to be developed daily. Some of these Web destinations are
        Wikipedia (and other wikis), Facebook, Myspace, Second Life, Blogger,
        del.icio.us, flickr, Wordpress, yackpack, gong, zotero, Gcast and talkshoe.
        These tools represent a multitude of methods that can be employed to enable
        users to share content, collaborate, communicate, and create. But this wide
        selection of technology tools has also created a new problem. Rather than
        simply identifying technology tools, new media professionals need to really
        imagine and identify a project&rsquo;s mission and goals before searching and
        selecting appropriate technology.</p>
      <p>A second important issue needing to be addressed reflects
        the allure of Web 2.0, user-generated content and social networking as well as
        one of the major challenges of working in this medium. New media content
        creators are faced with the dilemma that they need to relinquish some of their
        control over Web content. The strength of the tools is also a source of
        contention because anybody and everybody can create and publish content, with
        no regard to quality or accuracy. As professionals, we all understand the
        necessity of being the content editors and designers for our Web sites, and we
        strive to ensure that the quality of the virtual presence reflects the quality,
        mission and goals of the practical environments. But Web visitors are also Web
        producers and often have other agendas. They can and will post what they want,
        where they want and when they want; this can cause the most honest and benign
        of content to be suspect. Yet this can also be beneficial to the museum
        community as it can allow us to begin to think about how can we tap into this
        creative energy and use it to our advantage, to engage Web visitors, promote
        institutions and build our community. </p>
      <h1>Theories and Theorists 101</h1>
      <p>Guidance, inspiration and answers to these issues can be
        found by reviewing several learning theories about creativity and then
        determining practical applications for these theories. The work of Seymour
        Papert, Howard Gardner, Rodger Schenk and Sir Kenneth Robinson can all be
        directly applied to the challenges museum professionals face when contemplating
        how to harness Web 2.0 to enhance our community. </p>
      <p>In <em>The Children&rsquo;s Machine</em>, Seymour Papert describes how
        groups of learners of any age come together and form communities of learners.
        These communities are not limited only to traditional schools; they can be seen
        in Brazilian samba academies, Chinese kung-fu schools and Jewish Yeshivas.
        Papert provides examples illustrating that there are no limits to defining what
        students are, other than individuals who possess the desire to learn and
        participate. Novices are taught by the experienced and will later pass on the
        knowledge and skills gained to other novices who are not geographically bound.</p>
      <p>Promoting the theory of multiple intelligences, Howard
        Gardner describes nine separate human faculties that &ldquo;process information that
        can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems create products that
        are of value in a culture&rdquo; (Gardner, 1999, pp.13-4). He continues that
        &ldquo;[p]eople have a wide range of capacities. Person&rsquo;s strength in one area of
        performance simply does not predict any comparable strengths in other areas.&rdquo;
        (p. 31). In essence, Gardner argues that different individuals have different
        strengths and methods of understanding events and the world that surrounds
        them, and as well&nbsp; possess&nbsp; different modalities for communicating
        this understanding. Another way of expressing this is to say that some people
        &ldquo;get&rdquo; math, some &ldquo;get&rdquo; art, some &ldquo;get&rdquo; music and so on. Their understandings
        come from the individual narratives that they construct to develop their
        intelligence. Those who speak art will create visual narratives that are art
        related; those who speak chemistry will construct narratives that are chemistry
        related.</p>
      <p>In <em>Narrative and Intelligence</em> Robert Schank describes how
        individuals create their own stories and narratives to help them learn and
        remember. Sometimes these stories directly relate to a subject, as when a
        person can place himself or herself into the content, such as identifying with
        a specific location that one has visited when learning about geography. Yet
        narratives can also be softer and more creative. For example, a person can
        remember hard facts by creating a personal narrative about the time and place
        that they were originally presented and learned. Then later, when the need
        arises to use these facts, the learner recollects their personal narrative
        about actually learning them. Schenk writes: &quot;We have difficulty
        remembering such abstractions, but we can more easily remember a good story. Stories give life to past experience&quot; (p.10). Using and understanding
        these life events to construct personal narratives and stories will assist
        individuals to learn, understand and enrich&nbsp;their lives.</p>
      <p>Sir Kenneth Robinson eloquently states that we are in the
        midst of a paradigm shift in our approach to learning because of the increasing
        complexity of human society, caused in part by the intersection of culture,
        technology and communication. Many models of learning and education were
        developed in the previous 200 years in response to the industrial revolution
        but are rapidly losing their relevance. The current information revolution
        requires the development of models that encourage creative and critical
        thinking and problem solving. </p>
      <p>Accepting the assumptions of Papert, Gardner, Schenk and
        Robinson, it is relatively safe to assume that within any group, there will be
        differences in how information is processed, how problems are solved and how
        projects are created. One of the most important experiences that art, science,
        historical or cultural museums can provide is to construct spaces (both virtual
        and practical) that allow and encourage visitors to create their own personal
        narratives that best reflect their own individual learning styles and
        intelligences. The importance of this process cannot be underestimated. Many
        times people cannot remember straight data, but will remember the same data if
        there is a story involved. </p>
      <p>The creation of personal narratives that promote individual
        styles of learning is one of the most powerful byproducts of using technology
        and social networking tools. These tools and Web destinations use real time
        reflections, lessons, exhibitions or other learning experiences to produce rich
        personal narratives that encourage individual users both to discover their own
        vision and method of communicating, as well as to share that vision with others</p>
      <p>By integrating these four related theories into practical
        applications, museum professionals can create new initiatives for collaboration
        and outreach. Web 2.0 tools help museums find innovative ways to share
        resources with minimum investment and maximum return. Empowering individuals to
        create and share their narratives fosters a greater involvement in museums by
        the global community and can only assist us as museum professionals to continue
        creatively do our work. </p>
      <h1>Practical Applications</h1>
      <p>Understanding the underlying issues and theories is
        important, but essentially is empty if we cannot allow ourselves to cultivate
        and promote practical applications. And although changes in technology seem to
        happen at the speed of light, the natural tension created by the generally slow
        tempo of the museum world can work to the benefit of the museum community. A
        wide selection and variety of Web 2.0 tools are available, accessible and
        relatively easy to use and maintain. This means that the reality of creating
        practical solutions using Web 2.0 applications is now truly limited only by the
        imagination of the developer (and in some cases, also the user). </p>
      <p>We need only to look at the Web to see how new applications
        are being used. The evidence shows that if a tool is made, people will use it,
        even if not for the original purpose. The explosive growth of Facebook, YouTube
        and a multitude of other applications illustrates the creativity of the users
        and is something that we can emulate. For example, blogs can be used to pose
        the type of questions that stimulate individual reflection and learning. Wikis
        promote collaborations with visitors and with other museum professionals. Other
        resources include video and audio capture tools that put the creation of
        multi-media into the hands of the users, and open- source applications
        permit&nbsp; user-generated virtual
        exhibitions. </p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>It is clear that tools and processes associated with Web 2.0
        can cause a radical shift in the development and control of Web content.
        Professionals can (and should) design content for their institutions using the
        standards and best practices of our community. But users are also joining the
        act by making content that speaks more directly to them. Continuing to engage
        users as we already know how to do, as well as learning to include them in the
        process, can only strengthen the museum community. These processes promote
        creativity and collaboration in news ways that are people friendly, extremely
        cost-effective, and minimally demanding technically. These Web destinations,
        once created, can more fully engage visitors, promote the mission and goals of
        museums, and provide locations where the professional, popular and scholarly
        can truly co-exist and complement each other in unexpected ways.</p>
