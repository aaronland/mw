    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>We started with the following questions: How can
        creolization processes be represented, performed, visualized? How can slavery, <i>engagisme</i> and colonialism be shown? How can the physical,
        human, economic and political constraints that shaped the island of R&eacute;union and
        its inhabitants be staged? How can a culture arisen from constant contributions
        of waves of voluntary or forced migrations to a territory where there was no
        first, pre-colonial culture be visualized? How can the struggle against a
        colonial system backed by despotism, brutality, force and contempt, be told?
        That is, what visual forms are there for showing the life and cultural
        practices of a slave, a maroon, a freedman, a master, an engag&eacute;? What visual
        forms are there for representing the everyday life of a small planter, a
        docker, a washerwoman, a female civil servant&hellip;? What is a museum without
        &ldquo;objects&rdquo;? What is the status of the immaterial archive in a world of colonial
        archives? These questions framed our reflection, and we drew our conclusions
        from works in the past twenty years on museums, postcoloniality, the politics
      and poetics of representations and visual theory.</p>
      <p>In R&eacute;union we have to invent a place that does not fossilize
        history or memory, that remains a site open to revisions and reinterpretations,
        that shows creolization processes and practices while restoring the spaces and
        histories that led up to this creolization. The spirit is one of&nbsp; non-linear interpretation where the viewers
        are invited to &ldquo;dialogue&rdquo; with what they see, where they can suggest other
        meanings for things and objects. R&eacute;unionese anthropology, history, and culture
        offer so many layers of intersecting meanings that clash and connect that it is
        impossible to extract a homogeneous narration and draw a straight line from A
        to B. Meeting this challenge by juxtaposing spaces of signification is another
        evasive device, since handling the heterogeneous and the polyvocal requires
        thinking about the space of the presentation as much as about the presentation
        itself. This exigency does not concern the MCUR alone, yet before undertaking a
        program we still have to conceive this space in connection with its environment
        and its content. Its environment: it is impossible to &ldquo;represent&rdquo; creolization
        without talking about the physical territory (mountains, ocean, plains, rivers,
        fields, towns), its constraints (cyclones, fragility of the soil, steep slopes)
        and its influence on the imaginary. It exists as a non-material and material
        heritage. Its content: the challenge is to present intersecting stories and
      views, never letting one of the terms prevail, yet nonetheless give meaning.</p>
      <p>The MCUR wants to provide the public with very diversified
        and complex information and to give time for reflection, to spawn a movement of
        curiosity, a desire &ldquo;to know more&rdquo;, while providing surprise, emotion and
        enjoyment. Notwithstanding, the MCUR cannot do without a reflection on the
        issues of a museum of the present time, a space that must display episodes
        where violence, brutality and poverty prevailed, without becoming a space of
        expiation. It is by starting from the present that another future can be
        imagined. The MCUR proposes a highly innovative conception of space, in terms
        of both scientific and organizational systems. The MCUR has to solve this
        difficulty: how to show extremely different civilizations at very different
        periods of their respective historical trajectories and their translation on
        R&eacute;union. These civilizations arrived in the form of traces, and were further
        altered during creolization. The creolized traces will be represented not only
        by material testimonies but also by mechanisms we have to invent to render
        tangible and intelligible the contexts in which they were created, the finalities
      and functions that had been assigned to them, and the meaning attached to them.</p>
      <h1>Economy Of Catching Up</h1>
      <p>In R&eacute;union we have to take into consideration an <i>economy
        of catching up and of urgency</i>. This demand
        to catch up, and its vocabulary, stemmed from anti-colonial struggles and the
        discourse of progress. They were based on the acknowledgment of facts:
        malnutrition, wretched condition of the infrastructure, non-application of
        labor legislation, extremely brutal employers, racist schools and churches&hellip; Equality
        was the key notion in the struggle for social and political emancipation in
        1946. The demand for equality expressed in the colonies was a demand for social
        equality (application of the social and labor legislation). It was expressed as
        well as a demand to catch up, and the anti-colonial movement was the first to
        emphasize its urgency. In the 1960s, under the pressure of unrest, the State
      adopted the expression &ldquo;catching up&rdquo;, adapting it in its own way. </p>
      <p>Since then, that notion and its representations have become
        the framework and central issue of every discussion. This economy of making up
        for lost time met several demands: of the State, of elected representatives, of
        the population. In just a few years, &ldquo;providing&rdquo; became the key issue. The gap
        between the different worlds in R&eacute;union &ndash; haves and have-nots, those who
        have a permanent job and those who have a temporary one, those who work and
        those who don&rsquo;t,  the legacy of a colonial system, deeply unequal development -
        all this legitimated this &ldquo;catching up&rdquo;. However, the notion has also blocked
        us inside the rhetoric of urgency. The catching-up economy cannot do without a
        reflection on policies, time and place, tools and strategies. We borrowed
        models that were not necessarily appropriate, and notions, concepts that we did
      not necessarily seek to adapt. </p>
      <p>There are scores of examples of poorly-designed and
        poorly-made infrastructures. The need to catch up has served consumerism. The
        case of the automobile is the most symptomatic. On an island of 750,000
        inhabitants, 300,000 cars travel a perimeter of 250 kms because there is no
        public transportation policy (which ought to have been part of a catching-up
        policy); you can easily see the perverse misuse of that type of economy. Since
        the notions of catching up and urgency lie behind every discussion, culture was
      caught up in them as well. </p>
      <h2>The Demand for Social and Cultural Equality</h2>
      <p>However, the demand for social equality opened new fields of
        protest, expressed in the 1960s by a critical approach to the colonial policy
        with respect to culture: mimetic reproduction of the model of a certain France,
        denial of the language, contempt for non-Catholic religions, folklorization or
        negation of popular expressions, rewriting of history canceling non-European
        contributions, racism, paternalism, mediocrity of cultural productions. A
        movement for the assertion of Creole language, of R&eacute;unionese history and
        culture invested the public sphere. It was a turning-point. But the field of
        culture did not elude the catching-up principle. Gradually the demand for
        infrastructure prevailed over the demand for content and esthetic elaborations.
        Since then, cultural action has only too often been confused with
        entertainment. Towns encourage petty bourgeois prettifying, supposedly picturesque,
        to the detriment of reappraised and historicized esthetics. A neo-Creole
        aesthetics has been invented and sold for consumption. Besides, the legitimate
        demand for historical recognition leads to a race to build monuments without
        thinking about their esthetics and function. Obviously the monument comes to
        fill a lack of representation and recognition and replaces a missing archive.
        The monument is a form of recognition of presence and filiation in the public
        space. Commemorating the ancestor or the longing for an ancestor, it gives
        meaning to present existence. Lately the accumulation of stelae, statues, and
        busts at traffic circles, crossings, and places of remembrance proves the need
        to situate history on the territory and raise a pantheon of great men who are
        missing in the colonial archive. The monument fossilizes the interpretation of
      history by replacing the document and instead lends itself to reinterpretation. </p>
      <h1>Heritage</h1>
      <p>Owing to colonial history, that lasted officially up to
        1946, and owing to a certain amount of denial, including during the
        contemporary period, issues of remembrance or heritage are essential in R&eacute;union
        insofar as they question the dominant story, personal or group stories,
        ideological or fanciful reconstructions, the desire for roots or genealogies.
        You cannot talk about&nbsp; remembrance
        and heritage without placing them within the frame of heritage and debt. The
        challenge is to allow the actors of the present to appropriate a past that is
        theirs only because inherited, that opens onto the future and as much as
      possible avoids dwelling hopelessly on what once was and will no longer be.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Heritage has to
        do with the remembrance of the past in the present. How can we present a common
        heritage of a &lsquo;we&rsquo; that is shaped but not fossilized, because if it were, then
        heritage could be a pretext for the closing of this &lsquo;we&rsquo;? In R&eacute;union this is a
        particularly important question. There are at once several pasts (those of the
        different groups that shaped the population) and a past. But this is a widespread
        condition. What is special for R&eacute;union, as for many territories that were
        colonized, is that the construction of what Paul Ricoeur has called a r&eacute;cit
        partag&eacute;, a shared story was postponed, prevented by the colonial power. Its
      construction is now under way. </p>
      <p>As Jacques Derrida observed, heritage is something we
        receive without being able to choose. You might say heritage &ldquo;chooses&rdquo; us.
        However, nothing forces us to preserve this heritage as it is. That would mean
        making heritage a prison, trapping ourselves in a genealogy we would not be
        allowed to transgress. We have heritages. We inherited the systems of thinking
        and practices of slavery, of engagisme, and colonialism, along with the ideals
        and practices of anti-slavery, the Enlightenment, and anti-colonialism. We are
        heirs to various civilizations - African, Malagasy, Indian, European, Asian -
        heirs to various religious and cultural beliefs and practices. These different
        heritages that merged and dissociated from one another did not remain static over
        the centuries: they were creolized. Some aspects were lost; others were
        transformed. Over the centuries, new traditions have appeared, new practices,
      new beliefs, and that impetus is still under way.</p>
      <p>The goal of the MCUR is not to set off searching for lost
        origins, trying to restore an authenticity that is imaginary, or defend a
        nostalgia that &ldquo;things used to be better&rdquo;. There is nothing in our heritages,
        no matter how painful they are, that gives us the right to claim a moral
        superiority; nothing in our heritages that deprives us of the right to claim we
      are different.</p>
      <h1>Cultural Difference</h1>
      <p>Cultural difference is now part of an economy that needs to
        increasingly extend its range of action (as soon as they are discovered,
        spaces, artifacts, images become part of the consumer economy. The popularity
        of shops featuring &ldquo;ethnic items&rdquo; testifies for the appetite for the &ldquo;exotic&rdquo;).
        There is no point in complaining and regretting a more &ldquo;protected&rdquo; past (this
        notion of protection is often an illusion: temples, libraries, artefacts
        destroyed and peoples massacred speak of a more violent past; colonialism
        profoundly upset practices and brought about the creation of museums where the
        cultural difference was staged in a scenario featuring a retrograde scientism),
        nor in censuring a tourist industry that provides employment and also allows us
        to encounter the diversity of cultures. Instead, we should undertake and
        pursue&nbsp; reflection of the
        representation of cultural differences, receptive to international research and
        the R&eacute;unionese public&rsquo;s comments, and work with the tourist industry,&nbsp; with the arts and crafts movement, in
      connection with cultural exchange.</p>
      <h1>Pitfalls</h1>
      <p>There are two pitfalls that must be avoided: the illusion of
        a harmonious life and that of pure, protected origins. Postcolonial critique
        insists on the <i>transculturation</i> of forms
        and practices. Far from embracing the approach to <i>multicultural
          managerialism</i>, it seeks to represent lines
        of contact, exchange routes and trajectories, creolization, mixtures of memory
        traces. It insists on the need to visualize new maps of the past and the
        present where Europe does not speak in the name of others, does not shape their
        lives and territories, to restore the history of the men and women who have no
      &ldquo;archives&rdquo;. </p>
      <h1>The Archive</h1>
      <p>The archive is not a talisman, nor a fetish, but a <i>document</i>. <i>The archive is meaningful in its context</i>: it is not &ldquo;truth&rdquo;, but it belongs to an entire
        social environment (thus the notarized deed of the sale of a slave is
        meaningful when it is replaced in a social and historical framework; the deed
        itself is merely a notarized deed). The MCUR cannot be content to display
        archives.&nbsp;&nbsp; There has to be a
        space where these archives are contextualized and reinterpreted: thus the Code
        Noir (Black Code) has to be presented in a context where what founds the law in
        France and Europe is explained, and put in perspective with other codes
        regulating slavery. It must not become a &ldquo;sacred&rdquo; text (that cannot be
        discussed), but a testimonial text on special laws, on the justification of
        exclusion. In this way it helps us understand what this state of exception with
        respect to French legislation meant for R&eacute;union, and more broadly, how this
        text is inscribed in the long history of special exclusionary laws (look at current
      laws on foreigners, immigrants, refugees).</p>
      <h1>The Object</h1>
      <p>Rather than looking for the lost object, trying to fill a
        gap, we started with the following challenge: &ldquo;If there are no objects, how do
        we imagine a museum without objects?&rdquo; It might be truer to say: the object
        cannot be central to the MCUR. We know how important it has been for
        non-Western countries to impose a new reading on the object so that the latter
        (African mask, Inuit sculpture, Aboriginal painting &hellip;) was seen as equally
        legitimate to a sculpture or painting by a European artist. The importance of
        that movement is still being felt. Yet, considering our own situation, we
      judged it better to start with an <i>accepted absence</i>. </p>
      <p>No vernacular object before 1848 has survived (and we wish
        to underline: there was no collection of testimonies of slaves after the
        abolition of slavery. No one (freemen, abolitionists, Writers&hellip;) thought of
        collecting oral testimonies of the freed slaves. Their reaction was lost
        forever). The voices of 60, 000 freed women, children and men were lost. They
        survived in oral literature, songs, poetry, and also in police and trials
        reports, but no direct testimonies remained. Wealthy Whites did not collect
        much, and there exists no great private collection of paintings, books or objects.
        Archeological work is in its infancy, and so many popular vestiges (cemeteries,
        calbanons housing slaves and engages, popular neighborhoods, boutik sniwa&hellip;)
        have been destroyed or built over in recent years that it is doubtful we can
        recover much. Starting from an absence led to revisiting the notion of the
        object and then integrating what exists (the trace of the object, a
        reconstruction&hellip;) within that approach. Thus, the object is treated as a trace
      whose meaning emerges from a scape.</p>
      <p>It is worthwhile investigating the notion of &ldquo;anonymity&rdquo;,
        the lack of patrimony, and its connection with the archive in R&eacute;union. Only
        freedmen; that is, a minority, had a patronymic that inscribed them in a
        filiation and a genealogy. The great majority was deprived of this inscription.
        Genealogy and filiation were passed on orally but with lacunae, blanks, masks
        and reelaborations. These breaks, these lacks surface in denials, in the
        obsessive quest for origins, filiations, ties: who is my mother? Who is my
        father? How can I talk to my ancestors? It recurs in appeals for recourse, for
        help, addressed to the gods, to the powers that be. This is the ground in which
        the R&eacute;unionese individual and collective relationship is rooted. The postc<i>olonial
          archive</i> is an archive of traces, ghosts,
      missing and anonymous persons.</p>
      <h1>Material And Immaterial Culture, Creole Language</h1>
      <p><i>The material heritage</i> &ndash; the island itself, factories, fishing ports, docks, houses, forests,
        ruins, ravines, stations, sacred places&ndash; should be preserved, but the way
        this preservation is carried out should be discussed. Do we want to just save
        them from destruction? Turn them into tourist attractions? Give them back a
        social context? All that at once? We know how difficult it is to transform a
        place, a building into a heritage: it can lose its soul, become a consumer
      item. </p>
      <p>A reflection on buildings, industrial remnants, sites of
        popular memory cannot avoid a reflection on the habitat and architecture. The
        vernacular architecture of the past has disappeared; what remains are popular
        &ldquo;Creole&rdquo; style houses built forty, fifty years ago, and houses of wealthy
        Whites reminiscent of colonial houses the world over. Bidonvilles (shanty
        towns) and their organization of the space (private vs. public, spaces for
        animals, for plants) have been torn down before visual and audio recording
        could be done on the lives of their inhabitants (there are few notable
        exceptions). Popular neighborhoods have been gentrified. The mutations and deep
        transformations of society, its need for housing and all the facilities that go
        with it (schools, day care centers, playgrounds, stores, movie theaters&hellip;)
        radically altered the landscape and lifestyles. The clash between these
        mutations and these needs led to the creation of the &ldquo;lambrequin Creole house,&rdquo;
        a neo-Creole style. This invention of nostalgia produces Disneyland-style or
      folkloric town centers. </p>
      <p>The pull between modernization and nostalgia leads to a
        fictitious model of an illusory &ldquo;art de vivre,&rdquo; a desire to embellish the
        environment and a falling back on conventional forms. As a result, architects
        and planners either forgot or folklorized vernacular forms they were unable or
        unwilling to adjust to modern requirements. But they were equally unable to
        invent new forms, so they chose conventional solutions. The change from
        shantytown to social housing was hardly ever designed in dialogue with the
        inhabitants. The time has come to reflect on the materials and forms of a
        third-millennium architecture in a densely populated, increasingly fragile island.
        The material culture world is caught between revised colonial forms (elite Creole
        architecture) and metropolitan urban models. The creation of new forms of
        habitat should be drawn from the encounter between vernacular inventions that
        allow for natural air conditioning and flow: a balanced relation between plants
      and housing and postmodern proposals.</p>
      <p><i>Immaterial heritage</i> concerns the following spheres:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Oral
          traditions and expressions, including language as a vehicle for the
          non-material cultural heritage;</li>
        <li>Performing
          arts;</li>
        <li>Social
          practices, rituals and festive events;</li>
        <li>Knowledge
          and practices concerning nature and the universe;</li>
        <li>Skills
          pertaining to traditional crafts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>During the Etats G&eacute;n&eacute;raux de la Culture (Convention on
        Culture) (October 2004), the participants in the &ldquo;Heritage&rdquo; workshop proposed
        drawing up an inventory of the material and non-material cultural heritage
      under these main headings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>what
          is intangible, that cannot be subject either to consumer or administrative
          logic because it appeals to the very foundations of history and the imaginary
          (myths, legends, places);</li>
        <li>what
          should be made accessible to the general public and could be introduced in the
          economic circuit (museums, cultural centers);</li>
        <li>what
          belongs to the commercial circuit (crafts, ethno-medecine, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because of the very heterogeneity preceding its formation,
        Creole language necessarily bears the stamp of the languages, dreams,
        imaginaries that ruled over its birth: unconscious, underground, cryptic. But
        one way or another it surfaces in the everyday speech of exchange, in poetic
        speech, in the texts of the s&eacute;gas and the maloyas, proverbs, puns, riddles. It
        indeed surfaces, but altered by encounters that shape the imagination of the
        place; it surfaces in crossings and appropriations. Creole language is
        evolving. The space of a constantly enriched shared heritage, it is a vector of
        knowledge about practices and imaginaries;&nbsp; Creole singers, poets, storytellers, and all those who speak
        Creole safeguard and transmit entire areas of the living R&eacute;unionese cultural
      heritage, giving inhabitants the means to survive and develop. </p>
      <p>Non-material heritage cannot be limited to memory or
        tradition. It is by definition alive and belongs to social practices. So it is
        important, next to past practices, to take into consideration new ones like hip
        hop, rap, contemporary dances, etc., as well as the transformation of practices
        (christenings, wakes, weddings, carnaval&hellip;) and the creolization of imported
      practices (table manners, French cuisine, world music..).</p>
      <h1>The Indoceanic Space</h1>
      <p><i>&nbsp;The Indian
        Ocean is the oldest sea space humans shaped into a space of exchange: a
        5000-year history</i>, while the Atlantic (as a
        space shaped by humans) is 500 years old and the Pacific, 2000 years old. At
        one time or other in the history of the rim, each civilization tried to exert
        control over the Ocean and the circulation of wares and men, therefore boosting
        decisive elements for the interpenetration of cultures. This process led to the
        formation of exchange networks that lasted several centuries. From a historical
        angle, we should speak of globalization that led to regionalization. Toward the
        fourth-six centuries A.D., the southwest part of the Indian Ocean gradually
        entered a time world characterized and defined by one or more dominant poles.
      Control over communication and exchange networks was often a source of contest. </p>
      <p>The Indian Ocean connects six worlds: Eastern Asia, Southern
        Asia, the Muslim world, Africa, Europe and the islands. Arabs, Chinese,
        Malayans and Indians shared the knowledge of the ocean. Marco Polo pointed out
        that in the fifteenth century, Chinese maps were far more accurate than
        European maps. Exchanges between China, India and Africa preceded the arrival
      of Islam in the seventh century. </p>
      <p>The Indian Ocean remains a cultural space of encounters and
        exchanges between areas of civilization. It is up to the MCUR to represent the
        cartographies of these layered areas of civilizations that have been
        interacting for 5000 years. R&eacute;union belongs to that oceanic space with a long
        history as a cultural space of contacts and conflicts. Its population comes
        from these areas of civilization. Showing these networks before the arrival of
        Europeans as well as&nbsp; since then
        helps re-place the island in a broader, more complex space. The place of origin
        is not the place of lost purity. It is a place of culture, with a social,
        political and economic organization. The individual is a member of a group,
        whether of Picardy peasants, inhabitants of villages of Mozambique, villages of
        Southern China, Southern India, western Madagascar... There are bits of Europe,
        Asia, Africa, that meet, and these bits and pieces of culture in contact with
        one another never remain intact. Nor is the native place the place of an elite.
        The native place is already a place of interculturality, crossed by conflicts
        and tensions. History is always the history of interculturality, conflicts and
      exchanges.</p>
      <h1>Creolization</h1>
      <p>Creolization<i> </i>refers
        to a dynamic process which comes about by forgetting, abandoning the illusion
        of authenticity and of entity of native cultures. All that is left of them is
        traces. The matrix of creolization was the slave system: the human being was
        subject to a series of traumas and violence that produced aphasia and amnesia,
        if we believe the conclusions of studies in psychology that examine the effects
        of brutal violence on memory, speech, and&nbsp; ability to integrate this experience in its intensity (for
        self-protection human beings sometimes have to &lsquo;forget&rsquo; their victimization
        through an erasure of the most morbid facts remembered through symptoms,
      depressive thoughts, nightmares).</p>
      <p>The slaving system was a machine the captive was put through
        to become a slave and a Reunionnese. The creolization process is a dynamic of
        loss, of borrowing, and creating something new that adds to the creolized
        culture but that will again be challenged by the next wave of slaves, of
        indentured workers, and recent immigrants like groups from mainland France or
      the Comores.</p>
      <p>There cannot be creolization without a revision of the
        notion of origin. Creolization should&nbsp; produce neither&nbsp; nostalgia
        nor a fiction of authenticity. It is both a very radical notion and one very
        hard to defend today: radical because it challenges all the usual approaches to
        issues of identity that glorify roots, blood bonds, the immutability of
        references to identity; and&nbsp; hard
        to defend because our time either spawns processes of identitary withdrawals,
        to which the notion of an identity subject to dynamic constants is illusory, or
        glorifies a historical flexibility of the Self. The first process leads one to
        withdraw into what one knows, into a re-enchantment of tradition; the second
      rests on the idea that one lives without bonds and connection.</p>
      <p>The heterogeneity of R&eacute;unionese society questions the foundation
        of shared identity. The lack of strong ethnic or national markers visible from
        the outside blurs the perception of identity in a world ruled by strong
        civilization categories founded on primordial: language, skin color, ethnicity&hellip;
        How can &ldquo;being R&eacute;unionese&rdquo; be imagized? The questioning is multiplied by the
        minor and outlying situation of R&eacute;union with respect to larger, more powerful
        units such as the French State, the European community, that each have the
        means to offer cultural expressions with high added value. This results in a
        proneness to reinforce the signs of belonging to a community in order to
        &lsquo;exist&rsquo; in the French ensemble by borrowing &ldquo;visible&rdquo; and recognizable
        categories linked either to &lsquo;civilization&rdquo; (Chinese, Indian, European) or to &ldquo;color&rdquo;
        (Black, White). Yet what many R&eacute;unionese display is their attachment to the
        R&eacute;unionese territory and shared practices. That is where the process of
        identification takes place, in this articulation of interlocking loyalties.
        R&eacute;unionese unity is not exclusive: it takes into account a shifting of
        articulations and tensions. But this unity remains linked to a process of
      resistance to any form of imperialism whatever.</p>
      <p>Since 2005, the MCUR team has been engaged in a series of
      actions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collecting
          vernacular knowledge and memories: starting in 2005, a region-wide campaign has been launched, aimed at
          collecting items belonging to the contemporary (1900-2005) Reunionese
          vernacular culture. It is team work, mobilizing collectors, social workers,
          associations and local authorities involved in the preservation and the
          promotion of Reunion patrimony. These specimens can be a nursery rhyme, a song,
          a prayer, a brief life story, a mantrah, a bit of graffiti. It can also be the
          remembered map of a quarter conjured up by memories of communal experiences and
          everyday life shared within a group: going to the public fountain to fetch
          water, playing dominoes or lotto, buying at vendors&rsquo; stalls, making <i>pti
            bondi&eacute;</i> (votive
          offerings)&hellip;</li>
        <li><i>Zarboutan
          Nout Kiltir</i>: the
          honorary title <i>Zarboutan nout Kiltir</i> was created in 2004 to acknowledge the role of
          a Reunionese woman or man in the preservation, the creation and the
          transmission of Reunion cultural heritage. In 2004, it was awarded to Lo Rwa
          Kaf; in 2005, to Firmin Viry, Gramoun L&eacute;l&eacute;, Gramoun Baba, Gramoun B&eacute;b&eacute;, great
          composers and interpreters of <i>maloya</i> music; in 2006 to female practitioners of
          vernacular medicine, and in 2007 to local inventors.</li>
        <li><i>Shimin
          la vi</i> (Routes of
          Life): a program with schools around the notion of itinerary, of a person, a
          spice, a song, a word&hellip;</li>
        <li>A
          program of formation of cultural mediators: young people from modest background
          are trained to become cultural mediators</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In 2007,
        the project architects Anouk Legendre and Nicholas Demazieres of X-TU, were
      chosen by an international jury. </p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>In summary, here are the <i>overall goals of the MCUR</i>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The MCUR will document culture in the broadest sense, that of
          peoples and not just that of the State or official culture or elites.</li>
        <li>It shall respond to the expectations of several publics: the
          R&eacute;unionese public by giving it back its cultural history, the non-R&eacute;unionese
          public by giving it the desire to learn about the civilization areas that
          contributed to the history of mankind and about an island that proved able to
          assemble so many differences. It shall become a space of encounter for
          different publics and listen to their needs and demands.</li>
        <li>The MCUR shall put contemporary society and its questionings
          at the heart of its reflections.</li>
        <li>The MCUR shall be a place for a comparative approach to the
          civilizations the inhabitants of the island   from: Africa, Asia,
          islands of the Indian Ocean, Europe. It shall help discover the ties connecting
          these spaces that first seem to be separated by great differences.</li>
        <li>The MCUR shall help discover a common belonging, be a place
          where new solidarities, new projects for society are produced. It shall help
          the R&eacute;unionese discover the solutions found by other societies faced with the
          same problems and challenges as theirs.</li>
        <li>The MCUR shall play a major role in improving civic life, in
          thinking about the territory: how to inhabit it and protect, safeguard it for
          future generations. </li>
        <li>The MCUR shall encourage curiosity and desire for knowledge,
          because no knowledge in the field of research in the social sciences, no
          artistic expression can be imposed as a unique truth: that imposition is the
          source of every intolerance and violence.</li>
        <li>The MCUR shall remain a space where learning is combined with
          leisure, reflection with play.</li>
      </ol>
