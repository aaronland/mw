	    <h1>Introduction</h1>
	    <p>The increase in
		    Internet use and the rise of social networking has increased the need for
		    museums to understand not only who uses the Internet, but how and why they are
		    using it (Russo et al, 2008). Previous ways of classifying users typically used
		    demographic data or analysed search and visiting patterns. However, these
		    methods often lack the depth of information needed to understand why people
		    engage in certain behaviours. An additional challenge for museums is to
		    consider the relationship between on-line and physical visitors, and what
	    characteristics and behaviours may be shared across both.</p>
	    <p>This paper will
		    explore recent examples of types of on-line participation and classifications.
		    It reports on three recent studies, undertaken at the Australian Museum, that
		    investigated the impact of on-line visitation, and compares these results to
		    data collected in the US (Li, 2006). Some initial findings regarding the
		    relationship between on-line and physical visitation is also considered.
		    Finally, the paper explores the potential for museums to create networks of
	    participation through social media.</p>
	    <h1>Background</h1>
	    <p>Several ways of classifying
		    on-line visitors have emerged recently. Green and Hannon (2007) investigated
		    how young people understood and employed digital technologies. From their
	    discussions they identified the following four user &lsquo;types&rsquo; (p.11):</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>Digital pioneers [who] were blogging before the
	      phrase was coined;</li>
          <li>Creative producers [who] are building web
        sites, posting movies, photos and music to share with friends, families and
        beyond;</li>
      <li>Everyday communicators [who] are making their
        lives easier through texting and MSN and</li>
      <li>Information gatherers [who] are Google and
        Wikipedia addicts, &lsquo;cutting and pasting&rsquo; as a way of life.</li>
        </ol>
	    <p>The Forrester Group
		    surveyed 4,556 US youth in October, 2006, and 4,475 US adults in December,
		    2006, to learn about their social computing technology use (Li, 2006). As a
	    result, users were grouped into six different categories of participation:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>52% were inactive</li>
      <li>33% were spectators (read blogs, watch
        peer-generated videos and listen to podcasts)</li>
      <li>19% were joiners (use social networking sites)</li>
      <li>15% were collectors (tag web pages)</li>
      <li>19% were critics (comment on blogs, post
        ratings and reviews)</li>
      <li>13% were creators (publish web
        pages, publish or maintain a blog, upload video to sites like YouTube).</li>
        </ol>
	    <p>It was suggested
		    that these categories formed a ladder of participation, with progression from
	    one to the other up the ladder.</p>
	    <p>Apart from
		    Inactives, these categories have resonance with museums, given the shift to
		    more active engagement with audiences via the tools that Web 2.0 offers.
		    Creators, Critics and Joiners, in particular, present a useful and exciting way
		    for museums to think about the different kinds of on-line audiences they are
	    catering to now and in the future.</p>
	    <p>In order to both
		    unpack the Forrester findings further and seek more qualitative information,
		    three studies were conducted by the Australian Museum during 2007: an on-line
		    survey of Australians&rsquo; Internet behaviour; five focus groups with adults aged
		    18-30 recruited specifically using the Forrester categories; and a workshop
		    with high school students aged 12-18 years. The aim was to understand users&rsquo;
	      motivations and behaviour in more detail in the on-line, as well as physical,
	    context.</p>
	    <h1>What Are Australians Doing On-Line?</h1>
	    <p>An on-line survey of
		    2,006 participants across eastern Australia was undertaken in November 2007
		    using a similar set of questions from the Forrester study in order to make some
		    comparisons (Australian Museum, 2008). Respondents were asked about the kinds
		    of on-line activities they had undertaken in the previous month, as well as
		    where they accessed the Internet, and how comfortable they felt with
	    technology; they were also asked to provide some demographic information.</p>
	    <p>Figure 1 shows the
		    kinds of activities Australians were engaged in over the previous month. Most
		    related to watching videos; reading customer reviews; participating in
	    discussions; and reading blogs.</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="kelly-fig1-what.png" alt="figure 1" width="405" height="211" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 1: On-line activities Australians are engaged in</p>
	    <p>Some of the
		    differences between Australians and Americans in specific activities undertaken
		    were that significantly more Australians participated in discussion
		    board/forums (32% compared with 21%) and watched videos (43% compared with
		    18%). However, the latter could be due to the timing of the study, with the
		    rise in YouTube usage and content over the previous 12 months since the
	    Forrester study was conducted in 2006.</p>
	    <p>These results were
		    then grouped into the six categories identified by Forrester to compare data
		    across both the Australian and US samples. As shown in Figure 2, the survey
		    revealed that more Australians fell within in the Creator, Critic and Spectator
	    categories, with significantly fewer being Inactive on-line.</p>

	    <p class="caption">Fig 2: Participation: Australian and US data</p>
	    <h1>Museum Visitors And On-Line Behaviour</h1>
	    <p>Are those who interact
		    with museums on-line different from general Internet users? Given the
		    substantial increase in the kinds of on-line experience museums are offering,
		    how do they reconcile their Internet and physical experiences? From 1990-2004,
		    a major telephone survey of Sydney adults was undertaken to understand both the
		    demographic and psychographic profiles of museum visitors to a range of
		    cultural institutions across Sydney, including the Australian Museum,
		    Powerhouse Museum, National Maritime Museum, Art Gallery of NSW, as well as the
		    local zoo and aquarium (Hall, 2005). An analysis of over 13,000 respondents
		    found that those more likely to visit museums agreed with the statement, &ldquo;I am
		    more interested in abstract ideas&rdquo;. As the Web may be seen as a place for abstract
		    ideas, could this mean that there may be a link between physical and on-line
	    museum visitors?</p>
	    <p>In the on-line
		    survey of Australian Internet users, 41% (n=829) reported that they had visited
		    a museum/gallery in the previous six months. The data from this group were 
		    separated to compare against the rest of the sample to see if there were any
		    differences in these users&rsquo; on-line behaviour (Table 1). The data show that
		    museum/gallery visitors participated at higher levels across all activities.
		    Apart from using social networking sites, statistical tests revealed that these
	    differences were highly significant across all categories.</p>

	    <p class="caption">Table 1. Comparison of museum visitors and total sample</p>
	    <p>These findings have
		    broad implications for museums and their relationships with both their on-line
		    and in-person audiences. The data suggest that not only do those who visit
		    museums participate in more on-line activities; they also engage in activities
		    that are participatory and two-way. This raised the question of whether these
		    visitors may bring those expectations and modes of behaviour and learning to
		    their physical visit. In considering this question, the two in-depth studies
		    undertaken by the Australian Museum provided the opportunity to not only look
		    more closely at the Australian on-line survey findings, but also investigate
	    possible implications for the physical museum experience.</p>
	    <h1>In-Depth Study 1: On-Line Users Aged 18-30 Years</h1>
	    <p>It has long been
		    demonstrated that people aged between 18 and 30 are under-represented among
		    Australian Museum visitors (Australian Museum, 2007). Given the rate of
		    Internet usage across this age group (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2007) it
		    has been suggested that maybe the on-line environment could be one way to
		    engage this group and perhaps entice those living in Sydney to actually visit
		    the Museum through new ways of on-line marketing, promotion and programming.
		    Therefore, the aim of the first in-depth study was to understand more deeply
	    how those aged 18-30 behave on-line.</p>
	    <p>Five focus groups
		    were held with a range of participants recruited using the Forrester categories
		    (Vivid, 2007). However, when interviewing participants during the recruitment
		    phase it was found that people could be identified as belonging to Creators,
		    Spectators, and Joiners, but not to the Critics or Collectors groups. On
		    reflection, it was decided that Collectors didn&rsquo;t yet exist in Australia, and
		    that many of the Collector characteristics, such as tagging and bookmarking,
		    formed part of how people manage their on-line lives rather than being ends in
		    themselves. Also, another group emerged, called Commentators, rather than
		    Critics. It was felt that Critic was too strong a label for this typology given
		    that Australians tend not to be comfortable with debate (outside of sports).
		    Also, &ldquo;commenting&rdquo; is the most common term given to a collection of random
		    thoughts on a subject, and comments are usually quite brief, so it was felt
	    that this label was more appropriate.</p>
	    <p>From analysing the
		    transcripts across the groups, overall it was found that the typologies were not
		    mutually exclusive and are often influenced by life stage and personality.
		    Users move in and out of categories depending on their age and personal/social
		    circumstances, as well as on their levels of comfort with using technology. It
		    was also found that people had either a one-dimensional relationship with the
		    Internet, using it as a transaction or information source, or a two-dimensional
		    relationship that was more about participation and exchange. Certain
	    characteristics of each group did emerge as discussed below.</p>
	    <h2>Spectators</h2>
	    <p>The research showed
		    that Spectators have a one-dimensional relationship with technology. Their key
		    driver is efficiency &ndash; the Internet makes their lives easier through
		    activities such as banking, looking up movies, restaurants, etc. They typically
		    don&rsquo;t spend much time on-line outside of work and study, and tend to have a
		    negative view of technology. In their personal lives, they may have niche
		    interests but not enough knowledge about them and faith in the Internet to use
		    it to feed their passion. Spectators belong to their segment for two main
		    reasons: their relative lack of trust in the Internet, over aspects such as
		    security and content; coupled with a relative lack of interest or passion that
	    they want to share or learn more about.</p>
	    <h2>Joiners</h2>
	    <p>Joiners utilise the
		    Internet for work, study and general organising of their lives, but are quick
		    to point out that the most important aspect is socialising. The Internet is
		    their social lifeline through sites like Bebo, MySpace and, more recently in
		    Australia, Facebook. It was found that the use of Facebook has become
		    compulsive for many Joiners, who check it many times a day. They also reported
		    that their work, study and general life administration was suffering because of
		    it. Joiners demonstrate a high level of trust in the on-line world and are very
		    optimistic about the potential of technology. Compared with Spectators, their
		    relationship with the Internet is two-dimensional and, although they are more
		    engaged with technology, that engagement  is quite shallow, limited primarily
		    to social networking sites as a means to keep in contact with friends and
		    family. Joiners have been swept up in a social movement that is easy to access,
	    fun and rewarding to be a part of. Yet could it be a phase for most users?</p>
	    <h2>Commentators</h2>
	    <p>In discussions with
		    Commentators, two types of behaviour were uncovered. The first was deliberate &#8211;
	      focused around interest areas as a way to maintain and explore their interests
		    and where they will comment in most on-line sessions. The other was
		    spontaneous, where they sporadically commented on anything and anyone, usually
		    because of a negative provocation or experience. The driving force behind
		    Commentators&rsquo; Internet usage is a fuel for their passions. Although they use
		    the Web for other functional activities, doing so gives them more time to
		    devote to their passion Web sites. Like Joiners, they have a two-dimensional
		    relationship with the Web; however, they see it as a give and take
		    relationship. They acknowledge the gratification the Internet has provided them
		    and, in turn, feel the need to return the favour. They are comfortable with
	    debate and tend to revisit the same sites rather than explore new ones.</p>
	    <h2>Creators</h2>
	    <p>Creators use the
		    Internet as a personal development tool. They are hunters and harvesters of
		    information which they then share with others. Unsurprisingly, they spend the
		    most time on the Web compared with other categories, using the language of
		    addiction to describe their Internet usage. They are trusting of and optimistic
		    about the potential of the Internet, without being na&iuml;ve. They are typically
		    passionate people, driven to be at the forefront of their passion. They
		    recognise that knowledge equals power and value the importance of being
		    published in order to leave a record of themselves, their opinions and their
		    activities. Overall, it is intellectual rather than social fulfilment that
	    Creators seek on-line.</p>
	    <h2>Significance of These Findings</h2>
	    <p>What do these
		    findings mean for museums, their on-line presence, and their sites for visiting?
		    Some preliminary ideas emerged in discussion of these findings with Museum
		    staff. As Spectators use the Web for information, museums could advertise
		    through information sites such as CitySearch to ensure they are connected to
		    museum events more readily. In this way, museums could collaborate with
		    commercial and not-for-profit organisations to create a trusted network through
		    which audiences could participate in cultural activities. As Joiners are driven
		    by social engagement, museums could promote events through social networking
		    sites. They could provide incentives to promote on-line &lsquo;advocates&rsquo; or &lsquo;fans&rsquo;
	      to encourage others to participate. Additionally, museums could create on-line
		    community spaces for those with like-minded interests to discuss and debate
		    issues relevant to museum collections and events. As Commentators are driven by
		    somewhat obscure passions and interests, museums could promote their physical
		    offerings through professional or specialist Web sites. They could then
		    cultivate those with interest in their content areas and collections (such as
		    science, the environment, culture, social history and art) to contribute to the
		    museum&rsquo;s Web site on a deeper level. As the Internet is so much a part of
		    Creators&rsquo; lives and is used as a personal development tool, it was felt that
		    they might be the least likely segment to physically visit a museum, yet they
		    have the most potential for on-line engagement as professionals contributing to
	    content.</p>
	    <h1>In-Depth Study 2: Students Aged 12-18 Years</h1>
	    <p>For young people
		    with easy access to technology, the links between social behavior and the
		    knowledge economy are becoming more diffuse. Both Green and Hannon (2006) and
		    Li (2006) argued that the ease and affordability of on-line connection are
		    having a profound effect on social structures and learning, and that
		    peer-to-peer interaction is increasingly being perceived as a source of
		    information - as opposed to some central pedagogue or authority. Young people
		    are learning to use a huge range of digital technologies in their homes and
		    other sites in the community beyond schools, and they also use them
		    differently. For example, a recent report demonstrated that young people make
		    clear distinctions between social sites and news sites, and prefer to access
	    their news via tailored feeds (Vahlberg, Peer and Nesbitt, 2008).</p>
	    <p>Given that learning
		    through social media and digital resources is increasingly becoming a core
		    function in the learning repertoire of today&rsquo;s students (Green and Hannon,
		    2006), it was decided to run an e-Kids&rsquo; College with participants from the
		    Coalition of Knowledge Building Schools to investigate how they were using the
		    Web and, in particular, social media. An important component of the research
		    was the search for feedback and advice about how the Museum&rsquo;s research and
		    collection could be better utilised through digital media to match audience
	    needs and interests.</p>
	    <p>The Museum has
		    worked with students from the Coalition since 2003 on a variety of audience
		    research projects (Groundwater-Smith and Kelly, 2007). The Coalition consists
		    of around 20 public- and privately-funded schools across New South Wales that
		    have joined together to undertake research across a broad range of topics,
		    specifically related to both school activities and informal learning projects. 
		    The schools cover the spectrum of years from Kindergarten (students aged five)
		    to Year 12 (aged 17-18), and as well represent a broad range of socio-economic
	    circumstances and geographic locations.</p>
	    <p>Twenty-four students
		    from nine schools across New South Wales attended a one-day workshop in
		    November 2007. Students were consulted on a range of issues encompassing their
		    use of digital technologies for leisure and for learning. They undertook a
		    behind-the-scenes tour of the Museum, spoke with a number of scientific staff,
		    and experienced the public areas of the Museum in order to provide feedback
		    about the Museum&rsquo;s potential for on-line offerings. Prior to their visit the
		    students had interviewed ten of their peers, again using the same questions
		    from the Forrester study, with other aspects included that asked about their
		    general views of the Internet, where they accessed it and how comfortable they
	    felt with technology.</p>
	    <p>Unsurprisingly, all
		    students reported that they felt totally comfortable with technology in
	    general, giving interesting perspectives about the Internet, for example:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I enjoy using
		    computers and digital technologies to learn because there are so many
		    possibilities and it is a lot more interesting than a pen and paper. But
		    technology can be tricky and break down very easily and it isn&rsquo;t always
	    reliable. But with technology, almost anything can happen.</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Surfing the net is
		    fast, exciting and surprising and different. Without the Internet the world
	    would be bland.</p>
	    <p>When asked to
		    complete the sentence, &ldquo;Not being able to access the Web is like not being able
		    to &hellip;&rdquo; respondents likened it to not being able to breathe, live, eat, talk,
		    socialise and get access to water, as well as travel around the world, explore
	    my inner self or broaden my horizon.</p>
	    <p>One interesting
		    finding was that the students had mixed views about the Museum&rsquo;s presence on
		    social networking sites such as MySpace and content-sharing sites like YouTube
		    and Flickr. Some felt that it would make the Museum look too &ldquo;try hard&rdquo; or &ldquo;uncool,&rdquo;
	      and others thought that these sites were primarily for socialising and leisure &ndash; 
	    they did  not associate them with education:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I don&rsquo;t really see
		    how you can use things like MySpace, YouTube etc. Most people would not even
		    consider watching a video from the museum. I think the best thing to do would
		    be to keep the Museum Web site always up to date and accurate. Make sure it
		    comes up the top of search engines, with actual paging. People never click on
	    the sponsored links.</p>
	    <p>However, on
		    reflection, several students felt that the Museum could utilise social spaces
		    in a number of unexpected ways; for example; showing movie trailers of upcoming
		    exhibitions and events, and even developing a page for a number of animal
	    species, as a way to promote the Museum&rsquo;s work in a fun and light-hearted way:</p>
	    <p>&quot;The Australian
		    Museum should have a trailer and a page about their tours and expedition&quot;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The
		    Museum could set up a MySpace, with bulletins, to keep contacts up-to-date, set
		    as public;&quot; &quot;For Bebo, have a Bebo bank (make a page just for the Australian
	    Museum)&quot;; and</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I think it would be
		    interesting to set up a MySpace type profile for the different specimens, and
		    use this to provide information. It would allow you to make it visually
		    appealing with bright colours, and even movie and music clips. This would
	    appeal to young audiences.</p>
	    <p>Overall, they felt
		    that content should primarily sit on the Museum&rsquo;s Web site, for example:        </p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">MySpace is more for advertising value than viewing content. Whatever I put out
		    on the Internet, it should be able to all be linked back to the Museum&rsquo;s Web
	    site for credentials &ndash; accuracy and reliability.</p>
	    <p>In one of the day&rsquo;s
		    activities, they were asked to answer the question: &ldquo;If the Museum were a Web
		    site &hellip;&rdquo;. The overall consensus was that the site should be uncluttered,
	    pleasing to look at, advertisement-free, jargon-free, simple and easy to use:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">If the museum was a
		    Web site, it could be either boring or fascinating depending on the way that
		    designers approached it. For a younger audience it is crucial to break up the
		    factual information, and present it in an interactive, appealing and creative
		    way.  It would be important to have it set up by a representative of the target
	    audience, as &lsquo;second guessing&rsquo; often proves inaccurate.</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">If the Museum was a
		    Web site it would need a variety of ways used to get the message across e.g.
		    videos, pictures, podcasting. It would need to have a dedicated site for
		    younger people, because different target markets respond to different things,
		    so only one type/theme site would not work. Primary, secondary and public would
	    be good because of different reasons for using the site.</p>
	    <p>They believed that
		    there should be a discussion board where questions could be asked and opinions
		    mooted, games, interactivity, and more personal and informal staff information:
		    [a] &ldquo;question of the week, where children are able to write in and ask a
		    question, the best question will be chosen and will be posted in a blog, this
		    way people can comment on it&rdquo;, &ldquo;An interactive touch screen that would show
		    different types of animals (e.g. marine) and let you design a pattern on the
		    animal&rdquo;, &ldquo;Have a link on your Web site called &lsquo;scientists are people too&rsquo; and
		    have a character version of a scientist and maybe try and portray their quirky
	    ways&rdquo;.</p>
	    <p>These findings
		    resonate with an earlier study that examined students&rsquo; and teachers&rsquo; needs and
		    wants relating to the Internet generally, and museum Web sites specifically
	    (Kelly and Breault, 2006).</p>
	    <p>A number of others
		    also made a distinction between visiting the Museum itself and visiting the
		    Museum&rsquo;s Web site. For example, one student who had participated in previous
	    research projects with the Museum had this to say:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Last time I came here
		    we focused mainly on new technology and we were constantly saying we needed
		    more screens, games and interactive displays, but since then I have been
		    thinking: I can do that at home, I can watch movies, play games etc at home. If
		    I come to the Museum I want to be able to get information, read it and be able
		    to learn from it. It is good to have these things (screens etc) but I guess,
		    like all things, in moderation. The Web site needs to suit all audiences. I got
		    the feeling that you were trying to find out what we want but we are not the
		    only people that use the Museum. A section on the site, with bright colours,
		    games etc could be good, but it is unlikely that the reason we are at a Museum
		    site in the first place is to play the games. We can do that anywhere. If we
		    are there we are probably looking for information of some kind. So it needs to
	    be easy to read and access without being too dry.</p>
	    <p>When reflecting on
		    the outcomes of this work with the Coalition over the years,  participants have
		    suggested that when it comes to designing fantastic physical and on-line museum
		    experiences for young people, the principles are the same and include a range
	    of elements:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>experiences that encourage discovery,
		      interaction, cater for the unexpected, provide many pathways to explore, give a
	      taste for what happens behind-the-scenes and are fun</li>
      <li>content that is challenging, real, authoritative,
        meaningful, encourages questions and is well-organised and easy to navigate</li>
      <li>staff that can relate to young people, are
        respectful of their ideas and views, are knowledgeable in their field and are
        easy to talk to</li>
      <li>opportunities to socialise, hang out with their
        friends and learn together.</li>
        </ul>
	    <h1>From Ladders Of Participation To Networks Of Participation Through Social
	    Media</h1>
	    <p>The Forrester report
		    provided useful data and classification tools to determine the ways in which
		    audiences participate in on-line activities. Yet it did little to extrapolate
		    these findings in relation to cultural participation beyond broad genres of
		    interactivity. The Australian data suggested that people who were actively
		    engaged in physical museum visitation tended to be involved in on-line
		    activities that included participation in greater numbers than those who didn&rsquo;t.
		    Using the Forrester categories to survey the 18-30 year olds resulted in a
		    range of options regarding cultural engagement with visitors both physically
		    and on-line. The work with students demonstrated many similarities between what
	    they wanted from the physical and what they wanted from the on-line museum.</p>
	    <p>Social media can be
		    used to encourage audiences to respond to museums and relate their experiences
		    back to themselves, to communities of interest and to the museum itself in ways
		    that are meaningful.  It is here that the opportunities to create networks of
		    participation through social media can be usefully explored. Recent research by
		    Russo et al (2008) demonstrates how social media facilitate knowledge exchange
		    by taking advantage of &lsquo;network effects&rsquo; and creating a new forum through which
		    diverse audiences can participate with museums to explore issues and voice
		    these reflections on-line. Social media are an exceptional platform from which
		    to establish dialogue with and between users, to build relationships with and
		    between audiences, to bring together communities of interest, and to enhance
		    external and internal knowledge sharing. With recent technological changes they
		    are a simple and cost-effective way to enhance and extend audience experience
	    through networks of participation.</p>
	    <p>Changes to the
		    centrality of collections within museum programs have set the scene for
		    authentic learning through social networking.  Social media could be useful in
		    stimulating audience engagement as some of its forms, particularly the newer
		    complex sites such as My Space and Facebook, break down conventions of
		    information sharing. When social media such as blogs, podcasts and wikis are used
		    by museums, they provoke the systems of authority and custodianship which
		    museums have, over history, tried to establish. This has both positive and
		    negative implications. For example, the use of audio tours has recently been
		    deconstructed as individuals offer their own perspectives or audio tours via
		    pod casts or via blogs. In the USA an independent media group, ArtMobs, works
		    with young people to offer a platform through which audiences can upload their
		    own podcasts of their visits to the Museum of Modern Art, New York (MoMA).
		    While supported by the museum, this stand-alone Website provides what ArtMobs
		    describes as &lsquo;unofficial guides&rsquo; to museum content. MoMA itself offers a forum
		    through which young people can offer their opinions and experiences in relation
		    to museum content. &lsquo;Talk Back&rsquo; encourages young people to &lsquo;&hellip;read about what
		    other people have to say about art and share your own opinions&rsquo;. While these
		    types of &lsquo;youth engagement&rsquo; initiatives are increasingly popular in large
		    museums, it is rare to find them extending to reflections and additions to
	    curatorial expertise.</p>
	    <p>A Pew Internet
		    report found that Wikipedia was far and away the most-accessed on-line
		    reference in the USA (Rainie and Tancer, 2007) because it acknowledges and
		    encourages community voice and collaboration. Groundwater-Smith and Kelly
		    (2003) demonstrated that young people visiting museums are increasingly
		    interested in taking experiences which are relevant and authentic to them and
		    creating experiences which illustrate this engagement to their peers. If this
		    is the case, then museums could operate as hubs of a cultural network and
	    engage communities of interest in conversation, collaboration and co-creation.</p>
	    <p>As museums attempt
		    to make their collections and expertise more accessible in audience terms,
		    certain concessions to experimentation will need to be made, allowing audiences
		    to express what it is that they value as opposed to being offered a learning
		    environment focused exclusively on institutional views. The challenge for
		    museums is in developing the ability to support multiple representations and
	    critical examinations across that range of public forums they operate within.</p>
	    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
	    <p>For institutions
		    that are not used to responding to technological or social change in short time
		    frames, the challenges of providing on-demand experiences will require some
		    adjustment in the conceptualisation and development of programs. Informal
		    learning environments such as museums are well-positioned to draw people of all
		    ages into their collections by designing interactive experiences which take
		    advantage of the opportunities of social media while introducing specialist
		    knowledge. While museums are not able to compete with commercial leisure
		    activities, there is the potential to enable users to engage in live
	    experiences and accentuate their on-line learning with physical experiences.</p>
	    <p>The research
		    undertaken at the Australian Museum goes some way to providing evidence of how
		    innovative programs of cultural engagement might be developed and how they might
		    be perceived by both in-person and on-line visitors. The potential for museums
		    to create new types of participation and then evaluate the experiences needs
		    development. Over the next year, as the Australian Museum undertakes a major
		    redevelopment of its Web site, it will trial social media initiatives based on
		    some of the issues identified from the research reported in this paper. These
		    experiments will result in new questions to investigate and generate further
	    discussion.</p>
