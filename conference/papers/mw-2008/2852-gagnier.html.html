        <p class="AbstractText">New challenges concerning the
    acquisition, exhibition and preservation of media art in museum collections
    have recently surfaced. These challenges have given rise to an important study
    led by the DOCAM Research Alliance (Documentation and Conservation of the Media
    Arts Heritage). Established in 2004, this initiative is a SSHRC funded research
    project spearheaded by the Daniel Langlois Foundation and the Canadian Heritage
    Information Network. This paper presents a number of DOCAM case study findings
    on new media works by the research teams at the Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;art contemporain de
    Montr&eacute;al and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">Conclusions drawn from a survey of new
    media cataloguing practices in some North American, European and Australian
    institutions are also  discussed. Museum cataloguing methods and conservation
    strategies are  identified. Finally, the importance of protecting our new media
    heritage for the future is emphasized. Participants will benefit from the
    research findings and will learn how the Web is used to bring together vast
    quantities of resources on new media, including the DOCAM Web site
    (<a href="http://www.docam.ca/">http://www.docam.ca</a>).</p>

   <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p><b>Media
    art</b> refers to the
    large body of artistic works that have a technological component. The
    complexity of such works has been described on the DOCAM Research Alliance Web
    site (Documentation and Conservation of the Media Arts Heritage -
    http://www.docam.ca). The Web site states that the components of media
    artworks, created in different eras, may be analog, mechanical or electronic,
    and that they may be composed of machines, software, electronic systems, and
    still or moving analog or digital images integrated with traditional and
    non-traditional materials. </p>
  <p>Museums
    that have acquired media artworks in recent years face major challenges. Chief
    among them is certainly technological obsolescence, in itself a serious
    impediment to the ability of museums to adequately exercise their mandate to
    exhibit and preserve the art in their collections. The urgent need to avert
    obsolescence - or worse, extinction &ndash; of a major portion of our recent artistic
    heritage has forced museums to take serious stock of their capabilities. In
    addition to implementing new conservation strategies, museums must also cast a
    critical eye on the concept of their mandate to manage, acquire, exhibit and
    preserve media artworks. Should such works be acquired with the intent of
    preserving them for the longest possible time, thus fulfilling a mandate to
    conserve our heritage for generations to come? How are museums to catalogue
    media artworks and integrate the resulting information into a collection
    management system? Is there additional information that should be gathered and
    preserved within collection archives? What should our preservation strategies
    be when the time comes to replace worn out or defective equipment? Are the strategies
    under consideration consistent with the integrity and authenticity of the
    works? These are some of the questions that the DOCAM Research Alliance has
    addressed. </p>
  <p>DOCAM is
    an international research alliance consisting of museum professionals and university
    researchers who address the documentation and preservation of media art
    heritage. DOCAM&rsquo;s main objective is to develop new tools and methodologies that
    respond to challenges posed by technology-based artistic practices. It has
    assembled a multidisciplinary team of researchers from such fields as art
    history, museology, archival management, information sciences, and history of
    technology. DOCAM has six research committees - Conservation and Preservation,
    Documentation and Archival Management, Technological Timeline, Pedagogy,
    Cataloguing Structure and Terminology - all working together toward a common
    goal. </p>
  <p>This
    paper is divided into two parts. The first part, prepared by the Cataloguing
    Structure Committee, details the research methodologies and preliminary
    findings of the case studies on new media works in the collections of the Mus&eacute;e
    d&rsquo;art contemporain de Montr&eacute;al. It also reviews the survey and case studies conducted by
    the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and identifies current cataloguing approaches.
    The second part, prepared by the Preservation and Conservation Committee,
    discusses issues pertaining to the authenticity and integrity of media artworks
    and illustrates current conservation approaches. </p>
  <h1>Cataloguing Methodologies and Case Studies at the Mus&eacute;e
    d&rsquo;art contemporain de Montr&eacute;al</h1>
  <p>The Mus&eacute;e
    d&rsquo;art contemporain de Montr&eacute;al (MACM) is a pioneer in the study of new media
    works in public collections, being amongst the first museums in Canada to
    develop a tailor-made cataloguing methodology and to conduct case studies. This
    section will illustrate three major concerns &ndash; archival, technical and
    ethical - that are evident in the case studies conducted by the MACM on works by
    Bill Viola, Gary Hill and Janet Cardiff. </p>
  <p>The three
    concerns can be described as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Archival</b>: The archival aspect focuses on the importance of archiving the
      greatest amount of pertinent information possible on the work acquired. In
      addition to documenting standard logistical issues, preservation and
      presentation aspects must also be considered. To protect an artwork&rsquo;s
      integrity, it is necessary to provide a description of conceptual aspects as
      the work evolves and transforms in various presentations and as it adapts to
      technological changes.</li>
    <li><b>Technical</b>: The technical aspect concerns all information on the technology
      used to produce the work (how it was produced, how it operates, how it can be
      preserved and how it can be migrated to a newer technology).</li>
    <li><b>Ethical:</b> The ethical aspect is linked to copyright issues that not only
      pertain to the exhibition and preservation of a work of art through time, but
      also deal with the production of new media works.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Prior to
    the case studies, the MACM research team analyzed its database and reviewed its
    standard cataloguing methodologies, adding fields of information and adapting
    cataloguing forms specifically for new media works. Several fields of
    information, such as three new fields for the description of the works
    (iconographic, a technical and a detailed description of the installation of
    the work) and various fields for describing the different components of each
    work, were added to the database. The MACM also developed an in-house artist
    questionnaire. In addition to the factual and technical queries, the
    questionnaire asks how the work was conceived, how it functions, and which of
    its components need to be preserved for each presentation. The questionnaire
    can be completed either privately by the artist or publicly in the form of an
    interview between the artists and museum staff. A videotaped interview during exhibition
    installation is the ideal time to collaborate with the artist and his/her
    technicians and to obtain extensive documentation about a new media work. </p>
  <h2>Archival Documentation </h2>
  <p>For each
    of the case studies, the MACM documented every new media work in depth. The
    archival documentation consists of a description of the operational components,
    including both the components visible to the visitors during the presentation
    and those hidden behind the technical booth. A complete inventory of
    audiovisual equipment, machines, manufacturers, models, serial numbers and all
    tapes including exhibit copies, program codes, etc. was taken.</p>
  <p>Preserving
    an artwork&rsquo;s integrity is an important part of its archival documentation. It
    is defined by using several descriptive levels, all of which are mainly based
    on the artist&rsquo;s concept and intentions. An understanding of how the work
    operates on a conceptual and functional level is necessary in order to foresee
    its behaviour at each presentation and its evolution from a technological
    standpoint. Therefore, a description of the work, its function, and behaviour,
    is done so that the museum can determine its installation parameters. The
    artist questionnaire/interview helps to determine these parameters, and to
    clarify the artist&rsquo;s wishes with respect to each presentation. The
    questionnaire defines the relationship between the concept, the artist&rsquo;s
    intention and the artwork&rsquo;s technical expression.</p>
  <p><i>The
    Sleepers</i> (1992) by
    Bill Viola was one of the MACM&rsquo;s case studies. At the time of acquisition,
    Viola produced a complete description of the work with a list of the materials
    and technical equipment required for the installation. The artist also provided
    signed hand-drawn sketches and floor plans for <i>The Sleepers</i>, clearly describing his intentions
    and requirements. This serves the MACM as a certificate of authenticity for the
    work and determines the parameters that apply to the artwork&rsquo;s presentation.
    These documents describe the work&rsquo;s essential functionality. They help the MACM
    to understand how the work needs to behave; they also define the physical and
    aesthetic parameters that need to be reproduced at each presentation. In
    addition, they also help the MACM to respect the integrity of the work at each
    presentation and avoid any understatement of its intrinsic value.</p>
  <h2>Technical Aspects</h2>
  <p>When
    taking into account technical aspects, it is necessary to document
    transformations over time, such as migration, emulation and the refurbishing of
    obsolete equipment. In fact, the MACM constantly migrates video components of
    media works to newer formats - all of which are documented. The MACM emulated
    several works which needed re-design or re-programming of digital components.
    Most of these changes and transformations are made according to the artist&rsquo;s intentions
    and recommendations.</p>
  <p>Technical
    aspects of some works are highly specialized. One of the MACM&rsquo;s most complex
    video installations is <i>Dervish</i> (1995) by Gary Hill, another case study completed by the research
    team. <i>Dervish</i> is
    composed of 2 moving video projections (rotating on a semi-circular wall built
    specifically for this installation). It comprises 2 laser discs and players, 2
    modified projectors with integrated strobe lights, a control box and a laptop
    computer.  The structure at the centre of the piece, barely visible to the
    visitor, holds two modified projectors with strobe lights, a turbine engine
    with mirrors, a time coder, and a computer that contains the programming code
    for this piece. The moving video projections on the wall are created by the
    reflection of the video images on the rotating mirrors. In the technical booth
    adjacent to the installation, the main control box, two laser discs with
    players, and a synchroniser are not visible to the viewer.</p>
  <p><i>Dervish</i> is activated by a sensor in the installation
    space.  As visitors walk into the room, the turbine engine is automatically
    activated.  The video images are reflected on rotating mirrors and projected on
    a semi-circular wall. The projections move horizontally across the wall, in
    various directions, for variable lengths of time.  The code (computer) controls
    the turning mirrors&rsquo; velocity and activates the control box sending a signal to
    the video players for the selection of video display and the control of the
    on/off sound. </p>
  <p>The
    documentation on <i>Dervish</i> consists of construction plans for the semi-circular wall, electrical plans for
    the installation of the wiring, the equipment, with a detailed plan of each
    part of the installation, installation instructions, as well as instructions on
    the handling and care of the equipment. Most of these plans were provided by
    the artist&rsquo;s studio at the moment of acquisition. The MACM continues to work
    closely with the <i>Gary Hill Studio</i> with regard to this piece.</p>
  <h2>Ethical Concerns</h2>
  <p>Ethical
    concerns involve copyright issues. In respecting Canadian copyright laws, any
    modification to the presentation and/or preservation of the work must be
    overseen and authorized by the artist. The artist may specify, through an
    official contract, the changes that he/she authorizes to the piece; however
    this occurs on only rare occasions. Each work varies, and artists have
    divergent opinions on how their works should survive through time. For this
    reason, it is difficult to adopt a standardized acquisition policy for all new
    media works. </p>
  <p>Museums must deal with  copyright issues in the production of the media
    work itself. The MACM needs to ensure that artworks acquired are copyright free
    with regard to collaborators, programmers, and the existing software used in
    the production of the piece. The MACM must also ensure that the artist has
    obtained the right to use specific software and cleared all authorship issues
    with his/her collaborators.</p>
  <p><i>Th&eacute;orie
    du complot / Conspiracy Theory</i> (2003) by Janet Cardiff, another case study, has an interesting
    copyright issue. This work was specifically produced for the MACM. It is an
    interactive video installation consisting of 12 digital cameras, 24 mini DV
    cassettes (12 in French and 12 in English), and 12 sets of headphones. It is one
    of Cardiff&rsquo;s walking pieces; she has created several versions for different
    museums. They are all produced with a similar approach: the museum visitor is
    handed a video camera containing a videotape for playback with a set of
    headphones and is directed to a specific area of the museum where the walking
    piece begins. As the camera is set in playback mode, the artist in the video
    leads the visitor to specific areas and sites in and around the museum by
    speaking to the visitor throughout the walking tour. </p>
  <p>The MACM
    has no written agreement specifying the changes that are allowed to be made to
    the work. The artist must approve such modifications. Since it is also a
    site-specific work, any modification to the architecture filmed in the walking
    tour can render the piece impossible to experience. Moreover, a change in the
    MACM&rsquo;s architecture has made it impossible to complete the tour as originally
    envisaged. Respecting the copyright law and the artist&rsquo;s moral rights, the MACM
    will verify if the artist is willing to recreate part of the tour so that its
    visitors can continue to view it. Cardiff will then decide if it is possible
    and if she is willing to recreate a part of her work. In cooperation with the
    MACM, both parties will determine how the re-creation of the work will be done.
    Should Cardiff decide against the modification of the artwork, the MACM will be
    left with only the documentation of the original piece. </p>
  <p>The case
    studies on Bill Viola, Gary Hill and Janet Cardiff demonstrate that it is
    necessary for museums to address the archival, technical and ethical concerns
    brought forth by the Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;art contemporain de Montr&eacute;al when acquiring new
    media works.</p>
  <h1>Survey and Case Studies at the Montreal Museum of Fine
    Arts </h1>
  <p>As a
    member of the Cataloguing Structure Committee alongside the MACM, the Montreal
    Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA) has contributed to the DOCAM project in two ways:
    first, by conducting a Survey of New Media Cataloguing Practices in some North
    American, European and Australian institutions; and secondly, by completing two
    case studies of new media works from its contemporary art collection. </p>
  <h2>Survey</h2>
  <p>The MMFA
    prepared a survey of 13 questions which address collections management issues
    specific to the acquisition, classification, documentation, installation,
    conservation and migration of new media works. The MMFA contacted 143 North
    American, European and Australian museums and galleries. Forty-three of these
    institutions responded, citing the timeliness and appropriateness of the DOCAM
    initiative. Several conclusions have been drawn from the survey findings:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>First, when acquiring new media works, some institutions continue to apply
      existing procedures used for traditional artwork. Other organizations are
      formulating specialized contracts and artist questionnaires and developing
      tailor-made databases.      </li>
    <li>Second, new media works are classified under various categories such as Art
      with a Technological Component, Electronic Media, Media Art, etc. It would be
      preferable that standardized cataloguing terminology for new media works be
      agreed upon by museum professionals. 
       </li>
    <li>Third, art institutions typically archive master versions of new media works
      and exhibit duplicates. Some institutions store these new media works in
      specialized cabinets, whereas others store them in spaces alongside painting,
      sculpture and other media.
  
    </li>
    <li>Fourth, the obsolescence of technological components in new media works is a
      growing concern for museums. It is common practice to migrate, repair, and, if
      necessary, replace specific elements of new media works. 
    
    </li>
    <li>Finally, the maintenance of multifaceted new media works necessitates ongoing
      collaboration among specialists in curatorial, conservation and audio-visual
      departments. 
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>The
    results gathered from the survey led the MMFA to review its own collection
    management procedures for new media works and consequently to conduct two case
    studies: 1) <i>In Your Dreams</i> (1998) by Gisele Amantea; and 2) <i>Royal Canadian Mounted Police</i> (1989) by Nam June Paik. The MMFA&rsquo;s
    research team carried out a comprehensive study of each work. First, the team
    reviewed the object file, noting each work&rsquo;s exhibition history and condition
    reports. Next, the team completed a photographic inventory of all of the works&rsquo;
    components, detailing the monitors, power supplies, cables, lights, fans, etc.
    With the aid of technicians, the team then installed each work; the
    step-by-step process was documented and photographed. Lastly, the team
    generated reports on the case study findings. Moreover, the MMFA&rsquo;s database was
    restructured to include these results and better correspond to the specificity
    of new media works.</p>
  <h3><i>In Your Dreams</i></h3>
  <p>The
    MMFA&rsquo;s first case study examined the video installation <i>In Your Dreams</i> by Gisele Amantea. In this work, 31
    snow globes &ndash; presented in two long horizontal rows &ndash; rest on a
    large, white wooden structure. Each globe supports a mirror which allows the
    viewer to observe short film sequences projected from tiny colour monitors
    hidden within the structure below. Through extensive research and analysis, the
    MMFA documented: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      the migration of the work &ndash; the VHS tapes purchased at the time of
      acquisition have been converted to DVD;
    </li>
    <li> the modification of the substructure &ndash; the aesthetic appearance of the
      work has not changed, but the installation process has been facilitated for
      technicians;
    </li>
    <li> the deterioration of the monitors &ndash; the longevity of the work is at risk;
      and
      </li>
    <li>the complexity of the installation procedure &ndash; the loan of this work to
      other institutions requires specialized technicians.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>These
    results closely relate to the MMFA&rsquo;s survey findings. This case study was
    concluded with an artist interview that will help the MMFA to better determine
    future preservation and exhibition strategies for <i>In Your Dreams</i>.</p>
  <h3>Royal Canadian Mounted Police</h3>
  <p>As its
    second case study, the research team closely examined Nam June Paik&rsquo;s <i>Royal
    Canadian Mounted Police</i>.
    Here, a figure composed of 10 vintage television and radio casings sits on a
    wooden horse. Each casing holds a colour television that is connected to a
    Laserdisc player at the base of the structure. Malfunctioning components have
    kept this video installation in storage since its acquisition. These
    obsolescent components could be migrated to extend the artwork&rsquo;s longevity.
    This information illustrates another survey result: a majority of respondents
    mentioned their continued reliance on the opinion of the artist to make
    collection management decisions regarding new media works. This reinforces the
    necessity of formulating detailed agreements between artists and museums at the
    time of acquisition. Today, the MMFA is faced with the challenge of obtaining
    authorization from Paik Studios for any issues relating to <i>Royal Canadian
    Mounted Police</i>.
    Without authorization, the MMFA is unable to conserve and exhibit this work in
    an appropriate manner.</p>
  <h2>Preliminary Results</h2>
  <p>The
    research teams of the Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;art contemporain de Montr&eacute;al and the Montreal
    Museum of Fine Arts validate and complement two existing collection management
    approaches specifically designed for new media works: 1) <i>Variable Media</i>, and 2) <i>Media Matters</i>. </p>
  <h3>Variable Media</h3>
  <p>Developed,
    for the most part, by the Guggenheim Museum, in cooperation with the Daniel
    Langlois Foundation and other organizations, <i>Variable Media</i> (Depocas, Ippolito &amp; Jones,
    2004) recommends that museums use a detailed questionnaire as its primary tool
    to document the artist&rsquo;s viewpoint concerning the material and behavioural
    components of his/her work. At the time of acquisition, the artist outlines
    which elements are crucial to the integrity of the work. Therefore, the
    questionnaire can be useful in resolving existing collection management
    problems. </p>
  <h3>Media Matters</h3>
  <p>The
    second collection management approach, <i>Media Matters</i> (Tate Research, 2004), was
    developed by the Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art,
    Tate and New Art Trust. This method focuses on the need for an international
    agreement among museums regarding time-based media works and specifically
    targets the loan process. <i>Media Matters</i> guidelines can be consulted on-line and
    include a sample budget, a condition report, a facilities report, an
    installation document and a loan agreement. </p>
  <p><i>Variable
    Media</i> and <i>Media
    Matters</i> are
    excellent strategies when seeking to update existing collection management
    procedures while taking into consideration the requirements of new media works. </p>
  <p>The
    research conducted by the Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;art contemporain de Montr&eacute;al and the Montreal
    Museum of Fine Arts demonstrates some of the challenges that museums are facing
    with new media works. The research teams concluded that artist interviews and
    questionnaires, inventory lists, documented installation procedures and
    customized databases greatly facilitate the cataloguing, conservation and
    exhibition of new media works in museum collections. The survey and case study
    findings will help to update collection management procedures and protect our
    new media heritage for the future, thereby benefiting the entire museum
    community.</p>

    with an interest in exhibiting and collecting new media art are faced with many
    complex issues. Not only do such works challenge the fundamental notion of what
    makes art unique and original, as is the case for a number of contemporary art
    practices (Couture, 2005), but they also make it difficult to define exactly
    the intrinsic composition of the works, or at least the required technology for
    survival. In the first place, we have the technology itself (image or sound)
    which is at risk of deterioration over time and may become incapable of
    delivering its content. In fact, such artworks are all transformed into media
    to varying degrees by equipment. For such components, the issues of their
    status within the work and of their ability to be maintained and operated become
    critical and determine to a large extent what strategies are applied to their
    conservation, both in the short and the long term. This aspect of feasibility
    is not technical as such, as it involves the very essence of the work: the
    things that convey its meaning, according to the artist&rsquo;s intentions. Media art
    works not only are representative of the values and content of their specific
    time in history (Laurenson, 2004), but also act as part of the history of
    technology development. Although well-documented, this history is occasionally
    very difficult to understand, given that the quest for innovation and the
    upgrading of technology tend to make its initial manifestations vanish. Where
    the work of art is concerned, this unavoidable obsolescence runs counter to its
    reason for being, which places it in a fixed position on the continuum of time. </p>
  <p>Part of
    the museum&rsquo;s mission is to preserve the objects with which it is entrusted. In
    preserving objects, the museum strives to define and maintain the authenticity
    of the work. However, conservation traditionally establishes authenticity based
    on the identification of the original materials making up the work (Laurenson,
    2006). Once such materials have been identified, the conservator must analyze
    them, assessing their stability and state of preservation. Measuring
    deterioration enables assessment of what Pip Laurenson describes as the degree
    of loss of the original, and thus in good part the authenticity of the work
    (Laurenson, 2004). The concept of material originality therefore is obviously
    strongly linked to the traditional notion of the artist&rsquo;s technical expertise
    and of his/her manipulation of the material. Technical knowledge impacts the
    production of media art works, with several artists having a claim to their
    creation, often relying on the creativity and knowledge of technicians in the
    particular media to convey their artistic vision. New principles of
    contemporary art conservation consider replacing industrial components of some
    works of art with similar components, in the case not only of purely mechanical
    or electrical components, but also of aesthetic ones. Such replacements of
    &ldquo;originals&rdquo; that have become too damaged or impossible to repair have led to
    expanding the ethical concepts of conservation (Beerken and Hummelen, 1999). </p>
  <p>In the
    long term, certain types of equipment such as out-of-date video projectors that
    can no longer be repaired and are discontinued could be replaced by later
    models featuring different technology but  having the same basic functions in
    terms of image production, i.e. to display the image. The problem arising here
    is that in many instances, new equipment performs faster and/or produces a
    different quality of image in terms of resolution, contrast, or proportion. But
    for many media works, significant upgrading poses no problem, and artists
    appreciate the incorporation of newer technology into the functionality of
    their works. </p>
  <p>Ethical
    issues involving technology transfers arise, certainly within the context of
    museum preservation. Let&rsquo;s take, for example, a 1960s analog video work
    projected on a large-scale museum wall using technology from the 1990s instead
    of a CRT monitor. Soon, CRT monitors will be obsolete, and analog technology is
    already quite unstable. Moreover, under what conditions is transferring to
    digital technology inevitable if we are to preserve such artworks?</p>
  <p>It is
    understood that media professionals have access to equipment and techniques to
    reproduce originals, using either the same medium as the original or other
    media that are more easily exhibited, but not necessarily with the same
    quality. It has been well established as part of the ethics of technology
    preservation that the most stable medium is selected: the medium that has the
    capacity to store the most data from the original and to be used as a master
    from which copies may be made. A hierarchy for preservation is formulated using
    such reference copies (submasters of the original).  As opposed to exhibition
    copies, these will be stored under optimal conditions and never be viewed. For
    instance, a digital work on DVD is considered an exhibition copy, whereas its
    DigiBeta version is the submaster. In the same way, when a film work is
    acquired, it must include not only a positive for exhibition, but also an internegative,
    to guarantee preservation over time and the ability to make new copies. </p>
  <p>At the
    time of acquisition, the equipment that makes the exhibition of a work possible
    is not always included. Depending on the artwork&rsquo;s complexity, the artist may
    insist that specific models of equipment be purchased. However, the institution
    may elect to rely on the multimedia equipment it already owns or borrow a
    certain type of equipment for the duration of the exhibit. In either case,
    preservation of the artwork will depend on the acquisition of additional
    apparatus after the assessment of stability and costs involved, even though the
    use of spare parts and continued technical maintenance jeopardize the long-term
    functionality of the artwork. </p>
  <p>The
    ensured long-term preservation of media artworks is a fundamental museum
    practice. Museums are no longer just acquiring unique objects dependent on the
    stability of their constituent materials. With media art, stability becomes
    dependent on other materially &lsquo;representative&rsquo; copies of the same thing.
    Museums must ensure that the artwork can be reproduced successively and not
    just presented once. </p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>Although
    media artworks are increasingly found in museum collections, the requirements
    associated with their documentation, conservation and exhibition often remain
    as barriers that museums hesitate to cross at the time of acquisition. </p>
  <p>The work
    of the DOCAM Research Alliance is innovative and brings together museum
    professionals and university researchers in an effort to achieve a better
    understanding and appreciation of media art. Results demonstrate that
    initiatives such as DOCAM give rise to the design of tools and methods that can
    complement current museum practices in terms of describing and conserving media
    works. </p>
  <p>The Variable
    Media, Media Matters and DOCAM Web sites are worth further exploration. They
    show how museum and cultural communities benefit from research findings because
    of the Web&rsquo;s ideal interactive platform for learning, research and exchange.
    These sites are also effective instruments for disseminating information,
    documents, recommendations, guidelines or practical tools, all of which benefit
    museum professionals, teachers, students and, ultimately, the creators
    themselves. </p>
