      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Spatial awareness, the ability to relate where objects are
        in space, is an important part of our daily lives. We are constantly creating
        spatial relationships, whether it is as simple as packing many items into the
        car or remembering where you parked the car at the shopping centre.
        Visualisation of locations on maps is well understood by the community; maps
      themselves are a familiar part of our lives and a familiar interface. </p>
      <p>Museums deal with large digital collections categorised and
        described under strict guidelines. Typical searches are based on these
        categories and the use of keywords. Similarly, large collections can be
        searched spatially by their location on the Earth, and keyword searches for
        locations used. However, the true power of spatial relationships is
        demonstrated when you visualise the information by its location interactively
        across the entire globe. This experience allows the users to navigate their
        world, drilling into more information as they zoom in, and exploring new
      detailed information for a region as they pan.</p>
      <p>The effective visualisation of large sets of information
        poses several problems. The sheer number of records multiplied by the data of
        each record is typically handled in non-spatial searches and browsed by paging
        the data. This concept does not work spatially; instead, we must use other
        powerful techniques to reduce transmission size. Spatially we can deal with the
        current viewport of the users; that is, the section of the Earth they can
        currently see on screen - loading only information for that area can vastly
        reduce the data transmitted. Clustering data, a technique of grouping
        closely-located data based on the size of the display and elevation, is
        effective at summarising dense areas. On the interactive map, as you zoom into
        a dense cluster, more space becomes available on your screen for that area to
        show, and the cluster separates. Eventually you reach single locations as you
      zoom right into the detailed region.</p>
      <p>Prints and printmaking Australia Asia Pacific provides a
        gateway for information on printed images from Australia and the Asia Pacific
        region. The focus of the site is prints and printmaking by artists from
        Australia, Aboriginal Australia, the Torres Strait Islands, Papua New Guinea,
        Maori and Pakeha Aotearoa New Zealand, and the Pacific region, including New
        Caledonia, Nuie, Samoa, Kiribati, and the Solomon Islands. The site also
        includes references to prints and printmaking in China, India, Indonesia,
      Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. </p>
      <p>Based on the collection at the National Gallery of
        Australia, the site provides free on-line access to 17,000 images. The
        databases can be searched by artist, subject or print techniques such as
        etching, woodcut, wood-engraving, linocut, lithograph, screenprint, monotype,
        and other print-related processes such as posters and artists&rsquo; books. An index
        to on-line information on printmakers, print workshops, print publishers, print
      galleries and public and private collections is provided. </p>
      <p>This service is an initiative of Roger Butler, Senior
        Curator of Australian Prints and Drawings, National Gallery of Australia. This
        access initiative is generously supported by the Gordon Darling Australia
      Pacific Print Fund. (<a href="http://www.printsandprintmaking.gov.au/">http://www.printsandprintmaking.gov.au</a>)</p>
      <h1>What Is Spatial Data?</h1>
      <p>Also known as geospatial data or geographic information, it
        is the data or information that identifies the geographic location of features
        and boundaries on Earth, such as natural or constructed features, oceans, and
      more  (<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/">http://www.webopedia.com</a>).</p>
      <p>Within our digital collection we often have location
        information. This may be a place of birth, a gallery address, a location where
        the work was made, or the place the work depicts. These locations will vary in
      quality and accuracy. Not all records will necessarily contain a value.</p>
      <p>The Prints database contains a number of location fields.
        Within the Creator / Artist catalogue we find high quality data for Birth
        Place, Death Place and the Movements of the creator. The printed works
        themselves have a Place Made field, and the Subject of the work is sometimes a
        location. These locations are textual and are at best a city or town with
        corresponding state and country. Galleries, on the other hand, have a real
      world address, typically with an actual street name and number. </p>
      <p>Additionally, we can derive location information from
        related catalogues. Works are exhibited at Galleries, allowing us to provide
        not only a set of locations for exhibitions but also an interesting set of
        locations for the works themselves. Similarly, we can derive locations from the
        artist of a work, but we must ask ourselves what  the relevance of visualising
        printed works by some of these related fields is. For example, the
        effectiveness of showing works by the death place of the artist is very low.
        Some derived locations make sense and add significant value, while others
      certainly do not.</p>
      <p>What turns traditional collections into spatial data?</p>
      <h1>Geocoding</h1>
      <p>Geocoding is the activity of defining the position of
        geographical objects relative to a standard reference (<a
href="http://www.sli.unimelb.edu.au/gisweb/glossary.htm">http://www.sli.unimelb.edu.au/gisweb/glossary.htm</a>).
        When visualising locations spatially, we use numerical co-ordinates, not
        textual locations, to allow for fast plotting on the map and also mathematical
      comparisons and calculations.</p>
      <p>In practical terms, this geocoding is the process of
        converting the textual location of varying accuracy and quality into a Latitude
        and Longitude that uniquely identifies every location on Earth. We observe five
      main categories of textual locations:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>No data. There is nothing we can do here. We cannot plot this value on
          the map. A common mistake is to plot at (0,0); this is not correct as this is a
          real- world location on the equator near Africa.</li>
        <li>General Area. This may simply be a country, state, city or Zip/Post
          code. A common technique is to plot the location at the centroid or middle of
          the area. This alone can be very misleading. Again, the actual co-ordinate will
          be an exact location on the earth: the middle of a city may very well be over a
          house or building. We need to supplement the location with an accuracy value or
          &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; to recognise this. Our visualisation techniques can then use this
          value to provide more meaning within the interface.</li>
        <li>Exact Street Address. The quality of the geocoder will either
          approximate the street number as a proportion of the length of the segment of
          road, called &ldquo;street interpolation&rdquo;, or provide an accurate location called
          &ldquo;Rooftop Geocoding&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>Ambiguous location. Take, for example, 1 Margaret Street, Queensland,
          Australia. There are half a dozen possible matches. At this point a decision
          needs to be made. For large automated geocodes, this record will have to fall
          back to the general area of Queensland, Australia. In would be up to a subject
          matter expert to review other relevant information or a set of more advanced
          rules. For example, the lack of city or town may indicate it  refers to
          Brisbane, the capital city.</li>
        <li>Not found. The address may not be found due to a number of factors. The
          textual location may contain spelling errors, or use a non-standard address
          representation. Over time the spelling of locations can change: a valid address
          from the 1800s may no longer exist today. Conflicting values; for example, the
          wrong Zip/Post code, can lead to no results. Additionally, the database from
          the geocoder may not contain that location. Again the location may fall back to
          the subject matter expert or a general area.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Prints database contains all of these possible options.
        Due to the size of the database it is not practical to manually review each
        record. By reporting on the confidence of each level of detail within the
        location for each field, we can find a suitable level. The levels in order of
      most to least accurate are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rooftop</li>
        <li>Street
          Address</li>
        <li>Street</li>
        <li>Suburb</li>
        <li>Zip/Post
          code</li>
        <li>Town
          / City</li>
        <li>State</li>
        <li>Country</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The geocoding for the Prints site was completed using
        Microsoft&rsquo;s MapPoint Web Service (MWS). This geocoder offers extensive coverage
        of much of the populated world. The process is performed in bulk and separately
        from the Web site logic. As our data is unlikely to change, we perform this
        operation once and store the Latitude, Longitude and tolerance against the
        record. Within our database a &ldquo;GeoCodeStatus&rdquo; allows us to identify new or
      edited records that need to be updated, and those that failed to find a result.</p>
      <p>As a Web service it is relatively easy to set up this
        process. The most complex part is creating logic to handle the various quality
        and accuracy of data. The accuracy of the results from the geocoder varied from
        country to country. Currently only the US supports the highest quality of
      Rooftop geocoding results. </p>
      <p>No information is available for the physical size of the
        cities, countries, etc. so the implementation of the tolerance was based on the
        eight detail level codes above. This allows us to tailor the visual
        representation of this tolerance independently of what was stored. Currently
      this is applied as a circular polygon to show there is no clear point.</p>
      <p>How do we use this location within our existing Web site?</p>
      <h1>Alternative Search Results View</h1>
      <p>Within the collection search of an existing Web site, the
        simplest integration is as an alternative search results view. Typically a list
        of results is presented in textual form; retrofitting a tab or navigation
        button to View results spatially can be integrated into the design. This will
        load the complete set of results on an interactive map. This simple approach
        makes use of the powerful search already implemented in the site. The
        interactive map allows the user to essentially filter the results spatially and
      navigate to the more detailed view.</p>
      <p>For example, a search on intaglio prints would return 13,654
        records. Textually we can sort alphabetically, by date, by catalogue raisonn&eacute;,
        or filter on images only. For Web performance, only small sets of results are
        ever returned: the user must explore page by page. Spatially, we can show all
        these results on the map, clustering data to show the density of results around
        the world. Immediately this gives the user visual insight into the geographical
        distribution. If the user is interested in prints from a region of New Zealand,
        a simple interaction of zooming and panning gets to the region of interest.
        Essentially we add a dynamic filter to results and present them in new visual
      interactive interface.</p>
      <p>What do we do with those entries that don&rsquo;t have a location? </p>
      <p>The biggest issue we face is incomplete data and data
        accuracy. Unlike a date search where we can create an unknown category, we
        simply can&rsquo;t show results on the map without a location. A common mistake is to
        plot these results at (0,0), a location near Africa in the ocean. This is
        misleading and confusing to the user. An alternative is to provide
        informational text to notify the user that only X of Y results have been
      plotted overall on the map for the given criteria.</p>
      <p>A more powerful section to the site is a dedicated Spatial
        Browse for the collection. This section provides an unrestricted view of the
        entire collection spatially. The addition of complementary filters can
      dynamically modify what is on the map in real time. </p>
      <p>The most effective filter that complemented the map was a
        timeline. The ability to filter the data visualised on the map by periods in
        history provides amazing insights. Additionally, filters that provide a
        selection for a known set of values; for example the print type, are quite
      effective.</p>
      <p>What did we find interesting as we explored spatially?</p>
      <p>It is only early in this process, but this style of
        interface actually immediately allows you to view the entire collection,
        something impossible as giant text list of results. Clearly the view is
        summarized, and navigating to a pre-determined record by anything apart from
        location is difficult, bordering on impossible, with such a large dataset. This
        will not replace the text search. What you do get is immediate visualisation of
        the size and geographic extent of the collection, something that is not
        apparent from a piece of text saying &ldquo;1-50 of 45,000&rdquo;. The clich&eacute; of &ldquo;a picture
      tells a thousand words&rdquo; is multiplied several times here.</p>
      <p>Major densities are initially interesting, but to go a step
        further and explore how these change and build over a timeline is amazing.
      Also, distribution across the world over a timeline is equally interesting.</p>
      <p>Lastly, outliers, single points at strange locations which
        you did not expect, are quite interesting to explore. This style of browsing
      for these records would be impossible any other way.</p>
      <h1>Leading Web-Based Mapping Technologies</h1>
      <h2>Microsoft Virtual Earth </h2>
      <p>Virtual Earth is a Web 2.0 browser-based mapping platform.
        It uses AJAX technology without the requirement of any browser plug-ins to
        provide an incredible amount of visual mapping data. The entire world is broken
        into small tiles; these are reconstructed on demand in your browser to display
        road networks and aerial photography. This imagery is then enhanced by high
        resolution &ldquo;Birdseye&rdquo; images giving a unique 45 degree angle view of all sides
      of buildings and features.</p>
      <p>A 3D mode is available as a downloadable plug-in. To support
        3D, the software must access the 3D hardware from your computer not available
        to HTML; hence the plug-in. Within this 3D environment users can more fluidly
        navigate, rotate and tilt the planet. The world becomes a true sphere without
        the distortions present in the flattened 2D mode. In 2D mode, the map uses the
        Mercator projection to flatten the earth. The combination of a full terrain
      elevation model and 3D building brings cities and locations to life.</p>
      <p>Combined with both of these are rich mapping functions,
        including the finding of locations or business types and step-by-step driving
      directions. User-generated content can be overlaid in several ways. </p>
      <p>The first is as interactive points, lines and polygons. The
        points are typically called &ldquo;Pushpins&rdquo; and represent a single location on the
        planet. Lines are great for marking a path while polygons can represent an
        area. These objects have an &ldquo;infobox&rdquo; or popup that can contain any HTML
        content you desire. This is a perfect place for the some summary data for the
      record and a thumbnail image.</p>
      <p>Second is the support for an overlay of tiles. Using the
        same high performing and scalable tile system, the overlay can provide visual
        information or improved imagery. Typically this layer is just for a small
        region on the earth and is pre-generated. The layer can be masked and a
        transparency applied. The layer can also be dynamically created and is often
        used in this way for a heat map providing semi-transparent coloured areas
      representing some relevant information.</p>
      <h2>Google Maps / Google Earth</h2>
      <p>Google Maps is very similar to Virtual Earth 2D,in that it
        is based on the same AJAX concepts and has the same tile system. However,
        Google offers different features, data and imagery. Although coding uses the
        same concepts and language, the syntax is very different. The power of
        competition is great for consumers; Google Maps outperform Virtual Earth in
        some areas and underperform in others. Both companies update their software
      regularly to compete.</p>
      <p>Google Earth brought 3D mapping to consumers. A very
        innovative product, this application is installed on your computer and uses
        your Internet connection to stream in the images and information on demand.
        This differs from Virtual Earth&rsquo;s 3D &ldquo;in browser&rdquo; experience. A more evolved
        product, Google Earth offers strong support for user-generated content,
      including 3D models.</p>
      <h2>Sharing And Aggregating Collections Spatially</h2>
      <p>Both mapping technologies allow the rendering of data in a
        proprietary format for complete control or from a Standard XML format. GeoRSS,
        an extension on RSS, where additional nodes for location have been added, is
        useful for providing a location for items in a newsfeed. KML (Keyhole Markup
        Language), the format behind the original Google Earth product, is more complex
        and defines many complex structures and features. These files are a complete
        set of data. This is not ideal for very large databases. Currently there is no
        clear solution for how to provide a large collection to be aggregated into
      another system.</p>
      <p>Both Google and Microsoft offer a personalised mapping
        experience with <a href="http://maps.google.com/">http://maps.google.com</a> &lsquo;my maps&rsquo; and <a href="http://maps.live.com/">http://maps.live.com</a>        &lsquo;collections&rsquo;. Both of these allow you to create your own content on the map or
        import data, save a new collection, and publish this in a shared format. Again
      this is limited to small dataset sizes.</p>
      <h1>Early Adopters Of These Technologies</h1>
      <p>Real Estate has been the fastest by far to adopt this
        technology into their Web sites. In their case, the houses are typically easy
        to Geocode. Where there is an issue, the Estate agent can correct the location
        and even enhance the listing by drawing the boundary of the property. The
        different implementations give insights into how to use this technology
        effectively. When showing just a single house it is useful to identify where
        the house is, but doing so doesn&rsquo;t add a significant amount of value, whereas
        seeing all the houses for sale in as area, filtering by features and price and
      exploring their proximity to shops, schools and transport is infinitely better. </p>
      <p>Photo sites for consumers and professionals have all
        integrated some sort of mapping interface for viewing  photos spatially. Most
        of these sites actually use the map as the interface to locate the photo or
        rely on the supply of a GPS position. This removes the need for Geocoding and
        places the responsibility to accurately locate the photo&rsquo;s position on the
      user.</p>
      <p>Emergency response planning and asset tracking industries
        are using the rich interface and ability to overlay both interactive shapes and
        new tile layers to provide real time, on-line interfaces to their rich data.
        These solutions are typically more complex as they require data from remote
        devices (most often GPS&rsquo;s) to be integrated with user input in real time. These
      systems rely on logic to trigger alerts and statuses.</p>
      <p>Finally, major retail chains are using mapping, often
      enhanced by current events and driving directions, to provide store locators.</p>
      <h2>Integration Into Portable Devices</h2>
      <p>Sales of personal navigation devices are booming. These come
        in various flavours, including stand alone devices, factory-installed devices
        in vehicles, and software for smart phones and PDAs. The devices use the GPS to
        pinpoint your location on the earth and can tell and show you how to get to
      your destination.</p>
      <p>But the devices do not stop there. Aside from music, photo
        and videos&rsquo; most current devices will integrate with your telephone to bring
        hands-free voice calls. This data connection opens up the ability to access the
        Internet to retrieve content, specifically spatial content for a current
        location. Currently this is being used for live traffic integration where,
        unlike one way, broadcast-only transmissions, this technology allows the unit
        to provide speed and location data back to the service to further enhance
      traffic data.</p>
      <p>This opens up opportunities to provide other location-specific
        information to the user. Combined with user profile information, dynamic tour
      guides can be created, drawing on spatial data from various sources.</p>
      <p>An opportunity exists for Museums to be content providers
        for these devices. This does not necessarily mean you have to develop custom
        applications. If your collection is made available spatially on the Web,
      applications can utilise the content for many diverse purposes. </p>
      <h1>The Future</h1>
      <p>Heavy investment into spatial technology by the leaders in
        Web search does indicate the likelihood of searching spatially for more and
        more data in the near future. It may not be long before your on-line collection
        goes beyond today&rsquo;s textual and image searches and returns results for
      locations both textual and from GPS.</p>
      <p>Geolocation, the process of determining users&rsquo; locations
        from their Internet addresses, can be used to show collection items more
        relevant to those users. This works by referencing a lookup database of IP
        addresses or wifi points to determine from users&rsquo; connections their approximate
        locations on the Earth. Within the Prints site, for example, this technology
        could allow the site to focus on content within close proximity to a user,
      perhaps specific printmakers from Sydney or just from the country Australia.</p>
      <p>Digital photography is rapidly introducing location
        information for images. The Exchangeable image file format (Exif), the standard
        for metadata for photos, has fields for location. New digital cameras are
        increasingly becoming equipped or optioned with GPS. Leading photo sites
        already allow for photos to be displayed on Google Maps and Virtual Earth based
      on these tags.</p>
      <p>Looking further ahead, Photosynth is an amazing new
        technology from Microsoft Live Labs; it will change forever the way you think
        about digital photos. The software takes a large collection of photos of a
        place or an object, analyses them for similarities, and displays them in a
      reconstructed three-dimensional space (<a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/">http://labs.live.com/photosynth/</a>).</p>
      <p>Photosynth offers some amazing possibilities. The most
        interesting are the aggregation of images from many sources and the power of
        enriching images with metadata from other sources. Essentially the technology
        can match images based on features. This builds relationships between images
        from different sources. The ability to drill into the wealth of information
        from those sources is very interesting. Take, for example, a statue at a
        Museum. The Museum would have a wealth of information about the artists
        involved, its original location or where it was made, how it was made, etc. A
        visitor to the Museum would only need to take a photo of the statue and find
        the match within Photosynth to access that wealth of information about that
      statue for their photograph.</p>
      <p>The same concept can be applied to general spatial data. New
      relationships can be formed based on location.</p>
      <p>These combined technologies could allow for a number of
        interesting experiences in the future. For example, a visitor walking around
        Pompeii in Italy could be viewing on their mobile phone documented museum
        pieces originating from Pompeii but housed in various Museum Collections around
        the world. The visitor would be accessing the rich content, in real time and on
      demand, directly from the Museums. The key is the GPS location.</p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>As with any project that relies on a large set of data, a
        significant amount of time is required to analyse and cleanse. The powerful
        Web-based mapping technologies made accessible by the large software vendors
        gives us the best opportunity to get this content out on the Web for a rich and
        interactive experience. These rich features and imagery are not something we
      would want to re-invent.</p>
      <p>The Prints Web site will continue to improve; more entries
        will receive locations; and existing entries will become more accurate. Once a
        process is in place, new entries can be added with ease. For such a large
        dataset, it is unlikely that all records will ever be complete. This is
        certainly not a reason to delay release of this information. A reasonable
      judgment has to be made as to what is complete and accurate enough to be live. </p>
      <p>The innovative interface has provided another way to
        visualise and browse our search results; as well, it has become an interface
        for browsing and filtering in its own right. With the hard work of geocoding in
        place, the collection is ready to be searched and aggregated into new
      innovative technologies. </p>
      <p>Now is a great time to start looking at how your collection
        could be explored spatially. The technology exists to effective visualise the
        collection on-line, and the opportunities for exposing such information to
      other innovative ideas are just around the corner.</p>
