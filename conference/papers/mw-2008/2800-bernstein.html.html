      <p class="AbstractText">As discussed in the 2007 Museums and the Web paper and
        presentation, &quot;Building an On-line Community at the Brooklyn Museum: A
        Timeline,&quot; (<a
href="http://www.archimuse.com/mw2007/papers/caruth/caruth.html">http://www.archimuse.com/ mw2007/papers/caruth/caruth.html</a>) </span>in 2006, the Brooklyn Museum set out to further engage its existing
        on-line audiences and continue to build an interactive Web community. We
        described how we utilized offsite Web 2.0 sites and services to engage our
        younger audience demographic, to extend the physical visit, and to provide
        interactive tools for contemporary learning. We discussed how in spring 2007,
        after notable success with these projects, we made the decision to bring
        community back home, integrating sites such as Flickr and YouTube into the
        Museum's own Web site. Our 2008 paper picks up where we left off last year by
        detailing some of the projects, developments, and realizations we&rsquo;ve made over
        the past year - including blogging, electronic comment books, a Facebook
        application, a YouTube-based video competition, and an experiment with Twitter
        - in our ongoing effort to link Web and gallery interaction, both physically
        and virtually. </p>

      <h1 class="PaperTitle">Introduction</h1>
      <p>As we moved forward
        with Web 2.0 and social media in 2007, we had two objectives in mind while
        overhauling earlier initiatives and creating new projects for visitors:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep it real: We
          aimed to personalize content as much as possible, since Web 2.0 for the
          Brooklyn Museum is all about social connections and growing communities. </span></a></li>
        <li><span class="listwithbullets">Deliver content
          their way: Museum surveys have shown that visitors want to consume more
          information in shorter visits. Hence, we wanted to allow our audiences to
          easily receive information from the Museum, and dynamically share it with
          others. </span></span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>We continued to focus
        on our community-oriented, visitor-centered mission, and these goals became
        paramount as we thought about (and adjusted) our early initiatives; they also
        served as philosophical barometers when we created new projects. </span></p>
      <h1>Facebook: Groups, Pages, and ArtShare</h1>
      <p>&quot;Social&quot; is the
        operative word in social networking. Simply defined as &quot;seeking or enjoying the
        companionship of others; friendly; sociable; gregarious,&quot; this can be a
        challenging proposition for a large institution seeking to participate in a
        site where individual and personal connections are key. How do you give an
        organization a face? How can an institution make personal connections? Unlike
        MySpace, Facebook has a strict policy: profiles = individual people, not institutions,
        no exceptions. The reason is pretty simple: the site is based on social
        interaction and relationships. So how can a Museum work within Facebook's
        structure? </span></p>
      <p>In the early days of
        Facebook, one could establish a personal account, start a group (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2211294957">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2211294957</a>)</span> for the organization, and administer the group by posting announcements,
        pictures and videos. The benefit of this system was that members could connect
        a face (and perhaps a personality) to the organization, rather than
        encountering a disembodied Museum voice. On Facebook, it&rsquo;s pretty clear who is
        running things, because the administrators have personal profiles of their own,
        featuring information about themselves and clearly identifying what roles they
        play at the Museum. This idea of getting to know the person who is
        administering the Museum&rsquo;s page is critical when representing an institution on
        a social networking site. It is fundamental to being part of a community,
        rather than operating for the sake of marketing or public relations.</span></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a><a href="bernstein-fig1.html"><img src="bernstein_fig1_thumb.jpg" alt="Fiigure 1" width="379" height="278" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="bernstein-fig1.html">Fig 1: Shelley
        Bernstein&rsquo;s personal profile on the social networking site, Facebook</span></a></p>
      <p>Over time, Facebook has made some changes to
        its original model, and to stay in step with the community of users on Facebook
        it was important for the Brooklyn Museum to adjust. In Spring 2007, Facebook
        opened up its social networking architecture so that anyone could create
        applications for the site via its Application Programming Interface (API),
        allowing independent developers to create applications they could share with
        other users. Facebook users began to install an astonishing variety of
        applications on their profiles, quickly making Facebook unique among social
        networking sites. The Brooklyn Museum Information Systems department responded
        by creating ArtShare (<a
href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=7723691927&amp;ref=pr">http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=7723691927&amp;ref=pr</a>)</span>,
        an application that allows Facebook users to select works of art from our
        collection, which they can shuffle on their personal profiles. Recognizing that
        social networking is never one-sided, but rather an exchange of information
        between parties, we developed this application so other Museums could use it to
        share works in their own collections; and so artists on Facebook can upload
        their own artwork to share with friends.</span></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig2" id="fig2"></a><a href="bernstein-fig2.html"><img src="bernstein_fig2_thumb.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="386" height="372" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="bernstein-fig2.html">Fig 2: ArtShare
        application&rsquo;s user interface on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=7723691927&amp;ref=pr</a></p>
      <p>So, what is the significance of ArtShare?
        ArtShare functions just like everything else on Facebook, allowing the members
        of its community to get to know one another, but in this case through art. It
        allows users (art lovers, museum-goers, and others) to connect their profiles
        and personalities to works in museums&rsquo; collections. ArtShare allows them to
        display their favorite paintings, photographs, and objects on their own terms
        and in their own social spaces. Browsing through Facebook users who have
        installed ArtShare, one begins to get a sense of the personal tastes and
        interests they have, just by looking at the works of art they&rsquo;ve selected for
        their profiles. </span></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a><a href="bernstein-fig3.html"><img src="bernstein_fig3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="206" height="361" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="bernstein-fig3.html">Fig 3: Selected
        work of art rotating on a user&rsquo;s Facebook profile in the ArtShare application.</span></a></p>
      <p>Moving away from the earlier policy of banning
        institutions from the site, in November 2007 Facebook launched &ldquo;pages,&rdquo; a new
        feature that allowed an organization or institution to create its own page. This
        feature distinguishes Facebook from other social networking sites. The open
        application structure, so important to Facebook&rsquo;s identity, also works within
        this new feature; therefore the institution&rsquo;s administrator can install various
        applications to make the organization&rsquo;s page more dynamic. When selecting and
        testing applications, we followed two vital rules of thumb. First, if at all
        possible, we selected applications that work with fully syndicated content. Second,
        we tried to find applications that allow us to connect to our existing content
        on other sites like Flickr, del.icio.us, YouTube, and our blog.</span></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig4" id="fig4"></a><a href="bernstein-fig4.html"><img src="bernstein_fig4_thumb.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="391" height="459" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="bernstein-fig4.html">Fig 4: Screenshot
        from Brooklyn Museum&rsquo;s Facebook page that shows installation of the Simply RSS
        application. This application will display fully syndicated content which
        allows the reader to view all the full text directly on Facebook without having
        to leave the site.</a> </span></p>
      <p>Why are these rules of thumb so vital? Social
        networking users don&rsquo;t like to leave the social networking sphere and go
        elsewhere for content. When we select applications to display our RSS feeds or
        YouTube videos, we want to embed as much content as possible on the same page.
        On Facebook, when possible we avoid making people leave Facebook to see our
        content. You&rsquo;ll notice that the Museum&rsquo;s Facebook page is designed so that
        visitors can easily read our blog posts and play our videos right there on the
        page. Because many talented developers have created applications on Facebook,
        we&rsquo;ve been able to establish a fully featured page (<a
href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Brooklyn-Museum/7204523707">http://www.facebook.com/pages/Brooklyn-Museum/7204523707</a>) </span>for the Brooklyn Museum, so that it provides a comprehensive snapshot of
        what&rsquo;s happening at the Museum. As a nice side effect, these pages are viewable
        by anyone on the Internet (not just members of the Facebook community) and can
        be fully indexed by search engines.</span></p>
      <h1>Flickr </h1>
      <p>Having learned lessons from our experience with
        Facebook about the significance of profile personalization, we adjusted our
        Flickr presence accordingly. For every Flickr group we manage, you&rsquo;ll notice
        another admin in addition to &ldquo;Brooklyn Museum&rdquo; - &ldquo;aur2899.&rdquo; This is my personal
        Flickr account, where I identify myself as an employee of the Museum and link
        to my posts on the Museum blog. Now Flickr users can get to know the person
        behind the Brooklyn Museum profile. In addition, any time a visitor makes a
        comment or a Museum staffer answers a question, the author&rsquo;s name appears. This
        maintains the personal and social nature of the site and moves away from an
        opaque &ldquo;Voice of Authority&rdquo; that is typically associated with museums. </span></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig5" id="fig5"></a><a href="bernstein-fig5.html"><img src="bernstein_fig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="395" height="264" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="bernstein-fig5.html">Fig 5: Screenshot
        from Flickr showing multiple administrators for the Brooklyn Museum group</span></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig6" id="fig6"></a><a href="bernstein-fig6.html"><img src="bernstein_fig6_thumb.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="271" height="98" class="caption" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="bernstein-fig6.html">Fig 6:
        Screenshot from Flickr showing details of Shelley Bernstein&rsquo;s personal Flickr
        feed, including identification of professional association with the Brooklyn
        Museum</span></a></p>
      <p>When we initiate a Flickr project, we aim to do
        something of interest both to our visitors, who seek to learn more and/or
        extend their on-site visits, and to Flickr photographers, who are personally
        invested in a particular subject. In accordance with our objective to &ldquo;keep it
        real,&rdquo; for our photography exhibition <i>Goodbye Coney Island?</i></span> (<a
href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/goodbye_coney_island/">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/goodbye_coney_island/</a>)
        w</span>e asked photographers to upload their own photos of Coney Island to a
        Flickr group (<a
href="http://flickr.com/groups/goodbye_coney_island/">http://flickr.com/groups/goodbye_coney_island/</a>)</span>.
        (As of this writing, the project is still in progress.) Unlike our previous
        Brooklyn Graffiti group (<a
href="http://flickr.com/groups/bklyn_graffiti/">http://flickr.com/groups/bklyn_graffiti/</a>)</span>,
        which was connected to our <i>Graffiti</i></span> (<a
href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/graffiti/">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/graffiti/</a>)
        e</span>xhibition, we shifted our mode of operation for this effort. In
        Brooklyn Graffiti, users could submit an unlimited number of photographs on the
        subject. In <i>Goodbye Coney Island?</i></span>,
        participants can submit only one photo to the group; but this time, the
        Brooklyn Museum&rsquo;s curator of photography, Patrick Amsellem, will review users&rsquo;
        submissions and select a few to discuss on the Museum&rsquo;s blog during the run of
        the exhibition. The curatorial presence is key to this project, because the
        curatorial voice is what matters most at a Museum and, therefore, matters most
        to the people participating in the project.</span></p>
      <h1>YouTube: Visitor Video Competition</h1>
      <p>We first began sharing
        videos with our community using the video-sharing Web site blip.tv (<a href="http://brooklynmuseum.blip.tv/">http://brooklynmuseum.blip.tv/</a>).</span> We chose to do this because video quality at blip.tv is better than most
        video-sharing sites, in that it permits unlimited file size and length. This
        allowed us to host a single video rather than, for example, splitting a long
        artist&rsquo;s talk in half, as we would have to do on YouTube in order to adhere to
        that site&rsquo;s length and size restrictions. Brooklyn Museum had a YouTube profile
        (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/BrooklynMuseum">http://www.youtube.com/user/BrooklynMuseum</a>)
        i</span>n addition to the one at blip.tv, and though we had steadily added
        content, the material didn&rsquo;t seem to capture much of an audience. We started to
        think about ways to improve our YouTube presence, and the more we thought about
        YouTube, the more we came to believe that content created by the Museum might
        not be as engaging as content created by others. Asking for visitor-created
        content seemed more in sync with the YouTube community. </span></p>
      <p>Our Public Information
        department had worked with two students at the Pratt Institute, a college in
        Brooklyn known for its art and design programs, to create a Public Service
        Announcement (PSA). The students&rsquo; short video (<a
href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=K9RHQB8dPkw">http://youtube.com/watch?v=K9RHQB8dPkw</a>) </span>inspired the idea for a video contest hosted on YouTube.&nbsp;Closely
        working with Public Information, we invited (<a
href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/vvc/">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/vvc/</a>) </span>visitors attending our October 2007 <i>Target First Saturday</i></span> (a free monthly event at the Museum featuring
        films, performances, dance parties, and other entertainment) to bring video
        cameras and create their own PSAs for the Museum. </span></p>
      <p>Similar to Flickr,
        YouTube is a site where users create and upload their own material, retaining
        full rights to their content. Instead of asking for copyright or blanket use,
        as is the norm in such competitions, we simply asked contestants to upload
        their PSAs to their personal YouTube accounts. As a result, viewers can access
        each contestant&rsquo;s personal YouTube profile and learn more about him or her.
        Because we respect the hard work of participants and want to acknowledge them
        as individuals, we felt this was important to the project. On our end, we
        linked to the submissions on our Web site using YouTube playlists (<a
href="http://youtube.com/view_play_list?p=77760CA9EE2ED053">http://youtube.com/view_play_list?p=77760CA9EE2ED053</a>)
        a</span>nd standard embed code, which allowed for easy identification of the
        participants and also ensured that the view count for each video would be
        featured on the contributors&rsquo; personal profiles. </span></p>

      <p>The power of this
        exercise lies in the spontaneity and diversity of the participants and what
        their fresh, unbound perspectives can bring to our daily working environment.
        We happily discovered that PSAs created by our visitors are quite different
        from what the institution would typically produce; for example, you&rsquo;d probably
        never see a video called &ldquo;Art Thief&rdquo; (<a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxpSS12qdRA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxpSS12qdRA</a>)</span> - one of our most-viewed visitor-contributed PSAs on YouTube - produced by the
        Museum. We received a total of eleven entries, all of which were as creative
        and exciting as our <i>Target First Saturday</i></span> events, and all offered a unique tone and theme. The judging
        panel included <span style='color:black'>Christina Norman, President of MTV
        Music Television; Danny Simmons of Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation; and
        Patrick Amsellem, the Brooklyn Museum&rsquo;s Associate Curator of Photography</span>.
        In addition, many Museum staff (<a
href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/2007/11/02/good-luck/">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community /blogosphere/ bloggers/2007/11/02/good-luck/</a>) </span>and supporters enjoyed viewing the entries, including our Director,
        Arnold Lehman. </span></p>
      <p>As a testament to the
        power of user-generated content, we were excited to discover that the videos
        submitted for the competition were viewed four to five times more than anything
        else we had previously posted on YouTube. And when YouTube decided to feature
        our contest in its &ldquo;Groups&rdquo; area, the view counts increased exponentially.</span></p>
      <h1>Electronic Comment Books</h1>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig8" id="fig8"></a><a href="bernstein-fig8.html"><img src="bernstein_fig8.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="400" height="226" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="bernstein-fig8.html">Fig 8:
        Community Voices label from the Egypt Reborn exhibition</span></a></p>
      <p>If
        you&rsquo;ve visited our permanent collections in recent years, you may have noticed
        wall labels featuring visitors&rsquo; responses to specific works of art - we call
        these &ldquo;Community Voices.&rdquo; Visitors and/or residents of neighboring communities,
        representing a range of backgrounds and age groups, are invited to create
        written responses to objects, and their comments are subsequently mounted next
        to the work on view. These support the institutional mission because they
        incorporate the voice of the visitor in the process of interpretation. </span></p>

      <p class="caption"><a href="bernstein-fig9.html">Fig 9: Electronic
        comment book kiosk installed in the Infinite Island exhibition</span></a></p>
      <p>We extended this idea to the Web by replacing
        paper comment books with electronic comment kiosks in special exhibitions<i>.
        This </i></span>ensured that visitors&rsquo;
        comments would be visible both in the gallery and on the Web site. Comments can
        be submitted onsite using our comment kiosks or directly from the Web site (<a
href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/brushed_with_light/">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/brushed_with_light/</a>)</span>;
        no matter where or how visitors submit them, all comments are visible in both
        places. Now easily read from both the Web (<a
href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/comment/archive.php">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/comment/archive.php</a>) </span>and within the exhibition space, electronic comment books make visitor
        interpretation and response more visible than our older in-gallery labels.</span></p>
      <p>As one might expect, we have found that most of
        our Web traffic comes to pages that provide information about particular
        exhibitions. There are at least two benefits of having comments reside on our Web
        site (located in the Community area of the site, but clearly linked from the
        exhibition pages): </span></p>
      <ol>
        <li>within the
          institution, it is easier to review visitor feedback in real time as opposed to
          slowly circulating paper comment books after an exhibition&rsquo;s closing; and </span></li>
        <li>&nbsp;visitors can easily see how others are
          interpreting exhibitions and objects, and, to some degree, engage in
          conversation. </span></li>
      </ol>
      <p>That is, when visitors
        leave questions that necessitate answers, we can formulate responses and post
        them directly in the comment forum.</span></p>
      <p>For example, in our
        recent exhibition <i>Infinite Island: Contemporary Caribbean Art</i>, one work (<a
href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/infinite_island/highlight.php?a=EL51.87">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/infinite_island/ highlight.php?a=EL51.87</a>) </span>in particular elicited the following comment, to which the artist
        personally responded.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"><b>Comment</b></span>: What
        I do not understand is how come platano has now become a term or pride and
        endearment? It seems as though you hear the term &quot;platano pride&quot;
        thrown around, but if you were to call someone a platano they would take great
        offense; is that not a double standard?&hellip;This piece seems to be tribute to
        cultural and national pride but it contradicts itself. - &nbsp;Posted by Roxanne Ali</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"><b>Response:</b>The Pl&aacute;tano is a symbol with double
        meanings, a stereotypical yet iconic signifier of Caribbean culture. Indeed,
        Puerto Rican and Dominican immigrants were pejoratively referred to as
        &ldquo;Pl&aacute;tanos&rdquo; as they arrived in New York. Then there are regional associations
        that expand the meaning. In Puerto Rico for example, &ldquo;la mancha del pl&aacute;tano
        (the stain of the plantain)&rdquo; is an expression that historically referenced the
        indelible mark of one&rsquo;s skin color, culture or class. Today however, it is most
        often used as a statement of pride in one&rsquo;s roots and heritage. In the Pure
        Plantainum series, actual plantains were plated in platinum. They are like
        emblematic jewels on the outside, while the actual fruit is decomposing within.
        The work engages these contradicting spaces of who we sometimes are on the
        outside vs. the inside. And it flips the symbol, insisting upon pride over
        shame. -Miguel Luciano - Posted by Brooklyn Museum</p>
      <p>The rigorous participation and positive
        feedback from Museum staff, visitors, and colleagues, both in the galleries and
        through our online comment forum (<a
href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/comment/archive.php">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/comment/archive.php</a>)</span>,
        made this a very successful initiative from its inception in March 2007, to the
        degree that we created a new version of comment kiosks for the exhibition <a
href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/infinite_island/"
target="_blank" title="Infinite Island">Infinite Island.</a> Visitors had the
        opportunity to not only share general comments about the exhibition, but also
        comment on specific objects within the exhibition. <i>Platano Pride</i></span> is a case-in-point. Connecting the comment to
        the visual work of art was closer to our original Community Voice labels and
        has proven to be more popular than our earlier structure. We discovered that
        when given the choice to comment on the exhibition or works with in it, nine
        out of ten people chose to comment on a specific piece.</span></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig10" id="fig10"></a><a href="bernstein-fig10.html"><img src="bernstein_fig10_thumb.jpg" alt="Figure 10" width="218" height="197" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="bernstein-fig10.html">Fig 10: Infinite
        Island in-gallery user interface for electronic comment book allowing comments
        to be given on specific works and the exhibition itself</span></a></p>
      <p>Our comment books have gained popularity over
        time. For the Spring 2007 exhibitions <i>Global Feminisms </i></span>and <i>Asher B. Durand</i></span>, 107 and 124 comments were posted,
        respectively. Our Fall 2007 exhibitions, <i>Brushed With Light</i></span> and <i>Infinite Island</i></span>, garnered 340 and 533 comments, respectively. It
        is difficult to know what increased participation truly tells us, as it could
        suggest any of the following: growing knowledge of the Web feature, the
        popularity of the exhibition, audience demographics, a desire for dialogue,
        pure attraction to the visual image&hellip;etc. What we do know for sure is this:
        although visitor attendance for both exhibition seasons was roughly similar,
        participation in the comment forum more than tripled in the second season. As a
        result of this success, in the coming months electronic comment books will be
        installed in our permanent collection galleries, with related forums on our Web
        site.</span></p>
      <h1>Cell Phone Audio, RSS Feeds and Embedding</h1>
      <p>After a successful trial period in 2006, during
        which we discovered that the pickup rate for cell phone tours tripled that of
        our on-site audio tours, we began expanding this architecture. Cell phone audio
        has allowed us to cut costs dramatically and provide audio interpretation
        within an often-limited budget. To extend cell phone service in our building,
        we installed repeaters in selected areas. Existing audio tours for exhibitions
        like <i>American Identities</i></span>, <i>Egypt
        Reborn</i></span> and <i>Arts of Africa</i></span> were migrated to the new Guide By Cell system.
        We also produced and recorded tours for Judy Chicago&rsquo;s <i>The Dinner Party</i></span> and the exhibition <i>Global Feminisms</i></span>. In addition to increased pickup and
        cost-cutting, cell phones have allowed us to receive visitor feedback
        immediately &ndash; visitors are encouraged to &ldquo;press 1&rdquo; to record comments at
        any time in the tour. In this way, the visitor is given a voice, similar to our
        &ldquo;Community Voices&rdquo; labels and our electronic comment books. We expect to see
        further integration of these three projects in the near future.</span></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig11" id="fig11"></a><a href="bernstein-fig11.html"><img src="bernstein_fig11_thumb.jpg" alt="Figure 11" width="407" height="357" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="bernstein-fig11.html">Fig 11: RSS
        Feeds available on the Brooklyn Museum Web site</span></a></p>
      <p>RSS (Rich Site
        Summary) is a format for delivering regularly changing Web content to
        subscribers. RSS helps us to meet the objective to &ldquo;deliver content their way&rdquo;:
        it aligns closely with our Web 2.0 goals, and has surfaced as an important
        means of access for many of our readers/visitors. Hence, this year marked an
        RSS feed revolution on our Web site. Available feeds now include Exhibitions,
        Blogs, Podcasts, Events, <i>Target First Saturday</i></span> schedules, Press Releases, and more. While the
        information in some of these feeds is a bit sparse, over the next year we&rsquo;ll be
        working to provide more content in this way.</span></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig12" id="fig12"></a><a href="bernstein-fig12.html"><img src="bernstein_fig12.jpg" alt="Figure 12" width="400" height="317" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="bernstein-fig12.html">Fig 12: Brooklyn

      <p class="caption"><a href="bernstein-fig13.html">Fig 13: Brooklyn
        Museum embeddable player</span></a></p>
      <p>Allowing users to embed content on social networking sites
        is another central aspect of Web 2.0 technology, and this is one of our most
        recent endeavors. By providing embed code, we enable people to share our
        content the way they want to, via their own Web sites. All of our podcasts (<a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/podcasts/">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/podcasts/</a>) </span>and cell-phone audio stops come with embed code. If a visitor sees
        something s/he likes on our Web site and s/he wants to share it with others,
        the visitor can use the embed code to place our content directly on his/her own
        site. Giving the visitor ownership of the content in this way increases
        word-of-mouth, too. This is similar to some of our other initiatives, such as
        ArtShare, and will play an increasing role in our overall technology strategy
        moving forward.</p>
      <h1>Blogs</h1>
      <p>In June 2007 we began to overhaul our blogs. Our
        previous efforts were hosted at blogger.com and while a couple of those blogs
        provided valuable subject matter, such as behind-the-scenes looks at certain
        projects (<i><a href="http://digdiary.blogspot.com/">Dig Diary 2007</a></i></span> and <i><a
href="http://brooklynmuseum.blogspot.com/">Statue of Liberty</a></i></span>), others (e.g. <a
href="http://brooklynmuseumwifi.blogspot.com/">Brooklyn Museum Wireless News</a>)
        had become repositories for promotional materials. It was clear to us that an
        overhaul was badly needed, so the Museum&rsquo;s various blogs were consolidated (<a
href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/</a>)</span> and integrated into our own Web site. Thereafter, we moved forward with the
        intention to make publishing quick, easy, and enjoyable for staff, and also to
        make the information we provided to our audience as open and transparent as
        possible. In contrast to other means of communication (e.g. Web sites,
        publications, printed materials, press releases), blogging in its very nature
        is more personal; ideally, the authors&rsquo; voices are retained and spontaneity
        rules. On our Web site, information is thoroughly vetted, like any other
        official publication from the Museum; but our blog allows for much quicker,
        direct communication from staff. This means that readers of our blog sometimes
        find typos and less than elegantly phrased missives, but we also hope they
        reveal the human side of the institution.</span></p>
      <p>Authors, following a set of institutionally
        approved guidelines, write posts focusing on behind-the-scenes information not
        readily accessible to the public. Diverse in terms of content, posts are
        written personally by staff members and retain each author&rsquo;s unique voice and
        perspective; they also identify each author with a small picture and short
        biography and use tags to integrate posts with appropriate exhibition pages on
        the site. Readers can follow the subjects in which they are most interested
        using a number RSS feeds. Our blog (<a
href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/</a>) </span>provides feeds for a wide range of subjects and authors, and for
        categories such as <i>Rarely on View</i></span>, <i>On Loan</i></span>, <i>Recent
        Acquisitions</i></span>, <i>Architecture
        and Planning</i></span>, <i>Egyptian Art</i></span>, <i>Technology</i></span>, etc. The content in our blog is fully
        syndicated; this further supports the interests of subscribers/readers, as new
        content can be delivered directly to them whenever they want it, eliminating
        numerous clicks through our site.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig14" id="fig14"></a> <a href="bernstein-fig14.html"><img src="bernstein_fig14_thumb.jpg" alt="Figure 14" width="168" height="211" /></a></p>

      <h1>Twitter</h1>
      <p>Our experience with Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/">http://twitter.com/</a>)</span> is a really interesting case of what happens when you <i>don&rsquo;t</i></span> follow your own advice. Twitter, a
        social-networking site that allows friends to subscribe to your feed and
        receive short txt messages on their phones, seemed like an innovative way to
        distribute information in real time. At the October 2007 <i>Target First
        Saturday</i></span>, we established a
        profile at Twitter in order to send visitors updates during the event. However,
        major obstacles occurred during the course of this trial run.</span></p>
      <p>The first concerned Twitter&rsquo;s sign-up process. You
        can sign up people at the event using their phones, but this sign-up process
        results in users getting multiple messages which are often confusing. Suddenly,
        Twitter starts sending txt messages like &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll know what&rsquo;s going on with
        BrooklynMuseum. But, what are you doing?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thanks! Reply with your name so
        you can tell friends how to follow you!&rdquo; If you are already using Twitter or
        other social networking sites, these messages make sense; but if you are
        unfamiliar, it can be a confusing jumble.</span></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig15" id="fig15"></a><a href="bernstein-fig15.html"><img src="bernstein_fig15.jpg" alt="Figure 15" width="400" height="290" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="bernstein-fig15.html">Fig 15: </span>Target First Saturday Twitter feed
        showing content related to evening scheduling</span></a></p>
      <p>The second obstacle had to do with content. One
        of our most important rules of thumb is to post interesting content. Most
        often, when starting new initiatives like this one, we start simply, so we can
        get to know the users and the social fabric of the site and develop better
        content as we go along. Because we were only offering scheduling information
        and similar updates throughout the evening via Twitter - content that could
        easily be seen elsewhere - there was no real reason for a user to go through
        the hurdles of the sign-up process, or waste valuable txt messages in their
        calling plan. </span></p>
      <p>Moving forward with
        Twitter (or a similar service) will mean a much greater commitment on our part
        to provide content that visitors will find interesting. For example, there are
        many ways to create a game-like event using txting, or to provide valuable
        information that visitors can&rsquo;t access in other ways. Unique content combined
        with an easier sign-up process could make Twitter an interesting technology to
        utilize in the future. &nbsp;In the
        meantime, while we consider how to utilize Twitter more effectively, we are
        feeding the contents of our blog to our Twitter profile (<a href="http://twitter.com/brooklynmuseum">http://twitter.com/brooklynmuseum</a>)</span>.
        This provides a nice middle ground, because users can stay in the loop via the
        Twitter site, rather than having to come directly to our Web site.</span></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig16" id="fig16"></a><a href="bernstein-fig16.html"><img src="bernstein_fig16_thumb.jpg" alt="Figure 16" width="200" height="103" /></a></p>

      <h1>Conclusion </h1>
      <p>By way of conclusion, let&rsquo;s return to the two
        goals stated at the beginning of this paper, and identify how the projects
        described above have met each objective: </span></p>
      <p><b>Goal #1: Keep it real.</b></span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blogs
          allowing for author identification and instant publication</li>
        <li>Electronic
          Comment Books</li>
        <li>Personalized
          social networking sites (Facebook, Flickr)</li>
        <li>Coney
          Island project on Flickr</li>
        <li>Visitor
          Video Competition </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To successfully meet this goal, a museum must
        personalize its content as much as possible. Web 2.0 is about social
        connections and community, not about marketing or PR. The museum must fully
        commit to being in the community and offer content that people care about. When
        creating a platform for discussion, it must be sure to listen to what visitors
        have to say and respond when necessary. As much as possible, it must create
        projects that really mean something, both to the institution and to the
        participants; give visitors ownership over content; and allow visitors to use
        content in any way they see fit. It must also involve the curatorial presence
        in projects whenever possible. Patrick Amsellem is reviewing and commenting on
        entries in our <i>Goodbye Coney Island?</i></span> group on Flickr, and that means a lot to the participants. Similarly,
        judges were lined up for the Visitor Video Competition that would matter to the
        participants.</span></p>
      <p><b>Goal #2: Deliver content their way.</b></span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>ArtShare
          on Facebook</li>
        <li>Fully
          syndicated content with no need to click-thru</li>
        <li>Blog
          RSS feeds broken down by author and subject</li>
        <li>Blog
          feeding directly to our Twitter profile</li>
        <li>RSS
          feeds for events, exhibitions, press releases, podcasts</li>
        <li>Cell
          phone audio tours</li>
        <li>Embedding
          opportunities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Allow your audience to
        take content with them and share it with whomever they want, in whatever way
        they want. Fully syndicate content so visitors don&rsquo;t have to click-thru unless
        they really want to</span><span style='font-family:Helvetica'>. </span>What you lose in stats, you gain in community.</span></p>
