        <p class="AbstractText">In 2007 the Art
    Gallery of Ontario (<a href="http://www.ago.net/"
title="http://www.ago.net/">http://www.ago.net</a>) closed its doors temporarily to complete the renovation and installation of a new Frank
    Gehry-designed facility. In the months leading up to this closure, the Gallery
    experimented with different ways to keep people connected to the institution.
    One of the most high profile programs to emerge during this time was the
    exhibition <i>In Your Face</i> that began with a call for submission asking the public to send in
    postcard-sized portraits.</p>
        <p class="AbstractText">The response to
    this project was unprecedented and resulted in the AGO receiving over 17,000
    portraits that were initially presented within a gallery space normally
    reserved for blockbuster exhibitions. The success of this endeavor led the AGO
    to experiment with various on-line presentations of similar content that
    further demonstrated that museums can function as catalytic agents when open to
    experimenting with a combination of innovative programming and on-line access.</p>
  <p class="AbstractText">The success of <i>In
    Your Face</i> also attracted
    the attention of the Portrait Gallery of Canada (<a
href="http://www.portraits.gc.ca/">http://www.portraits.gc.ca</a>),
    a public gallery without a permanent home, and resulted in a partnership that
    made it possible for the exhibition to be re-mounted in Ottawa, and made it
    accessible to a national audience. Tracing the evolution of <i>In Your Face</i> through its various forms of presentation
    and partnership, this paper examines issues of significance to museums and
    galleries as their relationship to the public is forced to evolve in response
    to changing circumstances, including those times when collections may be
    inaccessible and the building itself is offline.</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The face of Canada is changing. Of the 33,000,000 people in Canada,
        nearly 20% identify themselves as immigrants, and an equal number have
        indicated that their mother tongue is a language other than English or French.
        In Toronto, half of the population identifies as having been born outside of
        Canada, and as many as 150 different languages are spoken every day. For public
        institutions like the Art Gallery of Ontario, this stimulating and rich
      environment brings with it many challenges but also incredible opportunities (<a
href="http://www.statcan.ca/">http://www.statcan.ca/</a>).</p>
      <p>In addition to these demographic shifts, the way people access
        information, spend their leisure time and interact with each other continues to
        evolve as the world becomes increasingly wired. Globally, Canada ranks among
        the top 20 countries in terms of the percentage of the population that uses the
        Internet. Canada ranks even higher in terms of broadband penetration and,
        within this context, Toronto has been referred to as the social media capital of North
      America and the Facebook capital of the world (<a
href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/">http://www.internetworldstats.com/</a>).</p>
      <p>The proliferation of new forms of collectively created knowledge
        (Wikipedia), the popularity of Web sites featuring user generated content
        (Flickr, You Tube), and the emergence of social media platforms (My Space,
        Facebook) have turned traditional notions of expertise, cultural production and
        public space upside down. With the evolution of technologies that make it
        possible for people to share their knowledge, creativity and experience in new and
        novel ways, the old divisions between expert and enthusiast, producer and
        consumer, public and private, have blurred irrevocably. As contemporary culture
        plays itself out on-line, it is fascinating to see how museums and galleries
      are responding to the challenge.</p>
      <p>In response to these changes, the Art Gallery of Ontario created the
        exhibition <i>In Your Face</i> and a complementary project, Collection X, both
        offering compelling examples of what can happen when a public gallery has an
        opportunity to experiment with programming. It involved a transparent process,
        a flexible structure, and an entirely open-ended outcome. The result was the
        emergence of an alternative programming model that privileged creativity and
        participation and, as a result, fostered new levels of audience engagement,
      public involvement and professional partnerships.</p>
      <h1><i>In Your Face</i> at the Art Gallery of Ontario</h1>
      <p>In 2006, when the
        AGO was beginning a major reconstruction and reinstallation project, the
        organization made the decision to launch a community-generated exhibition
        called <i>In Your Face</i> &#8211;
        The People&rsquo;s Portrait Project. Public programmer Gillian McIntyre and
        interpretive planner David Wistow had collaborated before on two experimental
        interventions in the Degas (2003) and Modigliani (2004) exhibitions, where the
        public was invited to create art in the exhibition space. One of the things
        learned from these interventions was how engaged visitors were with content
        produced by other visitors. Inspired by these examples, the planners built on
      their experiences to design <i>In Your Face</i>, an exhibition created entirely by and for the public.</p>
      <p>At the heart of <i>In
        Your Face</i> was a public call
        for submission that went out through newspapers, via e-mail and on the AGO&rsquo;s
        Web site. Members of the public were asked to submit postcard-size portraits in
        the media of their choice. The only criteria were that portraits had to measure
        4&rdquo; x 6&rdquo;, be an original work of art, and be accompanied by a signed consent
        form. From the outset,&nbsp; the
        decision had been made that the portraits would not be judged and there would
      be no limit to how many could be submitted.</p>
      <p>The response to <i>In
        Your Face</i> was extraordinary.
        By the time the exhibition opened in July 2006, the AGO had received over
        10,000 portraits, from across Canada and beyond, in various media, including
        drawings, oil paintings, watercolors, encaustic, papier m&acirc;ch&eacute;, acrylic, silk
        screen, relief print, photos and digitally-based imagery. Packages arrived
        containing portraits from individuals, whole communities, classes, and families.
        Many sent with their submissions letters showing a strong desire to share
      personal stories.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="mcintyre.fig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="400" height="292" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: In Your Face portrait. &copy; Art Gallery of Ontario,
      2008. All Rights Reserved</p>
      <p>Word of mouth also
        contributed to the success of the exhibition, and submissions started to pour
        in not only from across Canada, but also from other countries such as Italy,
        Germany, the United States, Great Britain, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, Holland,
        India, Switzerland, France, and Australia. By December 2006, 17,000 portraits
        had come in. The range of responses was vast - from all ages, levels of
        ability, and types of communities. The images too reflected an enormous amount
        of creativity, effort and thought, and the humor, honesty, and ingenuity were
      moving.</p>
      <p>As promised, all the
        works submitted by December 1, 2006 that met the original criteria were
        exhibited. The portraits were installed in prime exhibition space at the AGO
        and had to be hung floor to ceiling to accommodate as many submissions as possible.
        During the course of the exhibition, visitors dropped into the space during
        gallery hours to create portraits to add to the collection. Visits, phone
        inquiries, and e-mails continued for months; the exhibition&rsquo;s run was
        eventually extended and it had to be re-installed twice in order to respond to
      the level of interest.</p>

      <h2>Why the Appeal?</h2>
      <p>What was it that
        made this very straightforward exhibition so successful? Perhaps one reason is
        that <i>In Your Face</i> tapped
        into universal creativity as well as the usually unrealized potential of
        museums to function as catalytic agents. Indeed, much of the creativity that
        occurred around <i>In Your Face</i> happened off-site and in non-urban communities. Group submissions were frequent
        and contained the work of families, neighbours, schools, workplaces, lunch
        groups, and other community groups. For example, a package of 23 portraits of
      various adults and children arrived with the following letter:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Dear
      Folk at the Art Gallery of Ontario,</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Please
        accept the enclosed portraits for display in &ldquo;<i>In Your Face</i>&rdquo;. We are members and friends of the
        Middle Road Community, an intentional community in rural Nelson, B.C. We had
        lots of fun working together to create these pictures. Thanks for your support
        of art and for sharing/spreading the word . . . art is for everyone, art is in
      everyone.</p>
      <p>Within the
        exhibition itself, visitors to <i>In Your Face</i> were also able to make portraits at drawing
        stations and and could then leave them behind to be installed. Many visitors
        also photographed one another in the space, often holding up their portraits or
        pointing to mounted portraits they had previously submitted. In this way the
        exhibition became a social space bringing life to the institution and
        transmitting the life of the institution back out into the community. As an
        example of this, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Toronto chose to partner with the
        AGO to raise awareness for their after-school, weekend, and summer programs. In
        celebration of Boys and Girls Club Week they held a media event in the
        exhibition, during which the AGO&rsquo;s director, Matthew Teitelbaum, said: &ldquo;I think
        the challenge with a big institution is it seems elitist. This project says,
      &lsquo;You belong here. This is your place.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

      <h1>Honouring a Genuine Response</h1>
      <p>Internally, at the
        AGO, <i>In Your Face</i> definitely gave pause for reflection at a time when the Gallery was undergoing
        significant change. Transformation AGO was not only physical, but conceptual as
        well, and led to a re-imagining of the Gallery&rsquo;s mandate and vision. The
        Transformation AGO project created a space within which to question the values
        of the institution as well as the traditional ways of working - questions that
        needed to be asked in order to move the organization from traditional modes of
        working to more dynamic, contemporary practices. <i>In Your Face</i> has proved to be crucial to this process as it
        provided an opportunity to see the faces, and hear the stories, of some of the
      people to whom the gallery really matters.</p>
      <p>As <i>In Your Face</i> evolved, it was necessary for the AGO to
        become more agile than usual in order to accommodate new work within the
        exhibition and to respond to public inquiries. Though challenging, somehow this
        need for increased flexibility, coupled with the open-endedness of the project,
        enlivened the institution and kept the exhibition in play for much longer than
        anticipated. The portraits contained within <i>In Your Face</i> also noticeably reflected far more diversity
        than is usually seen at the AGO, either on the walls or among visitors. Given
        the fact that Toronto is such a multicultural city, this proved to be an
        evolutionary step for the institution. Multicultural representation remains a
        deficiency that continues to be addressed. It is worth noting, however, that on
        several occasions school children from diverse backgrounds visiting the
        exhibition were able to point to portraits and say: &ldquo;That looks like me.&rdquo; That
        level of recognition and relevance is essential for inclusion, and <i>In Your
          Face</i> has helped to prove that
        museums and galleries can play a role in forging identity, a process that has
      to begin by honouring the value of the individual.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="mcintyre.fig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="400" height="267" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 5: In Your Face, Installation shot with visitors, Art
      Gallery of Ontario. </p>
      <p>For museums and
        galleries, achieving social inclusion means actively seeking out and removing
        barriers to participation. In choosing to program open-ended projects like <i>In
          Your Face,</i> public institutions
        can go a long way toward becoming relevant and inclusive. People enjoy being
        creative and want to explore their own creativity as well as the creativity of
        others in ways that are accessible, attainable, and engaging. If the museum can
        act as a catalyst for creativity - and the thousands of people who have
        participated in <i>In Your Face</i> have shown that it can - then what will happen if we allow our walls to become
      more permeable?</p>
      <h2>Extending the Experience: <i>In
      Your Face</i> and Flickr</h2>
      <p>While the <i>In Your Face</i> exhibition was being developed at the AGO, gallery
        staff suggested that it would be interesting to open up the call for submission
        by creating a parallel project on the Web site Flickr. The idea proposed,
        inspired by similar work done at the Brooklyn Museum (<a
href="http://brooklynmuseum.org/">http://brooklynmuseum.org/</a>),
        was that Flickr could be used as a framework within which to solicit virtual
        contributions that could also be featured as part of <i>In Your Face,</i> but in the form of
      a digital slide show that would be incorporated into the gallery space.</p>
      <p>The AGO decided not to proceed with integrating Flickr for this project
        primarily due to concerns regarding copyright, the public display of content
        that would be submitted on-line, and the corporate use of a Web site that is
        clearly intended for personal use only. The AGO did,&nbsp; however, create a Flickr group that made reference to the
        exhibition and invited users to share their creativity on-line within that
      context of the Web site itself (<a
href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/artmatters/">http://www.flickr.com/groups/artmatters/</a>).</p>
      <p>Although it was not possible to create a direct link between <i>In Your
        Face</i> and Flickr, the experiment did generate valuable experience in relation to
        social networking and has helped to inform the development of other ideas and
        projects at the AGO. It also demonstrated that these initiatives are relevant,
        evidenced by the fact that the <i>In Your Face</i> &ndash; Portraits
        group on Flickr still exists and continues to grow nearly two years after it
        was created. Some of the other conclusions that have been drawn from this
      experiment include:&nbsp; </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When audiences see themselves reflected in a
          collection, they can remain engaged over a long period of time. The <i>In Your
            Face</i> - Portraits group on
          Flickr currently features close to 10,000 photos contributed by over 900
          members and continues to grow every day.</li>
        <li>Active Flickr users submit their photos to
          multiple groups. People&rsquo;s interests are naturally diverse and the relationship
          between groups is fertile territory for exploration.</li>
        <li>There is a small group of very active Flickr
          users. The most active members of the <i>In Your Face</i> &ndash; Portraits group have submitted over
          150 images each. Viewed over the long term, however, they have not dominated
          the content.</li>
        <li>The right idea well positioned will attract
          people&rsquo;s attention. People are naturally attracted to content that is relevant
          and meaningful to them and will remain involved if it is presented in a way
          that is accessible, inviting and social.</li>
        <li>There
          is impact in numbers. People like to be part of something that is bigger than
          themselves. The fact that the <i>In Your Face</i> &ndash; Portraits group on Flickr features nearly 10,000 photos presented
          within the context of hundreds of million more photos is compelling.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In response to the
        Transformation AGO project, and out of a desire to assess the potential of
        projects like <i>In Your Face</i>,
        the AGO has invested more energy in community consultation to help ensure that
        the Gallery&rsquo;s collection and program better reflect the needs of existing and
        future audiences. At a session, a young participant offered the following
        observation: &ldquo;Art is social&rdquo;. This comment has the potential to become a museum
        maxim that reverberates across programming areas. Museums and galleries have
        always been social spaces, but the explosion of social media demonstrates both
        a hunger for connectedness as well as a desire to see creativity itself
      fostered in a way that builds a sense of community and belonging.</p>
      <h1>The Actual and the Virtual: <b><i>In
        Your Face</i></b> and
      Collection X</h1>
      <p>While <i>In Your Face</i> kept evolving and growing, the AGO was also in the
        process of developing its own experiment in social media through the creation
        of an on-line initiative called Collection X (<a href="http://www.collectionx.museum/">http://www.collectionx.museum</a>). Launched in April 2007, Collection X represents
        a programming and delivery approach that is purposely designed to challenge
        some of the fundamental practices of museums and galleries. As with <i>In Your
          Face,</i> Collection X provides a
        space within which to share user-generated content, but it takes this concept
        even further by inviting users to curate and interpret their own content using
        a range of Web 2.0 technologies and concepts such as self-publishing and
      tagging.</p>
      <p>In relation to <i>In Your Face,</i> what Collection X offered was an opportunity to
        weave together selected portraits from the exhibition, along with a variety of
        installation shots, to create a virtual version of the exhibition. However,
        this on-line presentation of <i>In Your Face</i> through Collection X represents more
        than just a digital document of the original exhibition. In fact, it places it
        within the larger context of social media, creating an opportunity for an
        on-line audience not only to learn about <i>In Your Face,</i> but also, potentially,
        to expand upon the original exhibition by adding additional content or perhaps
      even creating their own parallel exhibitions to explore similar themes.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="mcintyre.fig6.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="400" height="349" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 6: In Your Face, Screen shot, Collection X. </p>
      <p>Structurally,
        Collection X is built around the relationships among three main elements: collect, connect and create.
        Within this structure &lsquo;collect&rsquo; and &lsquo;create&rsquo; function as headings that
        represent traditional museum practices, including collection building at one
        end of the spectrum and the creation of knowledge and meaning through research
        and interpretation at the other. The heading &lsquo;connect&rsquo; literally provides the
        link between these two practices by inviting users to create on-line
        exhibitions and connections that are personally meaningful and relevant, using
      the content that is made available through Collection X.</p>
      <p>In order to generate
        interest and model the kind of content that can be created using Collection X,
        the AGO worked with various project partners to seed content that includes
        images, video and audio and to create a range of on-line collections,
        exhibitions and connections. Collection X was also developed in tandem with
        another AGO initiative called ArtsAccess that was designed to bring together artists, community members and cultural
        organizations through art, art making and arts education. Together, Collection
        X and <em>ArtsAccess</em> were meant to
        foster creativity within a wider sphere, to encourage broader participation and
        to build relationships through a combination of on-line and community-based
      experiences.</p>
      <p>For the AGO,
        Collection X represents a major leap forward in terms of program development
      and delivery on two fronts: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>it provides an opportunity to activate public
          collections by making them available in new and interesting ways, and&nbsp; </li>
        <li>it makes it possible for
          the public at large to upload their own collections and create virtual
          exhibitions using the same application. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>As a result,
        Collection X functions as what has been described as an &lsquo;open-source museum&rsquo;
        that enables users to emulate museum practices while, at the same time, drawing
        upon a mix of content taken from public collections as well as from collections
      created by the public.</p>
      <p>Collection X
        provides users with multiple points of entry and levels of engagement. They
      can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Search and browse images, videos and audio
          clips</li>
        <li>Contribute content in the form of images, video
          and audio</li>
        <li>Create exhibitions using public collections and
          collections contributed by the public</li>
        <li>Connect exhibitions together around themes,
          issues or ideas to create connections</li>
        <li>Use tags to describe and identify all levels of
          content</li>
        <li>Share thoughts and engage in dialogue through
          comments and e-mail exchanges</li>
        <li>Subscribe to RSS feeds and podcasts to track
          new content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>RSS feeds are
        integral to the design of Collection X as they provide a way to keep users
        connected to content that is constantly changing. The decision to use them was
        based on the realization that people need tools to help them sort through the
        vast amount of content that exists on-line. They also help to address the issue
        of motivation by delivering prompts to users who are subscribers when the
        content changes. Within Collection X, RSS feeds give users the ability to
        subscribe to any thread of content on the site - tags, exhibitions, searches,
        collections, user profiles - and to receive live updates using an RSS reader.
        The integration of RSS feeds also means that new content can be distributed and
        accessed through a variety of platforms and content personalization
      applications.</p>
      <p>What a comparison of <i>In Your Face</i> and Collection X reveals are
        strategies that can be used to encourage creativity and engagement, even when
        the intended audience is quite different. Included among the strategies that
      have proven to be effective are the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>establish structures and frameworks that are open and inclusive;</li>
        <li>foster creativity without being prescriptive;</li>
        <li>be democratic and ensure that the processes are non-hierarchical;</li>
        <li>engage in dialogue and nurture relationships;</li>
        <li>encourage a layering of voices and a plurality of content;</li>
        <li>embrace a multiplicity of potential outcomes; and</li>
        <li>honour the collaboration.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Based on the examples of <i>In Your Face</i> and Collection X,
        AGO has found that these kinds of endeavors can succeed if the idea being
        explored is authentic and engaging, the process is transparent, the structure
        is flexible and the outcome is open-ended. For public galleries in particular,
        such an approach has the potential to result in an expanded definition of art
        as well as the emergence of a new kind of aesthetic that is rooted in the
        authenticity of the experience, a critical mass of creative content and a
        willingness to allow the work to assert its unique identity. It is critical
        that these conditions exist so that the participants are able to see their knowledge,
        creativity and experience reflected back in ways that are meaningful and
      respectful.</p>
      <h1>Museums in Partnership: <i>In Your
        Face</i> and the Portrait
      Gallery of Canada</h1>
      <p>The Portrait Gallery of Canada, a programme of Library and Archives Canada,
        is part history museum and part art gallery. The Portrait Gallery's active
        program of traveling exhibitions, educational initiatives and community
        partnerships brings a unique collection of more than four million paintings,
        prints, drawings, sculptures, photographs, films and caricatures to all
      Canadians.</p>
      <p>Faces from the past and present, known and unknown, tell the story of
        Canada, while contemporary works explore today's issues. To broaden and deepen
        the Canadian experience, the Portrait Gallery is forming partnerships with
        other cultural institutions nationally and internationally. The faces and
        voices of past generations influence and inform Canadians today. The Portrait
        Gallery of Canada's mission is to honour, commemorate and celebrate those who
        have shaped this country, while redefining &quot;portrait&quot; for a new
      century.</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 7: Office of the Portrait Gallery of Canada. &copy; Library
      and Archives Canada/Portrait Gallery of Canada. </p>
      <p>Library and Archives Canada developed the National Portrait Collection
        based on works amassed since the 1880s, with the goal of documenting historical
        personalities important to Canada's development. In November 2007, The Government of Canada launched a Request for
        Proposals (RFP) to locate the Portrait Gallery of Canada in one of the
        following cities: Halifax, Qu&eacute;bec city, Montr&eacute;al, Ottawa-Gatineau (National
        Capital Region), Toronto, Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary, and Vancouver. The RFP
      advertisement is closing April 16, 2008.</p>
      <p>In early spring of
        2007, representatives from the Portrait Gallery of Canada (PGC) met with
        colleagues at the AGO to discuss collaborative opportunities. Over the course
        of this meeting the institutions also expressed their respective challenges -
        the AGO&rsquo;s challenge to continue to make <i>In Your Face</i> available during a period of renovation, and
        the PGC&rsquo;s challenge to initiate real-time programming in the absence of a
      permanent building.</p>
      <p>Back at Library and
        Archives Canada, PGC management approved the partnership. Staff secured an
        unused exhibition space and worked closely with the AGO and colleagues at
        Library and Archives Canada. They also initiated a great relationship with
        Wallack&rsquo;s, who generously sponsored art supplies and frames for the exhibition
      space (a model inspired by the AGO).</p>
      <p>On October 29, 2007,
        the PGC launched its first exhibition in Canada: an exhibition organized by the
        AGO, featuring approximately twelve thousand portraits submitted by the public.
        Portrait&nbsp; submissions continued to
        be accepted on-site. Over 100 people attended on opening night; kids were
        making portraits; adults enjoyed portrait-tini&rsquo;s; Canterbury Art Students
        provided a live portraiture demonstration; the podium was set aside and
        replaced by a television-inspired talk show format; three giant puppets greeted
        the crowd in the exhibition; and some great Canadian tunes had people moving
      about.</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 8: In Your Face exhibition in Ottawa, Canada. &copy; Library
      and Archives Canada/Portrait Gallery of Canada. </p>
      <p>Two weeks later,
      programming started and is still ongoing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>From November 2007 until June 2008, twice a
          week, two classrooms (grades 4-12) visit <i>In Your Face</i> and experience educator-led curriculum
          programming. Information about our programming was shared with teachers through
          a collaboration with the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board and the
          Ottawa-Carleton School Board.</li>
        <li>Examples of public programming include Video
          Portrait Mosaics, Eat Me, Valentine! and Portraiture 101. A self-portrait on a
          cake required an extra dose of creativity. Elizabeth-Todd Doyle, Curator
          Education, collaborated with the Billing&rsquo;s Estate Museum and the Nepean Museum
          to welcome our programming into their space and into their community</li>
        <li>Guided Tours of the exhibition were added in
          the New Year. The tours have increased the reach and helped to identify new
          publics such as English as a Second Language</li>
        <li>Two teacher events allowed the sharing of
          techniques and new ideas for using portraits in the classroom</li>
        <li>New Media Programming enhances and shares the
          experience through on-line exhibitions, news items, capturing and editing
          image, video and audio content for presentation onto the PGC Web site</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The exhibition has
        been extended from March until September 1, 2008. Programming is currently in
        the works to accompany the duration of the exhibition. Coming this summer,
        Canadians will be able to contribute their portraits on-line through a simple
        service enhanced with an exhibition feature. The AGO and the <i>In Your Face</i> exhibition have clearly enabled the PGC to
        initiate programming. The catalyst that pushed PGC programming was the ability
        to see beyond a building. The museum is not the building. PGC staff are working
        on the foundation of the museum by challenging the interpretation of space and
        programming, both physical and virtual. Their commitment to reach out to a
        national audience remains at the forefront by proudly defining themselves as a
      gallery without walls.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="mcintyre.fig9.jpg" alt="Figure 9" width="400" height="394" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 9: In Your Face exhibition in Ottawa, Canada. &copy; Library
      and Archives Canada/Portrait Gallery of Canada </p>
      <p>The <i>In Your Face</i> exhibition has proven to be an energizing
        experience for both PGC and Library and Archives Canada. <i>In Your Face</i> is already being referred to as a model of
        public engagement and collaboration. Between this exhibition and other projects
        currently underway, it is challenging to take some time to reflect and share
        lessons learned and to explore ways to sustain this energy. Still to be
        addressed at the PGC is the question of what to do with portraits that the
        public has shared and entrusted to the Gallery. This type of engagement creates
        expectations on the part of contributors. Are the portraits to be acquired into
        the collection and cared for; made available as a study collection; digitized
        and made available on-line? Exploring ways to answers these questions will help
        to inform how the PGC will continue to engage with Canadians and how Canadians
      will choose to engage with us.</p>
      <h1>Questions Asked and Lessons
      Learned</h1>
      <p>What happens when
        public institutions like the AGO and the PGC function more as catalytic agents
        and increasingly relinquish control? What if, instead of positioning ourselves
        as gatekeepers, experts and judges, we strive to establish ways of working that
      are inclusive and that honour creativity in a broad range of forms?</p>
      <p>The overwhelming
        response to <i>In Your Face</i>,
        in all its manifestations, would seem to offer one possible answer. Starting
        out as the seed of an idea, it took on a life of its own grew into something
        bigger than ever could have been imagined. It gathered momentum drawing on the
        strengths of the institution and the public and, along the way, captured the
        imagination of both. This strength was rooted in community collaboration,
        collective forms of creativity and a shared sense of ownership that
        demonstrates what can happen when institutions and the public work together as
      both producers and consumers of culture.</p>
      <p>Within this context
        many other questions are being asked, including, &ldquo;How do public institutions
        maintain standards of excellence while, at the same time, achieving accessibility?&rdquo;
        At the AGO there has been a conscious shift toward a more balanced approach
        from &lsquo;curatorial expertise is paramount&rsquo; to &lsquo;visitor experience is paramount&rsquo;.
        In order to achieve this balance, and in order to assist all areas of the
        gallery to share in this vision, a set of guiding principles have been
        developed to direct the work of the institution; they include relevance,
      responsiveness, creativity, transparency, diversity and forum.</p>
      <p>As another element
        of the Transformation AGO project, all decisions regarding exhibitions,
        acquisitions, interpretive strategies and educational programs are now being
        made based on these guiding principles. Not surprisingly, such a move has
        prompted endless debate and discussion within the institution, a healthy sign
        of movement towards a more democratic process. Questions of quality and voice
        are still being argued, but, in order to remain relevant, institutions must pay
        attention to what is happening within the larger culture or risk being left
      behind.</p>
      <p>Is it possible that, by functioning in a democratic way, museum standards may actually improve? As museums become more relevant to broader audiences, and include a multiplicity of voices and art forms from a mix of cultures and communities, what will emerge is much livelier and harder to define bodies of knowledge and expression around which to curate and program. The resulting juxtapositions, debates and discussions will keep museums alert, flexible and accountable. Within this new kind of museum environment expertise will be drawn from many different places and disciplines. </p>
      <p>In developing
        strategies to encourage creativity, engagement, and investment when the museum
        is off-line, public institutions like the AGO and the PGC have found ways to be
        more creative in their approach. As part of this process, it makes sense to
        engage more fully with the kind of practices that have proven to be so
        successful within the world of social media and social networking. As museums
        and galleries evolve (as they must), the need to embrace a multiplicity of
        voices will continue,&nbsp; as will the
        need to surrender institutional authority and control. As challenging as this
        proposition continues to be, it is also exciting, and provides perhaps the only
        strategy that will work if museums and galleries are to succeed at fostering
        new levels of audience engagement, public involvement and professional
      partnerships.</p>
