        <p class="AbstractText">How would you piece together the culture web of the
    future? In the perfectly interoperable, automatically-joined world of 'Web
    3.0', some think we need our content connected more closely, more
    intelligently, with more meaning. But, faced with the initial challenges of Web
    2.0, is the UK museum and gallery sector now heading in the right direction
    strategically, technically and in terms of sustainability? Is the negligible
    engagement of UK museums with the new wave Web an indicator of more fundamental
    blockages to come? Can we cope with even bigger steps towards a more unified
    digital world, an Internet of things? Many people working deep in the digital
    cultural sector feel there&rsquo;s a growing gap between what&rsquo;s going on out there in
    the fertile land of Facebook, and what&rsquo;s going on in our arid world of
    collection descriptions, copyright conundrums and so on. </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">A wish for more decisive, open-minded developmental
    connections recently led to the 2006/2007 Semantic Web Think Tank (SWTT)
    project, a UK research partnership between the Museums Computer Group, MDA, the
    V&amp;A, Natural History Museum, Science Museum, the 24 Hour Museum and
    collaborators in the academic world, such as Cambridge University, Leicester
    University and software sector groups like Box UK. The SWTT project pulled
    together experts from all sides, talking in six directed sessions which were
    recorded and published as papers on a blog and in a planned report. The big
    &lsquo;take home&rsquo; from the SWTT project has not, in the end, been a demonstrator,
    mash-up or a software widget of some kind. It&rsquo;s the emergence of a suggested
    roadmap for the development of a joined-up digital cultural sector, to be
    revealed in more detail in a report published spring/summer 2008. </p>

  <h1>1. Collections and Semantic Thinking</h1>
  <p>Semantics
    have always been an integral part of museums. Just as the act of collecting
    objects into a singular physical site defines museums today and through
    history, so too does the ongoing act of making meaning with and between these
    objects. Throughout their (at least) five hundred year story, museums represent
    the coping strategy of countless historically and culturally differentiated
    communities to bring some degree of order to the world around them.
    Traditionally, museums bring fragments of society&rsquo;s knowledge and experience
    into a highly controlled environment, a closed system, within which order can
    then be found &ndash; or contrived. It has been the function of museums to find
    meaning within (or give meaning to) these highly orchestrated aggregated
    performances. Whether through narrative or systematics, genre or geography, the
    museum has sought to frame disparate objects with a rationalising discourse
    into a &lsquo;collection&rsquo; or &lsquo;exhibition&rsquo;. Using numbering, term lists, taxonomy or
    simply physical proximity, museums have deployed systems that have provided
    logic, a set of assumptions, and (invariably) a vocabulary to tame and explain their collections. This classificatory project (this syntax) and importantly,
    the semantics inextricably linked to it, are what has come to define the museum
    today and through history. Museums, in short, are places where, in a structured
    way, we give or reinforce meanings to things. This is museum semantics. </p>
  <p>More
    recently (or, at least, in the last forty years) the automated and systematic
    processing of computer technology has come to support and augment this
    syntactical and semantic project. Unsurprisingly perhaps, when museums first
    began to explore the potential of computing it was specifically to the
    management and documentation of collections that they first turned (Vance, 1973). In contrast to
    some highly localised, frequently personalised, at times idiosyncratic ordering
    systems that existed in museums, computing instead promised (indeed, required)
    a systematized and consistent treatment of collections. Computers could help
    generate (and, in fact, were dependent upon) a curatorial environment where the
    semantics of collections could be formalized and standardized. Moreover, the
    standard classificatory codes, data entry conventions, fixed fields and
    terminology control that the new automation was reliant upon came to resonate
    with the professional aspirations of the new managerialism that came to define
    the sector in the last quarter of the twentieth-century. A professional museum
    was an ordered museum, and an ordered museum was a museum that used the new
    documentation &ndash; driven by standards and automation (Parry, 2007). Within
    a generation (or two), therefore, the museum sector became familiar with the
    concept of a collection being organized and described in a highly structured
    and systemic way. Standardisation became orthodoxy. At least for classification
    and management purposes, semantics (the meanings associated with objects)
    became highly engineered.</p>
  <p>However, in
    the last five years, this &lsquo;engineering&rsquo; has been challenged by the new Web 2.0
    environment. We are now perhaps all too familiar with the ways in which what
    was once an extensively broadcast model of centralised, specialised, institutional providers publishing
    flat on-line pages predicated upon agreed protocols and standards of
    collections management, has been supplanted by a much more diverse on-line
    cultural heritage ecology. This is the digital landscape where users become
    producers, where &lsquo;pages&rsquo; are more transitory. This is a landscape characterised
    by syndication, where the Web (rather than in its old function as repository)
    becomes &lsquo;event&rsquo; and communications space (Pratty, 2007). (Or, to see it in
    Dickensian terms: this is a move from the Miss Havisham model to the Fagin
    model. The Miss Havisham model involves the museum sitting there in wedding
    dress waiting for people to turn up to the party, with cobwebs over the table,
    having gone to all this trouble, angry and bitter, destined to go up in flames.
    The Fagin model, on the other hand, is to be more cunning, to have lots of
    agents running around the city, slipping into all sorts of places, being
    discovered, not being discovered, moving things around, being exciting and, of
    course, being prepared to review the situation.) Significantly for our
    discussion here, this is a domain where meanings become more explicitly
    contested, where the diversity of on-line activity is matched by the diversity
    of interpretations and voices (Chun et al., 2006; Chan, 2007); and it is here
    where the orthodox syntax and semantics of museum collections become both
    negotiable and negotiated. </p>
  <h1>2. Collections and Semantic Technologies</h1>
  <p>Although
    not always stated as such, technology (specifically computer technology) has
    had a conspicuous role to play in museum semantics. The early publications of
    the Museum Data Bank (headed by Robert Chenhall, and based at the University of
    Arkansas Museum) are testimony to how, even in the early 1970s, museum curators
    worried about how computer technology would reflect (or shape) the semantics of
    collections (Vance 1974). Likewise, the first generation of hierarchical
    database management systems that, in the UK, set the parameters on the MDA data model in the mid-1970s posed a
    series of questions for the development team on to what extent the terminology
    and data entered would need to be consistent and controlled (Roberts and Light,
    1984). The relational models and systems of the 1980s, and the more flexible
    standard units of information and documentation protocols that they prompted,
    saw computing, knowledge capture and documentation influence each other yet
    again, as demonstrated in the publication of MDA&rsquo;s SPECTRUM standard in the
    early 1990s (Nuttall, 2000). Then later in the 1990s, and within the context of
    the Web, initiatives such as the European Union&rsquo;s &lsquo;Aquarelle&rsquo; project yet again
    wrestled with how cultural heritage content might be made interoperable despite
    being contained within different semantic and syntactical systems and within
    different software and hardware platforms (Dawson 1998). In each case, museums
    had to reflect not just upon information retrieval, the harvesting of data and
    the interoperability of their systems, but also (fundamentally) upon how they
    made meaning with their collections. In each case, these were technologies that
    aimed to support and reflect museum semantics.</p>
  <h1>3. The Unresolved Semantic Web</h1>
  <p>It is
    therefore into this deeper context of &lsquo;semantic technologies&rsquo; that our recent
    engagements with the Semantic Web might usefully be seen. For five years now
    the museum sector has had its self-proclaimed &lsquo;primer&rsquo; for understanding what
    might be the core building blocks of the Semantic Web (DigiCULT, 2003).
    Subsequently, Seamus Ross (2006) articulated a clear and beguiling lexicon and
    outline of how the Semantic Web can be characterised for the culture heritage
    sector; namely, that it is participatory (cultural heritage and academic
    institutions can participate as well as students allowing for growing
    interconnections of knowledge); interactive (it is possible to trace different
    pathways, contribute to the process of knowledge development and learn by
    watching how others are adding to these interconnections); retentive (the
    Semantic Web has the property of retaining knowledge links and being functional
    so both people and machines can continue to use them in different ways);
    trans-disciplinary (in the cultural sector, not only do we think of content as
    being the curator&rsquo;s input, but we can also build up interconnections of
    knowledge stories that other people have and build those into other datasets in
    other cultural institutions); and trans-cultural (building in the cultural
    interconnections between, for example, Picasso&rsquo;s work, when heavily influenced
    by African art, and the pieces which influenced him, and other cultural
    activities that were going on at that time). During 2006 and 2007, the &lsquo;UK
    Museums and the Semantic Web&rsquo; project funded by the AHRC also devoted
    considerable time to exploring the potentials and realities of these technologies
    for the sector. The objective of this series of workshops (the &lsquo;Semantic Web
    Thinktank&rsquo; as it soon become known) was to identify the key challenges and
    opportunities that the Semantic Web presented for museums and galleries in the
    UK and to define how the culture sector should respond to them. The Thinktank
    brought together experts from a wide range of disciplines, including museum
    policy and management, cataloguing and computational science. Over nine months,
    12 to 15 semantic Web experts and museum professionals gathered in a series of
    closely documented meetings around the UK to explore ways forward for the
    sector into this more digitally connected future
    (http://culturalsemanticweb.wordpress.com/). But more recently still &#8211;
    and more tangibly &ndash; the sector has at last begun to glimpse localized,
    small-scale manifestations of semantic technologies being constructed and
    applied to real heritage content and contexts (Amin et al 2007). </p>
  <p>In each case, these projects continued to recognise the
    importance of metadata, turning data into meaningful objects sitting within
    intelligent semantic Web structures. However, as the number of initiatives
    working in this area grows, a number of recurring obstacles and questions
    continue to characterise (if not plague) the research and development
    landscape. At a very fundamental and practical level, as Ross (2006) observed
    so succinctly, Semantic Web projects continue to be hampered by a lack of
    standards, a lack of skills, a lack of investment, a lack of strong case studies,
    and the lack of immediate reward. As well as a series of technical questions
    (what role for RDF, XML, OWL or Topic Maps?), there remain conflicting visions
    of how the Semantic Web may play within the cultural heritage sector. Will
    (should?) the Semantic Web be a unified and collaborative venture within the
    sector? Or, is it more likely to be (and more likely to succeed as) a series of
    contained and localized systems and projects linked to a specified set of sites
    and resources? Likewise, will the ontologies upon which the Semantic Web is so
    reliant be &lsquo;universal&rsquo;, inviolate and few in number, or (in contrast) highly
    localized, variable, liquid and multiple? Is the Semantic Web for the heritage
    sector likely to grow from a coordinated sector-wide set of agreements,
    standards and joint initiatives? Or will the sector find itself responding to
    more user-generated ontologies and community-created solutions for
    intelligently discovering and searching heritage content? </p>
  <p>Within these different versions of a semantic future for
    museums, there is at one extreme the vision of a hard &lsquo;Semantic Web&rsquo;, with
    prescribed and persistent ontologies predicated by the sector on existing
    collections standards (and perhaps term lists and thesauri) by the professional
    community of practice itself. On the other hand, there is a vision of a soft
    &lsquo;semantic Web&rsquo;, with user-defined (and likely more transitory and disparate)
    ontologies generated by different communities of interest outside of the
    institution. Both result in
    more efficient and intelligent resource discovery, but whereas the former
    appears to privilege an inward gaze towards more improved collections
    management, the latter looks instead outwards to how users outside the museum
    make their own meaning and search for and encounter digital cultural content
    on-line. </p>
  <h1>4. The Aspirational Semantic Web</h1>
  <p>What is the aspiration for the Semantic Web? What would a
    semantic museum look like, and what problems would it solve? We may be able to
    find some indication in some of the innovative services and partnerships in
    which museums are currently engaged. </p>
  <p>Recent work by Flickr in partnership with the Library of
    Congress (http://flickr.com/commons) illustrates the power and potential of
    working collaboratively with leading technology companies in developing
    semantic approaches. Using images from the Library of Congress collection as
    raw material, the popular photo-sharing service is enabling users to 'tag'
    images with their own descriptive metadata. In addition to providing
    semantically rich information, the project demonstrates the importance of
    bringing together content and platform in innovative ways. Politically and
    economically, this project represents an important step in the process of
    advocating a Semantic Web to the managers and funders of museum services. The
    culture sector is able to offer deep, rich contextual data and expertise in
    mediating and interpreting source materials. The private and commercial sectors
    are able to leverage technology, finance and market share to bring these
    cultural resources to a far greater audience than would otherwise be possible.</p>
  <p>Experience tends to show that there is a cascade effect
    among the titans of the on-line world. The interest of Flickr in taxonomy and
    social classification may also prompt interest from companies such as
    Microsoft, Amazon or eBay, all of which have strongly vested interests in the successful implementation
    of semantics as part of service delivery. This cascade may just provide the
    momentum and technical research and development required to move the Semantic
    Web on from a conceptual framework to a concrete reality, something which the
    culture sector on its own is not in a position to achieve. </p>
  <p>Most of the Internet's major companies are experimenting
    with tools, frameworks and systems which enable the user to interact not just
    with the information, but also at the level of the application itself.
    Platforms such as Google Base and Yahoo Pipes are encouraging a collaborative
    approach to experimentation and technical development. In this opening up of
    the development process, it is becoming increasingly feasible to embed true
    semantics into the base functionality of systems, and to expose these semantics
    to a massively distributed network. Above all, then, the semantic museum is likely
    to be one that is joined-up, integrated into and apparent within existing
    successful and large-scale consumer services. This, in itself, forms a
    compelling argument for museums to embrace semantics as a mechanism for
    reaching a vastly extended marketplace.</p>
  <p>In the near future, the museum sector's response to the
    Semantic Web has to connect to current practice in the creation, management and
    delivery of digital content. In this context, the traditional standards-based
    museum digital approach will stand us in good stead. February 2008 discussions
    on the Museums Computer Group (UK) news list passionately exposed the
    long-running debate in British museums and galleries about good metadata
    practice and what it is for. Imagining the real possibility of a socially
    networked Web built from clusters of networked and semantically connected
    databases, then the long, long legacy of straight museum data with good URIs,
    consistent metadata and simple tagging are seen to provide a vitally stable
    infrastructure on which to build.</p>
  <p>Another key development in the current generation of digital
    services is the erosion of the important of 'place'. As the Web itself moves
    further towards distributed platforms and dynamic media, it seems likely that
    Web 'sites' will come to be replaced by Web 'services'. In this world of
    diffuse identities and services, persistent semantics - the ability to share
    meanings between platforms as well as records - will become the prime currency.
    With this likely scenario in mind, we should perhaps be considering the places
    and contexts where our digital cultural content might be found in future.
    Already we are familiar with search page results where particles of content or
    individual collection items are sometimes found. Already we may be familiar with
    massive numbers of one-page viewers of our sites, visitors attracted by search
    engines. Better quality search results must surely result in the centre of
    gravity of the on-line museum running away from the place of publishing towards
    remote published contexts, like blogs, search results pages, re-skinned or
    repurposed sites. </p>
  <p>In this mid-term Semantic Web world, content needs to be
    self-describing, imbued with its own meaning and context. On your site it makes
    sense. When found in Google with a summary, it becomes puzzling. We know we
    need our content to be trusted, and we want our museum&rsquo;s name to be considered
    when the object or text is found in a search. </p>
  <h1>5. The Disruptive Semantic Web</h1>
  <p>The genesis of the Semantic Web lies in a very specific
    technological context. The way it is presented, the jargon it has engendered
    and the solutions it promotes are strongly geared towards the technologist, and
    this places the entire momentum of its development at risk. The tendency to
    this point has been for the technologists to presume that the majority of
    people need not concern themselves with how the Semantic Web will function, but
    that they will simply benefit from the better, richer, more meaningful and
    intelligent experiences they will enjoy as a result. This view, however,
    contains a fundamental error. It is not possible to &lsquo;build&rsquo; a Semantic Web,
    turn it on and enable people to use it. Instead, the development towards a
    semantically richer Web depends on the countless organisational and individual
    decisions made every day across the culture sector. It depends on the needs and
    expectations of the users of cultural services, and the extent to which
    semantic technologies and techniques can provide better service to meet them. </p>
  <p>Whether one thinks of them as a sector, or an industry, or a
    public service, museums and related cultural organisations are part of a
    collective whole which maps in the mind of the ordinary user to the concept of
    &lsquo;museum&rsquo;. Preparing museums for a Semantic future is a sector-wide issue which
    cuts across almost every area &ndash; from policy to standards, funding to
    professional practice. In this sense, the real challenge to pursuing a
    semantically rich cultural offer lies far away from technology. Effecting
    large-scale and permanent change across the museum sector depends on a variety
    of factors. From a top-down view, it depends on Government policy in areas such
    as technological innovation and social reform. These policy drivers inform both
    the strategic direction of the sector and, more important, the prioritisation
    of funding. From a bottom-up view, change depends on champions within
    organisations with the energy, commitment and management support to reset
    cultural values and attitudes. It depends on practitioners on the ground
    recognising and working to address the needs of the people who interact with
    their collections. </p>
  <p>As it is currently presented, the potential of the Semantic
    Web for museums lacks this quality of immediacy and clarity. Although the
    high-level, long-term aim is clearly stated, Semantic Web discourse rapidly
    disintegrates into a multitude of candidate technologies and models, each of
    which independently lays claim to the orthodox definition of a truly semantic
    Web. Museums cannot dictate what the Semantic Web becomes: they can only
    participate in its development. If they are to achieve the change necessary to
    ensure that they are prepared for the Semantic Web, it will be necessary to lay
    claim to one particular view of what it is and how it works. If money is to be
    secured, standards changed and staff employed, then it will be necessary to
    parcel up the concept of a Semantic Web for museums and quite explicitly sell
    it &ndash; to Government, to agencies, to funders and to the profession. </p>
  <p>Furthermore, if, over the last forty years, or even over the
    last ten years, we didn&rsquo;t have the time, resources, organisational commitment
    or systems in place to catalogue our collections, how is that we think we will
    have any of these things to make the collections semantically rich? The answer,
    of course, is that we won&rsquo;t &ndash; and this presents a fundamental challenge
    to the ability of museums even to consider how to participate in a Semantic
    Web. If the vision for the development of a semantic museums sector is
    decoupled from the realities and practicalities of making it work, then it
    quite simply will not happen. </p>
  <p>Nor does the development of the culture sector's response to
    the Semantic Web exist in isolation of the technical development which preceded
    it, and the current direction this work is taking. Building on the <em>Netful of
    Jewels</em> report (Keene, S. et al, 1999), much of the past decade of technical
    development for UK museums has been occupied in pursuit of a vision founded on
    access and education. This vision depended on achieving a critical mass in the
    on-line publication of collections information. Broadcast models such as
    mass-digitisation and the provision of on-line access to museum catalogues were
    intended to achieve a ubiquity of cultural content that was embedded, coherent
    and fit for a variety of different purposes. In contrast, the policy focus of
    recent years has shifted towards making more active use of the capacity that is
    distributed across the sector. Instead of funding content creation per se, a
    new generation of funding streams is focusing on developing the infrastructure,
    standards and skills to aggregate content from multiple sources and to broker
    it to content platforms and services. The new vision is of a multi-faceted,
    domain-agnostic system that is capable of using any number of protocols to
    aggregate data from multiple sources, of repurposing that data, and of
    expressing it to many different services in structured ways.</p>
  <p>As this policy agenda moves forward, however, it becomes
    increasingly exposed to the risk of diverging from the real, practical and
    on-the-ground business of managing a collection. The more the emphasis is
    placed on infrastructure and aggregation, the greater the danger that museums
    and practitioners will not be able to produce the content, the raw material
    with which to feed them. In this context, and inasmuch as it represents a
    next-generation challenge over and above the very real corporate challenges
    currently faced by cultural organisations, the Semantic Web may very well be a
    bridge too far. If museums are to become Semantic Web-ready, it will be
    necessary to divert these current developments to ensure that they address both
    the technical and cultural challenges surrounding the delivery of semantically
    rich resources.</p>
  <p>In the context of the Semantic Web, and indeed the more
    general trajectory of technological development in museums, the solution
    perhaps is prosaic but entirely necessary. Participating in the Semantic Web is
    no different, in practical terms, from participating in any other type of work.
    It requires skills and resources, it necessitates organisational and cultural
    change, and it requires clear practices and protocols. Although the potential
    of the Semantic Web is clearly transformative, the reality falls far short. In
    this sense, the progression towards a Semantic Web mirrors that of the
    development of Artificial Intelligence during the 1970&rsquo;s, 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s. The
    end goal is clear, but the path is anything but, and apparently promising
    approaches often yield very little progress. There is the sense, then, that the
    Semantic Web &ndash; tremendously powerful and promising though it may be
    &ndash; is a distraction from what should be the proper business of a museum in
    the digital age. Perhaps what is needed is clean and consistent data about
    objects, structured according to open standards and delivered through open
    architectures. Perhaps it is more important to develop the skills, both
    technical and managerial, to ensure that technology is well-planned and
    implemented, and that it delivers first and foremost against the core
    objectives of the organisation.</p>
  <h1>6. The Dilemma of the Semantic Web</h1>
  <p>At the heart of the discourse about museums and the Semantic
    Web, then, lies a dilemma.</p>
  <p>Intuitively, the imperative of the Semantic Web to connect
    meaning and object reflects the long-held imperative for museums to define, to
    classify and to present. There are approaches and models sitting alongside the
    development of a true Semantic Web which are clearly either parallel to or
    extensions of existing practices within museums. The Semantic Web also
    apparently has the potential to resolve some fundamental tensions which are
    currently inhibiting progress - such as the need to provide better-mediated
    search and discovery of resources via quasi-intelligent services. </p>
  <p>At a conceptual level, therefore, it seems as though the
    development of semantic technologies and methodologies is the next best step
    towards a fully integrated, always-on, mediated and contextual on-line cultural
    offering. The dilemma faced by museums, however, hinges on the significant gap
    between the vision and the reality of the Semantic Web - a gap which critically
    undermines the ability of the sector to move forward in a clear and
    constructive way. </p>
  <p>The whole on-line environment is experiencing a second
    generation that is characterised by rapid growth and equally rapid collapse.
    From this environment are emerging interesting and challenging models, some of
    which may point towards a more open and participative future. In the time since
    the first dotcom collapse in 2001, none of these models has had time to
    stabilise, to demonstrate its long term effectiveness. None of the Creative
    Industries has had time to learn about these new models, to test them out or to
    apply them in truly integrated ways to its services. </p>
  <p>Museums are understandably driven to embrace new
    technologies which support the provision of better services to users. From the
    earliest days of computing and data manipulation, museums have found ways of
    harnessing technologies to achieve their aims. Where these technologies have
    succeeded, it has been because there is a natural and intuitive fit between the
    functionality of the technology and the requirements of the museum and its
    users.</p>
  <p>The danger of the Semantic Web is that, unlike digitisation
    or cataloguing, it is not a coherent practice or set of practices. There is no
    coherent answer to the question, 'How do I do the Semantic Web?' and almost no
    information with which to make an informed decision about technologies,
    platforms, models and methodologies. Of course, most well-structured and
    standardised disciplines didn't start out as such, but the Semantic Web is
    proving uniquely resistant to specification and definition. </p>
  <p>Achieving a constructive role for museums in the Semantic
    Web demands resources, and securing resources depends on the ability of the
    sector to express a clear and compelling case for investment. This case
    ultimately hinges on the extent to which semantics enables more people to reach
    better museum services. This is the bottom line towards which the Semantic Web
    for museums must be oriented, and without which it runs the risk of shattering
    into a thousand disconnected splinters.</p>
  <p>As with everything else, the extent to which museums will be
    able to respond collectively and with confidence to the opportunities and
    challenges presented by the Semantic Web depends far more on politics,
    economics and people than it ever did on technology. After all the noise has
    died down, and the cutting edge of New Technology has moved on, it seems likely
    that the Semantic Web will prove to be, not our destination, but just another
    stop along the way.</p>
