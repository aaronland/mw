        <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText">In the provision of networked services for museums, the term
    'openness' crops up in a variety of contexts including <i>open
    standards</i> and <i>open source</i> software. In
    addition, the Web 2.0 environment has led to increased interest in <i>open
    content</i> and in the use of freely available networked applications which may be regarded
    as <i>open services</i>. This focus on
    openness for the developer or service provider can be complemented with a <i>culture
    of openness</i> which encourages the users to
  actively engage with services and generate their own content. </p>
<p class="AbstractText">It can be difficult to argue against the benefits which
    openness seeks to provide. But will a commitment to openness guarantee the
    deployment of effective and sustainable services? This paper explores in more
    detail the potential benefits of openness, but also acknowledges associated
    limitations. The authors argue that a more sophisticated approach is needed:
    one which seeks to make use of open standards, open source and open content if
    these can help to deliver sustainable services, but is prepared to take a more
    flexible approach if the perceived difficulties are felt to outweigh possible
  benefits.</p>

<h1>1. Aspects Of Openness</h1>
<h2>Open Standards</h2>
<p>The potential
    benefits of open standards in a networked development work are well understood.
  Use of open standards can help to: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Maximise access</b>: Cultural heritage services normally seek to
    maximise access to their resources and services. Ideally, access will not be
    limited by constraints such as the device used by the end users; their physical
    location; their location on the network, etc. or personal factors such as
    disabilities. </li>
  <li><b>Provide application- and device-independence</b>: The dangers of lock-in to particular
    applications or hardware platforms are widely acknowledged. </li>
  <li><b>Provide long-term access to resources and
    services</b>: Long-term access to
    scholarly resources and cultural heritage resources is of particular importance
    for public sector organisations. </li>
  <li><b>Support interoperability</b>: There will be a need to ensure that services
    and data can be used not only within their own environment, but also across other
    digital services and across other application areas. A prime purpose of open
    standards is to provide such interoperability. </li>
</ul>
<p>Such benefits
    explain why lists of relevant open standards have been developed for several
    national and international digital library development programmes, including,
    in the UK, JISC's Information Environment programme (JISC, 2001) and the
    NOF-digitise programme (NOF, 2001), and, in Europe, the Minerva programme
  (Minerva, 2004). </p>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>Free, Libre, and
    Open Source Software (FLOSS) is software that, amongst other things, ensures
    that the recipients  are able to use the software for whatever purpose they
    desire. Unlike closed source software,  users are provided with everything they
    need to modify and customise the software according to their needs. This
    customisation can be carried out by anyone with the required skills, such as
  the users themselves, an IT department or a third-party contractor. </p>
<p>This freedom to use,
    modify and redistribute software is fundamental to the Free and Open Source
    software movements. It is these freedoms that differentiate open source
    software from closed source software. However, open source software is not free
    as in beer; it is free as in speech. Although open source software does not
    carry licence fees, there are costs involved with implementing it in your
    organisation &ndash; costs which are often greater than purchasing closed
  source software.</p>
<p>Software rarely
    works as needed out of the box. Usually it requires customisation to integrate
    with existing systems and processes. The freedom to access the source code and
    modify it accordingly ensures that these customisations can be done in the most
    cost-efficient way available to your organisation. That is, you can use your
    own internal IT staff or you can engage an appropriate third-party contractor.
    With closed source software, only the software vendor has access to the source
  code in order to make these modifications.</p>
<p>The introduction of
    competition into the marketplace can increase the quality, satisfaction and
    flexibility of any solution. Furthermore, the availability of the source code
    for the application helps to ensure that the software remains valuable to the
    organisation regardless of the changing strategic objectives of any single
  software development or support organisation. </p>
<p>Finally, since the
    full source code of an application is available, there is no incentive to
    attempt to lock-in a customer by using proprietary extensions to file formats
    or data standards. Thus, the adoption of FLOSS will usually result in more
    complete adoption of open standards; that is, open source software will often
  enhance the benefits identified in the open standards section above.</p>
<h2>Open Content </h2>
<p>The notion of
    providing access to content in an open way is a core part of what has been
    labelled &quot;Web 2.0&quot;. Although this term has become part of the
    ecosystem in which we now work, the subtleties have in many areas yet to be
    worked out. For many people (and in many contexts), &quot;Open Content = Free
    Content&quot;. For organisations such as museums where exploitation of IPR is a
    core part of their business, this is understandably very hard to come to terms
  with.</p>
<p>The Creative Commons
    (CC) licence set [<a href="http://creativecommons.org/">http://creativecommons.org/</a>] was first published in 2002 and
    provides the means for authors to share their creative work under a set of
    terms which are relevant and easy to use in the age of the networked world.
    Creative Commons was set up to counter what is seen as an increasingly
    restrictive set of copyright laws among large media distributors. More
    recently, Creative Commons licences have been extended to include database
  rights (Nodalities, 2007). </p>
<p>Unlike watermarking
    or DRM (digital rights management), which enforce the use (or non-use) of
    content in particular ways, Creative Commons relies heavily on the trust of the
    individual who is using the derived work. As such it fits well with individuals
    who are licensing their work, but is viewed with more caution by institutions.
    For many museums, it is images which are of the most interest: these continue
    to be an important source of income generation: to date institutions have
    posted smaller images or watermarked large versions rather than providing
  full-size and full-access. </p>
<p>At the core of the
    debate about open access to content are a series of questions which go beyond
    the initial monetary value of a particular image or asset and instead start to
    focus on what value can be had to <i>opening</i> access to content rather than restricting it. The &quot;Google
    Effect&quot; - particularly around images, but also around other content types,
    means that content is often used and re-used in ways which don't match the
    original intention. Users consistently embed images from Google image searches
    on their MySpace pages or blogs: traffic is no longer necessarily the direct
    result of movement through a site. From a purely financial aspect,
    traditionalists would argue that this distills the financial impact of assets.
    From a marketing perspective, however, the benefits of allowing - or even
    encouraging - this approach are huge. The <i>long tail</i> of niche content particularly echoes the open
  approach.</p>
<h2>Open Services</h2>
<p>Any notion of open
    content requires the means of getting to the content. In the past this access
    was purely via the institutional Web site. Now, however, the content is being
    opened up: initially by search engines and better search engine optimisation.
    This simple form of &quot;openness&quot; made on-site content available to
  off-site tools such as Google images. </p>
<p>Open services take
    this openness a step further. Simple data feeds (such as RSS) provide access to
    content without requiring the user to visit the content-hosting site. A
    conventional application of RSS is for news and other rapidly changing content,
    but the premise is the same for any kind of content - for example, the feed at
    <a href="http://feeds.technorati.com/search/mw2008">http://feeds.technorati.com/search/mw2008</a> enables users to subscribe to a
    particular search term on Technorati. In essence, this is not an RSS feed, as
    most users understand it, but a programmatic means of remotely querying the
    Technorati site - the beginnings of a very simple API. Extending this notion
    that content can and should be exposed programmatically moves us into the
  realms of SOAP and REST (or possibly SOAP).</p>
<p>Increasingly,
    content rich sites are beginning to implement RESTful approaches to open
    content. Flickr, Google, Yahoo, Amazon, for example, all allow users to query
    their respective content databases and return results for use in third-party
  applications.</p>
<p>Many of these
    approaches are proprietary and sometimes commercial, but all have business
    models to ensure some level of sustainability and hence reliability. Most
    ensure that the original service isn't usurped by the third party application
  by having terms of service to ensure scales of use aren't abused.</p>
<p>Open services extend
    to <i>hosted Web applications</i> such as Google Maps, Simile Timeline, widgets, etc. In such cases, data may be
    passed to and from these applications, and end users are given the means to
  embed the interface on their own Web site. </p>
<h2>Open Culture</h2>
<p>Openness is a core
    component of Web 2.0. At the heart of Web 2.0 are core notions of putting users
    first: user-centricity and openness are therefore intrinsically linked. Web
    development companies and end users alike find that this humanising of
    institutions is an incredibly powerful driver for marketing. Companies like
    Microsoft actively encourage blogging, some of it critical of the company, by
    employees. This is a world apart from the traditional marketing approach where
    all comment and content about a company is carefully moderated. Users are
  increasingly welcoming an open debate rather than a closed, sanitised one.</p>
<p>This open culture
    encourages companies to be honest about mistakes, to take a modest and open
    approach to listening to users. From a user perspective, user-generated content
    has of course become a cornerstone of Web 2.0, and with it there is a drive to
    trust your users, allow them to self-moderate or even speak their minds in
    comments, blog posts and forums about you and the service you as an institution
  offer. </p>
<p>Open culture is also
    challenging: the authors have themselves focused on this in the past with
    papers (Ellis, 2007) looking at the issues which appear when openness is at the
    core of what you do on-line. Of particular interest to museums and other
    cultural institutions is always the question of authority: how to move from an
    environment in which the curatorial voice is absolute to one where the end
  users begin to curate - or at least to <i>prosume</i> - themselves.</p>
<h1>2. Complexities Of Openness</h1>
<h2>Open Standards </h2>
<p>Despite widespread
    acceptance of the importance of open standards and the feeling among some that
    use of open standards should be mandatory in the development of networked
    services in practice, organisations may fail to implement open standards in
    their provision of access to digital resources. This may be due to several
  factors: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Disagreements Over The Meaning</b>: There is confusion over the definition of
    &lsquo;open standard&rsquo;. For example, Java and Flash are considered by some to be open
    standards, although they are, in fact, owned by Sun and Macromedia, who have
    the rights to change the license conditions governing their use (perhaps due to
    changes in the business environment, company takeovers, etc.) Similarly, there
    are questions regarding the governance of apparent open standards, with the
    control of RSS 1.0 and RSS 2.0 providing an interesting example; this
    lightweight syndication format has a complex history plagued by disagreements
    over governance and the roadmap for future developments. </li>
  <li><b>Difficulties In Mandating And Enforcing
    Compliance</b>: There are also
    issues with the mandating of open standards. For example: What exactly does &lsquo;<b>must</b>&rsquo; mean? When told you must comply with HTML
    standards, a developer working on a project might first ask, &lsquo;What if I don&rsquo;t?&rsquo;
    Then what if nobody does? There is a need to clarify the meaning of <b>must</b> and for an understandable, realistic and
    reasonable compliance regime. </li>
  <li><b>Failure In The Market Place</b>: It also needs to be recognised that open
    standards do not always succeed in gaining acceptance in the market place: they
    may be too complex to be deployed, and the user community may be content to use
    existing closed solutions and reluctant to make the investment needed to make
    changes to existing working practices. </li>
  <li><b>Failure To Satisfy User Needs And Expectations</b>: There is a danger that a development approach
    may over-emphasise the importance of open standards to the detriment of the end
    users&rsquo; needs and expectations. </li>
</ul>
<p>Despite such
    reservations, in reality many IT development programmes are successful. The
    success may be based on the deployment of agreed-upon and well-defined open
    standards. However, in other cases, development work may adopt a more pragmatic
    approach, making use of mature open standards but having a more flexible
    approach to newer standards when there has been no time to reflect on the
  strengths and weaknesses and the experiences gained in their use.</p>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>Open source software
    is not a panacea: if you procure open source, it should be evaluated just like
  any other software solution. Consider, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Inactive development of the software:</b> It is important to look at the level of active
    development in a project before adopting it within your organisation. In the
    absence of active development, is your organisation willing to take responsibility
    for the project? </li>
  <li><b>Incomplete software: </b>Open source projects are encouraged to release
    early and often. This can result in software releases that are not yet ready
    for production use. Does the current release implement the critical features in
    your requirements? Can you find similar organisations which have implemented
    the software and are happy with it? Does the software work as it is supposed
    to? </li>
  <li><b>Lack of community support: </b>A healthy open source project will have an
    active support structure for new users. Such support is usually provided by
    volunteers who have an interest in the ongoing success of the project. A lack
    of such community support may be an indicator that there is little or no
    community development work, and thus the project may struggle with medium term
    sustainability issues. </li>
  <li><b>Lack of commercial support: </b>Whilst a healthy community support structure
    can be enough for those organisations with suitably skilled IT staff, other
    organisations will want to purchase support for the product. The presence of
    one or more commercial support organisations is often a strong sign that the
    project is healthy and viable. </li>
  <li><b>Incomplete documentation: </b>Documentation is perhaps the most commonly
    cited problem with open source. Look for published books and for up to date
    tutorials published on third-party Web sites. The existence of such materials
    may demonstrate that technical writers feel they can make a living by providing
    such documentation. </li>
  <li><b>Lack of adequate internal or contracted
    skills: </b>If your organisation
    chooses to train internal staff to support open source products, can you
    survive the departure of those staff members? Similarly, any contracted support
    company should be sufficiently staffed  to provide uninterrupted support.</li>
  <li><b>Unmanaged development model: </b>Open source development should not be chaotic
    and unmanaged. There should be a very clear development process that describes
    how contributions are made and how they are evaluated for inclusion. It should
    also describe how contributors investing considerable resource in
    customisations can become a part of the project management. This is to reassure
    significant contributors that their work will remain available to them in the
    future. Some projects have a formal structure governing this kind of development;
    others have a more fluid structure. In both cases the rules of engagement need
    to be clear. </li>
  <li><b>Internal open source policy:</b> An organisation that adopts an open source
    software solution should have a clear policy about how staff (either internal
    or contracted) engage with the open source project. It is important that,
    wherever possible, local modifications are shared with the central project.
    This helps to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the core project and reduce
    the cost of maintenance for the organisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to
    bypass these concerns by contracting a company to provide your solutions. The
    company can insulate the organisation from the open source projects used in the
    final solution. In this case it is the contractor who considers the above
    issues. However, it is recommended that the organisation take, as a minimum, an
    observer role within the open source development communities. This will ensure
    that the contractor is looking after the interests of its clients within the
    community and, should there be a need to switch contractors or bring the
    solution in-house, there is an understanding of how to do so. Engaging with
    open source communities is alien to most IT staff; however, it is not
  difficult.</p>
<h2>Open Content </h2>
<p>As outlined above,
    access to content has in the past been strictly controlled. Scarcity has
    historically been the definer of monetisation: limiting access to a particular
    resource or asset makes it sought after, and therefore increases financial or
  social value. </p>
<p>On-line, this access
    is much more fluid. Text and image content that is published on the Web is
    available to all; technologies that attempt to prevent or limit usage
    (watermarking or DRM software, for example) have met with limited success. DRM
    gets very bad press on-line: many of the recent drives by the music industry,
    for instance, have been around removing DRM limitations and giving people free
    access to music they have downloaded. Visually watermarked images are often
    seen as tainted images, made useless - or at very least less attractive - by
    the technology which is supposed to retain their value. Electronic watermarking
  is considered by most to be expensive to implement.</p>
<p>Users will often go
    to Google Images first to find a picture for their screensaver, blog or MySpace
    page. Watermarked images will most likely be ignored in favour of
    un-watermarked. In this and other contexts, the question that the content
  owners now need to ask themselves is: </p>
<p class="BlockQuote">..do we limit access
    to this content as we have done in the past, knowing that users are fickle
    enough to go elsewhere - or do we increase and encourage access, knowing that
  far more people will see and use our material if we do so..?</p>
<p>Overall, many
    industry commentators see the importance of scarcity being usurped by scale in
    this new world order - instead of limiting access, use the scale of the Web as
    the key driver in creating value. This may mean creating openness around assets
    and giving &quot;free&quot; access to them, and then building business models
    on the back of this; for instance, capitalising on the advertising value of an
  &quot;asset&quot; page with a high traffic throughput, or using this page to
    derive value with on-context linking (&quot;You liked this image. How about
  this exhibition?&quot;). </p>
<p>In the museum
    context, the &ldquo;long-tail&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; value of assets becomes crucial, and a
    question which is still yet to be answered adequately. If your institution
    doesn't make money from selling the image rights directly, then value has to be
    ascribed to the long tail of, for instance, marketing exposure, advertising
    exposure, brand, virality, etc.. This is complex and subjective. Often,
    understandably, institutions instead choose to lock down their assets and sell
  rights as they always have: it has a more obviously positive financial impact.</p>
<h2>Open Services </h2>
<p>Although there are
    many popular Web 2.0 services which are available for free, their use with a
    business context may cause concerns over the sustainability of the service,
    especially if it is used to support important business processes. The lack of
    agreed contracts and the difficulties in engaging in negotiations over the
    terms and conditions are likely to be alien to those involved in procuring
    software services and negotiating  contracts, terms and conditions. In addition
    to the concerns organisations may have over the long term sustainability of
    services with whom there may be no formal financial agreements, there may also
    be concerns over possible changes to terms and conditions (such as the
    introduction of charges or withdrawal of services) as well as concerns related
    to data lock-in. How easy, for example, will it be to migrate data to
    alternative services? It should be noted, though, that in addition to such
    concerns which are likely to be openly articulated, there may also be fears
    regarding possible down-sizing of a department or individual concerns over
  redundancies or de-skilling. </p>
<h2>Open Culture </h2>
<p>Organisations may
    also have worries regarding user-generated content (UGC), around  issues  such
    as providing blogs and wikis, encouraging individuals to comment on articles
    produced by museum professionals, or providing communication channels to
    facilitate more open discussions. Such concerns may be exacerbated if the
    services are hosted by third-party services as the legal responsibilities in
    such circumstances may be unclear. No matter where the service is hosted, the
    concerns are likely to include flaming and inappropriate language; copyright
    infringements; spamming; inappropriate or irrelevant materials; etc. There will
    also be concerns over the resource implications in providing and managing such
  services, especially the costs of moderating inappropriate content. </p>
<h1>3. Addressing The Complexities</h1>
<h2>Open Standards </h2>
<p>How should museums
    respond to the limitations of open standards described above? The authors feel
    strongly that such limitations need not mean an abandonment of a commitment to
    exploit the benefits of open standards. Nor should it necessarily mean imposing
    a stricter regime for ensuring compliance. As described in (Kelly et al., 2007a)
    experience has made it clear that there is a need to adopt a culture which is
    supportive of the use of open standards but provides flexibility to cater to
  the difficulties in achieving this. This culture and approach is based on: </p>
<ul>
  <li>a contextual model which recognizes the diversity
    and complexities of the technical, development and funding environments; </li>
  <li>a process of learning and refinement from
    patterns of successful and unsuccessful experiences; </li>
  <li>a support infrastructure based on openness,
    such as use of Creative Commons, to encourage take-up of support materials and
    address the maintenance and sustainability of such resources. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a need to
    recognise the contextual nature to this problem; i.e. there is not a universal
    solution, but we should try to recognise local, regional and cultural factors
  which will inform the selection and use of open standards. </p>
<p>Over time, in
    response to the problems outlined, the authors and others have developed a
    layered approach intended for used in development work (Kelly et al., 2005). </p>
<p class="caption">&nbsp;</p>
<p>This contextual
  approach uses the following layers: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Contextual Layer</b>: This reflects the context in which the
    standards are used. Large organisations may choose to mandate strict use of
    open standards in order to build large, well-integrated systems intended for
    long -term use. For a smaller organisation, perhaps reliant on volunteer effort
    with uncertain long-term viability, a simpler approach may be more appropriate,
    perhaps making use of proprietary solutions. </li>
  <li><b>Policy Layer</b>: This provides an annotated description (or
    catalogue) of relevant policies in a range of areas. The areas will include
    descriptions of standards, ownership, maturity, risk assessment, etc. It
    summarises the strengths and weaknesses of the standards. </li>
  <li><b>Compliance Layer</b>: This describes mechanisms to ensure that
    development work complies with the requirements defined within the particular
    context. For large, public-funded programs there could be a formal monitoring
    process carried out by external auditors. In other contexts, projects may be
    expected to carry out their own self-assessments. In such cases, the findings
    could be simply used internally within the project, or, alternatively, reported
    (if deviations are significant) to the funding body. </li>
</ul>
<p class="listwithbullets">It should be noted that, although it is
    possible to deploy this three-layered approach within a funding program or
    community, there will be a need to recognise external factors over which there
    may be no direct control. These may include legal factors, wider organisational
    factors (for example, there are differences among higher and further education,
    museums, libraries and archives), cultural factors, available funding and
  resources, etc. </p>
<p>It is also important
    to note that the contextual approach is not intended to provide an excuse to
    continue to make use of proprietary solutions which may fail to provide the
    required interoperability. Rather, the approach seeks to ensure that a
    pragmatic approach is taken and that lessons can be learnt from the experiences
    gained. In order to ensure that the experiences are shared across the
    development community (and more widely), it will be important to ensure that
    systematic procedures are in place to ensure that the experiences are properly
  recorded and widely disseminated. </p>
<h2>Open Source </h2>
<p>As described in
    (Kelly et al., 2007b), the contextual model developed to support the selection of open
    standards can be extended to include decision- making for the use of open
    source software. Although this approach can help in the selection of open
    source software, it does not address approaches which can help to ensure the
  sustainability of software which is developed under an open source licence. </p>
<p>Sustainable
    software, whether open source or not, is software that will generate profit or
    cost savings which consistently outstrip the development and maintenance costs
    of that software. In terms of cost savings from open source, it is important to
    note that such savings are spread across all active users of the software since
    all users of the software are able to contribute to the ongoing development of
    the product. Additionally, for open source, there may be companies providing
    profit-driven services based on the open source product. It is in their
    interests to ensure that the software remains viable; otherwise, a vital part
    of their product will be lost. Thus such companies will contribute towards the
  ongoing viability of the software as part of their business plan.</p>
<p>Conversely, for
    closed source software, a single vendor must be able to maximise returns from
    the software. Such a vendor creates a monopoly on licence fees and support,
    customisation and maintenance contracts. By creating a monopoly for these
    additional services, the closed source company restricts competition and can
  therefore set support prices as high as the market will bear.</p>
<p>However, making
    source code available under an open source licence is not sufficient to ensure
    the software becomes sustainable. There must also be a vibrant and active
    community of users who, either directly or indirectly, contribute to the
    ongoing development and support of the software. In this sense open source is
  more than a licensing model; it is also a way of developing software. </p>
<p>To create
    sustainable open source software it is necessary for someone to foster this
    collaborative community, to lead and coordinate that community&rsquo;s effort. That
    leader  must ensure that anyone who wants to contribute in a way compatible
    with the project&rsquo;s goals can do so with ease. Failure to foster this community
    will usually result in the software being abandoned (the originator has lost
    interest) or the code will be closed (the sponsoring commercial party is fed up
  with giving whilst receiving nothing in return).</p>
<p>That is, the success
    of open source software is dependant on the existence of enough users to make
    the product viable and the existence of a leader able to bring together those
    users in a collaborative support structure. Such support can be internal IT
    staff time or financial payments to third parties willing to support the
  software.</p>
<h2>Open Content </h2>
<p>Addressing the
    complexities of open content is likely to be more problematic than is the case
    for open standards and open source, as this will directly impinge on an
    organisation&rsquo;s business models. It seems likely than organisations will
    initially be reluctant to make changes which might appear to undermine
  well-established business models.</p>
<p>In many respects
    there are parallels with the growth on the Web in the mid-1990s. At that time
    there were conflicting pressures between enthusiasts who encouraged the
    establishment of a Web presence and pessimists who voiced uncertainties
    regarding  the reasons for doing this and concerns over the costs. There may be
    lessons to be learned in drawing these parallels, including changes in the
    users&rsquo; expectations, the development of new business opportunities, and also
    unexpected benefits which may be gained. There is also the need to assess the
    risks in failing to provide open content; including the danger of the
    traditional audience migrating to new services, and competing services
  exploiting failures to innovate.</p>
<p>It is worth noting
    the Library of Congress&rsquo;s recent announcement of a partnership with Flickr
    which aims to provide users with &quot;<i>a taste of the hidden treasures in
    the huge Library of Congress collection</i>&quot; (LOC, 2008). Such initiatives from high profile
    organisations such as the Library of Congress may help to encourage greater
  engagement with commercial providers. </p>
<h2>Open Services </h2>
<p>It is undoubtedly
    true that Web 2.0 companies may go out of business or change their terms and
    conditions. On the other hand, this is equally possible for traditional
    commercially-provided software or services with an agreed contract providing no
    guarantee of long-term sustainability of the services provided. But such risks
    occur in many walks of life: banks, for example, can (and do) go out of
    business, but this does not mean that one should ignore the banking profession
    and store one's savings under the mattress. Rather, in both our personal and
    professional lives we measures the risks associated with decisions we make and
    make judgements based on those risks, and we formulate plans for addressing
  problems if the risks are realised. </p>
<p>UKOLN has published
    a briefing document on Risk Assessment For Use Of Third Party Web 2.0 Services
    (UKOLN, 2007).  It summarises various risks associated with the use of
    externally-hosted Web 2.0 services. An example of how this risk assessment
    approach could be applied within the context of use of Web 2.0 services to
  support a conference is available (UKOLN, 2006a). </p>
<p>It should be noted
    that when carrying out the risk assessment ,one should also document the risks
    of doing nothing (which might include missed opportunity costs) and the risks
    associated with replicating well-established services. Google, for example,
    could go out of business or change the terms and conditions for its search
    engine, but would it be sensible to attempt to replicate this service? This exercise
    can also provide an opportunity to document the risks associated with
    continuing to make use of existing in-house services: for example, is the
    company which provides or supports the software and services you current use in
  a financially stable position? </p>
<h2>Open Culture </h2>
<p>Allowing end users
    to comment on your services will entail the risks of inappropriate content
    being published on your Web site. One response to such risks is to deploy a
    publishing regime which requires comments to be approved. However, this
    approach can acts as a barrier and deter users from engaging with the service.
    A number of services, such as The National Archives&rsquo; wiki (TNO, 2007), have 
    taken a decision to allow unmoderated updates to their wiki, but will remove
    entries if they are inappropriate. A similar pragmatic approach is being taken
    by Brooklyn Museum (Caruth, 2007) where a variety of Web 2.0 services, such as
  Flickr and Twitter, are being used.</p>
<p>Another potential
    danger is the risk of automated spam. Blog postings which are full of comments
    which advertise services will act as a barrier to the user of the service, as
    well as detracting from the service provider. However, spam filters such as
    Akismet seem to be successful in preventing a large proportion of automated
  spam.</p>
<p>The policy decisions
    which organisations need to make will be based on the perceptions of the
    likelihood of inappropriate content, the willingness to take such risks, and
    the mechanisms used to manage such risks. Organisations such as The National
    Archive have chosen to accept the possibility of inappropriate content being
    added to their wiki, but will have &lsquo;just-in-time&rsquo; policies for deleting such
    content and have documented guidelines for identifying inappropriate content
    (non-English language resources, for example, are not permitted, to avoid the
    dangers of inappropriate content being published in a language which the site
  owners do not understand).</p>
<h1>4. Conclusions</h1>
<p>Although the
    benefits of openness are increasingly being appreciated by and exploited by a
    variety of sectors, including cultural heritage, education, other public sector
    bodies as well as the commercial sector, the authors would argue that the
    cultural heritage sector, in particular, should be pro-active in its engagement
    in this area. Such engagement needs to be aware of the limitations. The paper
    has provided suggestions as to how such limitations can be addressed. However,
    in a spirit of openness which is in keeping with the theme of this paper, the
    authors invite readers to contribute to the discussion by sharing their
    experiences, positive and negative, of exploiting openness within their
  services.</p>
