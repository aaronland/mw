        <p class="AbstractText">Art history images essential for teaching art history and
    art appreciation courses at institutions of higher education are important for
    universities&rsquo; stakeholders (students, faculty and staff, local museums, and the
    neighbouring community). Digital images displayed on the Web sites of
    universities worldwide are generally made available through digitizing slide
    collections, subscribing to digital libraries of art history images, making use
    of faculty&rsquo;s personal images and using university library catalogues. When
    creating a collection of art history images, Russian universities are severely
    limited by budget constraints, staff problems and change-management
    difficulties. But creating a visual resource base can be made possible through
    launching a volunteer research project with researchers from various university
    departments. Siberian museums and research centres contributed by studying
    standards of creating visual information resources, building an art history
    image database, developing cataloguing tools, and involving students in
    research projects, as well as doing the practical work of creating an art
    history image library.</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Digital collections
    are crucial for distributing knowledge about cultural heritage, especially in
    higher education institutions. It is desirable that they combine world art
    treasures and local artwork. This educational resource is important for a large
    university located in a Siberian city of one million people with a high
    proportion of educated residents but limited access to cultural heritage due to
    its distance from European, American and Asian cultural centres, and its
    limited ability to use art history digital resources provided in English.</p>
  <p>Museum and
    educational Web sites presenting cultural heritage on-line cannot usually
    display a variety of images, either because they can show only their own
    resources or because there are legal constraints. But University Web sites
    presenting cultural heritage on-line are able to take into account legal
    matters (access is limited to university staff and students) and to display
    various images covering both art treasures worldwide and local art work. </p>
  <p>In addition,
    universities may have the human capital and information resources necessary to
    turn a university collection of images into a research centre presenting an
    amalgam of scholars working on their research projects, and graduate students
    from various departments assisting researchers in their work and forming
    specific collections of images related to their research topics. Museums and
    local art centres could also collaborate in this work, providing digital
    pictures and descriptions for the objects they want to show to the international
    public. Neighbouring communities could benefit from the derived collections of
    images illustrating a particular topic.</p>
  <p>Building a
    university collection of images in the universities of North America usually
    involves subscribing to digital libraries of images available on-line, buying
    images from commercial vendors, digitizing slide collections, and making use of
    teachers&rsquo; images. Digital libraries of images, as well as commercial software
    applications constructed for cataloguing images and filing them for teaching
    purposes, allow for creating slideshows and folders as well as sharing them
    through &ldquo;specific access points made available by the institution for specific
    assignments and study purposes&rdquo; (Wagner, 2007). </p>
  <p>However, according
    to a recent study (Green, 2006), faculty image use at liberal art colleges in
    the USA is still based on teachers&rsquo; personal collections of images supported by
    PowerPoint software (50 per cent of respondents). Twelve percent of respondents
    used ARTstor (as an image database and presentation software), while only five
    per cent of respondents applied specialized image management and presentation
    software (Luna Insight, CONTENTdm, MDID). The report&rsquo;s author recommends action
    &ldquo;to build and  share easy-to-use, open-source tools to assist faculty to use
    and present images more fluently&rdquo; (Green, 2006). </p>
  <p>Even if art
    historians and teachers have personal collections of images to rely upon for
    their teaching and research purposes, visual resource centres serve the
    university community and university stakeholders. These university stakeholders
    involve students (sometimes from departments other than the Art History
    Department), university faculty and staff, and, indirectly, the local
    community. Database management tools and creative opportunities presented by
    visual resource centres in terms of research project results added to the
    collection and available to the general public are invaluable instruments for
    disseminating knowledge on civilizations and cultures, especially in the
    context of globalization and the necessity for knowledge of European and Asian
    cultural heritage to be transmitted in both directions.</p>
  <h1>Collections of Art History Images at Russian Universities </h1>
  <p>Financial
    constraints significantly limit acquiring library resources in Russian
    universities. Obtaining digital resources of images through subscription or
    purchase is, unfortunately, next to impossible. Art history teachers tend to
    use personal and shared collections of scanned images both because they have
    budget constraints and because they do not feel they need licensed images or
    images from free on-line collections. An art historian with whom one of the
    authors talked said that, &ldquo;it was useless to download images from the Web
    because of their bad quality. Images scanned from scholarly monographs produced
    much better results in terms of remembering and understanding an art object&rdquo;. </p>
  <p>However, according
    to Robert Nelson, Art History Professor from Yale University, teaching with
    digital images and giving students an opportunity to access them on the
    university Web site moves art history courses from the stage of memorizing
    images to the stage of reviewing them after classes and knowing them
    thoroughly. Other advantages of using PowerPoint presentations with digital
    images include:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote"> inserting quotations
    and referring to text materials, finding on-line images of the current state of
    a monument, bringing music and other kinds of media in, lecturing off a Web
    site, bringing personal digital pictures and experience of monuments into the
    classroom. (Nelson, 2006)</p>
  <p>In spite of having
    the set of problems indicated by Ken Hamma, Executive Director for Digital
    Policy and Initiatives at the Getty Trust, in his interview for <i>Academic
    Commons; </i>that is, the cost and
    difficulty of running a collection of art history images as well as &ldquo;high entry
    barriers (software license, maintenance fees, technology staff, infrastructure
    development, professional services),&rdquo; Russian universities join the general
    feeling that &ldquo;we are falling behind as a community by not fully participating
    in the online information environment&rdquo; (Hamma, 2007).</p>
  <p><i> </i>Russian experience of building image database
    management tools on-line includes a famous digital collection of the Hermitage
    Museum. As of 2006, the digital collection had 10,000 high-resolution images in
    twelve categories. Images can be retrieved and  enlarged, and a specified
    fragment can be downloaded in higher resolution. Textual information is
    provided both in Russian and in English.</p>
  <p>Russian universities
    belong to the institutions &ldquo;that are not doing anything and are not going to do
    things that are more expensive and time consuming&rdquo;. This happens due to budget
    constraints and due to the difficulties of &ldquo;content, development and
    maintenance, staff training, and change management&rdquo;. Ken Hamma&rsquo;s ideas of
    digital policy development as &ldquo;stewardship and dissemination of knowledge,
    digital preservation&hellip;&rdquo; could serve the community of scholars and general
    public, if they could be turned into a real project of a </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">nonprofit service model:
    management and collection cataloging software for institutional and individual
    collectors. It might manage software as an integrated suite of web applications
    along with centralized data storage and other required infrastructure at a
    single point for the whole institutional community. (Hamma, 2007)</p>
  <p>The Getty project is
    based upon a recently developed data standard CDWAlite, which is a shorter
    version of CDWA, &ldquo;a framework to which existing art information systems can be
    mapped and upon which new systems can be developed&rdquo;(Hamma, 2007). The framework
    will create vocabulary resources and descriptive practices to make image
    resources in art history aggregated at various institutions more compatible and
    more accessible.</p>
  <p>If such a data
    standard, combined with the possibility of harvesting data from a network of
    institutions, were created, it would benefit the community worldwide and the
    educated public in poorer areas, in particular.</p>
  <p>Visual resources
    centres, although nonexistent in Russian universities, could be created to
    disseminate knowledge on cultural heritage and to serve as research centres
    that provide information and library services for student research projects in
    art history and adjacent subjects, as well as the possibilities of hands-on
    experience in creating separate collections as parts of students&rsquo; coursework.
    These possibilities could be extended to involve students from the Department
    of Computer Science, Department of Translating and Interpreting, and the
    Department of Museum Computing. </p>
  <h1>Art History Images on the Web site of Siberian Federal University</h1>
  <p>The Department of
    Information Resources, Siberian Federal University, launched an Art History
    Project to be hosted on the university&rsquo;s Web site in 2006. The project aims at
    creating an on-line resource base of high-resolution images supported by a
    search engine for advanced search, as well as a number of services. About 300
    images have been catalogued using several parameters. The resource base is an
    MS Access relational database designed for cataloguing images according to
    their creator&rsquo;s name, title, period, medium, culture, country and subject. </p>
  <p>The team has done
    research on best practices of cataloguing and displaying images on museum Web
    sites. The project coordinator studied European and American museum Web sites
    in terms of their image resolution and zooming, search options, educational
    services, opportunities for browsing and copyright policies, and opportunities
    to source images already in the public domain. The sources studied included fifty
    European, American and Asian museum Web sites. The main findings include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>very few museums present high resolution
      images, for obvious reasons of protecting their copyright and receiving
      financial gains from licensing the use of high resolution images;</li>
    <li>half of museum Web sites studied provide
      zooming options so that at least fragments of pictures are available in high
      resolution;</li>
    <li>search options mainly include &ldquo;collection
      highlights&rdquo; and &ldquo;quick search&rdquo;; some museums also provide &ldquo;advanced search&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;type of art&rdquo; selection;</li>
    <li>several museum Web sites have various
      educational services, adding value to visiting the Web site and providing
      additional browsing options</li>
    <li>very few museum Web sites provide additional
      browsing opportunities that differ from the search organized by subject tagging
      (the Metropolitan Museum offers additional features that enhance browsing
      opportunities)</li>
    <li>copyright policies for using images for
      educational purposes vary dramatically across countries, but in most cases they
      allow for a flexible approach. (Visitors are encouraged to establish contacts
      to find out whether images can be used on educational Web sites provided they
      are protected by a password; many museum Web sites openly declare it to be
      their policy in relation to educational institutions)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to its
    basic function of serving as a source of images for the faculty, the image
    archive on the Web site of Siberian Federal University is expected to help
    students to review images after classes, to create their own slide shows, and
    to publish them on-line for comparison and evaluation. Additional features soon
    to be added to the archive include a glossary of architectural terms with links
    to relevant images; artists' biographies; random search; and excerpts from
    selected art readings, with appropriate links to the images from the university
    collection.</p>
  <p>A special Web site
    feature is monthly exhibitions prepared by art history students as part of
    their course work. Another special feature is the introduction of local art
    work. The site will show a selection of images presenting Siberian decorative
    patterns (ornaments) with links to their European, Asian and Siberian sources.
    This part of the site is provided with a special search engine and cataloguing
    tools specially developed by the authors for advanced search of ornamental
    motifs. Images can be retrieved according to their country of origin, motif
    type, period, and object on which the ornament is depicted. The catalogue is
    being developed by Dr.  Batorova, Dr.  Lozhkina and Dr. Kocheva, scholars with
    significant experience in investigating Siberian ornaments. </p>
  <p> The digital collection is designed as an educational tool for university
    students and art history teachers working in secondary schools in the
    community. Project Advisor is Dr.  Raissa Lozhkina, Associate Professor of Art
    History at Siberian Federal University. All the textual information is sourced
    from museums, translated by the Project Coordinator and provided in Russian.</p>
  <p>The experience of
    the Hermitage Museum where one of the authors spent four days studying good
    practices of building and maintaining the museum digital collection of images
    was especially helpful for understanding the practice of building thesauri for
    describing images.</p>
  <p>Researchers involved
    in the project represent various university divisions. Images are selected with
    the help of an Associate Professor of Art History from the Department of
    Ethics, Aesthetics and Culture, Siberian Federal University. They are
    classified and catalogued by Inna Kizhner, Project Coordinator from the
    Department of Information Resources. All the textual information sourced from
    museums is translated into Russian and ascribed to appropriate images through
    the image database. The project is technically maintained by the Department of Information
    Resources under the supervision of its head, Anna Kulikova. It is created as an
    educational resource within the university Web site. Images for monthly
    exhibitions, a special Web site feature, are prepared by the undergraduate
    students from the Department of Art History. They are advised by Dr. Mirkes,
    Associate Professor at the same department. The software for exhibitions is
    developed by the undergraduate students from the Department of Mathematics and
    Computer Science as a part of their coursework. They are advised by Dr.
    Popelnitsky, Associate Professor from the Department of Computer Science.
    Images for the local artwork section are presented by Dr. Lozhkina and Dr.
    Kocheva, Senior Researcher from the Department of Physical Problems, Bouryat
    Scientific Centre, Russian Academy of Sciences.</p>
  <p>The team&rsquo;s research
    on university collections of art history images benefited greatly from a visit
    to the Slide Library, History of Art, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.
    One of the authors had an opportunity to learn about the practice of building a
    university collection of images and to discuss its challenges, ranging from
    legal constraints to the resolution of images to digital preservation, with Ms
    Renee Doron-Gorochovski, Slide Library Director. </p>
  <p>The team has done
    research on building university collections of images, and cataloguing software
    and thesauri, and studied twenty Web sites of visual resources centres at
    various American universities. The main findings include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>most visual resources centres have digitized
      slides as the foundation of their collection;</li>
    <li>the majority of visual centres under study add
      digital libraries (ARTstor, CAMIO, Grove Art Online) available under
      subscription or buy images from commercial vendors (Saskia Art Images Collection);</li>
    <li>many visual resource centres try to integrate
      faculty&rsquo;s images;</li>
    <li>from the information available on the centre&rsquo;s
      Web sites, it can be assumed that very few centres collaborate with faculty and
      students to create further features to add to their collection and to promote
      research work as well as create liaison Web sites to disseminate scholarship;</li>
    <li>a third of the centres studied have commercial
      software or open source software for cataloging images or for using them in the
      classroom;</li>
    <li>many large universities create Web-based union
      catalogues to involve all digital images available at university libraries
      (Cumulus image database server at Boston University; Almagest (Princeton
      University Image Database); Harvard University Library Visual Information Access).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Creating a
    collection of art history images on a Russian university Web site under heavy
    budget constraints and without a slide library seems both a challenging and a
    viable project. The main challenges are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>obtaining permissions to publish images on the
      university Web site (some museums may not permit a university to post images on
      its password-protected Web site); </li>
    <li>sourcing high resolution images (although the
      Metropolitan Museum gave its permission for the use of 1700 high resolution
      images via ARTstor for scholarly publications, it is still unusual for high resolution images to be publicly available);</li>
    <li>creating a team of researchers, visual
      resources librarians and IT specialists working for a volunteer project.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The viability of the
    project is based on its relative novelty for Russian educational institutions.
    While building a university collection of digital images, faculty, staff,
    students and other interested parties feel they participate in the on-line
    information environment, develop research projects, contribute to their
    institution&rsquo;s development, introduce new forms of teaching, and work on a
    creative project to meet the local community&rsquo;s educational needs. </p>
