      <h1 class="Author">Introduction</h1>
      Even though the Nordic countries are small, it would be preposterous to pretend to map all the activities in the Nordic countries in this field. Instead, this paper will try
        to outline some lines of development and present some examples of
        implementations. In the last five years, a number of projects combining
        materials from archives, libraries and museums have been initiated in Denmark
        and other parts of Scandinavia; all involving different new technologies in
        order to present the material in innovative and immediately accessible ways. It
        is interesting to examine the approaches underlying the different projects and
      the resulting differences in user experience. 
      </p>
      <p>One group includes
        mind-mapping, topic maps and other similar technologies in order to present
        large bodies of material in an ordered manner independent of the classification
        of the individual institutions. Other projects have relied on more traditional
        approaches using a limited set of common data to enable aggregated searches. A
        different group of sites have a more limited scope. Some of these try to tell
        coherent stories based on limited but thoroughly researched material; others
        depend on presenting large bodies of material on a single subject, or on a
      smaller area of subjects. </p>
      <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p>One of the principal
        obstacles for all attempts at presenting cultural heritage information from the
        ALM-area is the different outlook of the different kinds of institutions. These
        differences have conditioned development of individual world-views and
        accordingly  affect decisions on what types of information are necessary and
        relevant. Furthermore, information that is common to all institutions, such as
        names, places and dates, is seldom registered following the same standards;
        even more important, classification systems are radically different from one
      institution to another. </p>
      <p>One of the principal
        challenges for all types of cooperative projects in this area is  therefore the
        merging of the different ontologies of the institutions. Based on a preliminary
        survey, the projects seem to fall into a few rather distinct categories. One is
        projects aiming at presenting the material in &ldquo;pure&rdquo; form, thus leaving
        interpretation to the user. Another tries to present the material together with
        context, in order to make it more intelligible to users not inherently familiar
        with the subject matter. Yet another tries   to develop the individual
        information snippets into coherent narratives, thus making it interesting to a
        wider audience. This paper analyses advantages and drawbacks of the specific
      solutions. </p>
      <h1>Possible Solutions</h1>
      <p>It is evident that
        the digital presentation and utilization of the immense number of materials is
        to some extent at a parting of the ways in a Scandinavian context. On the one hand,
        there is a policy of letting &ldquo;a thousand flowers bloom&rdquo;; on the other hand, a
        strongly perceived need to make all these diverse sources of information more
      easily available, to allow aggregated searches in some form. </p>
      <p>This last approach
        comes in two distinctively different flavors.  One attempts to make everybody
        use the same system, or at least report a set of core data to a centralized
        database. The other tries to build a transparent interpretation layer between
      the individual  databases and the users.</p>
      <p>The schools of
        thought lying behind these two different approaches are clearly linked to
        different notions of how easy it is to extract meaning from natural language,
        and to different  ideas of the semantic Web in general. There are those who
        believe that this is not only theoretically possible but also practicable,
        while others think that this possibility is at best only attainable in a
        not-too-certain future. The former tends to advocate ontology-based solutions,
      while the latter favors centralized repositories using controlled vocabularies.</p>
      <p>In order to
        understand the policies adopted in the cultural heritage area, a little
      background on the history of Nordic museums in necessary.</p>
      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>In Denmark and the
        other Scandinavian countries, the overwhelming majority of the local museums
        are sprung from popular initiatives in the decades around 1900. Partly because
        of their origins, there has been a marked propensity for independence. In this
        context it has taken the form of numerous individual databases and
        presentations of different bodies of material. In all fairness, it must be
        noted that many of these were done by first-movers, long before any centrally
        organized system could have been operational. The drawback is that they magnify
        the task of aggregating searches and effectively limit them to a very basic set
      of data.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig1.html"><img src="moehlenfeldt-jensenfig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="400" height="291" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig1.html">Fig 1: Opening page of the historical atlas of Funen</a></p>
      <p> Even today, many
        well-functioning systems are based on the work of a small body of individuals. A
        case in point is &ldquo;the historical atlas of Funen&rdquo; (Figure 1). In the opening
        page of the museum of Odense, the third largest city in Denmark (185.000
        inhabitants), presents geographically organized historical material on the
        island of Funen (<a href="http://www.historiskatlas.dk/">http://www.historiskatlas.dk</a>). As can be seen from the
        screenshot, this is done using a map as background, grouping the information
        physically around this. It is clearly a well-functioning site, but it is not
      immediately usable in other connections.</p>
      <p>A number of initiatives
        try to induce the individual institutions to report to central repositories,
        often using controlled vocabulary and a limited amount of information
        (parameters). An example of this is the Danish <i>museernes samlinger</i> (collections of the museums) which makes it
        possible to search in the aggregated database of the ministry of culture (see
      figures 2 and 3). </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig2" id="fig2"></a><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig2.html"><img src="moehlenfeldt-jensenfig2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="400" height="186" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig2.html">Fig 2: The initial page of http://www.kulturarv.dk/mussam/index.jsp</a><a href="http://www.kulturarv.dk/mussam/index.jsp"></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig3.html"><img src="moehlenfeldt-jensenfig3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="400" height="313" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig3.html">Fig 3: A search result from &ldquo;mussam&rdquo;</a></p>
      <p>This database is
        populated partly through museums using a common interface &quot;Regin<b>&quot;</b>, and partly through XML import from individual
        databases. All Museums are required by law to deliver data to this database,
        using either of the two methods. Not all museums are at present contributing,
      but this will shortly be the case. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig4" id="fig4"></a><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig4.html"><img src="moehlenfeldt-jensenfig4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="400" height="318" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig4.html">Fig 4: Data entry page of &ldquo;regin&rdquo;</a></p>
      <p> As is seen, the
        interface is very similar to the external interface of <i>mussam</i>, which of course indicates the temporary
      nature of the current GUI.</p>
      <p>As is apparent, the
        user friendliness of the current interface leaves a lot to be desired.  At
        present a large project to create common tools for the presentation of these
        data is underway. The museum of Copenhagen is involved in this development
        which includes, among other tools, a timeline. The idea behind these tools is
        primarily to enhance the usability of the common database, but also to make it
        possible to present data from the database together with information gathered
        for specific purposes. An example of the use of this could be to integrate
        information on Danish artifacts together with important dates in the history of
        other cultures. In this way, the immigrants to Denmark would get easier access
        to Danish cultural heritage to see its relationship to other cultures. This
      project is planned to be operational by the end of this year.</p>
      <p>In Norway, the ALM
        area has been integrated at the state level in a government body called <i>ABM-utvikling</i>, which among many other initiatives has
        initiated a process of consolidation of the museums, trying to merge smaller
        units into larger, more professionally run units. This process has of course
        met with some opposition, as it necessitates unification of a lot of routines
      formerly done individually.</p>
      <p>This leads to
      another line of separation in the area of cultural heritage presentation.</p>
      <h2>What is <i>Presentation</i>?</h2>
      <p>In Denmark at least
        there have been many attempts to qualify the term <b>presentation,</b> in order to distinguish between just making
        material available, and disseminating knowledge with the material as the
      vehicle. </p>
      <p>The former is, of
        course, much easier, and, it can be argued, is a necessary condition for the
        latter. This is to a large extent correct, but in actual practice many projects
        remain at the first level. While they may be very useful for &ldquo;the trade&rdquo;, they
        are practically of no use to the general public. Therefore, they are not a good
        argument in favor of increased grants, and ultimately not a good argument for Web-based
      presentation/learning.</p>
      <h1>A New Approach</h1>
      <p>The site
        <a href="http://www.absalon.nu/">http://www.Absalon.nu</a> which I demonstrated last year is an attempt at another
        approach; a third way, so to speak Instead of waiting for the perfect
        foundation for the presentation, we have initiated the aggregated search,
        hoping that enhancement of the material will go hand in hand with enhancement
        of the GUI. This approach is at the site complemented by the inclusion of an
        encyclopedia, in which the information is controlled by the institutions. In this
        way we hope that the two sides will complement each other, and create a both
      reliable and innovative experience.</p>
      <h2>User Reactions</h2>
      <p>User reactions to
        this have been twofold. On the one hand, reactions have been very positive,
        apart from users directing our attention to specific errors. On the other hand,
        the use of the site has been much less than anticipated. It must be noted,
        however, that we have deliberately not advertised the site, for two reasons.
        First of all, we wanted to have a period without too much traffic, in order to
        be able to solve performance issues. Secondly, it must be said,  parties in the
        institutions have been hesitant towards directly advertising a site with
        content that was less than 100% controlled by the institutions. The compromise was
      that we started off gathering experiences and user reactions. </p>
      <h2>Drawbacks</h2>
      <p>One of the drawbacks
        to this solution has turned out to be that in the period of collecting
        experiences, the iconography of the Web changed so much that the design and
        look-and-feel of the site have become an obstacle to its acceptance. We have as
        a consequence been forced to revamp the site, a modernization we hope to
      introduce in April of this year.</p>
      <p>Another is the
        disadvantage of living in a non-Anglophone country: we cannot easily take
        advantage of large international thesauri, ontologies, etc. Before we can
        utilize ULAN, TGN, etc., we have to translate labels. This involves much labor,
        and invariably gives rise to discussions about whether it would be better to
        create our own, and this is in turn even more time-consuming &hellip;. It quickly
      turns into the old discussion of the best being the enemy of the good.</p>
      <h2>Another Approach</h2>
      <p> Another approach is
        followed by sites where the aim is to present resources in a more portal-like
        way. The Norwegian site <a href="http://www.kulturnett.no/">http://www.kulturnett.no</a> presents events, temporary
      exhibitions and the like. More similar to the Danish <i>mussam</i> is the Norwegian <a href="http://www.primusweb.no/">http://www.primusweb.no</a> .</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig5" id="fig5"></a><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig5.html"><img src="moehlenfeldt-jensenfig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="400" height="291" border="0" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig5.html">Fig 5: Primusweb: Opening page </a></p>

      <p class="caption"><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig6.html">Fig 6: Primusweb, result, showing a traditional Norwegian
      costume</a></p>
      <p> The Swedish, site
      run by the office of the &ldquo;state antiquarian,&rdquo; is also similar.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig7" id="fig7"></a><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig7.html"><img src="moehlenfeldt-jensenfig7.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="400" height="284" /></a></p>

      <p class="caption"><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig8.html">Fig 8: Result from a search on pictures</a></p>
      <p>In the same vein but
        with an even more austere interface is <a href="http://www.arbimus.dk/">www.arbimus.dk</a> (&ldquo;arbimus&rdquo; is an acronym
        based on the initial letters in arkiv, bibliotek, museum (archive, library,
      museum). </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig9" id="fig9"></a><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig9.html"><img src="moehlenfeldt-jensenfig9.jpg" alt="Figure 9" width="400" height="255" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig9.html">Fig 9: The arbimus Web site</a></p>
      <p>This last system
        does indeed make the material available, but the search tools are limited to
        free text, offering a choice from 45 categories in 5 groups and/or from a list
      of 5 different types of material.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig10" id="fig10"></a><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig10.html"><img src="moehlenfeldt-jensenfig10.jpg" alt="Figure 10" width="400" height="248" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig10.html">Fig.10: The arbimus list of topics </a></p>
      <p>An approach somewhat
        similar to absalon is the Swedish &quot;<i>sams&ouml;k</i>&quot; (aggregated search) which is based on creating a transparent
      layer between the individual databases and a common search interface.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig11" id="fig11"></a><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig11.html"><img src="moehlenfeldt-jensenfig11.jpg" alt="Figure 11" width="400" height="347" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig11.html">Fig. 11: http://samsok.museum24.se Opening page </a></p>
      <p>Behind the scenes it
        is planned to collect the content of these mappings and in time use them to
        turn the site into an ontology-based search-engine. This has the advantage of
        being useful from day one, and evolving into a more and more advanced system.
        Current plans are underway to test the system in a Scandinavian setting, to try
      to internationalize the search.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig12" id="fig12"></a><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig12.html"><img src="moehlenfeldt-jensenfig12.jpg" alt="Figure 12" width="400" height="349" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig12.html">Fig 12:  Part of result, showing cupboard </a></p>
      <p>One of the principal
        decisions required before building a site of this character is whether to
        include all material or limit content to materials that are deemed &ldquo;fit to print&rdquo;.
        The case in Scandinavian museums, as probably in most museums, is that many of
        the registrations are made for internal purposes. That means that there has
        traditionally been neither the need to proofread the registrations nor the need
      to express oneself in a manner immediately understandable to everyone.</p>
      <h2>The Institutional Culture</h2>
      <p>It seems that the
        approaches to solving these types of problems are very much linked to the
        general outlook of the person(s) in charge, and to the &ldquo;ethos&rdquo; of the
        institution in question. I can&rsquo;t help recalling the differences explained at
        last years MW between the Smithsonian and Brooklyn museum, regarding how much
      control was felt necessary in the area of blogging.</p>
      <p>In Denmark, for
        example, some museums have felt that making the material known at all has
        priority, and have accordingly made a subset of their recorded information
        available, even if it at times it is very scant indeed. Examples of this are
        the already-mentioned NOKS and Arbimus. Other museums have made material available
      only after proof-reading and enhancing the data.</p>
      <p>Absalon has tried to
        devise automatic and semiautomatic ways of rectifying the more  basic omissions
        and obvious errors. To illustrate the problems facing public use of the 
      material, the question of dating is a case in point. </p>
      <h2>The Problem of Dating </h2>
      <p>One of the problems
        with poor quality data, at least in many Scandinavian museums, is the lack of
        dating, especially of archaeological artifacts. As everyone working with the
        artifacts knows the rough dating of the object in question, there is no need to
        include this in the registration. Dating is included only if it is a closer
        dating based on context or the result of scientific dating like radiocarbon
        dating or the like. The consequence of this is, however, that these
        registrations are useless if the museum wants to present them on a timeline.
        This is an area where semi-automatic, algorithmical methods might be employed
        to enhance the data. In Danish museums, the concept of cultural-historic
      periods is used to give this dating; e.g. Viking age, middle age, etc.</p>
      <p> In the case of
        datings, it would probably be possible to add outline dating of the individual
        types based on cultural relationships to allow presention of the artifacts with
      a reasonable chronological precision.</p>
      <h2>The Problem of Personal Data</h2>
      <p>Another problem
        which is not so easily solved concerns personal data. In many cases, persons
        are named in connection with the acquisition of the artifacts. Mention can be
        in the form of donors or comments concerning former use. At times the staff
        have made comments, including personal remarks. These types of data are
        naturally not fit to publish, if for no other than legal reasons. The snag is
        that these remarks are not always confined to the field where one would expect
        them, and it is therefore difficult to be absolutely sure that they do not slip
      out unless every record is thoroughly checked before publication.</p>
      <h2>The Problem of Proofing</h2>
      <p>A perhaps less
        serious debate, but one that nevertheless causes profound discussion,  arises
        over the amount of proofreading that should go into digitized texts. This is an
        area where there have been huge differences between institutions, and even
        greater between public institutions and private enterprises; that is, between
        museums, archives and libraries on one hand and user-initiated projects on the
        other. The latter have to a much larger extent made the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; OCR&rsquo;ed texts
        available and left it to the users to proofread, while the majority of
        institutions have felt that the impossibility to make exhaustive searches on
        texts with many errors made them unusable for their purposes, and have felt
        that the importance of the reputation of the institution prevented it from
      presenting such faulty material.</p>
      <p>There have, of
        course, simultaneously been those advocating the other approach, again arguing
        that &ldquo;the best is the enemy of the good&rdquo;.  In other words: if we have to wait
        for the texts to be proofread, we&rsquo;ll all be dead before we see them on the Web.
        More to the point, even the limited usability of the uncorrected texts is an
        improvement over no digitized text at all, until proof-reading can be
        completed. As with most questions of this type, there are political aspects as
        well as professional. There is widespread fear that if just the faulty text is
        on the Web, funding for the much less visible task of correcting will be harder
      to get. </p>
      <p>There may be some
        truth in this last argument, but last fall I heard the Royal Library in
        Amsterdam hinting that they may be lowering their level of proofreading on
        digitized tests in order to boost volume. This seems to be a powerful voice in
      favor of the immediate diffusion of less-than-perfect texts.</p>
      <p>An example of a
        totally different approach is www.historiefyn.dk.  This site has taken the
        radical approach to the question of control, and presents only material that is
        arranged specifically for this purpose. The result is a number of very coherent
        stories and a very organized way of navigating. The downside is that you very
        soon exhaust the material on the site, and economic constraints have prevented
      participating institutions from increasing the amount of material on the site.</p>
      <p>It is very obvious
        that presentation of cultural heritage material on the Internet is still very
      much in embryo in Scandanavia. </p>
      <h1>New Steps</h1>
      <p>A number of avenues
        are being pursued, and with profound difference from institution to
        institution. The attitude towards presentation on the Internet as opposed to,
        or as a supplement to, other forms of presentation is radically different in
      different places.</p>
      <p>This is illustrated
        by the current debate at the main library in Copenhagen, where the newly
        appointed leader, who wants to boost presence on the Internet and allocate
        resources to this end, has met with fierce resistance from a number of sides.
        Not all of this opposition is directed the right way. There is little doubt,
        however, that if cultural heritage institutions designed for the good of the
        common population, as most of them historically were, were to be reinvented in
        the 21st Century, they would have a very large focus on Internet-based
      presentation.</p>
      <p>Some of the
        so-called Web2.0 functionalities are being taken up by museums. The museum in
        the town of Truer has built a site where users can send in their stories and
        upload pictures. The site is, however, designed so that each &ldquo;story&rdquo; becomes
      its own static page in a kind of CMS-system.</p>
      <p>A similar approach
        has been adopted by The ALM-institutions in the Danish town of Viborg who are
        cooperating on www.viborghistorie.dk. This is a larger undertaking, as it
        involves much more diverse types of material, but the concept is basically the
        same: each piece of information is allocated its place, and internal linking is
      &ldquo;hard coded&rdquo;. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig13" id="fig13"></a><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig13.html"><img src="moehlenfeldt-jensenfig13.jpg" alt="Figure 13" width="400" height="405" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="moehlenfeldt-jensen-fig13.html">Fig. 13: Viborghistorie, page shoving details of a street</a></p>
      <p>It is obvious that
        this keeps very close control over the user experience, and in an
        &ldquo;encyclopedic&rdquo; setting this is obviously an important point. It is just as
        obvious that this approach is not scaleable. The economic resources involved
        soon become prohibitive, as there are almost no large-scale production
      advantages, apart from work-flow etc.</p>
      <p>It seems that if we
        want to aggregate the material and reap the insights that can be gained from
        such aggregation, we have to accept loss of control to a certain extent. A
        number of projects primarily in the text genre are relying on users to
        proof-read, and this seems to be working. It is surprising to some, how many
      people want to use a bit of their time to share their expertise. </p>
      <p>In the last few
        years, new theories of learning stressing the importance of student involvement
        have boosted interest in Web-based learning, including learning in the field of
        cultural heritage. A number of projects trying to utilize these insights are
        beginning to take form; they areas yet so new that there is no significant
      experience with the results.</p>
