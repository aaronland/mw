        <p class="AbstractText">In the fall of 2007 the Doig River First Nation, an
    Aboriginal group from northeastern British Columbia, launched its Virtual
    Museum of Canada-funded Web exhibit <i>Dane-Wajich &ndash; Dane-<u>z</u>aa
    Stories and Songs: Dreamers and the Land</i>.
    This exhibit was produced by the First Nation in collaboration with
    ethnographers, linguists, and multimedia professionals. It integrates subtitled
    Dane-<u>z</u>aa and English video narratives, interpretive e-text, photographs
    of the production process, recordings of songs, and contemporary and archival
    images of traditional lands in order to showcase Dane-<u>z</u>aa culture and
    address present concerns faced by the community as they negotiate legacies of
    colonialism. The exhibit&rsquo;s community-directed production process has
    contributed to the revitalization of Dane-<u>z</u>aa culture and language as it
    brought elders and youth together to document stories, songs, and their relationship
    to the land. The project has also provided the First Nation with control over
    their representation, and has become a valuable learning resource for local and
    global audiences. Presented by the exhibit co-curators and project
    coordinators, the demonstration and paper will showcase the exhibition and
    discuss questions, raised in the exhibit production process, which relate to
    the politics of cultural representation in the context of museums and the Web:
    How can curators and communities balance the benefits of sharing Indigenous
    culture with protecting Indigenous culture? Can consensus be reached over what
    is appropriate to show a worldwide audience versus a local audience? How is
    local intellectual property rights discourse constituted? And how do these
    emerging rights contribute to the development of protocols for meaningful
  consultation with Aboriginal communities?</p>

		<h1 class="PaperTitle">Introduction</h1>
		<p>In the fall of 2007 the Doig River First Nation, a Dane-<u>z</u>aa
    (Athapaskan) group from northeastern British Columbia, launched <i>Dane Wajich
    &ndash; Dane-<u>z</u>aa Stories and Songs: Dreamers and the Land, </i>a Web exhibit funded by the Virtual Museum of Canada.
    The participatory project was produced by the First Nation in collaboration
    with ethnographers, linguists, and multi-media professionals, and integrates
    subtitled Dane-<u>z</u>aa and English video narratives, interpretive e-text,
    photographs of the production process, recordings of songs, and contemporary
    images of traditional lands in order to address present concerns faced by the
    community members as they negotiate legacies of colonialism. The exhibit&rsquo;s
    community-directed production process facilitated the articulation of local goals
    for revitalizing language, recording oral traditions, and traveling to
    important places in their territory. It brought elders and youth together to
    document stories, songs, and their relationship to the land, and through
    reviews throughout post-production, provided the First Nation with control over
  their representation to local and global audiences.</p>
<p>The completed exhibit also represents the delicate
    negotiation of intellectual property rights and the careful consideration by
    community members of the ways in which the cultural protocols associated with
    sacred cultural objects and oral histories relate to their access and
    circulation in digital form. Through ongoing consultation and collaboration
    with and among Doig River First Nation community members and the team of
    collaborators, the exhibit raised many questions at the heart of the politics
    of cultural representation. How can curators and communities balance the
    benefits of sharing Aboriginal cultural heritage with the necessity of
    protecting it? Can consensus be reached over what is appropriate to show a
    worldwide audience versus a local audience? How is local intellectual property
    rights discourse constituted? In this
    paper, we explain how this project was realized; describe the extent of the
    collaboration, consultation and revision that such an exhibit required; and
    discuss what these questions about cultural representation on the Internet, and
    their resolutions, taught Dane-<u>z</u>aa people, curators, ethnographers, and
    linguists about the conduct of&nbsp; meaningful
  consultation in northern Aboriginal communities. </p>
<h1>The Ridington-Dane-<u>z</u>aa Digital Archive</h1>
<p>The <i>Dane Wajich</i> virtual exhibit was preceded by a number of collaborative digital heritage
    projects, initiated by members of the Doig River First Nation, which had drawn
    on archival materials from the Ridington- Dane-<u>z</u>aa Archive (Doig River, 2000; 2001). Dr. Robin Ridington began
    documenting Dane-<u>z</u>aa oral traditions and hunting and gathering lifeways
    in 1964 as a Harvard graduate student in anthropology. In the following decades,
    through ongoing work with Dane-<u>z</u>aa communities, he, along with
    colleagues Antonia Mills and Howard Broomfield and his colleague and partner
    Jillian Ridington, amassed more than 600 hours of audio recordings,
    approximately 5000 photographs, and 60 hours of digital video tape (Ridington
    and Ridington, 2003). Over the years, in response to requests from community
    members, they have reproduced and distributed hundreds of photographs,
    genealogical charts, and sound recordings to members of the four Dane-<u>z</u>aa
    communities in northeastern British Columbia where they were collected. The
    Doig River First Nation is one of these four Dane-<u>z</u>aa communities. In
    2002, embracing the opportunities provided by new media technologies, Robin and
    Jillian Ridington worked with daughter and folklorist Amber Ridington and newly
    elected Doig River First Nation Chief Garry Oker to apply for funding to
    preserve the material in the Ridington- Dane-<u>z</u>aa archive and to transfer
    it from slides, negatives, Uher reel-to-reel recordings, and cassette tapes to
    digital files. This digitization was achieved in 2003 through the award of a
  Digital Collections Project grant from the BC Museums Association. </p>
<p>The ethnographic material in the archive represents
    indigenous Dane-<u>z</u>aa intellectual property. Although much of the material
    relates to all four of the Dane-<u>z</u>aa bands, the Doig River First Nation offered
    to curate all of it in their new Band Hall and Cultural Center, then under
    construction, and to make it available to all Dane-<u>z</u>aa people from that
    location (Ridington and Ridington, 2003). This now digitized archival
    documentation is copyrighted by the collectors for their use, and shared with
    Dane-<u>z</u>aa First Nations in the north Peace region; any copying of the
    material must be done with the permission of the copyright holders (Ridington
    and Ridington, 2003). Recognizing the other Dane-<u>z</u>aa communities might
    like easier access, the Doig River First Nation collaborated with the
    Ridingtons to develop a password-protected interface for an object-oriented
    database of this newly digitized cultural heritage. It was then made available
    on the Web so that all Dane-<u>z</u>aa bands could have access to these
    archival heritage materials from any computer with an Internet connection. The
    final product was called the <i>Ridington-Dane-<u>z</u>aa Digital Archive</i>; it stands as a material representation of the
    desire to share ethnographic authority and to repatriate control over cultural
  representation back into the hands of the communities of origin.</p>
<h1>Collaboration and Participatory Process: &ldquo;Dane Wajich- Dane-<u>z</u>aa Stories and Songs:
  Dreamers and the Land&rdquo;</h1>
<p>Gaining access to the photographs, audio recordings, and other cultural information made available by the digital archive, however, is not as straightforward as receiving a mailing envelope from the ethnographers containing cassette tapes and photographic prints. Without enhanced computer skills, or a dedicated band staff member to facilitate access to the archive, the repatriated digital ethnographic material could not reach its potential for community use. The Doig River First Nation therefore initiated applications for funding that would create digital media skills-building opportunities for their community members that would align with community goals for linguistic and cultural education. These program goals include connecting youth with elders so that they can learn Dane-<u>z</u>aa oral traditions; documenting and revitalizing Dane-<u>z</u>aa <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL"><u>Z</u>&aacute;&aacute;ga&eacute;&#660;</span> (the Beaver language) (<a href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/resources/language.php">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/resources/language.php</a>); and, representing their language, culture, and history to a local and global audience. The first of these projects was a youth-produced website about moose hunting traditions called: <em>Hadaa ka naadzet: The </em><em>Dane-<u>z</u>aa</em><em> Moose Hunt</em> (Doig River, 2004). </p>
<p>Following the success of this small participatory and
  collaborative Web site project, and building on the community&rsquo;s trust and
  willingness to work with Amber Ridington and Kate Hennessy who had facilitated
  and mentored the youths&rsquo; moose hunt production, the band welcomed the
  opportunity to work with them again on another Web-based exhibit. They hired
  Amber to apply for funding, as she had done for previous projects, and were happy
  to be awarded a partnership investment from the Virtual Museum of Canada for <i>Dane
    Wajich</i>- <i>Dane-<u>z</u>aa </i>Stories<i> and Songs: Dreamers and the Land</i> (<a
href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich</a>).
  To meet the community goals stated above, the project required extensive
  collaboration and partnering of&nbsp; outside experts and a range of community members with diverse interests
  in the project&rsquo;s themes and activities. </p>
<p>Youth participation and the generation of tangible media
    production skills for youth were central to their vision for the production
    process. Because media production training was not eligible for&nbsp; funding by the Virtual Museum of Canada,
    we applied to the Northeast Native Advancing Society (NENAS) in neighboring
    Fort St. John, British Columbia, for support for the youth skills development
    training. We were thankful to receive their support and partnership for the
    project. Dr. Peter Biella, a visual anthropologist and filmmaker at San
    Francisco State University, along with media anthropologist Kate Hennessy and
    folklorist Amber Ridington, provided video production, photography, and sound
    recording mentoring to five youth participants. The youth ultimately did the
    majority of the camera and sound documentation of their elders, the work that
  you see on the Web site. </p>
<p>To address one of the community&rsquo;s core concerns about
    language documentation and revitalization, the community also formed a
    partnership with linguistic anthropologist Dr. Patrick Moore (University of
    British Columbia) and Dr. Dagmar Jung (University of Cologne), who had recently
    received funding from the German Volkswagen Foundation for Beaver language
    documentation. Working with Dane-<u>z</u>aa language experts such as Billy
    Attachie, Madeline Oker, and Eddie Apsassin, Moore, Jung, and their colleague
    Julia Miller were able to use these funds for extensive translation and
    orthographic transcription of Dane-<u>z</u>aa <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL"><u>Z</u>&aacute;&aacute;ga&eacute;&#660;</span>, for use both in the virtual exhibit and
  in local language revitalization programs and oral history projects. </p>
<p>Throughout the production and consultation process, Robin
    and Jillian Ridington assisted the curators (A. Ridington and Hennessy) by drawing
    on their own wealth of knowledge and experience in Dane-<u>z</u>aa communities to
    provide important contextualizing information for the exhibit&rsquo;s interpretive
    text, and making suggestions for the use of particular archival images, texts,
  and sound recordings from the repatriated digital archive. </p>
<p>The North Peace School District supported the project from
    its beginning. They signed on as an official potential partner during the
    application stage, offering the service of their staff and curriculum
    development expertise and acknowledging the need for local Aboriginal content
    in their schools. The School District&rsquo;s First Nation's Education Center staff
    made it clear that they wanted the Doig River community to decide on the
    content for the exhibit, and that they would later use the content to help
    develop lesson plans for Teachers and Students. They wanted to leave the
    cultural representation to the community, and then draw on those resources
    vetted by the community in their curriculum material development. They worked
    in consultation with the project co-coordinators and Angela Wheelock, an
    independent educational specialist, to develop two sets of lesson plans, one
    geared at the Grade Four social studies students and teachers, and another
    geared towards high school students. These lesson plans can be found under the
  &ldquo;Resources&rdquo; section of the Web site (<a
href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/resources/teachers.php">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/resources/teachers.php</a>).<span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Co-curators Amber Ridington and Kate Hennessy coordinated
    the initial production process, coordinated and facilitated the tasks of all
    the team members and partners, wrote, edited, and curated content, worked with
    multimedia designers on drafts of the exhibit design, and also conducted a
    number of community consultations and exhibit reviews at Doig River between
    2004 and 2007. We also worked with two different Chiefs and their councilors
    during the course of the project, each with different perspectives and concerns
    about sharing and protecting their culture with the public and on the Internet.
    As we describe, these multi-year, ongoing consultations were crucial in the
    development of protocols for meaningful consultation related to the display of
    both tangible and intangible cultural heritage, as the exhibit came to feature
  narrative and song traditions, rather than material culture, on the Web. </p>
<h1>Setting the Theme: Gaay<span style="font-family:Doulos SIL">&#281;&#261;</span>&rsquo;s
  Drum </h1>
<p>(<a
href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/drum/index.php">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/drum/index.php</a>)</p>
<p>The virtual exhibit was initiated with agreement in the
    community that the project should focus on stories and songs, but the process
    for choosing specific content was left open to suggestion. We therefore started
    the production phase by asking the Doig River community to define the way in
    which stories and songs would be chosen and recorded, who would be recorded,
    and which recordings were appropriate to share over the Internet. These
    questions were discussed at a series of meetings attended by Band Chief and
    Council, elders, community members with an interest in documenting their language
  and culture, and youth recruited for the project. </p>
<p>The Chief at the time, Garry Oker, helped community members
    conceptualize the potential for the project by bringing an important object to
    one of the first of these planning meetings. It was a moose hide drum skin, now
    torn and separated from its frame, painted in red and black, depicting two
  &ldquo;trails&rdquo; leading to a central circle, and from that circle, a single trail
    leading outward. Chief Oker explained that the drum skin came into his
    possession after its former caretaker, his grandfather Albert Askoty, had
    passed away. Elders in the meeting room recognized the drum, and began to speak
    in their language, Dane-<u>z</u>aa <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL"><u>Z</u>&aacute;&aacute;ga&eacute;&#660;</span>,
    about it. They identified the drum as having been made by the Dreamer <span
style='font-family:&quot;Doulos SIL&quot;'>Gaay&#281;&#261;</span> (<a
href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/dreamers/dreamer.php?action=dreamer/gaayea">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/dreamers /dreamer.php?action=dreamer/gaayea</a>)
    almost a hundred years before. The image painted on the drum skin was a
    representation of the trail to heaven, dreamed by <span style='font-family:
&quot;Doulos SIL&quot;'>Gaay&#281;&#261;</span> and rendered by him on the stretched
    moose hide. The drum was passed on to Charlie Yahey, the last Dane-<u>z</u>aa Dreamer
    (<a
href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/dreamers/dreamer.php?action=dreamer/yahey">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/dreamers/ dreamer.php?action=dreamer/yahey</a>),
    who in turn had passed it on to Albert Askoty, a respected song keeper, singer
  and drummer. </p>
<p>Dane-<u>z</u>aa drums are central to public ceremonial life, in
    which people dance to songs &ldquo;brought back from heaven&rdquo; by Dreamers (<a
href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/dreamers/dreamers.php">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/dreamers/dreamers.php</a>),
    also referred to as Prophets, who can be located genealogically in the Dane-<u>z</u>aa
    kinship universe (Ridington, 1988). Dreamers often drew pictures on their drums
    pictures of their vision of the trail to heaven. The drawings can be seen as a
    metonym of narrative that references the Dane-<u>z</u>aa creation story (<a
href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/dreamers/creation_story.php">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/dreamers/creation_story.php</a>)
    and the cycle of the world&rsquo;s renewal through natural cycles of birth and death.
    Dane-<u>z</u>aa elders, youth, Chief Oker, and other community members took this
    opportunity to interpret the drawings on the drum and explain what it meant to
    them to see the drum. They initiated a process of recontextualization as the
  old Dreamer&rsquo;s drum was connected to present experience. </p>
<p>Significantly, elder and song keeper Tommy Attachie used the
    story of this drum to publicly define the process of curating the virtual
    exhibit (<a
href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/stories/video.php?action=fla/tommyatcomplex">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/stories/video.php? action=fla/tommyatcomplex</a>).
    He instructed the elders present at the meeting to travel to places in the
    territory where the Dreamers had camped, and to tell the youth video team &ldquo;the
    important stories.&rdquo; Only a few hours after Mr. Attachie spoke at the meeting,
    the Doig River First Nation&rsquo;s fifteen-passenger van was loaded with elders and
    the crew. We drove thirty minutes to <span style='font-family:&quot;Doulos SIL&quot;;
' lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Al&aacute;&aacute;&#660; S&#817;at&#491;</span> (Petersen&rsquo;s Crossing) (<a
href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/places/petersons_crossing.php">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/places/petersons_crossing.php</a>),
    the former home of the Dreamer Oker, and the location of the day school that
    many community members had been forced to attend as children by the Indian
    Agent at that time. As the youth documentary team prepared the camera and set
    up the&nbsp; shot, Tommy made sure that
    an old stone chimney &ndash; all that remained of the day school &ndash;&nbsp; was present in the frame. Then,
    directed by Tommy, elders took turns sitting in front of the camera, telling
  &ldquo;the important stories.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In the following two weeks, the documentary team traveled in
    northeastern British Columbia and northern Alberta to five other locations that
    had been important camps and seasonal hunting and trapping areas. The impact of
    oil and gas industrialization was significant: traditional subsistence areas
    are now surrounded, and in some cases, obscured, by oil wells, highways, roads,
    seismic cuts, and natural gas pipelines. At each location, elders explained the
    origins of Dane-<u>z</u>aa <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL"><u>Z</u>&aacute;&aacute;ga&eacute;&#660;</span> place names and recounted stories of Dreamers who had camped there, and the
    songs that they brought from Heaven to those places. They told traditional
    stories, and talked about how the landscape and animals had been impacted by
    industrialization. They explained to the youth recording their stories how
    important it was to learn their language, and to hold on to their
    traditions.&nbsp; In the following year,
    these narratives were translated and transcribed in Dane-<u>z</u>aa <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL"><u>Z</u>&aacute;&aacute;ga&eacute;&#660;</span> and English, line for
    line, by Doig River community members and the Volkswagen Foundation-funded
    linguistic team directed by Dr. Pat Moore. Used in subtitled video clips and as
    downloadable resources, these bi-lingual transcriptions, presented alongside
    the oral history videos, became fundamental elements of the virtual exhibit.
    These alternative histories of place are a challenge to normalized settler
    histories of northern British Columbia that tend to obscure the Aboriginal
  experience of colonialism. </p>
<p>The Dreamer <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL">Gaay&#281;&#261;</span>&rsquo;s
    drum became an aesthetic anchor for the exhibit, occupying a central position
    on the exhibit&rsquo;s Home Page and inspiring the exhibit&rsquo;s color scheme. Further,
    the places that it inspired travel to, and the narratives recorded at them,
    emerged as important organizing principles for curation and public
    interpretation. Within the virtual exhibit, these places are contextualized by
    narratives and recordings of songs that make explicit the songs&rsquo; connections to
    Dreamers and Prophet traditions, the seasonal movements of Dane-<u>z</u>aa people
    prior to settlement on reserves, hunting and trapping, language revitalization,
    and contemporary struggles for rights and political recognition. The section of
    the exhibit called &ldquo;Dreamers&rdquo; (<a
href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/dreamers/index.php">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/ english/dreamers/index.php</a>)
    makes these thematic connections clear with a visual representation of core
    concepts: Dreamers, Land, and the Dane-<u>z</u>aa Creation Story as part of the
  same circle, and interpretive text that reads:</p>
<p class="BlockQuote">Our stories and traditions prepare us to face the many
    challenges brought on by the coming of the white people, and, more recently, by
    the rapid industrialization of our land. We remember the songs of our Dreamers
    and sing them today as we defend our Aboriginal and Treaty rights. (Doig River
  First Nation, 2007)</p>
<h1>The Politics of Cultural Representation &ndash; Cultural Heritage<strong> an</strong>d the Internet</h1>
<h2>Exhibition As Social Action</h2>
<p>The <i>Dane Wajich</i> exhibition arose out of the political context where the Doig River First
    Nation, like many other First Nations in Canada and around the world, are
    struggling to defend their Aboriginal and Treaty rights, and to protect and
    renew their language and cultural traditions. It is within this context that we
    can see the <i>Dane Wajich</i> exhibition as a form of social action providing voice and agency though
    storytelling on the Internet. Julie Cruikshank has written about Aboriginal
    performances at the Yukon International Storytelling Festival as an example of
    social agency that uses &ldquo;land and kinship as attachment points for memory&rdquo; (Cruikshank, 1997). The videotaped performances
    included on the <i>Dane Wajich</i> exhibit,
    along with the interpretive e-text, similarly highlight the importance of land,
  kinship and memory for the Doig River First Nation. </p>
<p>The exhibit was produced during a time when the Doig River
    community was actively working on litigation so that the Band can be
    compensated for land not allocated to Band members who were left off the
    original Band List in the early 1900s. They were aware of a need to demonstrate
    their people's use and knowledge of particular places, and especially to
    document their seasonal movements throughout their hunting and trapping
    territories. The Doig River First Nation is currently recognized in British
    Columbia, even though the Band members&rsquo; traditional hunting and trapping
    territories include areas in Alberta. Because of this colonial record keeping
    issue, the Doig River First Nation&rsquo;s stories, asserting their traditional land
    use, have implications for the Band&rsquo;s recognition as a First Nation with
    Aboriginal and Treaty rights in Alberta as well as British Columbia. In this
    political context, the demonstrations of cultural traditions and stories become
  social actions. </p>
<p>Some of the stories the community told were about their
    success in seeking compensation for lost Treaty lands. Gerry Attachie&rsquo;s video (<a

    about the long court case that led to their compensation for lost mineral
    rights from the sale of their reserve at Gat Tah <span
style='font-family:&quot;Doulos SIL&quot;;' lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Kw&#261;&#770;</span> (Montney) (<a

    by the Department of Indian Affairs after World War II demonstrates this
    success in getting recognition of their Treaty rights. Another strategic
    location included on the Web site is a place called Sweeney Creek (<a
href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/places/sweeney_creek.php">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich /english/places/sweeney_creek.php</a>)
    which is just over the British Columbia border into Alberta. At this place
    Tommy Attachie told about its sacred nature for Dane-<u>z</u>aa people because of its
    association with their Dreamer <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL">Gaay&#281;&#261;</span> who received a song from heaven there (<a
href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/stories/video.php?action=fla/sweeney_chicken_dance">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/stories/ video.php?action=fla/ weeney_chicken_dance</a>).
    Margaret Attachie similarly told about the traditional use of Sweeney Creek and
  about visiting it seasonally with her family as she was growing up (<a
href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/stories/video.php?action=fla/margaretsweeney">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/ stories/video.php?action=fla/margaretsweeney</a>). </p>
<p>These narratives demonstrate how the digital medium can be a
    location of indigenous social agency and self-representation. By videotaping
    these narratives and connections to place and people, and presenting them to a
    worldwide audience though the virtual exhibition, the Doig River First Nation
    is able to make their intangible memories and cultural knowledge tangible for
    local and global audiences. However, at the same time that digital media <i>production</i> is a location of agency in self-representation,
    digital media <i>post</i>-production
    became a location of emerging intellectual property rights discourse, within
    and between Dane-<u>z</u>aa communities, which, in this case, significantly
    changed the way that Doig River had originally chosen to represent itself to
  the world. </p>
<h2>Emerging Issues In IntellectualProperty And Representation</h2>
<p>From its inception, the <i>Dane Wajich</i> exhibit (Doig River, 2007) was intended as a participatory
    media project that would facilitate social and cultural agency and
    self-representation. Community consultation and approval of content and
    aesthetics therefore extended beyond planning and storyboarding to the
    post-production stage, when video, stories, and images recorded throughout
    production, and from the Ridington-Dane-<u>z</u>aa Digital Archive, were
    selected for inclusion in the exhibit. In the course of this highly
    consultative process, a new kind of conversation about the exhibit began
    between community members and the curators: it was both focused on particular
    details and broadly related to rights in digital contexts. Central to this was
    our realization that informed decision-making regarding the appropriate
    circulation of digital cultural heritage could only begin once elders and
    community members who had had limited interaction with on-line materials began
    to better understand what the Internet and the World Wide Web was, and had been
    able to widely discuss perceived consequences of sharing Dane-<u>z</u>aa
    narratives, songs, and images with anybody in the world with a computer and an
    Internet connection. As we soon became aware, this conversation was also
    starting in other Dane-<u>z</u>aa communities who were learning about Doig
    River&rsquo;s project and other media initiatives that used images and recordings
    from the digital archive. Two central issues sprang up, and in retrospect we
    are very glad they did arise before the Web site was finalized and published on
  the Internet.</p>
<h3>1. Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
<p>The first controversial issue revolved around intellectual
    property rights and the realization of the complexity of clearing permission to
    use archival materials from the <i>Ridington/Dane-<u>z</u>aa Digital Archive</i>. Robin Ridington (1978; 1981; 1988)
    had published pictures of the last Dane-<u>z</u>aa Dreamer, Charlie Yahey, in a
    number of publications that the communities knew about, valued, and have access
    to, but it was just in the course of this virtual museum project, and in the
    context of discussions related to the reach of the Internet, that issues around
    intellectual property rights and obtaining permissions from community members
    to use the materials became an issue.&nbsp; It became clear that permission would be required from both the copyright
    and the intellectual property right holders, but exactly who the intellectual
    property rights holders are is not always simple to determine. Some saw
    Dreamers&rsquo; songs and drawings as collective cultural property while others began
  to claim it as individual and family cultural property.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Early on in the review process, the Doig River Community had
    chosen an image of the Dreamer Charlie Yahey from the Ridington/Dane-<u>z</u>aa
    Digital Archive for the Home Page. They wanted to honour him and acknowledge
    his importance to their community. Charlie Yahey was an important Dreamer and
    cultural visionary who spent a great deal of time with their community, but
    settled at the adjacent Blueberry River reserve in the 1950s. Most of Charlie
    Yahey's direct descendents live at the Blueberry Reserve, and we were told that
    the Yahey family was upset about the use of pictures of their grandfather
    without their knowledge or permission. With tensions rising, we were directed
    by Kelvin Davis, the new chief at Doig River, to talk to the Yahey family,
    explain the project and ask for their permission to use images of Charlie Yahey
    and his drum. We started by talking to the Chief of the Blueberry Band, who was
    himself a grandson of Charlie Yahey. He was supportive of the project, but also
    expressed that his band wanted to produce something similar themselves and
    wanted to save this material for use in their own exhibits. We were directed to
    go to meet with the eldest Yahey grandson, who expressed concern about images
    of his grandfather being on the Internet. He felt that other people were
    profiting from ethnographic documentation of his grandfather, but that his
  family and his community were not benefiting at all. </p>
<p>He also was concerned that people might be able to copy
    pictures of his grandfather and his drum from the Internet and that his family
    would not be able to control how they were used. He emphasized that <span
style='font-family:&quot;Doulos SIL&quot;'>Gaay&#281;&#261;</span>&rsquo;s drum, cared for by
    his grandfather, and now by him, was not an ordinary drum, that it held power
    and needed to be cared for according to their tradition. He said that he would
    need to think about it and talk it over with his other family members before he
    could give us permission to use the materials. After a number of phone calls
    and meetings in the following months, the Yahey family ultimately decided that
    they did not want to have images or recordings of their grandfather included in
    the Doig River exhibit. With this direction, as curators, we went about
    removing all images and sound recordings of the Dreamer Charlie Yahey that the
  Doig River community had chosen for the exhibit. </p>
<p>A direct result of these discussions about intellectual
    property rights clearance was the narrowing of content in the exhibit to
    exclude pictures and song performances, not just of Charlie Yahey, but also of
    individuals from Dane-<u>z</u>aa communities other than Doig River. It had the effect
    of shifting the focus of the exhibit from Dane-<u>z</u>aa culture in general, to the
    culture of the Doig River First Nation, so that the Doig River First Nation was
  responsible only for their own public representation. </p>
<p>Another outcome of the Charlie Yahey material&rsquo;s removal and
    recognition of the Yahey family&rsquo;s concerns was the emergence of the Doig River
    community&rsquo;s own intellectual property rights discourse. Through these
    discussions about ownership and control it became clear that a new protocol was
    emerging, in which the Bands wanted the relevant families to be consulted
    before materials are made available to the public in any way. These discussions
    were tense at times. Frustration and rumors had built up within the communities
    about the Ridingtons&rsquo; release of materials from their archive for use in public
    media, such as their collaborative work with members of the Doig River
    community to produce two documentary videos and a number of audio CDs (Doig
    River First Nation 2000: 2001), as well as Doig River&rsquo;s <i>Hadaa ka naadzet</i> Web site (2004), without this type of clearance from
    the stakeholder families. The new message that we received was that individual
    stakeholders or their descendents should be consulted about the public display
    of their cultural heritage, and that this decision should not be made by their
    elected Chiefs or councillors without their knowledge. Though contested within
    the community, this articulation of social protocols reflects the egalitarian
    Dane-<u>z</u>aa social structure in which personal knowledge and individual
  experience supercede any hierarchical social authority.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>2. Sharing and/or Protecting Culture</h3>
<p>The second controversial issue involved a debate about Doig
    River&rsquo;s ability, or potential inability, to protect culturally sensitive
    materials made available to a worldwide audience on the Internet &ndash; in
    essence, a debate about balancing the benefits of sharing culture with
    protecting culture. The examples we describe here demonstrate the significance
    of cultural protocols related to sacred oral and material culture for
  determining its access and circulation in digital form. </p>
<p>During the exhibit review process that we have described, it
    was suggested that because of the damaged condition of <span style='font-family:
&quot;Doulos SIL&quot;'>Gaay&#281;&#261;</span>&rsquo;s drum, it would be more appropriate for
    the exhibit to feature a photograph of another drum made by <span
style='font-family:&quot;Doulos SIL&quot;'>Gaay&#281;&#261;</span>, one that was in good
    shape. This drum had been photographed in the hands of the Dreamer Charlie
    Yahey by Robin Ridington in 1967, and in response to consensus reached at a
    community meeting, this picture of an intact drum replaced the picture of the
    torn drum as the central image on the Home Page. It was suggested, however,
    that the torn drum, which was in disrepair and missing its frame, could be
    restored, or at least preserved by a conservationist, and displayed in a
    physical installation that would accompany the virtual exhibition as a symbol
    of the renewal of Dane-<u>z</u>aa traditions.&nbsp;As
    we began to look into funding for this installation project, and to discuss it
    with other Doig River community members, concerns about the possible
    inappropriateness of displaying this sacred object to the public were voiced.
    The first issue, voiced by elder Billy Attachie, was that sacred drums like
    this one, with a Dreamer&rsquo;s drawing on it, should not be out in public view at
    all times. Traditionally, they were kept covered in fabric, and cared for by
    song keepers or Dreamers who only brought them out on special occasions. They
    usually kept them tied up high in a tree close to their house or camp and were
    careful to keep them away from women who were menstruating. Billy Attachie, and
    the other elders we consulted, agreed that it was not appropriate to put the
    drum on display in a museum, but that it could possibly be cared for in a
  museum out of the public eye and according to the traditional customs. </p>
<p>Thinking about the best way to protect the power of the
    Dreamers' drum sparked a debate about whether it was appropriate to show on the
    Internet a picture of either of <span style="font-family:Doulos SIL">Gaay&#281;&#261;</span>&rsquo;s
    drums with drawings on them. Many different views were expressed, and in the
    end, no consensus about whether to use the image or not was reached. Billy
    Attachie suggested that the picture of the drum has as much power as the object
    itself and therefore should not be on public display where it cannot be
    adequately cared for. Many others felt that a picture of an object like this
    did not carry the power of the object and was safe to show to the public. One
    individual felt that a picture of the broken drum on the Home Page might cause
    other Aboriginal people to think that Dane-<u>z</u>aa people don&rsquo;t properly care for
    their sacred objects. The most adamant opponent to showing the drum on the Home
    Page, or anywhere else on the site for that matter, was concerned that other
  Native groups would see it and be able to do bad medicine with it. </p>
<p>As part of our community consultation, we talked to as many
    people as we could, from a variety of age and gender groups, and shared what we
    had learned from others. Some people changed their views in light of other perspectives
    ,but because no consensus was reached about whether to show the Dreamer&rsquo;s drum,
    we made the decision to remove it completely from the exhibit. When we asked
    for suggestions for replacement images for the Home Page (<a
href="http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/index.html">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Danewajich/english/index.html</a>),
    all involved agreed on replacing the picture of the Dreamer&rsquo;s drum with a
    regular, blank, drum used by the current song keeper Tommy Attachie. The
    picture of the Dreamer Charlie Yahey was replaced by an image of the current
    group of Doig River Drummers performing for school children at the community&rsquo;s
    annual Doig Days celebration. These changes to the Home Page allowed the
    community to introduce the exhibit with contemporary images and limit the stereotyping
  of Aboriginal culture set in an idealized past.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The debate about respecting the cultural sensitivity of the
    Dreamers&rsquo; drums sparked similar concerns about the public having the ability to
    copy, and possibly misuse, the recordings of Dreamers songs included in the
    exhibit. Concerns about cultural appropriation and commodification were
    expressed, but the community ultimately deferred to the thoughts of Tommy
    Attachie, the current song keeper. Tommy was adamant that it was all right for
    anyone to listen to the Dreamers songs and that they should be used in the
    exhibit to show the connection of the Dreamers, and the Dreamers teachings, to
    the places the community had chosen to highlight in the virtual exhibit. Tommy
    explained that the Dreamers brought the songs down from heaven for the benefit
    of everyone, and that they were meant to be shared and celebrated in
  public.&nbsp; </p>
<h1>New Directions</h1>
<p>In this paper, we have described <i>Dane Wajich- Dane-<u>z</u>aa
    Stories and Songs: Dreamers and the Land </i>as
    a case study in the participatory production and curation of a virtual museum
    exhibit. Doig River First Nation elders and youth worked with ethnographers,
    linguists, and new media designers to represent their local culture and history
    to a worldwide wired public. As curators and applied ethnographers, we affirmed
    that meaningful consultation and collaboration with this egalitarian Athapascan
    group requires time, patience and diligence, and willingness to continue
    discussions outside of official meeting rooms and with a broad range of
    community members (ages and genders) so that a spectrum of perspectives and
    concerns are voiced. We were fortunate to start the project with an already
    strong level of trust and cultural understanding forged through the Ridington
    family&rsquo;s history of documentation and research, Amber&rsquo;s life-long connection to
    the Doig River community, and Kate&rsquo;s introduction to them as a former student
    of Dr. Ridington&rsquo;s. That trust had to be reaffirmed and nurtured as we met the
    challenges of the project and openly and effectively negotiated complicated
  issues about cultural representation. </p>
<p>The project&rsquo;s breadth of collaboration and long period of
    review revealed many challenges to conducting adequate consultation for a
    public, collaborative, and participatory media exhibit, foremost among them the
    determination of intellectual property rights to digital cultural heritage, and
    the relationship between cultural protocols for care and circulation of sacred
    oral and material culture and the circulation of its representation in digital
    form. Barre Toelken&rsquo;s (1998; 2004) work with the Navaho similarly demonstrates
    Aboriginal concerns about a community&rsquo;s inability to control the proper use of
    sacred archival materials once they have been made available to the public in a
    form that is duplicable and about serious spiritual consequences for the
    violation of the protocols. Responses to the politics of digital cultural
    representation that we documented in the course of the <i>Dane Wajich</i> exhibit curation and review marked the emergence of
    local articulations of intellectual property rights, and are directly related
    to the mobilization of repatriated digital cultural heritage in participatory
  media production. </p>
<p>According to Faye Ginsburg (1994), the challenge for
    Aboriginal media producers is to create visions of culture and history that
    both address the realities of their communities and intervene in
    representations of national colonial histories. Like Aboriginal peoples around
    the world, the Doig River First Nation&rsquo;s mass-mediated interventions are
  politically grounded:</p>
<p class="BlockQuote">&nbsp;What has long
    been at stake is not only the right to occupy and use their homelands but also
    their right to control their means of communication. In this sense, freedom for
    indigenous peoples is premised on control over their political economy and
  control over capacity to tell their own stories. (Daley and James 2004:5) </p>
<p>The return of the Dane-<u>z</u>aa cultural heritage in the
    form of the <i>Ridington-Dane-<u>z</u>aa Digital </i>Archive, and the participatory virtual museum project that we have
    described in this paper, represent attempts by ethnographers, curators, and
    linguists to facilitate self-representation, but also to explore potential
    challenges for Indigenous control and authority over their cultural and
    linguistic representations. As a result of the process outlined in this paper,
    new protocols for the use of Dane-<u>z</u>aa cultural heritage are already
    afoot. In light of the issues raised about intellectual property rights,
    control and access to the archival materials in the Ridington<i>-Dane-<u>z</u>aa
    Digital Archive</i>, and in an effort to
    protect culturally sensitive materials, Internet access to the <i>Ridington-Dane-<u>z</u>aa
    Digital Archive</i> has been closed, and
    permission to access the materials must be directed to Robin and Jillian
    Ridington. It is the Ridingtons&rsquo; desire and intent to work with all the Dane-<u>z</u>aa
    communities to establish an acceptable and enforceable protocol for access,
    duplication, distribution, and control that involves the copyright holders and
  the intellectual property right holders alike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
