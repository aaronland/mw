        <p class="AbstractText">The potential for the use of wikis by museums to aid
  collaboration between users is great. Wikis allow a virtual community to
  maintain and update information in a cooperative and convenient manner. This
  mini-workshop presents current wiki tools and facilities that are available on-line
  and suitable for use by museums for on-line collaboration and the building of
  virtual communities. The general concept of wikis is introduced, and the
  leading wiki on the Web, Wikipedia, is covered in a museum context. Major wiki
  software platforms are briefly mentioned, with pointers to further information.
  The use of external wiki facilities such as those provided by Wikia, a free
  community of wikis, is also presented. Alternative wiki facilities are briefly
  compared. A selection of existing examples of museum-related wikis is surveyed,
  including comments on their features in a wider context. Some lessons from
  experience of wikis so far are given and the possible future of wikis,
  especially with respect to museums, is considered.</p>

<h1>1. Background</h1>
<p>Human beings have
  collaborated throughout their development from the earliest times. Without
  cooperation, the human race would never have survived; with cooperation, it has
  thrived. People are well adapted to mutual support through intelligent behaviour
  when needed, but are less well suited to a lone existence. This situation has
  continued from the days when cooperative hunting for food was required, through
  to the modern world of electronic communication, which has developed extremely
  rapidly over the past decade or two. Despite the pace of change, many people
  have adapted quickly and use this new environment to their advantage in order
  to interact with others who are geographically distributed, whether in a
  professional, social, educational or commercial context, in a productive manner
  for a particular aim (Zelenka, 2008). All these aspects require an adaptation
  to interaction within a completely new electronic medium supporting novel types
  of community in a virtual space that was almost unimaginable only a generation
  ago (Sairamesh et al., 2004). This development has occurred in many spheres,
  including the context of museums in particular (Bowen, 2002; Bowen et al.,
  2004) and research in general (Borda &amp; Farnhill, 2006).</p>
<p>There have been some
  forward thinkers who can be identified with hindsight. For example, Marshall
  McLuhan coined the now-classic expressions, &ldquo;the medium is the message&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;global village&rdquo; in the 1960s, in the context of media in general, especially
  the various electronic media. These concepts have become even more apposite
  with the coming of the Internet, largely after McLuhan&rsquo;s death in 1980. Early
  virtual communities, such as the WELL (Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link), started in
  1985 and still continuing today, were embryonic examples of what has now become
  commonplace in the networked world. The phenomenon of the virtual community has
  been recorded by Rheingold (2000); he drew attention to this new form of
  societal engagement and the variety of collaborative interactions that are
  enabled via the Internet and, in particular, more recently through rapidly
  evolving Web-based facilities.</p>
<p>Web 2.0 technologies
  (O&rsquo;Reilly, 2005; Solomon &amp; Schrum, 2007), such as blogs, discussion forums,
  networking Web sites and wikis, have all enriched the interactivity and
  user-generated content on the Web. Blogs allow individuals to produce a diary
  of time-stamped items easily in (reverse) time order, often with additional
  associated comments from readers. Discussion forums allow a more democratic set
  of areas where different subjects can be discussed on a more equal basis.
  Networking Web sites, whether social or professional, allow individuals to
  build up a set of contacts and interact with them on-line, forming groups,
  sharing media such as photographs, etc. Wikis allow simple collaborative
  updating of Web pages to produce user-generated content. This is the main
  subject of this paper. We consider the current status of using wikis for on-line
  collaboration and communities in the context of museums. In particular, the
  paper surveys some selected examples of museum-related wikis that are available
  on-line.</p>
<h1>Wikis</h1>
<p>Wikis (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki</a>)
  provide a facility that makes writing to and updating a Web site very easy for
  a group of users. This idea of an easily updatable, as well as easily readable,
  Web was originally envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee, the Web&rsquo;s inventor
  (Berners-Lee, 1999). Unfortunately, the original Web facilities did not provide
  easy editing facilities, access control, etc. Instead, an expert was required
  for these aspects.</p>
<p>Ward Cunningham
  devised the first wiki and launched it in March, 1995 (Leuf &amp; Cunningham,
  2001). Wikis were designed to enable a group of contributors to reach a common
  goal by editing interlinked Web pages in parallel via the Web itself. Wikis can
  be extremely successful when there really is a common objective with a large
  enough community to achieve this, and where a &ldquo;champion&rdquo; is available to ensure
  that the project reaches a critical mass. The on-line encyclopedia Wikipedia is
  the most famous (and successful) wiki, but a wiki can be used for any
  collaborative effort to produce any type of content, possibly in a private
  space not generally accessible on the Web.</p>
<p>A wiki is a
  specialized form of Content Management System (CMS). A wiki Web site presents a
  set of Web pages that can be easily created and/or edited via a Web-based
  interface by anyone who is allowed access (Ebersbach et al., 2006; Bowen,
  2006).  In this way, it can lead to one or more people&rsquo;s building up a corpus
  of knowledge in a collection of interlinked Web pages (Thomas et al., 2007).</p>
<p>A number of sites
  offer wiki facilities free of charge (normally with some form of advertising
  for revenue) or at modest rates with the advertising suppressed. These include,
  for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wikia (<a href="http://www.wikia.com/">http://www.wikia.com</a>);</li>
  <li>PBwiki (<a href="http://www.pbwiki.com/">http://www.pbwiki.com</a>);</li>
  <li>Wikispaces (<a
href="http://www.wikispaces.com/">http://www.wikispaces.com</a>);</li>
  <li>Wetpaint (<a href="http://www.wetpaint.com/">http://www.wetpaint.com</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Wikia is especially
  suited to more serious wiki use on the Web, provided the wiki&rsquo;s aim involves
  general Web access by an on-line community. In the case of Wikia, a proposed
  wiki requires a <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> to be provided as part of a brief proposal which must be approved by Wikia
  personnel before the requested wiki is set up. For example, a Wikia site
  dedicated to museums exists (Bowen et al., 2007). The Wikia organization is
  funded through Google advertisements, and the underlying technology is
  WikiMedia, as used by Wikipedia; it is familiar to users. However, the editor
  uses a markup language rather than being WYSIWYG, making it more daunting for
  inexperienced users. By contrast, PBwiki and Wikispaces have a WYSIWYG editor
  and are very easy to set up, but are less powerful.</p>
<p>Once a wiki is set
  up, however, there can be any number of community and educational uses, such as
  the incremental accretion of knowledge by a group, or production of
  collaboratively edited material. In other collaborative contexts, wikis can be
  used to develop work plans and to facilitate meetings (e.g., to prepare the
  agenda beforehand and deliver the minutes afterwards). Increasingly,
  organizations such as companies are using private wikis to enable collaborative
  content generation among their members and employees with suitable levels of
  access control (Mader, 2008).</p>
<p>Educational wikis
  are probably nearest to the aims of most museums in producing a publicly
  accessible wiki resource (Mader, 2006). Consideration by researchers in this
  area has included wiki use in the classroom (Wang &amp; Turner, 2004;
  Richardson, 2006), a use which may be relevant to school parties visiting
  museums. For example, a museum could make wiki facilities available for schools
  to undertake collaboration projects associated with its collections.</p>
<h1>Wikipedia</h1>
<p>Wikis have enabled
  collaborative communities to develop rapidly once a critical level of usage has
  been reached. It is important to have a common goal that is supported by a good
  number of contributors. Jimmy Wales set up Wikipedia (<a
href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">http://www.wikipedia.org</a>) with the aim of
  allowing anyone to contribute encyclopedic articles. Previous attempts with
  much more control on the content had failed to develop beyond an embryonic
  stage. However, once the content of Wikipedia was sufficiently worthwhile to
  attract users and to enter the general public consciousness, its success was
  assured.</p>
<p>Although the vast
  majority of Wikipedia users simply read the content, often found via the Google
  search engine, which rates it highly due to the nature of its PageRank
  algorithm, a significant number of people are contributors (Nov, 2007). These
  individuals have assembled in virtual space to form their own rules as to how
  Wikipedia is organized, all using the standard wiki facilities of Wikipedia
  itself. Once registered, contributors are able to interact with each other via
  &lsquo;talk&rsquo; and discussion pages, which themselves are simply further meta-resources
  available on Wikipedia for all to read (and update) if they wish. Contributors
  typically discover the user-generated rules as they gain confidence in updating
  pages on Wikipedia. Other more experienced users will typically correct novices
  if they attempt something out of line with generally accepted Wikipedia policy.
  Those with the required experience are able to participate by actually
  proposing new guidelines and updating those that already exist through mutual
  consensus.</p>
<p>Wikipedia provides
  an excellent set of general information on a wide range of topics. For example,
  there is a good overview and set of articles concerning wikis themselves (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikis">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikis</a>).</p>
<p>Museums are also
  well covered in respect of many individual museums (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Museums">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Museums</a>),
  although the site is by no means comprehensive yet. All museums should use
  Wikipedia to provide reliable information about their institution if it does
  not exist already. Every serious museum should have a Wikipedia entry. Larger museums
  may have related entries, e.g., concerning their collections and even
  individual objects such as artworks of international note. Detailed practical
  information on how to create a Wikipedia entry for a museum is available
  elsewhere (Bowen &amp; Angus, 2006). More general information on adding
  museum-related material in the context of the German version of Wikipedia also
  exists (Tunsch, 2007).</p>
<h1>Wiki Software</h1>
<p>While it is possible
  to set up wiki facilities very easily on-line, at no cost typically with some
  advertising, or at a modest fee without, it is also possible to install wiki
  software directly on a museum&rsquo;s own Web site. This requires some technical
  expertise, but gives the museum much more control over the facilities
  available, access rights, etc. It also allows the wiki section to be much
  better integrated with the rest of the Web site, giving more uniform corporate
  branding, etc.</p>
<p>Much wiki software
  is available, both free and commercial (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wiki_software">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wiki_software</a>).
  Two of the leading powerful (and free) software systems for implementing a wiki
  are MediaWiki (<a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">http://www.mediawiki.org</a>;
  Choate, 2008) and TWiki (<a href="http://twiki.org/">http://twiki.org</a>;
  Woods &amp; Thoeny, 2007). MediaWiki is used by Wikipedia, so is familiar to
  many users. Twiki is particularly good for embedding applications if this is
  important for a particular implementation with interactive facilities in a
  groupware project. Other wiki software systems include Wikka Wiki (<a
href="http://wikkawiki.org/">http://wikkawiki.org</a>), a lightweight wiki.</p>
<h1>Examples of Museum Wikis</h1>
<p>There are not yet
  many examples of the use of wikis by museums and related organizations. In this
  section, we cover some existing examples that are accessible on the Web.</p>
<p>A general Museums
  Wiki has been established using the Wikia facility (<a
href="http://museums.wikia.com/">http://museums.wikia.com</a>). Wikia itself
  was started by Jimmy Wales, as a facility for a family of wikis on a wide
  variety of topics (<a href="http://www.wikia.com/">http://www.wikia.com</a>).
  The Museums Wiki is intended for museum-related material that is too detailed
  for inclusion on a more general wiki site like Wikipedia. It was established in
  2006 (Bowen et al., 2007) and has been developed by a number of contributors.</p>
<p>The Museum Virtual
  Worlds Wiki (<a href="http://apps.exploratorium.edu/worlds/wiki/">http://apps.exploratorium.edu/worlds/wiki/</a>)
  has been established as an on-line resource by the Exploratorium in San
  Francisco, USA. It is designed to be a virtual space for sharing among museum
  and other educational Web developers information and resources about on-line
  virtual worlds. The resource is powered by the Wikka wiki engine. It is
  necessary to register with the site in order to edit pages. This is a
  specialist professional wiki, not designed for members of the general public. </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="bowen.small.fig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="400" height="381" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 1: Museum
  Virtual Worlds Wiki (<a href="http://apps.exploratorium.edu/worlds/wiki/">http://apps.exploratorium.edu/worlds/wiki/</a>)</p>
<p>The Newark Museum,
  the largest museum in New Jersey, USA, has its own wiki on its Web site (<a
href="http://www.newarkmuseumpr.org/mwiki/">http://www.newarkmuseumpr.org/mwiki/</a>),
  based on MediaWiki technology. Any visitor can view the pages, but users must
  register to create or edit pages. The wiki includes resources associated with a
  contemporary photography and video art exhibition (September 19, 2007 - January
  6, 2008), <i>India: Public Places/Private Spaces</i> (<a
href="http://www.newarkmuseumpr.org/mwiki/?title=India">http://www.newarkmuseumpr.org/mwiki/?title=India</a>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many
  of the pages on the wiki are not relevant to the museum. This illustrates the
  fact that it is worthwhile having a member of the museum who is willing to tidy
  up the content periodically to ensure relevance. Typically these pages have
  been used by people attempting to add links to other Web sites for promotional
  purposes, something that should be avoided on museum Web sites.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="bowen.small.fig2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="400" height="358" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 2: Newark Museum
  Wiki (<a href="http://www.newarkmuseumpr.org/mwiki/">http://www.newarkmuseumpr.org/mwiki/</a>)</p>
<p>The Brooklyn Museum,
  New York City&rsquo;s second largest art museum, has a wiki on the museum&rsquo;s Web site,
  a resource associated with the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for
  Feminist Art. The objective of this project is to provide up-to-date academic
  information about the 1,038 women represented in <i>The Dinner Party</i> by Judy Chicago (<a
href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/</a>). Scholars are invited to contribute to the entries in the Dinner
  Party Wiki by e-mailing the museum to gain access (<a
href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/about_wiki.php">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/about_wiki.php</a>).
  Because contributors to this wiki are vetted by the museum, the problem of
  inappropriate material is minimized. Taking this approach means that museum
  personnel need not monitor the content of the wiki so closely.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="bowen.small.fig3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="400" height="470" /></p>

href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/about_wiki.php">http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/about_wiki.php</a>)</p>
<p>The Amersham Museum
  Wiki (<a href="http://amershammuseum.pbwiki.com/">http://amershammuseum.pbwiki.com</a>)
  was set up in 2007 by Amersham Museum, a small local museum in southern
  England. The aim of the wiki is to allow those with knowledge of the history of
  the town of Amersham in Buckinghamshire, especially of its buildings, to
  contribute information and images. The underlying technology is PBwiki.
  Contributors to the wiki must have a password that is given to people
  associated with the museum. This limits the problem of vandalism of the wiki&rsquo;s
  pages, but may also restrict participation by genuine potential contributors.</p>

<p>The MN150 Wiki (<a
href="http://discovery.mnhs.org/MN150">http://discovery.mnhs.org/MN150</a>)
  presents topics nominated for the MN150 exhibit at the Minnesota History
  Center, Minnesota, USA. The exhibit covers responses to the following question:
  &ldquo;What person, place, thing, or event originating in Minnesota do you think has
  transformed our state, our country, or the world?&rdquo; In the exhibit, 150 topics
  were covered, whereas all 2,700+ topics are listed on the wiki. The original
  nominations are not editable, but the rest of the page is for comments. The
  underlying technology is MediaWiki; this editing feature required some
  modification to MediaWiki itself.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="bowen.small.fig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="400" height="376" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 5: MN150 Wiki (<a

<p>The Thomas Jefferson
  Wiki (<a href="http://wiki.monticello.org/">http://wiki.monticello.org</a>) is
  an on-line resource set up as a standalone MediaWiki-based wiki in 2007 by the
  Thomas Jefferson Foundation. This foundation operates Monticello near
  Charlottesville, Virginia, USA, the home of Thomas Jefferson, and now a museum.
  The main pages of the wiki are written by experts, but the discussion pages can
  be updated by any user who registers free on-line. This gives a good balance between
  authoritative information and public participation. What is more, it is obvious
  which is which, since discussion pages for user comments are clearly
  differentiated.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="bowen.small.fig6.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="400" height="390" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 6: Thomas
  Jefferson Wiki (<a href="http://wiki.monticello.org/">http://wiki.monticello.org</a>)</p>
<p>Placeography (<a
href="http://placeography.org/">http://placeography.org</a>) is a wiki for
  sharing the history of and stories about buildings, farmsteads, houses,
  neighborhoods, public land, or any place with which the contributor has a
  personal connection. It uses MediaWiki software with semantic wiki and semantic
  forms extensions. The quality of entries is good in general, and items are also
  relevant to the aims of the wiki. Entries are typically, although not always,
  of buildings and locations that would probably not be deemed noteworthy enough
  for inclusion on Wikipedia, for example. A useful feature is the inclusion of a
  Google map showing the physical location; it is embedded within individual wiki
  pages. MediaWiki is the underlying technology, and its category feature is used
  to good effect at the bottom of individual pages, allowing navigation between
  related entries in a hierarchical manner, although some category links are
  missing.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="bowen.small.fig7.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="400" height="385" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 7: Placeography Wiki (<a href="http://placeography.org/">http://placeography.org</a>)</p>
<p>Wikis not
  specifically dedicated to museums sometimes include museum information. For
  example, NeoPopRealism Journal is a Wetpaint-based wiki that includes
  information on the Brooklyn Museum of Art (<a
href="http://neopoprealismjournal.wetpaint.com/page/Brooklyn+Museum+of+Art">http://neopoprealismjournal.wetpaint.com/ page/Brooklyn+Museum+of+Art</a>).
  The AboutUs wiki includes a page on the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
  (<a href="http://www.aboutus.org/Ushmm.org">http://www.aboutus.org/Ushmm.org</a>).</p>
<p>This section only
  presents a selection of museum-related wikis. Further links may be found using
  Google (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=museum+wiki">http://www.google.com/search?q=museum+wiki</a>).</p>
<h1>Lessons for Wiki Use</h1>
<p>While there are many
  success stories with the use of wikis, it is just as likely, if not more
  probable, for a wiki to be unsuccessful. There are some critical issues for a
  wiki to become established on a long-term basis.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initially a wiki &quot;champion&quot; is required to
    provide the impetus to start the wiki. This champion must have enough technical
    expertise to install the wiki and enough social expertise to bring an initial
    community on board in order to start to populate the wiki with suitable
    information.</li>
  <li>There must be a real reason for the existence
    of the wiki. Unless a critical mass of the  community see the benefit of the
    wiki, it will not take off. Once this occurs, the role of the original champion
    becomes much less critical.</li>
  <li>Within a museum setting there may be a variety
    of reasons and different target users for a wiki. It may be outward-facing and
    accessible on the Web for the public (e.g., for educational purposes), or
    inward-facing and only available on an intranet (or extranet across the
    Internet in a larger organization) for museum personnel (e.g., for a project
    such as the development of material for an exhibition). A wiki can be readable
    and writable for different sets of users. For example, a publicly readable wiki
    on a museum Web site can be set up to be writable only by a set of known
    experts in the field being presented.</li>
  <li>A wiki is not expensive to install, so even if
    a particular wiki is not a success, there is not much risk involved
    financially. In addition, lessons can be learned for the next wiki-based
    project in a museum.</li>
  <li>There is a risk of misuse of a wiki if it is
    made generally writable. This certainly does happen, but is not as large a
    problem as might be first envisaged. It is so easy to vandalize a wiki that
    there is not much incentive to do this in terms of demonstrating expertise. If
    vandalism does occur, it is important to have a person monitoring the wiki
    (often the original champion) to take corrective action quickly. This may
    involve rolling back the contents of the page to a previous version (easy to do
    with the history facility on many wiki systems such as MediaWiki), or banning
    the user if registered, or locking down a particular page to prevent updates
    for a period, or changing general access permissions, etc., depending on the
    severity and type of problem encountered.</p>


	<p>For
    example, on the Museums Wiki under Wikia, occasionally unscrupulous users have
    attempted to add advertising links to individual pages. This can occur
    especially on the topmost pages, so in this case these have been locked down to
    prevent general editing by any user. This is a good policy for important and reasonably
    static pages in a wiki in any case. It is also possible to &ldquo;watch&rdquo; individual
    wiki pages and be notified of changes to these pages. This is a good idea if
    any pages prove particularly problematic. Facilities are available to view a
    list of recently changed pages as well.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Consideration should be given to the type of
    users expected for a particular wiki. In general, wikis should be as accessible
    as possible, avoiding barriers due to disability, gender, etc. (Boiano et al.,
    2008). This is a general problem on the Web, and lack of control on a wiki
    could exasperate the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the
  benefits far outweigh the problems in a successful wiki. Provided there is at
  least one person with a good sense of ownership of a wiki, in general the content
  of a wiki can be kept in good shape so that it is useful for the community that
  it serves.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Wikis are a very
  general concept that can be applied usefully in a wide variety of Web-based
  collaborations. In any case, the various Web 2.0 concepts and approaches that
  are available are increasingly merging with each other. For example, the idea
  of a &ldquo;Bliki&rdquo; (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliki">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliki</a>) has been developed, combining the facilities
  of a blog and a wiki. On-line social and professional networking facilities
  could increasingly incorporate wiki technology, especially for specific
  projects. Ning (<a href="http://www.ning.com/">http://www.ning.com</a>)
  provides support for creating specialized social networks, including blogging,
  discussion forum and media (photograph) sharing facilities. For example, the
  Global Museum Webzine has
  established a networking Web site for people interested in museums (<a
href="http://globalmuseum.ning.com/">http://globalmuseum.ning.com</a>). Such a Web
  site could be extended to allow wiki-based content development as well.</p>
<p>For the future,
  although Web 2.0 technologies are rapidly changing the Web landscape by
  providing enabling technologies for virtual communities, no doubt a Web 3.0
  growth of new technologies will allow yet more interesting developments,
  perhaps with a better and more reliable semantic basis than is currently
  available (Hendler, 2008). This has the potential to improve significantly the
  handling of knowledge within a wiki.</p>
<p>Wikis are likely to be used increasingly as part of museum Web
  sites and also on museum intranets for internal use. Their success in a museum
  context depends on a number of factors, and it is hoped that this paper will
  help some museums to avoid  common pitfalls and produce successful wikis to
  support their associated communities, both professional and public.</p>
