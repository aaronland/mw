  <h1>Problems
    and Pitfalls of Museum Project Management</h1>
  <p>Effective project
    management is crucial to the success of almost any project. This management can
    be difficult when faced with an ambitious project on a tight schedule where
    project partners are scattered across many miles. Museums face these challenges
    every day as they coordinate and plan new exhibitions, Web site content and
    educational programming. Managing the unknowns of projects and budgets is a
    reality for most museum professionals, but delivering results that are on time
  and meet expectations is often a difficult task.</p>
<p>Like other staff in
    the museum, museum technology teams commonly work within the confines of their
    own departments. Consequently when approached with the challenge of working
    collaboratively on the authoring of software projects, these teams need to find
  new ways to work together efficiently.</p>
<h1>Our
  Specific Case: Challenges of steve.museum</h1>
<p>The steve.museum
    project is focused on doing research related to the use of social tagging by
    museums and developing software that museums can use to make social tagging a
    reality for their institutions.&nbsp; From its early days, the project has had the additional goal of proving
    that distributed and diverse teams of museum professionals can work together on
    projects for the mutual benefit of their institutions and the broader
    community.&nbsp; The project is composed
    of team members from over a dozen different institutions, as well as other
    partners.&nbsp; The team is distributed
    geographically across the United States and collaborates with several
    international partners.&nbsp; Project
    members come from a diverse background of expertise and knowledge and include
    museum educators, administrators, research professionals, information
    specialists and software developers.&nbsp; Faced with an ambitious project, with tight schedules and budgets, and
    with the added requirement of enabling broad participation; the software
    development team of the steve project embarked on building a suite of tools to
  research the usefulness of social tagging for on-line museum collections. </p>
<p>The steve.museum project
    is certainly not the first to attempt such broad collaboration. Other
    communities have shared our difficulties with project management as well. In
    seeking to mitigate these difficulties, the software development community has
    worked to create project management methods that attempt to quantify the risks
    and scheduling difficulties inherent in any project. Over many years and
    projects, this community has tried and failed numerous different systems for
    managing complex projects.&nbsp; They
    have also learned many lessons that can be helpful to the museum community in
  planning our own projects.</p>
<p>After early
    missteps, the steve development team decided to adopt many of the practices of
    agile software development, a strategy for managing software projects. In the
    remainder of this paper, we will describe how the team started with little or
    no formal method and through necessity began shaping a working method into a
    prescriptive and repeatable process. We will go on to describe the features and
    benefits of agile project management and explain why they might be useful for a
  broad range of collaborative projects conducted by the museum community. </p>
<h1>An Agile Overview</h1>
<p>As mentioned above,
    Agile Project Management is a technique currently used in the software
    development community to address many pitfalls of project management.&nbsp; In contrast to other project management
    techniques, agile methods directly address the roles of the customer in the
    planning and development process, as well as the probability of changes in
  assumptions and requirements that will undoubtedly occur in most projects.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In 2001, leaders of
    various camps of the software industry met and created the Agile Manifesto
  which declared: </p>
<p class="BlockQuote">Individuals and
    interactions over processes and tools; <br />
  Working software over comprehensive documentation; <br />
  Customer collaboration over contract negotiation; <br />
  Responding to change over following a plan.&nbsp; (Manifesto for Agile Software Development &ndash; <a
href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">http://www.agilemanifesto.org</a>)</p>
<p>Out of these
    principles came working methods that sought to mitigate many of the obstacles
    of project management: difficulty estimating cost, risk, and schedule; adapting
    to shifting requirements; prioritization of critical path tasks; and dealing
  with the many different types of personalities involved in a project.</p>
<p>This paper is not
    intended as an overview of the various flavors of agile methods; interested
    readers might consult Cohn (2005), Beck (2004), or Schwarber (2004) for more
    specific descriptions on the use of these methods in the software development
  community.</p>
<h1>A
  Speedy Overview of Steve's Agile Methods</h1>
<p>The project begins
    like any other project. Brainstorming is accomplished; ideas fight against
    other ideas, nice people compromise. For the steve.museum project, the
    collaborative process inherent in agile development has become crucial and
    provides perhaps the best way for partners with experience in many different
    areas to actually have a voice in how the software gets developed.&nbsp; In our working methodology these
    discussions and brainstorming sessions are the beginning of the process of
  Specification.</p>
<p>Creating software
    specification and requirements documents is historically a difficult and
    contentious process of rigidly locking in the work that is to be accomplished
    in the entire duration of a project.&nbsp; Typically, software developers and customers have a hard time
    understanding each other and communicating clearly about what specifically
    needs to be accomplished for the project to succeed.&nbsp; The steve team chose to break the specification process down
  into smaller pieces consisting of Milestones, Epics and Stories. </p>
<h2>Milestones</h2>
<p>Due to their basis
    in real world activity, milestones are the easiest unit of project management
    for a large team to focus on.&nbsp; They
    can be described in common language, and the thinking about how they are
    constructed does not require any specific knowledge of software design or
    development. An example of a milestone in the development of the steve tagger
    was the &ldquo;Look Closer&rdquo; milestone. This represented the need for users to be able
    to see details of an image by displaying a higher resolution image through
    enlargement or zoom. Each milestone represents one concrete set of outcomes
  that can stand alone as its own piece of software.</p>
<h2>Epics</h2>
<p>Once the milestones
    of the project begin to solidify, the team can move from defining high-level
    features to articulating the logical progression of the use of the software
    through the creation of epics. At this stage of the process, epics are not yet technical,
    but merely more specific about how each of the milestones can be accomplished.
    An example of an epic from the steve project is, &ldquo;A user should be able to add,
    edit, and delete tags related to an image on the screen.&rdquo; Epics are useful in
    walking the team through the things that occur when a user follows the steps
    required to make something happen in the software.&nbsp; While useful for the entire team to better understand a
    logical flow of execution, epics are not yet at the level from which developers
  can proceed with programming tasks.</p>
<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>After the epics are
    finalized, they can be broken down into smaller tasks called stories.&nbsp; Stories are small discrete tasks
    described in common language, but of sufficient detail to enable developers to
    begin the software development process.&nbsp; If needed, developers can break stories down into tasks, technically
    detailed pieces of work needed to meet the requirements of stories.&nbsp; Tasks at this level only need to be
    understood by the technical project team and are for their own benefit in
    meeting the objectives of the project.&nbsp; Once the team has finished the creation of milestones, epics and
  stories, the specification phase of the project is complete.</p>
<h1>An Educated Guess&hellip;</h1>
<p>One of the most
    difficult parts of successfully managing complex projects involves the
    estimation of how long any particular set of work will take.&nbsp; Agile project methods address this
    difficulty by working in short development cycles that result in usable software
    at each iteration of the cycle. The software development team makes use of the
    milestones, epics and stories created in the specification phase to choose work
    for each member of the team to accomplish within any particular phase of
    development.&nbsp; Stories are assigned
    points by team members based on the estimated amount of effort needed to
    complete the story. It should be noted that this is not specifically a time
    estimate, but a relative guess at how hard any story is, compared to other
    stories. In points budgeting sessions, all members of the team, regardless of
    their background, indicate the number of points they feel is appropriate for a
    given task. Early on in the steve development, these estimates varied widely,
    with one developer assigning five points to a task and a non-developer assigning
    two points. These situations gave the team a chance to think systematically
    about the implications of desired software functionality and design and to
  clarify issues that might have led to disagreement later on in the process. </p>
<p>During each phase,
    developers select stories to complete during that time period.&nbsp; At the end of the period, developers
    calculate how many story points they were able to complete during that
    period.&nbsp; As cycles continue and
    estimation is refined further, developers are able to better estimate how many
    points are reasonable to complete in a fixed time frame. This is known as a
    developer&rsquo;s velocity.&nbsp; Knowing the
    different velocities of team members enables the team to estimate more accurately
  the time needed to complete a project.</p>

  <h1>Big Things are Made from Small Things</h1>
  <p>A key tenet of agile software development is that each development cycle
    includes the testing of stories completed in that cycle.&nbsp; The commitment of the team is to
    produce working software at each phase, thereby moving the project forward in
    baby steps each time a cycle is completed.&nbsp; There are several different benefits to this commitment.
    First, at the end of a development cycle, the software has to work, with no
    errors, even though the incremental changes in features may be modest.&nbsp; This results in much higher software
    quality for the overall project since testing is not left to the end of the
    project. It is much easier to diagnose and fully test small pieces of code on a
    continual basis as opposed to the testing of an entire system after all the
    work has been completed. </p>
  <h1>Unit Testing, User Acceptance Testing, and Why Evaluation
    Isn't a Party at the End</h1>
  <p>The agile methods used by the steve team rely on two different types of
    testing. The first type is called Unit Testing. Unit Testing involves writing
    small bits of software which assert that the results of each story match the
    expected results. Unit Tests are preserved across development cycles. This
    enables the checking of legacy software to ensure that the newest changes in
    the code does not break features that worked in the previous development
    cycles.<br />
    Another important piece of testing is called User Acceptance Testing or UAT.
    User Acceptance Testing provides a mechanism to ensure that actual users agree
    with the project&rsquo;s developers that the software works according to the
    specifications.&nbsp; As the software
    nears completion, the team drafts a script of what tasks the software should
    perform and what the expected outcomes of each step are. For example, a UAT
    script for a Web site with accounts and logins might be, &quot;The user
    attempts to log in with the wrong password.&quot; The expected result for that
    test would be, &quot;The user is returned to the log-in page with an error
    informing them that the user name or password is incorrect.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>
    Ideas Occur, Plans Change, and Life Goes On  </h1>
    <p>The team&rsquo;s commitment to software quality has another far more important
      benefit.&nbsp; By creating usable
      software at each step, we create places for sanity checking to occur.&nbsp; Team members from the larger project
      are able to check on the software progress and ensure that it really meets
      their needs, rather than simply following the specifications to the
      letter.&nbsp; This process allows
      non-technical members of the project to stay involved with the software
      development during each cycle.&nbsp; As
      the software continues to mature, these sanity checks also allow the team to
      decide that it would be better to go in a different direction, allowing the
      team to be more &lsquo;agile&rsquo; in addressing new challenges that were not envisioned during
      the specification process. Sometimes external forces cause changes to the
      original plan. Other times, new solutions become clearer as the team continues
      to work through the details. Since the agile methods haven't wedded us to an
      enormous plan, we have greater ability to change the direction of the software
      as it is being built.</p>
    <h1>Taking Time to Reflect</h1>
    <p>Agile working methods often include retrospective meetings at the end of
      each development cycle. The steve team held software retrospectives at our semi-annual
      meetings which served as both the conclusion of the previous development cycle
      and the beginning of the next cycle. We borrowed heavily from the format of
      agile retrospectives described by Derby et al. in <i>Agile Retrospectives:
        Making Good Teams Great </i>(2006). </p>
    <p>Prior to the retrospective meeting, each member of the team was tasked
      with helping enumerate the timeline of events in the previous development
      cycle. At the beginning of each retrospective meeting, each team member &ldquo;checks
      in&rdquo; by sharing with the group a simple statement about what he or she wants to
      achieve through the process. These comments often tend to describe team members
      wanting to work out kinks in the development process in order to deliver better
      or faster results.</p>
    <p>Following the check-in, the group proceeds with an analysis of team
      members&rsquo; emotional state at each point in the timeline. Examples of team
      members&rsquo; comments on emotional state are comments such as, &ldquo;On the initial call
      determining the scope of this development cycle, I was excited about the tools
      we were planning to use to compile the code,&rdquo; or &ldquo;during the delay in our
      delivery of a working test application in late November, I felt confused
      because I didn&rsquo;t know what was expected of me as a member of the team.&rdquo; Team members
      may also indicate their emotional states by indicating satisfaction with the
      process on a scale of 0 to 5, 0 being &ldquo;very upset&rdquo; and 5 being &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t be
      happier.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>The next activity in the retrospective is called the &ldquo;Fishbone.&rdquo; This
      exercise is designed to explore the problems that are identified in the
      emotional state analysis. In the fishbone, the group tries to identify root
      causes of dissatisfaction with the process by investigating the questions of
      who, when, and where. We split the &ldquo;bones&rdquo; of the fish into the following
      categories: Methods; Machines; Materials; Staffing; Place; Procedure; People;
      Policies; Surroundings; Suppliers; Systems and Skills.</p>
    <p>After fleshing out the questions around the difficulties encountered in
      the development cycle, the group moves on to creating an action plan for
      improving the process in future cycles. Examples of action items from steve
      retrospectives include modifying the tools that we used for communication,
      being conscious of the need to notify others when tasks were completed, and
      having clearer guidelines for the use of development resources.</p>
    <p>By allowing the team to regularly check the temperature of the project,
      agile retrospectives made the steve development team more comfortable with one
      another, established clear lines of communication in a non-hierarchical project
      team, and increased productivity.</p>
    <h1>Some Final Thoughts</h1>
    <p>As described in this paper, the steve<i> </i>development team employed
      several different agile project management methods in order to overcome several
      challenges facing the team of international collaborators. By involving both
      technical and non-technical team members in the development process, all team
      members had a greater investment in the success of the project. Technical staff
      became more sensitive to the real-world effects of architectural or design
      issues, while non-technical program staff gained a better understanding of the
      resource requirements and long-term implications of the many decisions that are
      taken in developing software. The team was able to bridge the gap of
      understanding that often exists between technical and non-technical team
      members and to avoid the consequences that often follow these common
      misunderstandings. </p>
    <p>The modular &ldquo;working software&rdquo; approach of agile development allows members
      of the larger steve team who are not directly involved in software development
      to check in on the project at&nbsp; regular intervals. It also allows staff beyond the development team the
      opportunity to be involved in testing throughout the process. In this way the
      software delivered at the end of each cycle is better suited to the needs of
      the client and better tested than software that has not been seen by actual
      users. </p>
    <p>The short intervals of the agile development cycles allowed the steve team
      to adapt quickly to changing requirements while delivering software on-time and
      on-budget. Weekly calls of the development team kept the team informed about
      the process and limited the slow-down of the process if a team member was
      unavailable for a week or two. The communication involved in using agile
      methods ensured that the goals, problems, and plans of the project were
      understood by all team members, and this led to better results.</p>
    <p>The use of these methods is not a panacea.&nbsp; A solid commitment to the repeated use of these methods is
      critical.&nbsp; Initially, the perceived
      addition of the burden of these methods seemed overwhelming.&nbsp; Indeed, adhering to such a structured
      method of working together requires discipline and persistence from the
      team.&nbsp; It was only after following
      these methods for some period of time that the benefits of the model became
      apparent.&nbsp; Admittedly, this
      requires some bit of faith on the part of a new convert to using agile methods.&nbsp; Perspective project managers should
      forewarn their team that the process will be difficult and will require
      self-discipline in the initial stages.&nbsp; Suggesting a trial period of a certain number of development cycles will
      allow the team to agree to a limited test period, followed by a retrospective
      in which a more permanent adoption of these methods can be discussed.</p>
