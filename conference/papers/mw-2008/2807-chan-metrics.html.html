        <p class="AbstractText">All over the world museum Web site visitation is growing
    as better access and faster speeds increase Internet traffic to all categories
    of Web sites. Museums are increasingly experimenting with and implementing more
    interactive services on their own Web sites, and also decentralising their
    on-line 'brand' into a multiplicity of social networking sites and services, as
    well as virtual worlds.</p>
  <p class="AbstractText">This increased environmental complexity makes the
    traditional Web analytics and metrics that museums have used to measure and
    track success on the Web for the past decade increasingly inadequate.
    Occasional user surveys and server-side log analysis can no longer be relied
    upon by Web teams to guide them towards making museum sites more user-centric
    and effective. This is complicated further by the greater and greater
    proportion of on-line museum visitors entering the sites via a search engine.
    Whilst basic reporting currently satisfies government and sometimes corporate
    benefactors, far more complex analysis is required for museums themselves to
    more effectively evaluate and refine their on-line offerings for their users. </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">This paper argues that museums must take another look at
    their analytics tools and methods. It calls for a new approach and examines new
    ways of measuring the use of on-line museum projects and Web sites. It looks at
    the new range of analysis tools available to Web teams and, referencing the
    broader segmentation work of Peacock and Brownbill (2007), proposes practical
    ways a segmented approach can work for museums of all sizes. It proposes that
    museums need to take stock of their comparative positioning in each of these
    segments, rather than use raw figures. </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">Drawing upon search engine optimisation techniques and 
    demand-side competitive ISP-level intelligence, it combines these with new
    site-specific techniques to allow museums to better learn how their existing
    users behave on their Web sites, as well as to identify the potential audience
    for their offerings, one that is currently untapped. </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">(This paper is intended to accompany a practical workshop
    which demonstrates, with examples, many of the concepts and techniques
    described within.)</p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>The Council of Australasian Museum
    Directors announced that in 2005/6, 37 million user visits were made to its
    member museums (Council of Australasian Museum Directors, 2007). This was
    compared to 12 million physical visitors. It was a simple comparison that
    generated significant media interest, raising the profile of museums in the
    community, and importantly, in political and philanthropic funding circles. </p>
  <p>What do these figures actually mean? Are they as impressive
    as they sound?</p>
  <p>There are three immediate problems with these figures.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, each museum uses different
      tools to measure on-line visitation, and each of these tools counts 'visitors',
      'unique visitors' and 'user sessions' in different ways.</li>
    <li>Secondly, there is no detail on
      where these visitors were from or what their visit intentions were. </li>
    <li>Thirdly, there was no mention of the
      unmeasured ways museum content was being used once it had 'leaked' beyond the
      museums' own Web sites.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These problems are not unique to the
    on-line environment. Of the 12 million physical visitors, we do not know how
    many were visiting a museum because of its collection or to see a blockbuster
    or niche exhibition, how many were unwillingly dragged along by their parents
    or teachers, how many were just attending a corporate seminar that happened to
    be onsite. The figure also tells us nothing about their 'experience' of their
    visit, nor how long they spent onsite.</p>
  <h1>Traditional Analytics</h1>
  <p>It sounded so simple - everyone who visited your Web site
    would be recorded in the server logfile. It sounded so 'accurate', precise and
    quantitative. It promised to answer all those questions that are hard to answer
    about a physical visit - time spent, what was looked at, and how they got
    there. Unfortunately, it was a false promise.</p>
  <p>Web statistics are a good example of the easy abuse of
    numerical data. Web analytics tools have been developed and refined largely to
    serve the needs of the on-line advertising industry. Outside the cultural
    sector, traffic figures allow Web sites to charge more for advertising and
    promise ever more 'eyeballs'. Traffic figures have been used to justify
    impression-based Web advertising (known as CPM, cost per thousand impressions)
    - the most lucrative on-line revenue generator, but are reliant on trust in traditional
    Web metrics. In contrast, Google's pay per click advertising model (known as
    CPC, cost per click) radically changes the way on-line advertising works by
    only incurring a cost when a visitor actually clicks on an advertisement.
    Within the cultural sector, traffic figures are used to justify funding and
    sponsorship, and to 'prove' the success of an on-line project.</p>
  <h2>Metrics Help Improve Design, But Don&rsquo;t Measure Success</h2>
  <p>Museums usually undertake extensive
    research, conduct elaborate user surveys, and trawl through years of usage data
    when they are redesigning their Web presence (Thomas and Carey, 2005, Peacock
    and Brownbill, 2007). Whilst this is important when re-designing, often, after
    launching the new presence,  the specialist resources brought in to undertake
    this work are jettisoned, and ongoing 'Web site evaluation' becomes a euphemism
    for just reporting 'monthly visitor figures'. One of the factors driving this
    is the 'research it, build it, launch it, move on' model that museum Web teams
    have inherited organisationally from the exhibition focus of museums in the
    physical world. Unfortunately, this model prevents museum Web teams from
    developing the necessary agility required to respond to rapidly changing
    on-line audience behaviours and expectations, and quickly leads to a
    sub-optimal on-line experience for users.</p>
  <p>If they are not a key part of your revenue generation
    strategy, then Web metrics should be used primarily to help you improve the
    usability, accessibility and performance of your Web site - on an ongoing
    basis. Raw usage figures are virtually meaningless and divert important
    attention away from the very things that statistics can help with. In fact,
    using a range of different tools makes it possible to monitor your museum's Web
    presence and keep track of trends that indicate its effectiveness over time, so
    that ongoing improvements can be made.</p>
  <h1>A Summary Of Old Problems</h1>
  <h2>The Problem With Log File Data</h2>
  <p>Server log files record every file
    requested by another computer. Nowadays, though, this rarely represents a real
    human user at the end of the line. A well built, somewhat standards-compliant
    museum Web site will be crawled almost daily by Google, Yahoo, MSN and all
    manner of minor search engine bots. Sometimes these bots will behave themselves
    and operate as a single user session, but it is not uncommon to have thousands
    of separate bot sessions recorded in a logfile. Add to this the swarms of
    content scrapers that feed spamblogs and unknown hack
    attempts that try to inject malicious code into your dynamically served page
    URLs, and an average museum Web site log might be contaminated by as much as
    50-60% non-human traffic. Now established log analysis Web packages will
    usually be able to identify at least the known search engine bot traffic, but
    all packages will count this traffic differently, and some will inevitably slip
    through - especially the site scrapers.</p>
  <h2>The Problem With Page Tagging Data</h2>
  <p>The alternative to log file analysis from
    the Web analytics industry was page tagging. With page tagging, each time a Web
    browser loads a page in full it runs a script or loads a small file from a
    'collection' server. Page tagging is good for picking up use of your Web site
    when it is stored in a cache or proxy. It also means that non-human traffic is eliminated,
    but at the same time, without complex programming page tagging doesn't pick up
    all those non-HTML files that museums are notable for producing plenty of:  PDF
    and Flash.</p>
  <h2>The Problem With 'Unique Visitors'</h2>
  <p>Unique visitors sounds like a good metric.
    The problem is that it is calculated in very different ways by different
    analytics packages. To assist in separating different visitors from each other,
    visitors are usually identified by a combination of IP address and a cookie.
    Some packages calculate uniqueness on a daily basis, meaning that if the same
    computer and browser visits your Web site on two different days they will be
    counted as two unique visitors. If your users delete their cookies at the end
    of each session or have a dynamically allocated IP address, then the same user
    visiting from the same browser and computer multiple times will count as
    multiple unique visitors. There are no easy solutions to this; the best
    solution is just to count 'visits'.</p>
  <h2>The Problem With 'Visits' And 'Time Spent On Site'</h2>
  <p>However, visits are also problematic because different
    analysis packages apply different 'timeout' periods to inactive user sessions.
    Generally the industry has set a 30-minute timeout period after which the same
    browser and computer accessing the same Web site is determined to have started
    a new visit. This timeout period is necessary because it is impossible for
    log-based solutions to determine when a user leaves a Web site. Only a very few
    packages effectively track exit points - this has to be done by a Javascript
    hack - and even this is ineffective if a visitor's last page on your Web site
    is a PDF or Flash interactive. </p>
  <p>'Time spent on site' measures break for the same reason.
    Because it is hard to determine when a visitor leaves a site, almost all Web
    analysis packages count a single page visit as zero (0) seconds. Likewise, if a
    visit spends 15 seconds on your home page, then goes to a second page, spends 2
    minutes there and then leaves, the visit length will almost certainly be
    recorded as just 15 seconds. A better measure of the average time spent on site
    (or average visit length) needs to be manually calculated by removing all the
    single page visits from the calculation.</p>
  <p>Newer browsers with tabbed Web browsing options (such as
    Firefox, Internet Explorer 7, Safari, Opera) also make these calculations
    problematic. Much like users walking away from their computers to get a coffee,
    if a user opens a new tab and browses to another site whilst keeping your site
    open, are they really 'on your site' any more? </p>
  <h2>The Problem With 'Page Views'</h2>
  <p>Page views are increasingly problematic
    with the popularity of AJAX and the rise of video content. Page views work
    quite well for hierarchical content where content on each page is fixed and
    users must traverse several pages to complete a task, but on sites which have switched to AJAX methods, the same task can now usually
    be completed on a single page with dynamic content updating. In these
    situations, time spent and individual sub-task tracking provide much better
    insights into user behaviour. This should not be new to museums as we have had
    to deal with tracking and analysing user behaviour in Flash content on Web
    sites and Director-based interactives in museum galleries.</p>
  <h1>Comparative Analytics</h1>
  <p>Whilst your internal metrics cannot be used to compare your
    museum's performance against another museum&rsquo;s because of different measurement
    techniques, there are ways to assess your competitiveness. The most effective
    'overall' measure is in fact to sample users beyond your own Web site &#8211;
    capture the entirety of a user&rsquo;s behaviour before and after visiting your Web
    site, as well as that of non-users. There are two types of firms that do this
    type of measurement. </p>
  <p>The first uses a method derived from television and radio
    ratings - surveying a group of users on their monthly behaviour, often using a
    Web tracking application installed on the survey participants&rsquo; computers to
    keep track of everything they visit during that period. This is known as
    panel-based measurement. Firms that do this sort of measurement include
    comScore (<a href="http://www.comscore.com/">http://www.comscore.com</a>) and
    Neilsen NetRatings (<a href="http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/">http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/</a>). The bigger their
    sample size, the better the results. But in most cases even the largest museums
    score poorly: this sort of measurement is well suited to only the most popular
    and largest generalist Web sites &ndash; not museums.</p>
  <p>A slightly modified form of this type of measurement occurs
    with 'toolbar trackers' like Alexa (<a href="http://www.alexa.com/">http://www.alexa.com</a>)
    which gather data from the relatively small base of users who choose to install
    the toolbar. This is easily &lsquo;gamed&rsquo; and inaccurate - at the Powerhouse
    Museum,one of our development computers had a toolbar feeding data to Alexa; we
    noticed that Alexa was reporting our 'development Web site' was one of the most
    popular areas of the Museum's domains.</p>
  <p>The second uses the proxy logfiles generated by Internet
    service providers (ISPs). ISP logs provide a much larger and more accurate pool
    of data for analysis and, assuming that the firms providing the analysis have
    signed agreements with the major ISPs in your country,  this can give the best
    comparative analysis of any solution. Free providers of this sort of analysis
    include Quantcast (US-only &ndash; <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/">http://www.quantcast.com</a>) and Compete
    (US-only &ndash; <a href="http://www.compete.com/">http://www.compete.com</a>). The best-known commercial provider is
    Hitwise (US, UK, Australia/NZ, Hong Kong, Singapore).</p>
  <p>Panel-based and ISP proxy-based Web analytics can provide a
    much better picture of metrics such as 'time spent on site' because they
    capture an entire user's browsing profile - the sites they visit both before
    and after your site, as well as all their searches and, in panel-based
    services, detailed demographic data. These services are region-specific and can
    only estimate total traffic, focusing more on proportional metrics and trends.</p>
  <p>Through these services it becomes possible to track the
    performance of your site against those of your competitors in your local area.
    This is particularly useful for examining physical visitation traffic as well
    as brand awareness by drilling down into search terms used to find particular
    sites.</p>
  <p>Importantly, these services also offer the unique ability to
    examine what your &lsquo;non-users&rsquo; are doing, and the alternative Web sites they are
    visiting to meet their information and other needs. Museums have been slow to
    engage with this sort of research, and yet these  tools are readily available
    and used extensively in the commercial world. </p>
  <h2>Behavioural Snapshot Tools And Usability Tests</h2>
  <p>In response to the problems with the traditional blunt
    measurement tools, highly specialised user tracking tools like Clickdensity (<a
href="http://www.clickdensity.com/">http://www.clickdensity.com/</a>) and Reinvigorate
    (<a href="http://ww.reinvigorate.net/">http://www.reinvigorate.net</a>) are
    emerging as ways of taking high volume &lsquo;snapshots&rsquo; of user behaviour in a short
    period of time as an alternative to undertaking small and time-consuming focus
    group sessions and surveys. </p>
  <p>Clickdensity is discussed at length by Haynes and Zambonini
    (2007) and offers the ability to track the coordinates of users&rsquo; mouse clicks
    on site pages. Aggregating this data over a month can quickly reveal shortfalls
    in user interface design. </p>
  <p>Reinvigorate takes a different approach to traditional page
    tagging metrics by revealing what is happening &lsquo;right now&rsquo; on a site. This
    allows the analyst to follow users as they move through the site, watching in
    real time the as they navigate and explore. Reinvigorate gives to &lsquo;time spent&rsquo;
    a level of granularity which is often hidden by aggregated data.</p>
  <p>Both of these tools are joined by many other startups that
    offer similar services through to the generation of &lsquo;user videos&rsquo; which record
    movements over a number of pages. </p>
  <h1>A Simple Segmented Web Metrics Methodology</h1>
  <p>A better approach to Web metrics on your Web site is to
    segment your users and deploy appropriate measurement tools to reveal trends
    and behaviours (Carey and Jeffrey, 2006). Most good analytics packages will
    allow you to implement segmentation in the report generation process to filter
    users and sessions - if your package doesn't, then switch.</p>
  <p>First, segment your content. Peacock and Brownbill (2007)
    propose four different types of broad audience segments &ndash; visitors,
    searchers, browsers and transactors &ndash; a useful start point. Within each
    category you will need to further segment. Visitors should be further segmented
    by exhibition and primary interest; searchers and browsers by discovered content;
    and transactors by transaction type. Each part of your Web site has a core
    purpose. The information about your location, opening times, hours and charges,
    exhibits and events are there to attract real-world visitors. You will want to
    create different segments for each exhibition and event so you can track
    comparative popularity. Other parts of your Web site, your collection and
    interactive learning resources, may be intended to operate independently from a
    real-world visit experience (Peacock, 2002). The more diverse your content -
    particularly with more usable collection databases - the greater the need to
    segment, as visitors will arrive at your site with a multiplicity of needs and
    intentions (Chan, 2007). </p>
  <p>Second, set user filters. If it is not done automatically,
    filter out all non-human traffic (bots, spiders, crawlers). You may also want
    to remove all visits that have a length of under 5 or 10 seconds (understanding
    that this may also remove all your single page visitors as well), and scripts and
    RSS feed traffic. This will likely halve your total traffic but bring you
    closer to understanding what your actual human visitors are doing on your site. </p>
  <p>Third, set targets for your segmented data. Targets should
    be set in terms of growth and refined over time. Probably your real-world
    visitation section (visitors) will show shorter average visit lengths than
    other sections of your site, indicating an effective communication design.
    Users should be able to quickly find what is on and where you are located and
    be able to act on this information. Lack of clarity on these parts of your site
    will directly impact upon your real-world visitation. Education resources and
    collection areas accessed by browsers and searchers should show longer visit
    lengths.</p>
  <p>Fourth, keep an eye on traffic sources, geographic location
    (calculated through geo-IP lookups) and search phrases. Each segment will
    arrive at your site through different means. Your real-world visitation traffic
    should predominantly originate from geographical locations close enough to your
    location to make a real-world visit possible. If the majority of your traffic
    to these areas of your site is not from your local region, then your museum is
    disengaged from the local community and/or attracts mainly tourist audiences.
    Likewise, by keeping an eye on the top search phrases you will probably find
    your museum's name at the top of the list. If it isn't, then most of your
    search-originating traffic is likely to be more interested in your content than
    your real world brand; this has implications for your revenue generation,
    visitation, and marketing strategies.</p>
  <p>These steps should bring your Web metrics to a level at
    which you will be able to make better decisions about your content, its layout
    and information architecture. For the museum as a whole, you will be able to
    better understand your on-line audience, its potential growth areas, and the
    weakest areas of your site that need redesigning or reconsideration.</p>
  <h1>New Problems For Web Analytics</h1>
  <h2> Distributed Visitation And The Social Web</h2>
  <p>As Ellis and Kelly (2007) have noted, Web 2.0 and the
    distributed content model it brings with it make solely site specific analytics
    obsolete. Museums that have presences in Second Life, MySpace, and Facebook,
    and content in YouTube, and Flickr, as well as hosted blogs on Blogger.com and
    Wordpress.com and hundreds of other distributed places, now need to know how
    'effective' each of these is. Even if there is not an official presence in
    these environments, museum fans and visitors will have already created
    unofficial presences ranging from complete 3D models (Second Louvre -
    <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Tompson/154/97/100/">http://slurl.com/secondlife/Tompson/154/97/100/</a>) through to semi-private blog
    entries about their experience visiting a museum on holidays or as part of a
    school excursion.</p>
  <p>These presences are based on interactions in the form of
    comments, &lsquo;friending&rsquo; and conversation, and so 'visitation' as a metric is
    misleading. Instead, what matters is, just like in the physical museum, the
    rather nebulous concept of 'engagement'.</p>
  <p>Complicating matters further is the fact that because the
    sites and services on which this content exists are not operated by the museums
    themselves, access to metrics, such as time spent or paths through content that
    would be available if the museums themselves operated the servers, is only
    available to the site owner (YouTube, MySpace, Facebook etc). Further, the
    valuable 'social graph' that links users to each other is opaque and takes
    significant investment to extract. </p>
  <p>With some small galleries already replacing their investment
    in their 'own Web site' with a managed presence in one or more of these
    environments, the concept of a 'visit' is changing quickly. How these galleries
    will report visitation is now unknown, although on balance it is likely that
    their Web presence will be considerably more 'effective' if measured in terms
    of 'conversions' and 'friends'.</p>
  <p>As Bearman and Geber (2007) remind us, the ambient museum is
    getting closer to reality. In this version of the future, museum content is
    pushed out to 'users' based upon their personal preferences and especially
    their geographic location. A simple example is a historic tour of a suburb that
    pulls in dynamic content from a plethora of content suppliers, based entirely
    on where the tourist is walking. In these coming realities, the concept of
    'visiting a museum Web site' changes entirely, and the required metrics change
    too. </p>
  <p>Investment in new social platforms for museum content
    necessitates a calculation of a return on investment (ROI) but this is not so
    easily measured. It requires a clear understanding of the objectives of
    organisational forays into the social Web, and then the combined use of
    different tools from different vendors.</p>
  <h2>Organisational Objectives</h2>
  <p>At this stage most museums are still in the
    experimental stage of social Web initiatives, and rarely have clearly defined
    strategic objectives. Some, for example Facebook pages and groups or MySpace
    profiles, are marketing driven; those like the Steve social tagging project
    (<a href="http://www.steve.museum/">http://www.steve.museum</a>/), the Powerhouse Museum's
    OPAC (<a href="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/">http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/</a>), and the Library of
    Congress' participation in Flickr Commons (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/commons/">http://www.flickr.com/commons/</a>) are
    intended to explore how users might be able to contribute to object
    classification and discovery mechanisms as much as they are about wider
    exposure; and other experiments in Second Life and Facebook Application
    development, such as Brooklyn Museum of Art's ArtShare
    (<a href="http://apps.facebook.com/artshare/">http://apps.facebook.com/artshare/</a>), are more open technical experiments.</p>
  <p>For marketing driven social media, the return needs to be
    measured in terms of 'meaningful use' and traditional 'conversions', or calls
    to action. 'Meaningful use' requires qualitative assessment of user
    interactions rather than simply quantitative data, whilst measuring
    'conversions' usually requires the measurement of special offer take up rates
    (print and present this free pass deals, etc), and task completion tracking.</p>
  <p>Technical experiments such as presences in Second Life or
    adding content to Facebook where usage will initially be limited are best
    assessed by how they affect staff understanding of user behaviours and
    preferences, and the impact of these changed perceptions on working methods and
    goals. This creates positive organisational change which filters up through the
    organisation. </p>
  <p>The Powerhouse Museum's OPAC is an example of significant
    organisational change that was effected because curatorial staff gained a
    better understanding of how our on-line visitors discover and navigate the
    collection information. This prompted changes in internal organisation
    policies, procedures and processes around collection documentation and
    classification as a result of examining and gaining an understanding of user
    interactions (Chan, 2007).</p>
  <p>It is not so much how many are accessing your content, but
    more, what they are doing with it.</p>
  <p>For all social media in general, a good measure of overall
    effectiveness is the level of self-management generated by an active community.
    If the community self-manages and polices content, acting for the organisation,
    that is a good sign of a healthy project.</p>
  <h2>Dealing With Embedded Content</h2>
  <p>Most museum Web sites show a high level of
    traffic generated by Google Image Search and a high proportion of Web site
    visitation resulting from &lsquo;image hijacking&rsquo;. Image hijacking is a term used to
    describe when another Web site &ndash; usually now
    social networking sites like MySpace and Bebo, on-line forums, and blogs
    &ndash; embed an image from your Web site in their profile or blog post, or use
    it as their forum avatar. Rather than download the image from your site and
    then host the image on their own server, image hijackers simply embed the URL
    of the image on your site in their content. For those using log file analysis
    tools, this can generate a very large number of single page (single file)
    &lsquo;visits&rsquo; very quickly.</p>
  <p>There are two main opinions on image
    hijacking. Those in favour of counting this as a legitimate use of museum
    content argue that it demonstrates a type of engagement with the museum,
    especially for younger audiences who are seen to be traditionally
    under-represented in museums. Those against the counting of this traffic argue
    that the majority of this usage is a result of image discovery through Google
    Image Search and that embedding of this museum content rarely involves an
    actual visit to the museum&rsquo;s Web site, but simply a copying of a
    decontextualised image URL. Further, once the image is presented in its new
    context, it is rarely acknowledged as coming from the host museum or linked
    back to, and thus has no benefit to the museum.</p>
  <p>Image hijacking is spreading to other forms of content, and
    so a consistent policy on dealing with this sort of &lsquo;content usage&rsquo; needs to be
    developed. Elsewhere other Web sites, and especially social content portals
    like YouTube, Flickr, Photobucket, Slideshare, Vimeo, as well as traditional
    media from newspapers to television broadcasters, are dealing with this by
    adding &lsquo;embed this&rsquo; widgets to their content. This encourages users to &lsquo;take
    away&rsquo; content to use on their own private sites but ensures that such content
    is linked back to its source, branded with the logos of its host and owner, as
    well as controlled so that it can be removed, replaced or
    updated at any time. </p>
  <h1>New Measurement Tools</h1>
  <h2>General Social Media Health Checks</h2>
  <p>Most organisations now perform what are known as &lsquo;ego
    searches&rsquo; for their brand name, event or exhibition name. An ego search is
    effectively the Internet equivalent of a traditional media monitoring service.
    A search is performed with traditional Web search as well as across multiple
    social media platforms for blog posts, linkbacks, discussions, photos and
    videos about your brand name.</p>
  <p>Several simple free tools allow this to be performed quickly
    and regularly. Most also can deliver the ego results as an RSS feed to your RSS
    aggregator or e-mail client on a regular basis. Most free SEO sites can quickly
    return lists of linkbacks from Google, Yahoo and MSN searches. As a daily
    health check of your brand performance, a social media ego search is even more
    valuable and can reveal unsolicited visitor opinions of your organisation as
    they happen - information unlikely to be formally submitted (via guestbooks or
    feedback forms).</p>
  <p>Technorati (<a href="http://www.technorati.com/">http://www.technorati.com</a>)
    is an easy-to-receive regular update on blog posts about your organisation and
    other topics. Searches in Technorati can be turned into RSS feeds quickly.
    Because of changes in the way that Technorati counts, stores and searches, it
    is worth using Bloglines (<a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">http://www.bloglines.com/</a>)
    to perform the same ego search and compare the results.</p>
  <p>Flickr and YouTube searches are also easy ways to track your
    presence and can help reveal the most popular parts (or most photographed
    parts) of your physical museum. Any social media site can be searched in this
    way &ndash; choosing the right ones to focus on will depend upon your target
    audiences and campaigns.</p>
  <p>Another interesting measure of reputation for museums is the
    number of Wikipedia articles that reference content on their Web sites.
    Wikipedia provides a simple tool for performing this type of search (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALinksearch">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALinksearch</a>) and it returns a list of Wikipedia articles by title, complete
    with the URL from your site that is  referenced by the article.</p>
  <h2>Measuring RSS Subscriptions And Podcasts</h2>
  <p>One of the great benefits of RSS is that
    content is easily syndicated to other Web sites and service providers.
    Once syndicated, though, there are no easy ways to measure actual usage of this
    content. Log file data will report back how many times an RSS feed is requested
    from your servers, but this only indicates the polling frequency of various RSS
    clients and readers. A single RSS client (user) may request the feed from your
    server every 30 minutes to check for changes, regardless of whether a user at
    the other end is reading the feed, and this will greatly inflate your visit
    figures unless specifically filtered out.</p>
  <p>Feedburner (<a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">http://www.feedburner.com/</a>) offers a useful free
    service to measure subscriptions to RSS feeds, and its statistics provide
    details on item by item usage, as well as offering a useful RSS-to-email
    function. Subscribers can easily be tracked by time period. Feedburner is also
    well suited to monitoring podcast feeds, especially if your podcasts are being
    listed in the iTunes directory. Without Feedburner, monitoring the source of
    traffic to your podcasts relies entirely on server logfile data.</p>
  <p>It should be emphasised that there is no current free
    solution for measuring how many podcasts are actually listened to after being
    downloaded. Many startups are developing technology in this space driven by the
    demand from advertisers to ensure that podcast advertising is reaching its
    intended audience. Most of these use a similar methodology to Feedburne,r
    tracking RSS and/or using a special embedded player application. For very
    popular podcasts it is occasionally possible to see them listed in user
    playlists on music trackers like Last.FM ,but this is rare (for example - <a
href="http://www.last.fm/music/SFMOMA">http://www.last.fm/music/SFMOMA</a>).</p>
  <p>In many ways the best measure of the success of a podcast is
    how much feedback and discussion it generates. This is far more valuable than
    the total number of downloads.</p>
  <h2>Measuring Blog Performance</h2>
  <p>Blogs are difficult to measure using
    traditional Web analytic methods. The problems with RSS feed measurement are
    compounded by the design of most blog &lsquo;home pages&rsquo; which list multiple posts on
    one page. Whilst this makes it easy for the reader to read multiple posts
    without loading another page, it makes tracking very difficult. Blogs
    will typically have very high numbers of users who visit only one page, and for
    the reasons discussed earlier, will have a zero visit length recorded against
    them. Further, if users are reading multiple posts on the one page, there is no
    reliable way of determining which posts are the most popular.</p>
  <p>Technorati rankings, which are based on linkbacks, are
    frequently used to measure blog performance; however, as the volume of &lsquo;splogs&rsquo;
    (spam blogs) grows exponentially, this is not always a reliable measure. As a
    generic measure it is a good starting point.</p>
  <p>Again, it is far better to measure interactions &#8211;
    comments, trackbacks &ndash; and then qualitatively assess them. Blogs should
    ideally be generating conversation and discussion, and blogs will rank
    differently depending upon your choice of what to measure (Chan &amp;
    Spadaccini, 2007).</p>
  <h2>On-Line Communities And Social Networking Sites</h2>
  <p>Measuring presence in social
    networking sites like Facebook and MySpace has usually been done at a basic
    level by counting &lsquo;friends&rsquo; or &lsquo;fans&rsquo; and profile comments. Increasingly,
    though, organisations are spreading their presence within these networks across
    profiles, groups, pages and events. Because the way users of social networking
    services use and interact with these presences is heavily reliant on situational
    relevance, some profile fans may not also exist in an organisational group, and
    vice versa. </p>
  <p>With Facebook and MySpace both now offering developers the
    ability to create applications/widgets, more detailed information can be
    gathered in this way. Indeed, the real value to organisations lies in the
    ability to data mine some of the data held on fan profiles, although there are
    obvious privacy and ethical concerns that need to be considered carefully. A
    Facebook application developer, for instance, can find out not only how many
    profiles are using an application, but also how that application is being
    discovered, and as well can map the individual users to their interactions with
    the application. Those that can devise ways of using the resulting data will be
    the most successful, much in the same way the Powerhouse Museum&rsquo;s OPAC project
    has gained more insights from tracking user behaviour than from the social
    tagging that can be done on the site (Chan, 2007).</p>
  <p>Whilst YouTube provides only very rudimentary statistics for
    uploaders and content creators, Flickr now provides for uploaders a statistics
    page that reveals aggregate views, comments and favourites along with the more
    useful data about referrers &ndash; how people discovered your photos. Tracking
    photo referrers, especially from other Flickr groups, along with comments
    tracking, allows organisations to build stronger community bonds with their
    content in these services.</p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>Social media metrics are still very much in their infancy,
    and traditional metrics are increasingly problematic and irrelevant. Tracking
    user behaviour is far more invasive, and privacy concerns are amplified as
    users present far more data about themselves and their identity. </p>
  <p>Whilst organisations are still struggling with inadequate
    traditional Web metrics and still devising social media strategies and
    objectives, measurement of their effectiveness is difficult. </p>
  <p>When combined with better site-specific metrics, however,
    there are great opportunities to build better, more engaging, more interactive
    content for more diverse museum audiences and to deliver them directly to the
    users where they already communicate and socialise on-line. </p>
  <p>User metrics, when properly segmented, can greatly improve
    usability and reveal otherwise unseen usage patterns and trends. The smartest
    museums will be the ones who can leverage their real world trust and reputation
    in the social media environment, and build unobtrusive tools to translate
    learning from user behaviour into organisational action and change &ndash; rather
    than just counting the numbers.</p>
