        <p class="AbstractText">Web 2.0 enables increased access to the museum digital
  collection. More and more, users will spend time preparing their visits to
  museums and reflecting on them after the visits. In this context, the CHIP
  (Cultural Heritage Information Personalization) project offers tools to the
  users to be their own curators; e.g. for planning a personalized museum tour,
  discovering interesting artworks they want to see in a 'virtual' or a 'real' tour,
  and quickly finding their way in the museum. In this paper we present the new
  additions to the CHIP tools to target the above functionality - a Web-based
  Tour Preparation Wizard and an export of a personalized tour to an interactive
  Mobile Guide used in the physical museum space. In addition, the user
  interactions during a real museum visit are stored and synchronized with the
  user model, which is maintained at the museum Web site.</p>

<h1>Introduction </h1>
<p>In recent years, the purpose of museum Web sites has shifted
  from merely providing static museum information to providing personalization
  services to various worldwide  users who have different personal
  characteristics, goals, tasks and behaviors. Personalization enables changing
  the museum mass communication paradigm into a user-centered interactive
  information exchange, where the &quot;museum monologue turns into a
  dialogue&quot;, and personalization is &quot;a new communication strategy based
  on a continuous process of collaboration, learning and adaptation between the
  museum and its visitors&rdquo; (Bowen, 2004). In this context, the goal of the CHIP
  research team is to demonstrate first,  how novel Semantic Web technologies can
  be deployed to enrich the museum vocabularies and metadata and providing
  semantic browsing, searching and semantic recommendations; and second, how
  personalization and user modeling techniques can be explored to enhance users&rsquo;
  experiences both on the museum Web site and in the physical museum space.</p>
<p>As a first step, we illustrated our approach with the
  Rijksmuseum ARIA (Amsterdam Rijksmuseum Interactief) database by mapping it to
  the external art-related vocabularies of Getty ULAN, AAT and TGN vocabularies
  and IconClass (Aroyo, 2007). The use of common vocabularies provides the new
  repository with a relational and hierarchical structure. Based on the semantic
  data model, we designed the first component of our demonstrator, Artwork
  Recommender. It is realized in the form of an interactive dialogue quiz that
  helps the users to find what is interesting in the Rijksmuseum collection for
  them to rate. Based on those ratings, the Artwork Recommender generates
  content-based recommendations for both artworks and abstract topics about the
  artworks. To store the users&rsquo; ratings, we built an interactive user model. It
  is an overlay of the semantic data model (Wang, 2007), extended by importing
  the users&rsquo; individual  FOAF RDF profiles, which include additional information
  (e.g. name, interests, past visits). </p>
<p>In this paper, we report on the implementation of two new
  components: a Web-based Tour Wizard and a PDA-based Mobile Tour, both aiming at
  providing personalized museum tours as a way to enhance users&rsquo; museum
  experiences between the Web and the real museum space in a more intensive,
  long-lasting and engaging way. </p>
<p>The Tour Wizard automatically generates personalization
  museum tour(s) on the Web. That tour contains artworks recommended according to
  the users&rsquo; art preferences,  initialized in the Artwork Recommender and stored
  in each user&rsquo;s model. The user could also edit the tour and add interesting
  artworks by using the semantic search in the Tour Wizard or getting further
  recommendations from the Artwork Recommender. Each tour can be visualized on
  the Rijksmuseum map or on the historical timeline.</p>
<p>The Mobile Tour is offered on a PDA, and it converts virtual
  tours created with the help of the Tour Wizard to actual tours in the physical
  museum space. In this transformation a number of constraints can be setup; e.g.
  to filter unavailable artworks, order artworks, set the number of artworks and
  time duration. Moreover, it synchronizes/updates user models on the Web server
  and on the PDA. </p>
<p>The paper is organized as follows. First, we present an
  overview of the current museums tours, mainly in the Netherlands, and discuss
  the requirements we derived for building museum tours. Secondly, we explain the
  rationale of the museum tours and describe the overall architecture. Third, we
  discuss each of the three different CHIP components: the Artwork Recommender,
  the Tour Wizard and the Mobile Tour. Fourth, we describe in detail how a
  virtual tour is mapped to the physical museum space and how to synchronize user
  profiles between the Web and the PDA. Finally, we present conclusions and
  future work.</p>
<h1>1. Overview of the Museum Tours and the Requirements </h1>
<p>In the exploration phase, we participated in a number of
  museum tours, mainly in the Netherlands: (i) the multimedia tours in the Van
  Gogh Museum, Frans Hals Museum, Kr&ouml;ller-M&uuml;ller Museum and Boijmans van
  Beuningen Museum; (ii) the audio and human guided tours in the Rijksmuseum
  Amsterdam; and (iii) the on-line museum tours outside the Netherlands, e.g. the
  &lsquo;Explore Tate Britain&rsquo; from the Web site of the Tate Britain and the &lsquo;Virtual
  Reality Tour&rsquo; from the Web site of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Below we
  give an overview of some of the museum tours: see Table 1. </p>

<p class="caption">Table 1. Overview of explored museums tours</p>
<p>Besides the tours mentioned above, there are numerous
  additional examples of museum applications that explore adaptive multimedia
  museum tours in mobile devices. For example, the wearable computer, developed
  at MIT Media Lab, delivers audiovisual narration adapting to the user's interest
  based on the physical path in the museum and the length of stops (Sparacino,
  2002). In the PEACH project, a museum guide application was developed to
  provide to individual visitors an educational environment adaptive their art
  interests and needs (Rocchi, 2004). Finally, as a result of this exploration, a
  set of criteria and requirements were outlined for building personalized museum
  tours within the CHIP demonstrators. Multiple languages, support of multiple
  platforms and limited use of the hardware controls of the device, as well as
  context sensitive help, appeared to play important roles in the efficient and
  effective use of interactive mobile tours by a large audience from various
  countries. With respect to the content of the museum tour, critical factors for
  achieving flexibility and sufficient user control are: (i) maintaining a good
  (and adjustable) balance between the number of artworks and time duration spent
  in the museum; and (ii) providing various types of information about museum
  artworks. For the overall satisfaction of the museum visitors, significant
  aspects are the adaptivity of  user guidance through the museum and the
  customization of the tour itself. To achieve these, it is essential to apply
  methods to determine user and artworks position in an overall wireless locator
  mechanism.</p>
<h1>2. CHIP Overall Architecture</h1>
<p>The goal of building museum tours within the CHIP
  demonstrator is to enhance the users&rsquo; museum experience in a more intensive,
  long-lasting and engaging way (see Figure 1); in other words, to keep the users
  &lsquo;stuck&rsquo; into the immersive museum environment, which includes the virtual and
  the real museums. </p>
<p class="caption"><a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a><a href="wang-fig1.html"><img src="wang-fig1.jpg" alt="fig 1" width="400" /></a></p>
<p class="caption"><a href="wang-fig1.html">Fig 1: Use case of museum tours</a></p>
<p>Imagine the following scenario. Individuals want to visit
  the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam but have no clue about what to see in the vast museum
  collection. So they first prepare at home by using the Web-based Artwork
  Recommender and Tour Wizard, which help to identify and find  art preferences
  in the Rijksmuseum collection (Artwork Recommender) and recommend personalized
  museum tours based on that art preference/user profile (Tour Wizard). After the
  preparation, the user goes to the real Rijksmuseum to start a real visit. The
  PDA-based Mobile Tour can load all the tours via the internet/wireless
  connection and give detailed information (text, audio and images) about
  artworks in the tour. Moreover, it provides navigation guidance (e.g. shows the
  current position and route direction). (The user can, of course, also directly
  visit the museum without any preparation. In this case, the PDA will offer only
  standard tours.) After the user&rsquo;s visit, the PDA will send back the user&rsquo;s real
  behavior information (e.g. time spent, route) to update the user model on the
  Web server, thus preparing better personalized services. </p>
<p>To understand different components (tools) of the CHIP
  demonstrator and the relations among them, below in Figure 2 we give an overall
  architecture diagram. </p>
<p class="caption"><a name="fig2" id="fig2"></a><a href="wang-fig2.html"><img src="wang-fig2.jpg" alt="fig 2" width="400" /></a></p>
<p class="caption"><a href="wang-fig2.html">Fig 2: Overall architecture of the CHIP demonstrator</a></p>
<p>A client-server architecture with Java Servlets is running
  on the main CHIP server. The semantic data model and the overlay user models
  represented in RDF are also stored there. Sesame and SeRQL are used for RDF
  data processing between the data model, Artwork Recommender, Tour Wizard and
  the user model. (More details of the semantic-enriched data model can be found
  in Aroyo, 2007.) Next to the two Web-based components of the CHIP demonstrator,
  Artwork Recommender and Tour Wizard, a PDA-based Mobile Tour converts museum
  tours from virtual to real tours in the physical museum space, and in the
  meantime gives useful guidance to users. In this way, by offering better
  personalization services based on their updated user models, we aim at
  enhancing and extending the user&rsquo;s museum experience and triggering follow-up
  visits to the virtual or real museum.</p>
<h1>3. Web-Based Components: Artwork Recommender And Tour Wizard</h1>
<p>The Artwork Recommender provides users an interactive rating
  dialogue of artworks/topics and generates semantic-driven recommended artworks
  and topics based on the ratings. From several user studies, a comprehensive
  usability feedback was gathered (Wang, 2007) and resulted in an improved user
  interface and interaction (see Figure 3). For example, a sequential
  visualization of a set of artworks to rate, and a clearer distinction between
  different frames (e.g. rate artworks/topics, recommended artworks/topics), were
  achieved. </p>
<p class="caption"><a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a><a href="wang-fig3.html"><img src="wang-fig3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="400" /></a></p>
<p class="caption"><a href="wang-fig3.html">Fig 3: New interface of the Artwork Recommender</a></p>
<p>Based on the user&rsquo;s ratings stored in the user model, the
  second component, the Tour Wizard, generates personalized museum tours of
  artworks. It also allows for a semantic search facility, provided by the
  MultimediaN E-Culture project (Schreiber, 2006), for users to search themes or
  topics of artworks to add to the tour(s). For example, if the user searches
  &ldquo;Rembrandt&rdquo;, the system will find concepts which all contain &ldquo;<i>Rembrandt</i>&rdquo; as a keyword, but from three different categories
  (see Figure 4): (i) Creator &ldquo;<i>Rembrandt</i> van Rijn&rdquo;; (ii) Artwork &ldquo;Old woman reading a lectionary (portrait of <i>Rembrandt</i>&rsquo;s mother)&rdquo;, &ldquo;Self portrait of <i>Rembrandt</i> van Rijn&rdquo; and &ldquo;Study for a statue of <i>Rembrandt</i>&rdquo;; and (iii) Theme &ldquo;<i>Rembrandt</i>&rsquo;s cycle&rdquo;. </p>
<p class="caption"><a name="fig4" id="fig4"></a><a href="wang-fig4.html"><img src="wang-fig4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="400" /></a></p>
<p class="caption"><a href="wang-fig4.html">Fig 4: Semantic search in the Tour Wizard</a></p>
<p>In the Tour Wizard, museum tours can be constructed by users
  and viewed either on the museum map or in a chronological timeline. Figure 5
  shows a screenshot of the visualization of museum tours on the Rijksmuseum map.
  The red line connects all the artworks included in the current to, and the
  number in the dot indicates how many artworks in the room are included in the
  current tour.</p>
<p class="caption"><a name="fig5" id="fig5"></a><a href="wang-fig5.html"><img src="wang-fig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="400" /></a></p>
<p class="caption"><a href="wang-fig5.html">Fig 5: Visualization of museum tours in the Tour Wizard</a></p>
<h1>4. PDA-based Component: Mobile Tour</h1>
<p>From the requirement study in Section 2, we derived that
  when the Internet/wireless connection is available, the PDA Mobile Tour should
  be able to load/import tours created from the Tour Wizard on the Web site;
  synchronize the user model; set tour properties (e.g. time duration and the
  number of artworks); retrieve explanations of artworks by using the RFID
  reader; and locate the user&rsquo;s current position in the museum and give
  navigation guidance.</p>
<p>To satisfy these requirements, four main functionalities are
  provided: (i) download tours; (ii) synchronize the user model; (iii) apply a
  set of constraints for the mobile tour; and (iv) indicate the user&rsquo;s positioning
  and plan a route.</p>
<h2>Download Tours </h2>
<p>To download tours to the PDA, the Mobile Tour will invoke on
  the server a Web application (i.e. Mobile data application) which is created
  for exporting and importing information in XML. Then, a Servlet called GetTours
  will be invoked to fetch the tour data from the data store using SeRQL and
  return the information to the PDA as an XML file using a DOM approach as a
  separate component called the XML Writer (see fig. 6). The generated XML file
  retrieves all data from the tours and returns to the PDA.</p>
<p class="caption"><a name="fig6" id="fig6"></a><a href="wang-fig6.html"><img src="wang-fig6.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="426" height="116" /></a></p>
<p class="caption"><a href="wang-fig6.html">Fig 6: Download tours and synchronize the user model</a></p>
<h2>Synchronize The User Model</h2>
<p>To ensure no user model data is lost when synchronizing, two
  steps are performed (see fig. 6). The first step is to add the current pending
  updates from the PDA to the user model on the Web server. This is performed by
  the PostUM Servlet, which receives the user model from the Mobile Tour as a
  Post variable. The second step is to download the new updated user model from
  the mobile data application by invoking a second Servlet GetUM. It retrieves
  updated user data and overwrites the current mobile user model with the new one
  on the PDA.</p>
<h2>Apply Constraints</h2>
<p>Different from on-line virtual tours, mobile tours in the
  real museum space encounters a number of constraints; e.g. the availability of
  artworks, time duration, route in the big museum space, etc. In the Mobile
  Tour, we proposed a mapping mechanism with three steps: (i) to filter out
  unavailable artworks from the total set of selected artworks; (ii) to order
  available artworks in an optimal route; (iii) to allow users to limit the
  number of tour artworks to see and set up the total time duration. The last two
  constraints are synchronized. </p>
<h2>Indicate The User&rsquo;s Position And Plan A Route</h2>
<p>In the Rijksmuseum scenario, each artwork is embedded with a
  passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag which is connected with the
  PDA. We track the user&rsquo;s position by scanning the location of the corresponding
  artwork. When the user starts a tour, a trace is calculated from the current
  user position to the first artwork in the tour, and then from the first artwork
  to the second one. This sequence is repeated until a trace is calculated from
  the last artwork to the end point of the tour, and finally, all these traces
  are merged together, leading to a route from the start point to the end point,
  passing all selected artworks. </p>

<p class="caption"><a href="wang-fig7.html">Fig 7: Screenshots of the Mobile Tour on PDA</a></p>
<h1>5. Conclusion and Future Work</h1>
<p>In this paper we have proposed an approach of exploiting
  personalized museum tours to enhance and extend users&rsquo; museum experiences both
  on the museum Web site and in the physical museum space. Our approach includes
  the following main steps: (i) we performed a user study to derive requirements
  for building museum tours; (ii) we implemented a Web-based Tour Wizard to generate
  recommended museum tours based on the user&rsquo;s art preference; (iii) we converted
  the tours to the PDA-based Mobile Tour, which is used in the physical museum
  space by applying a number of constraints arising  in real museum space; and
  (iv) we implemented the synchronization of the user model on the Web site with
  the model on the PDA mobile device. </p>
<p>As follow-up work, we are planning an evaluation to test the
  three-faceted rationale (prepare, visit and synchronize) of museum tours by
  using the Tour Wizard and the Mobile Tour. The general idea is to split users
  into two groups (one first exploring the Web-based Tour Wizard and one first
  directly visiting the real museum using the Mobile Tour) and let them perform
  their tour(s) in a museum scenario. We also aim to test the usability of the
  mobile device/PDA and the effectiveness of recommended tours. In addition, we
  will collect the users&rsquo; feedback and their satisfaction about using the
  multiple components of the CHIP demonstrator. </p>
<p>As a long-term goal, we are preparing to extend the current
  user model which allows a high expressivity of the users&rsquo; interactions with the
  Rijksmuseum collection in a wide variety of contexts. As a first step, we have
  already imported the user&rsquo;s FOAF profile (e.g. name, email, known people,
  interests, etc.) to enrich the user model and to solve the cold-start problem
  for first time users. As the heterogeneous population of users and their
  interactions with the system change very quickly, we might consider adding more
  dynamic and contextual properties in the user model and connecting the user
  model with other on-line social communities in the open Web 2.0 world. </p>
