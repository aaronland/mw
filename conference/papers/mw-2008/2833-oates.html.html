        <h3 class="AbstractTitle"><b>Abstract</b></h3>
        <p class="AbstractText">Flickr is a four year old online photosharing
    community. Before January of 2008, it primarily held &quot;user-generated content,&quot;
    photographs and stories from individuals in practically every country on the
    planet. Pioneering a variety of &quot;Web 2.0&quot; technologies like tagging, Flickr has
    grown into an enormous corpus of photography that reflects humanity over the
    last four years, and beyond. &quot;The Commons&quot; is a program we've developed to
    introduce publicly-held photography collections into the mix. Releasing a pilot
    partnership with the Library of Congress Prints &amp; Photographs Catalog has
    at once provided an interesting counterbalance to this &quot;user-generated&quot; archive
    and also begun to test ideas around the knowledge, authority and participation
    of the general public. Primarily intended to increase access to the vast
    collections of photography held in libraries, archives and museums around the
    world, the program also seeks to gather additional context about objects in
    these collections, and potentially even feedback or be cross-referenced by
    those institutions participating. There are thousands of interested members of
    the general public already adding information and knowledge about the content
    released in the pilot program. This paper is intended to outline the progress
    of the pilot so far, and to provide information for interested parties about
  how to participate in the Commons on Flickr.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Flickr launched in February of
    2004, and has grown into an enormous photo archive of over 2.3 billion images.
    There are over one million photos uploaded every day (that's somewhere around
    4,000 every minute). The Flickr infrastructure is built to serve the
    application and photographs at top speed, and the design of the site is
  optimized for searching, viewing and exploring images.</p>
<p>Our
    community is made of over 20 million people. There are myriad examples of
    community interaction and collaboration and the community we've nurtured is
    known for its supportive, intelligent, friendly nature. There are thousands of
    groups on Flickr, dedicated to a vast range of particular interests, many of
  which have well over one thousand members.</p>
<p>There are already
    several examples of cultural heritage institutions making use of Flickr, more
  or less in isolation. There seem to be two main types of use at this stage:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li><b>For general outreach</b><br />
    Includes &quot;behind the scenes&quot; documentation. Exhibitions being installed;
    photographs of preservation work; commentary from staff about collections.
    Some examples of this type of outreach are the Brooklyn Museum, or the V&amp;A</li>
  <li><b>To display collections</b><br />
    There are a few cases of institutions sharing content from their
    photographic collections and/or physical object collections. There are a
    variety of levels of engagement, and inclusion of institution-specific
    metadata included in each record, or not. </li>
</ol>
<p>We were thrilled
    when the Library of Congress (L.C.) contacted us in the middle of 2007 to talk
    about publishing some of the 14 million photographs held in their Prints &amp;
  Photographs Catalog. It was in the process of developing that partnership that
  I had the idea for the Commons.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>The Library of Congress Pilot</h2>
<p>The pilot project launched on
    January 16, 2008. We had worked together for the previous three months or so
    developing our plan for the pilot's release. This included debate and
    discussion around what to publish initially, how to represent the Library of
    Congress on Flickr, and negotiating new Terms of Service that the Library
  agreed upon with Yahoo!, specifically regarding their institutional account. </p>
<p>Helena
    Zinkham, the acting Chief of the Prints &amp; Photographs Catalog, had
    carefully selected content from two existing collections she knew to be
    popular: &quot;<b><i>News from the 1910s</i></b>&quot;, set of 1,500 photographs from the Bain New Service
    collection containing almost 40,000 glass negatives made ca. 1900-1920, and &quot;<b><i>1930s-40s
    in Color</i></b>&quot;, images of
    rural areas and farm labor, as well as aspects of World War II mobilization,
    including factories, railroads, aviation training, and women working between
    1939 and 1944. We intentionally planned that there would be a minimum of
    description or organization to the 3,150 photos uploaded, to provide a &quot;blank
  slate&quot; for Flickr members to describe things as observed, without constraint. </p>
<p>Both Flickr and
    The Library of Congress posted articles to their respective blogs, and then we
  watched and waited to see what would happen. We were stunned by the response.</p>
<p>Within
    two and a half days, the Flickr community added just over 20,000 tags to the
    two collections. (See http://flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/tags/.)
    There was also a tremendous amount of interest from the press and in the
    blogosphere. Frankly, both parties were somewhat overwhelmed, but in the most
  positive way. </p>
<h2>Joining The Commons on Flickr</h2>
<p>As we consult with more
    institutions about the potential of this program, we are beginning to
    consolidate feedback and functional demands into guidelines for further
    participation in the Commons. The program is just under three months old at the
    time of creating this document, so it's important to acknowledge that this
  outline may change in future.</p>
<h3>Program Objectives</h3>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><b>Increase access to publicly-held photographic
      collections</b><br />
      Above all else, the mandate of museums and libraries around the world is
      to increase access to their collections. Flickr is a vessel to make use of
      to share your collections with millions of people from all over the world,
      both Flickr members (who can interact with the collections leaving
      comments and so forth) and the general public (who may view and share
    public Commons content). </li>
  <li><b>Gather context and information</b><br />
    Part of the Commons design on Flickr explicitly invites the general Flickr
    membership to contribute knowledge, description, correction and stories to
    photographs they see. Both the L.C. and Flickr teams have been simply
    amazed by both the volume and quality of feedback provided so far. 
  <ul>
    <li>There is also a secondary objective here: To
        demonstrate the usefulness and validity of folksonomic data. Not in
        opposition to curatorial or archival expertise, but as a supplement or
      counterpart to it.&nbsp; </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><b>Feed back gathered information</b><br />
    Inform the institution's catalog, and possibly others in future, where
    relevant. It will be up to each participating institution to determine
    where and when information will be useful to enter in to their catalog.
    The L.C. team has recently updated approximately 70 records in their
    catalog as a direct result of participation in the Commons, and decided to
    link from some catalog records back to the stories and conversation about
    a particular photograph available on Flickr.</li>
  <li><b>Collect tools to share</b><br />
    There is a wonderful opportunity to create a shared pool of software so
    that smaller institutions without the necessary web development resources
    can make use of uploading and/or downloading software written by another
    institution's web team. For example, the L.C. web development team made
    modifications to an open source uploader, <b>flickrj</b>, in order to inject their Flickr presence with
      information directly from their catalog records. Given that these
      modifications are also open source, others may use (and modify) this
    software to publish their photographs on Flickr. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements for Participation</h3>
<ol>
  <li>All content in the institutional account intended for
    inclusion in the Commons must be marked &quot;<i>no known copyright
      restrictions</i>&quot; (see below)</li>
  <li>We will only be accepting content from <i>photographic
    collections</i>, and <i>not</i> photographs of physical objects in a
    collection. This may change in future, but for now, we want to maintain a
    tight focus on photography for the contents of the Commons</li>
  <li>The institution must indemnify Yahoo! Inc. against
    potential copyright disputes, signing additional Terms of Service that
    also establish its <i>presence on Flickr as an organization</i>, not an individual (which is the standard
    contract).</li>
</ol>
<h4>&quot;No Known Copyright Restrictions&quot;</h4>
<p>This verbiage was
    developed in collaboration with L.C. counsel, and is intended as a guideline
    for use, <i>not</i> a license per se. Each
    participating institution will be entirely responsible for confirming its
    ability to publish content under this guideline, and should look to present its
  interpretation online for reference.</p>
<p>It is important to
    note that publishing content on the internet means that attribution may not
    always happen. There are some simple ways to try to ensure that appropriate
    reference happens, such as a polite note in the description of the photo;
    something along the lines of &quot;If you choose to share this photograph outside of
    Flickr, please provide either a link back to this page, or mention of
  [Institution Name] wherever you use it. Thank you.&quot;</p>
<h3>The Community &amp; Your Institution</h3>
<p>The Library made about 10,000 new
    &quot;friends&quot; on Flickr as a direct result of participation. &quot;Friends&quot; in this
    context are people who now count the Library's Flickr stream as something
    they'd like to stay in touch with, which will in turn show up in their &quot;photos
    from your friends&quot; page. Members can keep in touch with new uploads the Library
    sends in &ndash; incidentally, they've published another 300 or so photos in
  recent weeks, at about 50 per week.</p>
<p>There is also a
    wonderful opportunity to establish personal identity of curators, archivists or
    librarians on Flickr, providing another portal through which to ask for
    assistance in identifying or correcting catalog information. We are looking to
    develop the facility for an institution's staff members to have access to the
    institution's &quot;Recent Activity&quot; stream as individuals, not simply by many staff
  logging in to the one account. </p>
<p>Flickr claims no
    expertise in curation. Each participating institution will choose what should
    be published on to Flickr, and when. There is flexibility in what to display
    alongside each photo submitted. (See the Library of Congress stream for
    examples). It's possible to provide a link back to original catalog source,
  which maintains the opportunity for continuing revenue in photo sales, etc.</p>
<h3>Feedback: Results and Examples</h3>
<p>There are different sorts of
    feedback provided for the photographs, using tags and in photo comments:
    transcription; photo format/technology; timeframes; creator name; subjects
    based on the contents of image; things in the image that weren't in the record
    like &quot;yellow&quot; or &quot;apple&quot; etc; transcription of signs in the
    photos; general commentary: &quot;dapper&quot;; humour &ndash; &quot;UFO&quot;;
    checking a source; cross-referencing; expanding the context &ndash; &quot;LA
    Bombing&quot;; emotional responses &ndash; &quot;Wow&quot;; machine tags;
    geolocative; spelling variants; non-english words; corrections on the catalog
  record, or to other taggers. </p>
<h4>&quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot;</h4>
<p>We were thrilled to observe a
    spontaneous collection emerge from the <em><strong>&quot;1930s-40s in Color&quot; </strong></em>photographs. Where the Library
    had classified these photos with such subject headings as <i>Airplane
    industry</i>, <i>Women&#8212;Employment</i>, <i>World War, 1939-1945</i>, <i>Assembly-line methods</i>, <i>Drilling</i>, <i>United States--California--Long Beach</i>, the Flickr community pulled 76 photos in the collection together
    using the tag &quot;rosie the riveter.&quot; This is just one example of many where
    cultural reference has been used to describe the Library's content, and create
  ad-hoc groupings based on 'common language.' &nbsp;See <a
href="http://flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/tags/rosietheriveter">http://flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/tags/rosietheriveter</a>.</p>
<h4>Hyperlinks</h4>
<p>The community has been able to
    cross-reference many of the Library's photos with other information on the
    internet, primarily resources on sites such as Wikipedia. This ad-hoc,
    supplemental context allows viewers to get a first step into wider research of
  the context in which these photos were taken. </p>
<p>The issue of the
    Library's authority is not questioned, but rather supplemented by information,
    effort and knowledge on the part of the millions of people in the Flickr
    community. Information that would take a curator potentially years to uncover
    flows thick and fast directly from individuals who either correct, augment or cross-reference
    the gorgeous photographs on Flickr. These stories and comments are collected
    and kept on Flickr, and are clearly understood to be contributed by Flickr
    members, and not by the librarians themselves. They provide additional color to
  the records in the Library's wonderful collection.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Both the Library staff and myself
    have been utterly charmed by the generous, participatory nature of the input
    into the Commons so far. On a personal note, I'm looking forward to increasing
    access to other photographic archives from around the world. (We've received
    over 30 enquiries so far, from large to small libraries and museums.)&nbsp; It has been fascinating to talk with
    and listen to the reflections of the Library of Congress team as it processes
    and analyses all the information we've received. There are lots of questions
    about how to combine the folksonomic data collected on Flickr with the
  structured, catalogued information of institutions. </p>
<p>It
    will be interesting to watch how the Commons grows. The ideal is that other
    institutions join, and special interest groups from the millions of people
    using Flickr will seek out and help describe content that they are interested
    in, and have knowledge about. This will make both the institutional catalogue
    (or links from it) richer, and help &ndash; above all &ndash; to increase
  access to the world's publicly-held photographic collections. </p>
