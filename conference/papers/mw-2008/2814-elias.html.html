      <p class="AbstractText">ECHO (Education through Cultural and Historical
        Organizations) is a federally funded partnership of six cultural institutions
        in Hawai'i, Alaska, Mississippi and Massachusetts linking Native and non-Native
        communities, and re-connecting Native people with collections of Native
        American art, objects and history. Since 2001 ECHO has created Web sites to
        accomplish this purpose, drawing on vast collections of data, media, and
        objects. The partnership is presently re-designing its main Web presence to
        represent its values and accomplishments, house its resources for
        cross-cultural and place-based education, and provide a suite of tools for
        communities, both Native and non-Native, to create and disseminate their own
        lesson plans, video, text, and photographic content. The conceptual foundations
        and process of designing the site are examined, and some of the challenges
        involved in working across a broad range of communities are addressed. </p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>It is a truism
        bordering on the trivial to say that in the 21<sup>st</sup> century the world
        is more closely connected than ever. Communication is cheaper and easier than
        at any time in world history. It does not follow, though, that we understand
        each other when we communicate. We have the tools; now we have to learn how to
        use them to promote understanding and fruitful interaction. </p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 2: ECHO partner locations</p>
      <p>ECHO (Education
        Through Cultural and Historical Organizations), a partnership
        of six widely dispersed cultural institutions, fosters that learning.&nbsp; Individual missions vary, but the ECHO
        partners all seek to enhance appreciation of regional heritage; to facilitate
        dialogue and understanding between people; and to provide life-enhancing
        educational opportunities in and out of the classroom.&nbsp; Through this dialogue, communities are
        better able to enter the global marketplace, bridging divides of geography,
        background, and age, while strengthening local culture.</p>

      <p>Since its founding
        in 2001, more than 150 distinct ECHO initiatives have generated over 1,500
        exhibitions, events, and public programs  &ndash; affecting more than four million
        people. Through those initiatives, ECHO has:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>received
          3 million Web visits;</li>
        <li>engaged
          580,000 individual program participants;</li>
        <li>catalogued,
          conserved, and stabilized over 33,000 objects, images, and historical documents
        for future generations;</li>
        <li>produced
          35 documentaries on indigenous and locale-specific culture, art, and history,
          of which several have been broadcast over public or public access television
          stations;</li>
        <li>served
          244 individual schools (including 100 charter schools), with programs for
          100,000 students;</li>
        <li>reached
          5,777 life-long learners through non-school educational programs;</li>
        <li>fostered
          191 partnerships with sub-recipients of ECHO funding and other community-based
          organizations;</li>
        <li>given
          584 interns of diverse backgrounds practical, on-the-job training in the
          vibrant and growing museum/cultural communications sector, while providing
          much-needed diversity to the pool of qualified talent;</li>
        <li>supported
          107 Research Fellows pursuing academic research in partner collections; </li>
        <li>hosted
          366 teachers at Teacher Institutes, for teachers learning Native and
          locale-specific ways of life and developing lesson plans and curricula to bring
          those experiences to their students.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The impact of ECHO
        is felt most strongly by those on the ground: teachers who teach what they have
        learned from others; students who develop skills and credentials for the
        cultural workplace and beyond; people of all ages who, opening themselves to
        other traditions, discover their own in the process.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">The pride of the
        people was palpable!&nbsp; The dancers
        in full Native dress, the beating of the drums, the chanting of the singers
        immediately immersed me in this culture and its people. . . . I will be a
        better teacher for having had this experience.&nbsp; I know I will be more patient with the E(nglish) L(anguage)
        L(earner) students and their parents, for I have a different understanding of
        their experience.&nbsp; ( Nancy D. , New
        Bedford teacher/participant in Southcentral Alaska Cultural Institute [ANHC])</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Ideas I have taken
        away from this day were: limiting impact; finding balance; the importance of
        myth, story, and belief; and the elders&rsquo; understanding of their world, in the
        context of the world we all live in today. (Beth B., a Salem, MA middle-school
        teacher and curriculum specialist, during an ANHC Teacher Institute)</p>
      <p>From students:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"> This internship reconnected me
        to my roots and ancestors and inspired me to pursue a career as a researcher
        and historian&rdquo; (Jessica E., Museum Action Corps intern, PEM).</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I learned the
        difference between an easily broken stick (a weak leader) and a house post (a
        strong leader). I&rsquo;m not afraid to speak in front of people. I use all the
        knowledge from my school, my family, and my ancestors, and try to make them
        proud of me.&nbsp; I learned all these
        things from this trip, and I am very grateful. (Destiny M., Hawaiian charter
        school student participant in Multicultural Youth Leadership Conference, ANHC.)</p>
      <p>From other
        participants:&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">It&rsquo;s good to try to
        ikuk (scrape and tan hides), like my aaka (grandmother) used to do (Anonymous
        participant in I&ntilde;upiaguniqput Sivunmuutilugu (Carrying Our I&ntilde;upiaq Ways
        Forward), a workshop of the I&ntilde;upiat History, Language, and Culture Commission,
        NSB).</p>
      <p>ECHO has
        successfully developed culture- and place-based educational approaches firmly
        grounded in national and state standards. The educational future of our nation
        will be written in the language of long distance, public/private, and
        community-based partnerships, for which ECHO programs are nationally important
        models.&nbsp; ECHO creates and tests new
        roles for museums as vital centers for conversations about our culture. By
        basing its lessons in the communities and cultures from which they spring, employing
        a mix of traditional and cutting edge practices and technology, and reaching
        people where they live, ECHO provides education that works. </p>
      <p>Current ECHO
        partners:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alaska Native Heritage Center (ANHC),
          Anchorage, Alaska </li>
        <li>Bishop Museum (BM), Honolulu, Hawai'i</li>
        <li>Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians (MBCI), Philadelphia, Mississippi</li>
        <li>New Bedford ECHO Project (NBEP), New Bedford ,
          Massachusetts</li>
        <li>North Slope Borough (NSB), Barrow, Alaska</li>
        <li>Peabody Essex Museum (PEM), Salem,
          Massachusetts</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Although not
        explicitly stated in the founding legislation, ECHO is also self-evidently a
        partnership of Native and non-Native institutions working together to create
        programming relating to the interaction of Native and non-Native cultures,
        applicable on a national scale. </p>
      <h2>Advantages and Challenges</h2>
      <p>ECHO has certain
        structural advantages. Our partners are located across the country and through
        a wide range of racial, ethnic, educational and economic strata. Our
        institutions&rsquo; in-house capacities and resources include legal advisors;
        researchers in botany, geology, astronomy and arctic <i>and</i> equatorial marine science; educators in both
        museums and classrooms; cultural expertise in both first nations and
        Euro-American traditions; Congressional contacts, including ex-staffers,
        full-time government affairs personnel, and support from our states&rsquo; senators
        and congresspeople; multi-media production capabilities; a publishing house;
        hunters and fishermen; craftspeople; native speakers of dozens of languages;
        and graphic and Web design staffs, along with many, many other specialties. By now
        we have had five years&rsquo; experience in working together on projects such as this
        one. And we have federal funding authorized in law and administered by the
        Department of Education.</p>
      <p>We also have certain built-in challenges. We are
        geographically dispersed, so face-to-face meetings are expensive and hard to
        schedule. Our institutions are of different types with different missions. We
        include in our partnership museums of art, history and science, a Native
        heritage center, a municipality, and a sovereign nation. In age our
        institutions range from 200 years to not yet built, and in financial scope from
        five or six million dollars a year to hundreds of millions. ECHO occupies
        widely different positions within our parent organizations, from a major pillar
        of some institutions to a minor supporting element at others. Political and
        personnel shifts within each parent entity can result in significant,
        occasionally wholesale, turnover in representatives to group meetings or
        discussions, and shifts in institutional priorities for the project. </p>
      <p>Our greatest
        advantage, but also the characteristic most difficult to analyze and
        understand, is our wide range of world views, histories and values. Some of us
        live every day with the consciousness of hundreds of years of undeniable
        oppression, injustice, and even genocide; some have fought to retain a staunch
        independence at extraordinary communal cost of marginalization; some are fully
        immersed in the dominant Euro-American culture with little institutional
        mandate to address social wrongs on a national scale. Generating consensus or
        even mutual comprehension in such a group is not easy, nor always successful.
        Decisions in our group require consensus, not only because traditional Native
        decision processes tend to work in that way, but also because strongly
        divergent impressions of history and reality have to be unwound and understood
        before we can go forward with confidence: too often we find that a voice not
        raised at a meeting masks a fundamental variance in perception or intent, or a
        voice raised too quickly drowned out a viewpoint slower to emerge. And yet,
        inevitably, issues left unexplored emerge later. </p>
      <h2>Aims</h2>
      <p>The present
        investigation surveys ECHO&rsquo;s efforts to present material from culturally
        disparate and geographically dispersed sources representing Native,
        Euro-American and mixed communities and institutions as authors and
        participants in creating content. It centers around our effort to re-create our
        main Web site. The site should do two major things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>provide content produced by ECHO partners,
          whether new or archived, reflecting our awareness, history and commitment to
          cross-cultural understanding and communication</li>
        <li>act as a forum for members of our communities,
          both virtual and actual, to create and present their own cultural
          understanding. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since this is a work
        still very much in progress, this paper will be an examination of history,
        principles and approaches based in our collective experience, rather than a
        final report of results.</p>
      <h1>History Of ECHO Web Projects</h1>
      <p>The Web has been
        central to ECHO&rsquo;s existence and practice from the start. Our geographic
        dispersal makes Internet communication a necessity. Our founding legislation
        requires us to create cultural programming and use &ldquo;modern technology,
        including the Internet, to educate students, their parents and teachers&rdquo; about
        historic and contemporary links between Native and non-Native peoples. Given
        that we are federally-funded, we feel called upon to produce work that can, at
        least potentially, benefit all the people of the United States. Beyond that,
        though, as museum and cultural professionals and human beings, the Web can help
        us establish and strengthen our personal connection with the human substance
        and meaning of the collections and programs we present. </p>
      <h2><b>Memory, History, Archives and Resources</b></h2>
      <p>The partners of ECHO, both as independent cultural institutions and in explicitly collaborative ventures, have created &ndash; and continue to create &ndash; many kinds and levels of digital or &ldquo;digitable&rdquo; content. We have extensive raw video, edited, highly polished video pieces intended for exhibition or educational or cable broadcast settings of performances, interviews and community events. ECHO partners have libraries of raw audio oral histories and language capture, as well as finished audio CDs and commercial-style music and performance recordings Photographic documentation exists in our collections at many levels, including participant snapshots of meetings and events, professional documentation of works of art, commercial-style photography of artists&rsquo; production, formal images of cultural venues and portraits, and scans of thousands upon thousands of historical documentary photographs of people, places and things long vanished. Finally, partners have developed educational texts such as lesson plans, curricula, essays, object descriptions and interpretation, classroom activities and discussion questions at many different levels of sophistication and utility, built on many different classroom or free-choice models, comprising everything from didactic wall labels to a full unit covering many weeks of multi-dimensional, interdisciplinary classroom instruction.</p>
      <p>The question is what to do with all of it? How should we to use it to reach out to our intended audiences in the most effective way, to have the desired impact, and to learn enough about that impact to be able to improve our offerings and delivery systems? Furthermore, how do we steward these collections of meaning, language, image, object, and ceremony in ways that are both respectful and responsible to the creators and their heirs, and to the heirs of the human story written broadly?</p>
      <p>It is a tall order. We have created a variety of sites over the past 5 years to connect to our diverse cultures, communities and histories and make them available through the Web.<br />
        Web Projects</p>
      <h2>Web Projects</h2>
      <p class="caption"><img src="elias.fig4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="400" height="332" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 4: The Home Page of the New Trade Winds project <a
href="http://www.newtradewinds.org/home.html">http://www.newtradewinds.org/home.html</a></p>
      <p><i>New Trade Winds</i> (<a href="http://www.newtradewinds.org/home.html">http://www.newtradewinds.org/home.html</a>) was
        the first Web project to present the ECHO partners as a unified entity. It was
        an ambitious effort to educate the public about the  &ndash; surprisingly substantial
        &ndash; historical connections among the three regions. Engaging Web experiences
        for students and teachers were developed, grounded in (and bounded by) the
        historical narrative. This site has several technical innovations. There is an
        interactive timeline marking the separate but intertwined histories of the
        three regions. There are lesson plans for Elementary, Middle and High school
        grade bands with linked illustrated stories and correlations with state standards
        of ECHO home regions.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="elias.fig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="400" height="250" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 5: The Interactive Trade Map on the New Trade Winds
        project <a href="http://newtradewinds.org/kids/index.html">http://newtradewinds.org/kids/index.html</a></p>
      <p>There is a map-based
        interactive tool that teaches about interactions between regions using historical
        trade routes, with the objects that were traded, now gathered in our
        collections, as teaching aids. <i>New Trade Winds</i> is a strong statement of ECHO&rsquo;s values. It is
        a highly unusual collaboration between three very different kinds of cultural
        organization. More to the point, it holds the promise of a new way of looking
        at history, mindful of and representing multiple viewpoints. </p>

      <p><i>New Trade Winds
        Artists Gallery</i> (http://www.pem.org/ntw/), originally planned as a sub-site of <i>New Trade
        Winds</i>, was very different in
        conception. It was ECHO&rsquo;s first site to rely heavily on the community for
        content, a curated list of links to Native culture bearers, artists, and
        craftspeople in our communities helping to keep cultural skills and knowledge
        alive. The site is still up and running as part of Peabody Essex Museum&rsquo;s Web
        site. It was our first attempt to provide an output channel to Native
        communities. </p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 7: Partners page from Echospace.org <a href="http://echospace.org/">http://echospace.org</a></p>
      <p><i>ECHOspace</i> (<a href="http://echospace.org/">http://echospace.org/</a>) was conceived as a catalog of partner media including video, audio, text, photographs, Web sites and collection databases with widely varying standards and formats, produced by the partners both singly and in collaboration. Development of ECHOspace was driven by our desire to showcase the extraordinary range of these materials: New Trade Winds&rsquo; profile as an integrated educational site with focused content was too limiting. ECHOspace opens the wealth of our storehouses to a broad public and lets them search and use as they like. Although similar in concept to the New Trade Winds Artists Gallery in its clearinghouse nature and neutral tone, all ECHOspace content was created within the partner institutions rather than out in the community. Over time, it has come to act as a public bulletin board of ECHO projects, including schedules of performances, stand-alone curriculum units, and background material on the partnership.</p>

href="http://pem.org/artscape">http://pem.org/artscape</a></p>
      <p><i>Artscape</i> (<a href="http://pem.org/artscape/">http://pem.org/artscape/</a>) is not, strictly
        speaking, an ECHO collaboration, in that it was created by a single institution
        to highlight its own collection. It is nonetheless relevant to the present
        discussion, since it includes two innovations addressing needs most clearly
        voiced, in PEM&rsquo;s experience, by Native museum professionals and communities.
        First, the structure of the database is open, allowing, for example, for
        multiple documents, images, audio or video files to be attached to a single
        object, and allowing for commentary from multiple viewpoints  &ndash; consulting
        curators or cultural experts, for example  &ndash; to be attached to a single object
        record. </p>

      <p>Secondly, the site
        encourages audiences to interact with content, to participate in their own
        education by building personal collections within the museum and the site. In
        its initial realization, the system, for it was more than just a Web site,
        included the capacity for a live visitor to wander the museum, tagging artworks
        with their hand-held audioguide wands. After docking the audioguide and
        entering an e-mail address, the visitor could direct information on the
        selected works home for future reference. Although the handsets didn&rsquo;t survive,
        visitors to the Web site can still select and store a collection of objects to
        share, revisit, or link to. </p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 10: The Home Page of the Hawaii Alive project <a
href="http://hawaiialive.org/">http://hawaiialive.org</a></p>
      <p><i>Hawai&rsquo;i Alive</i> (<a href="http://hawaiialive.org/">http://hawaiialive.org</a>/), another
        institution-specific project, was designed by the Peabody Essex Museum under
        contract to the Bishop Museum with help from WGBH, Boston&rsquo;s PBS television station.
        Bishop Museum then contracted Red58 Communications to continue development of
        the site, bringing it to its current state. Hawai&rsquo;i Alive represents a
        fundamentally novel approach to on-line content, providing images, video,
        historical photographs and educational units and standards through a
        distinctive cultural lens. The architecture of the site presents all didactic
        content, including scientific, historical, and cultural material, through three
        levels corresponding to the traditional Hawaiian spiritual realms: <i>Wao Lani</i>, the heavens; <i>Wao Kanaka</i>, the earth; and <i>Kai Akea</i>, the sea. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="elias.fig11.jpg" alt="Figure 11" width="400" height="328" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 11: Detail Page of the Hawaii Alive project <a
href="http://hawaiialive.org/">http://hawaiialive.org</a></p>
      <p>Given that the State
        of Hawai&rsquo;i educational standards require much of this content to be taught in
        K-12 classrooms, the site is able to incorporate correlations to Hawai&rsquo;i state
        educational standards for every aspect of site content, while presenting a
        culturally sound perspective on the material. During the development of Hawai&rsquo;i
        Alive, focus groups of Native and non-Native Hawaiian teachers were convened.
        They worked with a prototype and told us how the site responded to actual
        classroom needs. The project was validated by the teachers, who noted that up
        to that point there had been no authoritative information on Hawaiian culture
        on the Web. The Bishop Museum, with the world&rsquo;s foremost collection of Hawaiian
        material and traditions, is well positioned to supply that need, formerly met
        by the community themselves through Wikipedia.</p>
      <p>This project also
        showed us the limitations of expert technical consultants with projects
        incorporating Native themes and outlook. WGBH provided videography and editing
        services to the partnership, but the results were mixed. Some material had to
        be reworked or even abandoned, due to an organizational culture unused to the
        process of working with Native cultural and, indeed, sacred content. As we have
        often found in our collaborations, schedules and timelines that do not allow
        sufficient time for consultation often create rather than solve problems. The
        assumptions of Euro-American professionals may not correspond to the reality
        experienced by people in the community, and substantial cultural assimilation
        and education of the specialists may be necessary. </p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 12: The Learning From The People project on WGBH's
        Teachers Domain Web site <a href="http://teachersdomain.org/echo">http://teachersdomain.org/echo</a></p>
      <p><i>Learning from the
        People </i>(http://www.teachersdomain.org/echo),
        our most recent effort, was commissioned from WGBH as a special collection
        under their classroom resource Web site, <i>Teachers&rsquo; Domain</i>. It was created over the course of some eight
        weeks, and went live in February of 2007. The site is a focused collection of
        13 video and interactive resources drawn from ECHO partner raw materials, with
        background essays, discussion questions and correlation to state standards, all
        of which are gathered into five lesson plans. It is a focused application
        designed specifically for use in the classroom.</p>
      <p>The process of
        construction worked well and quickly. WGBH hired editors, writers, content
        specialists in education, and project management. The ECHO partnership
        delegated authority for contracts and finance, educational content, and
        production to three ECHO staffers. Each institution designated a point person
        to manage the in-house process for approvals and for all other contact with
        WGBH. As the partners fed content ideas and raw materials to the production
        team at WGBH, the team fed us back drafts of background essays and lesson
        plans. While they wrestled with our raw resources, we edited and re-wrote their
        essays, clarifying meanings or concepts and pointing out areas where they
        inadvertently veered into a problematic interpretation of a sensitive topic or
        event. </p>
      <p>Since ECHO is
        literally spread out halfway across the world, the WGBH team posted draft video
        and interactives on an ftp site for approval. Using Teachers&rsquo; Domain guidelines
        together with ECHO partner content ideas, WGBH created &ldquo;assets&rdquo;, in the form of
        3-5 minute videos or self-teaching, interactive elements based on 10 to 12
        still photographs. They wrote 500-word background essays on each asset, and
        sets of discussion questions to use with the essays. A single asset, together
        with its essay and questions, comprises a completed &ldquo;resource&rdquo;. Ultimately they
        created 13 integrated resources and five lesson plans supported and illustrated
        by those resources at appropriate places.</p>

      <p>One of <i>Teachers&rsquo;
        Domain&rsquo;s</i> most important
        innovations is the development of a proprietary standards database capable of
        correlating lesson plans with national and state standards in science and math
        for the 50 US states. Visitors to the site enter a home address on log-in. WGBH
        software reads the home state, and generates a real-time set of correlations
        based on comparison of terms from resource essay texts to a database of state
        standards. </p>
      <p>Our Web sites have
        ranged up and down the &ldquo;Knowledge Hierarchy&rdquo; (Sharma, 2004) from providing
        access to data for anyone who might want it, to providing detailed
        interpretation of events and ideas correlated with state frameworks to impart
        specific knowledge. They have also ranged from simple collections of community
        member links, to sites on which we created and controlled all content. In
        planning for a new Web presence for the ECHO project, we hope to come closer
        than we have in the past to finding a balance among all of these, providing
        content, but also allowing access for others to develop content as well. We
        hope to use the authority of our museums, as Australian museologist Tony
        Bennett proposes in <i>The Birth of the Museum,</i> not so much to &ldquo;claim&hellip;the status of
        knowledge&rdquo;, but to become an organization &ldquo;whose function is to assist groups
        outside the museum to use its resources to make authored statements within it&rdquo;
        (Bennett, 1995: 104), to connect us with our audiences and permit us to work
        together to tell the stories our collections and communities contain. </p>
      <h1>Program For A Unified ECHO Voice</h1>
      <p>To begin to create
        our new site, we have to understand what we want to get out of it. When we
        started, we didn&rsquo;t yet know to whom we were speaking.&nbsp; After five years, much of the guesswork is behind us. We
        have some history, we can see the shape of the collaboration, and we have
        greater unity about our ideals, values and goals. We can also begin to imagine
        and understand our natural audiences, rather than just making a place to hang
        our stuff. </p>
      <h2>Goals For A New Site</h2>
      <p>There are three
        chief goals for the new site. </p>
      <p>1.&nbsp; First, the site should provide a
        unified voice for the ECHO collaboration. Throughout our projects, both on and
        off the Web, there are good ideas, materials and resources that we want to use.
        No single ECHO site captures the range and essence of the partnership. We hope
        to facilitate new discoveries and uses of our collections by bringing our
        resources under one roof. Previous ECHO sites have been created as discrete
        entities, focused and bounded by their initial concept. This site should be
        able to grow, to expand as people use it, it should be accessible to our Web
        developers and museum staff, to change and update as necessary, and it should
        be capable of absorbing what we create together. We have certain content pieces
        (the 13 resources and 5 lesson plans from Learning from the People, the map and
        timeline interactives from New Trade Winds, and many lessons and resources on
        Hawai&rsquo;i Alive, for example) that do not yet coexist. We need to construct an
        architecture defined by a set of ideas that can be populated by what we have
        already, and what we create in collaboration with our communities. In essence,
        this reconstruction project is about organization and structure rather than
        content. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="elias.fig14.jpg" alt="Figure 14" width="400" height="503" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 14: User Matrix schematic for the echospace.org
        redesign</p>
      <p>But there are other
        constituencies than ourselves. </p>
      <p>2.&nbsp; The second goal for the site is to
        reach into our communities, not only to teach, but also to provide them with
        tools to express themselves directly, to participate with us in creating the
        content of the site. We understand that the major audiences of ECHO are K-12
        teachers and their students; parents and children; Native communities; museum
        audiences/lifelong learners; and culturally inquisitive young adults. Having
        identified these audience groups permits us to envision the capabilities they
        need, based on the experience of our collective institutions. It also permits
        us to conceive the site to respond to their wishes and to offer them tools they
        will use. Characteristics of these groups define the capacities we have to
        build and the pathways we can use to approach them. Ultimately it is a matter
        of approaching them as equals and listening to what they tell us. </p>
      <p>Through our
        experiences within the partnership we have learned that to engage communities
        successfully we must respect their traditions, integrity, and values.
        Communities may not be willing to settle for externally produced information -
        such as lesson plans and videos  &ndash; because of the values and assumptions that
        come with them. To reach and effectively serve such communities, it may be more
        important to provide tools than knowledge, because knowledge originating
        outside the community is necessarily filtered through outsiders&rsquo; cultural
        assumptions. </p>
      <p>Museums, in general,
        share relatively few characteristics with Native communities. One of those
        shared characteristics, though, is an attachment&nbsp;  &ndash; a commitment&nbsp;  &ndash; to &ldquo;place&rdquo; and its corollary &ldquo;presence&rdquo;. Many consider that teaching
        through the application of Native knowledge, and place &ndash; and culture-based
        education, keep Native students involved with school longer and produce better
        outcomes. That is justification enough to create tools to teach in that mode.
        It is our intuition, though, that if we provide or enable others to create
        lessons based in locales such as museum collections and Native traditional
        communities,&nbsp; they will be
        meaningful  &ndash; to say nothing of exciting  &ndash; not only to the students in those
        locales, but also to many kinds of students in many parts of the country. </p>
      <p>It is our assertion
        in the design of this site that teachers, students and parents will find value
        in the expression of local and communal values and stories, that State and
        Federal curriculum standards are a fact of life, but that those standards can
        provide a common set of ideas and facts with which to negotiate the wider world
        if they can be integrated with the language of the community. It is also our
        expectation that, if we build a set of capabilities and opportunities, we will
        be able to observe how the tools are used and adapt and improve the offerings
        as we learn more about our audiences. </p>
      <p>A main concern, then
         &ndash; if community participation in content development is to be central  &ndash; is
        access. The new ECHO site should be easy to understand and use, should allow
        visitors to store self-generated content of a variety of types, and should
        protect intellectual property rights of both content creators and those who use
        content to learn and to teach.</p>
      <p>Tony Bennett
        observes that museums currently feel themselves torn between the entertainment
        and educational industries, towards both of which the visitor is essentially
        passive. He supposes the public has a &ldquo;right to make active use of museum
        resources rather than an entitlement to be either entertained or instructed&rdquo;
        (Bennett 1995: 105).</p>
      <p><span class="BodyTextChar">3.&nbsp; The third goal of the site, based on
        our responsibilities as federal grant recipients, museum professionals and
        human beings, is to produce a site that is applicable across the country. None
        of the audiences we seek are defined by geography, so our efforts to serve our
        audience should be as broad as possible. </span></p>
      <p><span class="BodyTextChar">In
        order to be nationally relevant, we have to make the site searchable, usable on
        a wide variety of machines, and easy to use with little training; we must pay
        attention, after it is launched, to linking with other sites, notifying
        bloggers in the education space, and generally marketing the site to the
        audiences we seek. </span>By
        working with our partners at the Dept of Education, we can find many outlets
        within Native American educational communities. Using a combination of direct
        outreach to visitors, development of links with targeted teacher and cultural
        Web sites, a PR push to bloggers with interests similar to ours, purchase of a
        limited selection of search words on the major engines, and presentations and
        workshops such as this one, we will spread the information sufficiently widely
        to begin to see visitor-to-visitor communication picking up and propelling us
        into communities where we do not have other access.</p>
      <p><span class="BodyTextChar">Of
        the tasks required for national relevance, making the site searchable raises
        issues that are politically and technically complicated. Our experience with
        teachers showed that they searched for classroom resources in ways we did not
        expect. </span>The anecdotal
        evidence given us by the Hawaiian focus groups, among others, indicates that
        teachers only rarely download and use complete lesson plans. Instead, they use
        plans as keyword clouds to build queries that give them results that include
        the sites they want. This tells us we should treat all the text on the site as
        keyword clouds, and possibly (if the observation proves to be generalizable)
        rely less on lesson plans and more on tagging as a way to communicate content
        to visitors. </p>
      <p>Another aspect of
        the complexity of searching involves the 50 state and national educational curriculum
        standards. In addition to searching by lesson plan words, teachers tell us they
        frequently search for classroom resources through querying the actual standards
        they have to fulfill. The imposition of state standards in education is
        controversial. Native, poor, and otherwise underserved populations have
        suffered, in relative terms, under centrally imposed concepts of knowledge.
        Educational strategies that acknowledge and celebrate diverse models of
        learning are at a disadvantage in the present system. The potential of
        standards, though, lies in the fact of their universality: almost all teachers
        have had to learn them, and, as such, they begin to provide a &ldquo;universal
        language.&rdquo; If we can provide tools to create lessons locally, then post them on
        the Web correlated with the 50 state standards, teachers all over the country
        will be able to search quickly and easily among lessons that may incorporate
        local knowledge that, while far from their locus, may well resonate with and
        influence the behavior of their students. </p>
      <p>Teachers&rsquo; Domain&rsquo;s
        database system works well for the science and math standards, for which GBH
        has built complete databases, but is not (yet) effective in the Social Studies
        or Language and Literacy disciplines, which, of course, are central to our
        efforts. Since it is proprietary, it is not possible to migrate the
        correlations along with the resources and lesson plans. There are other
        vendors, however, who can provide correlations. </p>
      <p>Teachers&rsquo; Domain is
        not owned by ECHO.&nbsp; This makes it
        difficult for us to link these resources to other potentially valuable partners
        such as NEH&rsquo;s <i>EdSiteMent</i> teacher Web site, a resource that is focused on, and heavily used in, the
        disciplines of Culture, Arts, History and Language &amp; Literacy. While <i>Teachers&rsquo;
        Domain</i> is fairly widely used,
        its specialty lies in the sciences. We need to be able to share our site easily
        with other providers, and we need a cultural context.</p>
      <h1>How To Realize Those Goals</h1>
      <p class="caption"><img src="elias.fig15.jpg" alt="Figure 15" width="400" height="477" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 15: Site Architecture schematic for the echospace.org
        redesign</p>
      <p>The approach we have
        chosen to achieve these goals is to incorporate our partner material as a kind
        of example, or &ldquo;style guide&rdquo;, to seed the culture of the site. To this material
        we will add open source and free Web applications which we will continue to
        incorporate and update as they develop and improve. This combination will
        enable our community collaborators to develop, store and index their own
        materials, drawing on our examples to the extent they are useful. We are making
        an assumption that&nbsp; providing
        access to tools and information about how to use them is as valuable as
        providing finished materials, in accomplishing the cultural and educational
        goals of the site. By making high quality technology available and easy to use,
        we can encourage people to develop their own culturally-based educational
        materials, tailored to their situation but applicable across the country. It is
        inevitable, if they achieve that much, that they will be resourceful and
        engaged citizens of the Web. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="elias.fig16.jpg" alt="Figure 16" width="400" height="276" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 16: Site Architecture schematic for the echospace.org
        redesign</p>
      <p>The proposed
        structure of ECHO&rsquo;s new site is outlined on the attached illustration. The main
        page will identify the partners and the project, and offer access to several
        kinds of experience, here titled <i>ECHO</i>, <i>Classroom</i>, <i>Share</i>, and <i>Tools &amp; Materials</i>. </p>
      <p><i>ECHO</i> will contain a variety of content elements
        describing the program, the partners and the partner regions. It will
        incorporate a map of the partners, to which visitors can add their own
        locations. It will include a sub-site illustrating and describing the kinds of
        cultural transformation we aim for: a young man&rsquo;s photograph with a bowl from
        our collection that changed his life, with his narrative; another with audio from
        a grandmother and grandson telling a story. It will also provide a textual and
        photographic document of the nature, character and accomplishments of ECHO. </p>
      <p><i>Classroom</i> will incorporate finished ECHO lesson plans
        with links to video, audio, interactive and text resources, along with
        correlations to the state and national educational standards. The lesson plans
        will be grade banded and relatively brief, encompassing not more than 5 class
        meetings. Each resource will have a media component, a background essay and
        discussion questions. The media components will be approximately 3-5 minutes
        long, the essays not more than 500 words. </p>
      <p><i>Share</i> is a space for community members. They can
        create a virtual classroom to post students&rsquo; work, they can post their own
        lesson plans to share among themselves, there will be chat space available
        which may ultimately develop into several distinct spaces (for teachers, Native
        communities, home schoolers, etc.), and, in time, a series of themed blogs by
        leaders in the various communities of which ECHO is a part: Native education,
        cultural knowledge, education policy, Native arts, and others. </p>
      <p><i>Tools &amp;
        Materials</i> will be the media
        database capable of indexing images, text, video, audio, and Web tools to
        manipulate and store them, and to link them with the lesson plans on <i>Classroom</i> and <i>Share</i>. The database will be a series of links out to public media
        storage and retrieval sites such as Flick-r, YouTube, or i-Tunes, as well as
        textual descriptions and correlations to state standards. It will also
        incorporate text, video and interactive instructional materials showing how to
        store, access and use elements on the site, including suggestions derived from
        ECHO experience on creating successful resources for the site. </p>
      <p>In addition to these
        major sub-sites, each page of the site will incorporate a set of footer links
        to communicate with ECHO, to navigate the site, and to tag site elements with
        user tags, allowing users to create their own navigation and retrieval systems. </p>
      <p>Incorporating
        communities in the site is a commitment. It not only requires keeping the site
        constantly updated and monitored, but also requires a robust program evaluation
        and improvement scheme. We will build in a series of evaluation tools based on
        identified goals for the project, as well as Web site statistics of visitation
        and usage. These tools will include an avatar or game style interface that will
        appear at specific locations to inquire about visitor experience and an e-mail
        survey using addresses provided at log-in (required for up- or down-loads).</p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>ECHO is a
        partnership spread across continents and oceans, but the most significant yet
        rewarding distances we travel as we meet and plan programs and projects are
        those across cultures. Museums are often in the position of representing
        cultures they may not, within their own staffs, share. In this partnership, and
        from the perspective of Peabody Essex Museum, we have the luxury of knowing the
        people whose works we steward. We can build on these relationships to wrap the
        objects in our collections in a mantle of context, spirit and meaning. As we
        move forward with the re-construction of our main Web presence, our
        partnerships with Native people and communities bring our efforts down to
        earth. In however a fragmentary and limited way, we have devised this site in
        communication with those who will use it. </p>
      <p>We were faced with
        several challenges, common to most museum sites. Who is our core audience? What
        boundaries can circumscribe the content we provide so as not to overtax our
        productive capacity? (We cannot, for example, digitize and present the 800,000+
        objects in Peabody Essex Museum&rsquo;s collections.) How can we evaluate our efforts
        effectively to help us improve their focus? What do we do with the hundreds of
        hours of videotape, thousands of digital photographs, and dozens of curriculum
        units, lesson plans, and activities we have generated over time? Most
        importantly, perhaps, what can we do that will be of the greatest benefit to
        the greatest number of the members of our audience, on whom we place the
        highest priority? There are a string of judgments called for here, establishing
        hierarchies of benefits, and audiences, and quality of impact or access. To
        make those judgments carefully, in full collaboration with the communities we
        seek to serve, will require deftness, balance, sensitivity and good ears.
        Without shared value systems, little can be accomplished. The task is to agree
        upon the values that drive us, the audiences we serve, and the tools we possess
        to move them. The challenge, posed by Bennett, is to get the levers of the
        museum machinery into the hands of those whose cultures we have guarded so
        jealously. </p>
