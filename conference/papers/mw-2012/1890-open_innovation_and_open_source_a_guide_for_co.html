<h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
<p class="AbstractText">There are clear advantages to working in collaboration with outside partners when developing exhibits and museum content. The actual structure of these collaborations can take many forms. This report outlines approaches to engaging with outside talent on three levels of commitment<strong> </strong>(Casual Contribution, Mentored Development, and Expert Networks) as may be required for different projects. Categories of methods for open innovation can be applied to create a manageable structure for the contributions<strong> </strong>(Orchestra, Creative Bazaar, Jam Session, and Mod Station models). A range of<strong> </strong>stages of completion,<strong> </strong>from ideas to completed content, can be expected from such collaboration efforts. Last, some findings from The Tech Virtual project are described.</p>
<p class="keywords">Keywords: co-creation, collaboration, design, participation,prototyping, open source</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p class="Textbody">There are many options for approaching collaboration with external groups of contributors on creative projects. In many cases, people can collaborate without physical meetings, by using Internet-based exchanges such as forums, online video chats, and even immersive virtual worlds. Collaborative projects that use in-person working sessions can also be augmented with online documentation, making local work accessible to a much wider group.</p>
<p class="Textbody">The Tech Virtual project launched in late 2007 with the goal of applying the latest in open, online collaboration methods and tools to the creation of museum content. It is composed of an online platform (a website with user-generated content) and three-dimensional modeling resources that are located in an online virtual world prototyping space. The project was funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and is hosted by The Tech Museum in San Jose, California. So far the project has incorporated the formal participation of more than twenty institutions and 1,200 individual site members, who have generated more than 400 exhibit designs and video projects. In January 2012 the project was expanded and renamed The Tech Open Source (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org</a>).</p>
<h3>Navigating a forest of opportunities</h3>
<p class="Textbody">Although there are clear benefits for creative projects from external input and collaborations, the methods of proceeding through these exercises can vary widely. Many levels can be navigated, from the simplest user feedback to deeper partnerships over longer time periods. New online tools arise daily and create opportunities to exchange ideas and designs in novel ways. Project leaders are often in the position of needing to develop expertise with these new tools while simultaneously learning how to create a structure for the collaborative relationships.</p>
<h3>Core purpose</h3>
<p class="Textbody">The main purpose of open innovation is to provide a conduit through which new ideas can come into the institution from outside, in a structured way.&nbsp; These new ideas and influences can come from unexpected sources.&nbsp; An open approach can also become a valuable community-building process, bringing experts, enthusiasts, and staff together around an exhibition or topic.</p>
<p class="Textbody">Overall, the project has sought to improve the level of sharing and collaboration among science and technology centers. In an industry that is geographically distributed, exhibitions in development at one institution are not visible to others without physical travel.&nbsp; The efficiencies of posting in-progress work online then become obvious.</p>
<p class="Textbody">Many exhibit productions are undertaken without the benefit of having any “prior art” knowledge of in-progress or even completed projects at other institutions. Knowledge of exploratory work and even half-formed ideas can be of immense value in these situations.</p>
<p class="Textbody">Our project seeks to improve the well-known situation in which institutions are working in their own local silos, “reinventing the wheel” with each new exhibit project.&nbsp; A collaborative forum for the field invigorates the pace of innovation and the level of competition by exposing this previously opaque or seemingly irrelevant information. In addition, it provides an open venue for outside input and discussion that was not previously available.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Terms used in The Tech Open Source</em></strong></h3>
<p class="Textbody">Guided by similar open-source working methods (like those used in software development, for example), the project is structured around a few key components and concepts.</p>
<h4><strong>Open Innovation</strong></h4>
<p class="Textbody">Open innovation can be defined as “a means of production for innovation” (Castro, 2010) and is generally achieved by opening up the organization to allow the contribution of new ideas from outside contributors toward a product or goal.</p>
<h4><strong>Open Source</strong></h4>
<p class="Textbody">Open source in the context of this project refers to methods of collaborating with outside participants using online materials. Open source projects may start with or without a base of source material. Open source projects do not necessarily use open source software and may still involve intellectual property.</p>
<h3><strong>Request</strong></h3>
<p class="Textbody">A request is an online posting of an open opportunity to contribute. It is similar to a design brief or a request for proposal. It contains a title, a one-line “big idea,” a description, and beginning and end dates. This approach traces its roots to the open-source software-development method of using a “Request for Comments,” which originated in the very earliest days of the development of the Internet (Wikipedia, 2012).</p>
<h4><strong>Project</strong></h4>
<p class="Textbody">A project is a reply to a request. It too is composed of a title, a “big idea,” and a text description. A project can be as simple as a text description of an idea, or it can be an elaborate effort that evolves over the life of the Request.</p>
<h2>2. Other Approaches to Open Collaboration and Open Source</h2>
<h3>Visitor participation and crowdsourcing</h3>
<p class="Textbody">The Tech Open Source differs from other open efforts that have appeared in the field, in that it is a forum specifically for design work in progress.&nbsp; This should be considered separately from the range of participatory practices where visitor participation is a primary goal (Brown and Novak-Leonard, 2011).&nbsp; The approach also differs from most “crowdsourcing” methods, in which defined tasks are distributed across a group of individuals to complete. In purely crowd-sourced projects, the contributed work is essential to the completion of the product, and contributors often participate without full information about, or interest in, the end product that is being produced. The purpose of this project’s open source approach is to facilitate collaboration during the ideation and planning stages.</p>
<h3>Other online venues</h3>
<p class="Textbody">In contrast, Exhibit Files (<a href="http://www.exhibitfiles.org/">http://www.exhibitfiles.org</a>) is a forum for exhibit reviews and case studies of fully completed exhibits. Open Exhibits (<a href="http://www.openexhibits.org/">http://www.openexhibits.org</a>) focuses on software development, using a modular approach with customizable and interoperable templates, user-interface elements, and utilities. Exhibit Commons, a project by Liberty Science Center, sought to provide ways for visitors to “change exhibits using creative problem solving,” and speculated that this could lead to a “participatory approach to exhibition development” (Labar, 2006). The Museum Open Source Code and Repository (MOSCAR) was envisioned as a resource hub for museum-exhibit–related software projects but not necessarily physical exhibits (Lakhani and Moose, 2009). Numerous institutions also have their own individual open source projects.</p>
<h3>In-person participation and co-creation</h3>
<p class="Textbody">Other approaches for in-person, local participation in developing content have previously been explored. Museum administrator and author Nina Simon describes the structure of participation and its potential for visitor involvement in detail in <em>The Participatory Museum </em>(Simon, 2010). She traces the origins of participatory projects to the Public Participation in Scientific Research project undertaken by the Center for Advancement of Informal Science Education (CAISE) (Bonney et al., 2009). The model described by the CAISE project and Simon classify participation in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>§Contributory, in which participants collect samples or data</li>
<li>§Collaborative, in which visitors actively shape the exhibition</li>
<li>§Co-Creation, in which participants and the institution work together on all aspects of the project, and community interest may define the goals of the project</li>
<li>§Hosted, in which an institution hosts programs developed completely by outside groups.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Textbody">Generally, The Tech Virtual program did not seek to involve participation from in-person visitors at physical building locations. Instead, it connected to contributors found through external online networks and groups with their own diverse interests outside the institution. The approaches cited above focus on cultivating ownership by a local community of participants. In the CAISE framework, Requests generated under The Tech Virtual would generally fall into the category “Contributory,” because the direction, theme, and parameters of the participation are all predetermined by the institution staff, not visitors or outside groups.</p>
<p class="Textbody">In The Tech Virtual program, although the outside contributions can influence the overall development somewhat, the call for collaboration specifies fairly rigid, predetermined goals for the outcomes. Both of these approaches were successfully combined in two stages during the Expolab program in 2009 (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/expolab">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/expolab</a>); they are described in detail in “Engaging Users in Science and Technology Exhibition Codesign Online and Offline” (Lapuente and Sanguesa, 2010a).</p>
<h2>3. Structures for collaboration</h2>
<p class="Textbody">In undertaking these collaborative projects, we used a number of approaches. These fell into three general categories defined by the levels of commitment expected from collaborators. Collaborators participated at deepening levels of commitment, expertise, and responsibility. These ranges are guidelines and are not exclusive of one another. In any given project, a set of individual collaborators may fall into different categories, depending on their time allotment and level of involvement.</p>

<h3>Casual Contribution level</h3>
<p class="Textbody">In a Casual Contribution scenario, individual collaborators are asked to give input in the form of ideas, which may often be expressed in a few sentences or less. This method of gaining input leads to divergent paths, and very unexpected new ideas often arise. These can invigorate the creative process, as the proposed ideas may be very different from what an “expert” would bring to the table. This widening field of ideas is one of the main reasons for opening up to contributors in this way. Casual participatory projects can often be done very simply, using online forms or email for input. Contributors wishing to do more sophisticated projects are encouraged to develop them further.</p>

<p class="Textbody">In the “Exhibits About Microchips” request that was open from mid-2009 to early 2010 (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/exhibits-about-microchips">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/exhibits-about-microchips</a>), the majority of the entries in response to the request were submitted by text input only. Very few, if any, of the contributions evolved over time. A few basic concept illustrations were contributed, but largely, the staff gave little feedback about their relevance or how they would be implemented.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="Default" style="text-align: center;"><strong>&nbsp;<img src="../../files/ketner-2012-fig1.jpg" border="0" width="500" height="300" /></strong></p>
<p class="Default" style="text-align: center;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Figure 1: Sketch for “Microchips in the World” Project, an interesting concept that was not evolved after its initial proposal</span></p>
<p class="Textbody">The physical exhibits that were eventually produced were only lightly influenced by the open process. Some very detailed projects were created for the Microchips Request, but the majority are classified here as Casual Contributions because they generally did not evolve beyond their very first descriptions. This limitation was partly due to the minimal involvement of exhibition staff with the outside contributors. The casual level, then, may also be defined by the level of commitment available from internal staff.</p>
<h3>Mentored Development level</h3>
<p class="Textbody">In a Mentored Development scenario, a group of interested participants develop their own projects over a set period of time. Staff members make a large time investment to mentor the projects from draft stages to more completed products. This approach was used for the Expolab (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/expolab">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/expolab</a>) and Places of Invention (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/places-invention">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/places-invention</a>) Requests. During this process, the request (or a detailed design brief) serves as a guiding document for the open-source developers from beginning to end. As in an industrial product-design process, the organizers hold weekly design reviews, using online tools such as comments on individual Project web pages or real-time meetings in a virtual world. The participants’ work is reviewed and steered to best answer the needs of the design brief. It is crucial that the institutional staff attend to the stages of the process, including the design meetings themselves, to understand and guide the details of the concepts in development.</p>
<p class="Textbody">Eventually, ideas are narrowed down, and off-course projects are refined or eliminated from consideration. Resulting projects that answer the design brief are documented by the institution’s designers to produce design documents for production.</p>
<p class="Textbody">The method is time consuming. As a result, it can produce more refined ideas, as opposed to one-offs or highly personal visions. A staff member or professional consultant is needed to lead the contributors in a supportive and instructive way during the design process. Fabrication generally still requires additional interpretation by &nbsp;production staff.</p>

<p class="Textbody">In the Expolab project, which was open during the first quarter of 2010, weekly design reviews were used to refine and develop contributed projects. This approach yielded a higher ratio of feasible solutions per contributed project than the Casual approach. The overall themes of Expolab were formed in in-person participatory sessions held at the institution’s physical location before the online call for contributions.</p>

<p class="Default" style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Figure 2</em>: “Connections,” an exhibit produced for the Expolab Request, showing virtual model (top) and production diagrams (bottom)</strong></p>
<p class="Textbody">The definitive factor in the success of the mentored approach lies in the group collaboration and creative process that results from the weekly review sessions. The participating designers and staff interact over a period of many hours to produce the resulting concepts, which may then be moved forward for production. Because of changes in institutional plans, the Expolab exhibition was not produced as physical exhibits. We took steps to begin software production for the exhibits using yet another set of external communities, and the exhibit plans remain available should there be future interest in their production (Lapuente and Sanguesa, 2010b).</p>
<h4><strong>Expert networks level</strong></h4>
<p class="Textbody">For some situations, it may be desirable to connect directly with a group of experts skilled in creating specific content. For example, communities of videographers were contacted for contributions to video contests. Similarly, researchers and pioneers in augmented reality were contacted for an exhibition of emerging interfaces. In each case, we sought expert contributors to provide nearly fully formed, modular portions of an exhibition.</p>

<p class="Textbody">An example of this method is found in “The Tech Test Zone 2011” Request, which was open for nearly six months during 2011 (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/tech-test-zone-2011">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/tech-test-zone-2011</a>). For this exhibition, Expert Networks were contacted to collaboratively construct exhibits featuring emerging technology, based on research or product prototypes. Generally, the expert contributors collaborated on the production of the exhibits through extensive contact with the institution’s engineers and fabricators.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p class="Textbody">Through this process, entirely new configurations of the contributed projects were generated. For example, a new shape for the Digital Foam interactive was produced (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/projects/digital-foam">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/projects/digital-foam</a>), as well as an improved, museum-quality model for the Pixel handheld “viewer” units (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/projects/pixel">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/projects/pixel</a>). This approach had the highest ratio of number of participants per completed exhibit of the three types.</p>
<p class="Default">Giving structure to open contributions</p>
<p class="Textbody">After determining a level of commitment to solicit, managers of collaborative projects need to determine what type of structure will best allow the contributions to be accepted and integrated. A framework is provided in <em>The Global Brain,</em> by Satish Nambisan and Mohanbir Sawhney (2007). We found this structure extremely useful in defining the parameters of an open Request.</p>

<p class="FreeFormC"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Table 5: Nambisan and Sawhney’s models for innovation</span></p>
<p class="Textbody">The grid above is for use in outlining the parameters of an open-innovation or open-source project. “Network” as used in this example refers to the extended network of creative participants; it may be controlled or steered centrally by one institution or diffused across several.</p>
<p class="Textbody">Does the request call for participants to explore and create ideas across a wide field of emergent ideas, or should they contribute more defined and immediately “usable” projects? Is the potential for new ideas to shape the parts of the exhibition wide open, or is there a focus on practical units within a defined whole? These two questions define the range of contribution that is requested and the types of innovations that are invited.</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Orchestra model</span></h4>
<p class="Textbody">In the Orchestra model, contributors are expected to contribute discrete units of content or ideas, which are then combined to construct a complete exhibition. Examples include The Tech Test Zone 2011 (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/tech-test-zone-2011">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/tech-test-zone-2011</a>), in which exhibit content falling under a distinct description (emerging interactive technology) was placed in defined spaces with a common theme. The Microchip Clips video contest (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/microchip-clips">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/microchip-clips</a>) and the Science of the City Video Contest (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/science-city-video-contest">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/science-city-video-contest</a>) also fit under this model.</p>

<h4><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">The App Store or Creative Bazaar model</span></h4>
<p class="Textbody">In the App Store or Creative Bazaar model, contributors are invited to contribute within a wider theme, with fewer restrictions than in the Orchestra model. There is less restriction on exhibit concepts, interaction, and content. Examples of this model include Expolab (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/expolab">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/expolab</a>) and The Tech Awards 2008 (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/tech-awards-2008">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/tech-awards-2008</a>), in which contributors were free to choose from a number of themes for exhibits within a single exhibition.</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Jam Session model</span></h4>
<p class="Textbody">The Jam Session model is the most exploratory model, allowing for more emergent and unexpected ideas. Examples of this type of contribution structure include Places of Invention (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/places-invention">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/places-invention</a>), Water (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/water">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/water</a>), and The Tech Virtual Test Zone 2008 (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/tech-virtual-test-zone-exhibits">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/tech-virtual-test-zone-exhibits</a>), which was arranged around creating exhibits involving art, film, and music.</p>

<h4><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Mod Station model</span></h4>
<p class="Textbody">The Mod (or modification) Station model refers to open projects in which participants can modify existing content sitting atop a basic foundation, as is common in open-source video games. In this example, contributors create within a defined interaction mechanism or other format. Examples of this model include Monopoly-based board games that are customized for various cities or topics. None of the Requests run on The Tech Open Source thus far have fit this model precisely, but we plan to use it in the future.</p>
<p class="Heading3AA">Resulting stages of completion</p>
<p class="Textbody">The results of an open innovation approach using open-source methods generally falls between the input level derived from focus groups and that produced by contracted, hired firms through a traditional request for proposal (RFP). When first approaching any project, content developers should consider the actual results desired from the process described above. A general framework for these contributions can be based on the participants’ time and ability to contribute. In producing exhibit content, the scale of completion can include ideas and brainstorming, detailed plans, and content.</p>

<p class="TableNormalParagraph"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Table 6: Levels of completion   that can be expected</span></p>
<p class="Default">One should not expect that open-innovation and open-source   methods will result in directly usable ideas or content. The motivation for   the approach should be based on obtaining new insight and fresh perspectives   that could not be generated within the constraints of a single institution’s   internal resources. One should expect that the products of open-innovation   and open-source methods will nearly always require modification for actual   installation as museum exhibits or content.</p>
<h2>4. Results and outcomes</h2>
<p class="Heading3AA">Findings   and considerations for using open innovation and open source</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recruiting of contributors is essential</span></h3>
<p class="Textbody">Open-source projects do not always attract contributors.   This is a factor inherent in the model. Therefore, the hosting institution   should generally expect to supply some basis or core of the “source” material   that is to be “open.” This process starts with a thorough and thought-out request   (the design brief); it can be even more meaningful to the industry if staff   members post their concepts and in-progress ideas for a given exhibition.</p>
<p class="Textbody">To truly leverage the benefits, content developers will   have to actively approach communities and individuals who may have a vested   interest in contributing. One must consider who can contribute (the expected   level of commitment) and what form of contribution (the model) to achieve the   results (ranges of completion) is expected. Failure to define these   parameters may lead to disappointment or confusion in the open approach.</p>
<h3><strong>A program leader is   required</strong></h3>
<p class="Textbody">Achieving results from open innovation requires dedicated   attention from a project staff member with expertise in managing   correspondence among the contributors. This person can be called a community manager,   developer program director, or other title. He or she is the point of contact   for the community of developers and participates in all aspects of the   program. The composition of the request can be particularly daunting. Nearly   all the disappointments with open-source results occurred because   insufficient time was allotted by the participating institutions. Without   staff time committed to the process, there is little chance that an open-source,   open-innovation project will produce any meaningful result.</p>
<h3><strong>Last-mile fabrication</strong></h3>
<p class="Textbody">Every idea, no matter how well thought out, will require   extensive interpretation to become a physical museum exhibit. Last-minute, onsite   construction details can be impossible to predict. Organizers should expect   to make modifications when using an open-source approach, as contributors may   have relatively little information about the physical space itself. Ideas   obtained by open approaches should not be discounted if they appear off course;   rather, they should be modified and mentored to achieve more fitting   products.</p>
<h3><strong>Open development   advances competition</strong></h3>
<p class="Default">Open development advances the overall atmosphere of   competition by providing a much wider palette of ideas from which to choose.   This competition for better ideas stimulates innovation. Opening up the   creative process to anyone results in cross-pollination of ideas and   “democratizes” the opportunities for a diversity of input (Hippel, 2006). It   is crucial that the organization’s staff recognize the importance of this   factor in producing more informed products.</p>
<p class="Default">In short, in closed development, the institution has a   monopoly on the production of its own product. With open methods, the market   of ideas benefits from creative input from a wide range of people. This   advantage is especially relevant to community organizations such as museums.</p>
<h3><strong>A diversity of ideas, some obvious</strong></h3>
<p class="Textbody">There is no doubt that open source provides a greater   diversity of ideas than could come from an internal team alone. Among the   internal creative staff, no doubt there will already be wide knowledge about   current ideas and approaches to the task. Contributions from open-source   methods may, therefore, appear to be obvious solutions. This factor should be   expected, and not taken to be a fault of the open approach. Accordingly,   obvious ideas can be evolved to become more useful. Documentation of obvious   solutions can provide a jumping-off point for new modifications of old themes   and uncover potential models for “template” exhibits with varied content.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3><strong>“Expert” does not   mean done</strong></h3>
<p class="Textbody">The Expert Network approach had mixed results. Several   experts committed to projects that could not be delivered as described.   (Indeed, in museum projects, often even paid contractors cannot deliver   projects as described.) Expert contributors generally have no more knowledge   than non-experts about what constitutes a typical or successful exhibit. In   addition, the internal staff will be in a position of learning from the   external experts. Overall, this approach requires intensive collaboration   with the production staff, and sufficient time should always be allotted for   unseen difficulties. In the case of contributed video content, this proved to   be a less important factor.</p>
<h3><strong>Time frames</strong></h3>
<p class="Textbody">Requests generally yielded the best results within a time   frame of approximately 60 to 90 days. This restriction concentrates the   effort of the contributors. Longer time frames generally resulted in   diffusion of the original energy behind the Request. Consider that it takes   some time to “get the word out” to prospective contributors. If the resulting   fabrication can be scheduled within one year, this can motivate participation   more than multi-year time frames.</p>
<h3><strong>Contests</strong></h3>
<p class="Textbody">The benefits of various reward structures for contributors   are beyond the scope of this report. In general, however, contests can   produce good results but tend to be unsustainable. Contests by nature do not   foster collaboration, except within groups working to win the contest as   competitors. Contests tend to produce a motivated group that dissipates   entirely when the contest ends. Invariably, the results of a contest are not   agreed upon by all of the participants, and so discontentment is to be   expected. Open-source projects that succeed best are ones in which the   contributors have a vested interest in the final product. Again, motivations   can include recognition, the feeling of contributing to a worthwhile   endeavor, a sense of mission, learning new skills through association with   the developer community, and a feeling of ownership of the project (Schroder,   2011).</p>
<h3><strong>The virtual   environment</strong></h3>
<p class="Textbody">Use of the virtual world of Second Life provided the widest   array of tools, and the most effective means of real-time collaboration, by   far. It is best approached as a high-speed sketching and prototyping tool   (Ketner and Stephenson, 2010). Its success reveals the “industrial inertia”   plaguing existing, slower prototyping tools, which offer no option for   working in shared virtual spaces. The Second Life environment, which provides   tools to build three-dimensional objects, has a high “effort-to-performance   ratio,” meaning that orders of magnitude in prototyping speed and   collaboration options become&nbsp; available   to those who learn to use it (Engelbart, 1962). The inherent openness of the   platform itself leads to a great deal of enthusiasm around collaboration and   sharing (Ball and Phillips, 2011).&nbsp;   There is an even deeper ideal in the possibility that anyone,   regardless of her position or resources, can, with online tools, create and   succeed on the basis of the merit of her ideas.</p>
<p class="Textbody">Overwhelmingly, contributors wish to use the tools of   expression that they are most familiar with. In instances in which it may be   desired that contributors use specified tools, it should be determined   whether the same results could be obtained by other means. If one particular   tool or programming language is to be used exclusively, one should expect   that the ability to contribute may be limited to highly skilled and motivated   specialists.</p>
<h3><strong>A “cultural change”   is required</strong></h3>
<p class="Textbody">Implementing an open-innovation or open-source project   requires complete support from the institution at the highest level (Nambisan   and Sawhney, 2007).<strong> </strong>The “not   invented here” syndrome, which pits internally developed ideas against   externally sourced ones, must be left behind. Successful use of open-source   methods requires acceptance of “bad” ideas along with the good. The exposure   of half-formed ideas should not be feared; rather, the opportunity to develop   them further with the benefit of outside input should be emphasized.</p>
<h3><strong>Community is   essential</strong></h3>
<p class="Textbody">Open-source development requires carefully handling a   community of contributors (Bacon, 2009). Without this community, there can be   very little motivation to contribute. Open approaches can extend the impact   and meaning of the institution beyond its “four walls” and its physical   location. Similarly, the visibility of any one institution’s creative efforts   invigorates innovation for the industry as a whole.</p>
<h2>5. Going forward: Future potentials for open-source approaches</h2>
<p class="Textbody">There are significant opportunities for the further   development of open-innovation and open-source methods in creating museum   content.</p>
<p class="Heading3AA">Data sharing and prototyping with Feedback Stations</p>
<p class="Textbody">The Tech Test Zone 2011 produced a unique Feedback Station   model. Contributors can view input from visitors directly via a configurable   tablet computer-based interface (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/projects/feedback-stations">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/projects/feedback-stations</a>).   Input from users is shared directly with developers and staff, and across   multiple exhibits and physical locations. Institutions wishing to participate   should contact The Tech Open Source project for further information.</p>

<h3>Modular prototyping spaces</h3>
<p class="Textbody">The Tech Test Zone introduced five modular exhibit   prototyping stations. Developers wishing to deploy experimental content are   invited to post their suggestions as Projects from the current Test Zone open   Request. Ideas for other “templated” testing spaces with modular content   should also be considered. As of January 2012 (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/tech-test-zone-2012">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/requests/tech-test-zone-2012</a>),   these include:</p>

<p class="Textbody">Additional research into reward structures for open-innovation   and open-source projects is needed. The museum environment and its various   diverse and widely connected communities provide an intriguing set of   possibilities to experiment with. Documented insight into how a range of   rewards can function in different situations would be invaluable.</p>
<h3>An Open invitation</h3>
<p class="Textbody">The Tech Open Source program (<a href="http://thetechopensource.thetech.org/">http://thetechopensource.thetech.org</a>/)   is provided as a non-proprietary, industry-wide, open design platform where   the benefits of open-innovation and open-source methods can be realized. By   definition, participation by other institutions is crucial to advancing the   art and science of exhibit and content design. &nbsp;All are invited to post their own Requests   and Projects and continue this work.</p>
