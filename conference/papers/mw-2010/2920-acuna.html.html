<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The project &lsquo;The Digital-Signs in the Map of Mexico 1550&rsquo; is
    a project about open access, and has as the long-term purpose of supporting
    collaboration within Communities of Practice - COP (Wenger, 1998) and
    Communities of Interest - COI (Fischer, 2001) that are concerned with the
    dissemination and preservation of Mesoamerican cultural heritage. The first
    phase of this project also aims to become a wider collaborative research effort
    within the current social shift of the &lsquo;culture of participation&rsquo; (Fischer,
    2002). Since, the change towards a &lsquo;culture of participation&rsquo; is driven not
    only by technological facts, but also by a combination of social interventions
    and practice-based innovation in the form of new content creation, this project
    seeks to study how these communities of researchers could adopt hypermedia
    systems to fulfill their own expression. These
    CoPs and CoIs include (but are not limited to) communities of cartographers,
    curators, epigraphers, students, and historians investigating Mesoamerican
  studies. </p>
<p>Since the spread of the hypertext model, there have been
    innumerable hypermedia-systems produced for different domain-oriented
    environments, some of which lately have been designed as open source and open
    content systems that have received broad social attention. But within the
    cultural heritage domain, there have not been many long-term studies designed
    to analyze the implications and actual research practice of communities and
  collaboration. </p>
<p>The project &lsquo;The
    Digital-Signs in the Map of Mexico 1550&rsquo; intends to contribute to  this social
    evolution from the cultural heritage academic work perspective. We do this
    by using digital instruments and media to bring together diverse forms of
    content in order to create a new &lsquo;hypertext form&rsquo;. Because we are aware of
    issues related to intellectual property rights, we report on the work done, in
    order to demonstrate possible new research practices and procedures with
    respect to creation and annotation of already existing content. At the same
    time, we are convinced that there would be countless benefits for the
    communities of scholars working with the Map if the works that have already
    been written about it were to be made available to the public through separate
  layers to the already existing Digital Facsimile. </p>
<p>The study is also part of a broader research interest in the
    creation of digital facsimiles within the &lsquo;Systems of Representation Group&rsquo; of
    the Media Lab, School of Art and Design, of Aalto University, in Helsinki,
    Finland. See the project &lsquo;Exploring Carta Marina&rsquo;, a cultural heritage Forum
    built around Nordic cultural heritage and the narratives of the Carta Marina of
  1539. (<a href="http://cipher.uiah.fi/index2.html?lang=en">http://cipher.uiah.fi/index2.html?lang=en</a>).</p>
<h2>The Content and the Instruments</h2>
<p>In 1997 the Media Lab of the University of Art and Design
    Helsinki, the Helsinki University of Technology, and the University of
    Uppsala&acute;s Carolina Rediviva Library started a project to create a digital
    version of the ancient Map of Mexico also known as the Uppsala map and dated at
    1550 (D&iacute;az-Kommonen, 1998). The original artifact (that belongs to the Uppsala
    University Library, in Sweden) is a 114 cm x 78 cm painted parchment. The map
    depicts places and activities in what is known today as Mexico City around the
    year 1550, just decades after the ancient empire of the Aztecs and the city of <i>Tenochtitlan</i> had been conquered by the
  Spaniards in 1521:</p>
<p class="BlockQuote">The map is thought to be the work of the noted Spanish
    cosmographer Alonso de Santa Cruz and it is one of the only two known maps that
    give a fairly accurate picture of the city of Mexico and its surrounding
    regions on the mid 16th century. The map also gives information about the
    ethnography and the flora and fauna of the region (Diaz-Kommonen, under
  Background, 2007).</p>
<p>The noted Mesoamerican scholars Miguel Le&oacute;n-Portilla and
    Carmen Aguilera are part of a group of scholars who have proposed that the
    artifact is an example of the conceptual forms of representation of two
    different cultures and that it was not created by Santa Cruz, but rather by
    members of the Aztec nobility working under the tutelage of Spanish monks in
  what became the first university in the Americas (Linne, 1947).</p>
<p>ImaNote (Image Map Annotation Notebook) is the latest and
    improved version of Display Map, a tool designed specially to exhibit the Digital
    Facsimile of the Map of Mexico 1550 on the Web. It was designed as a Web open
    source tool (Diaz &amp; Parttanen, 2010). This means that the tool is freely accessible
    to be used, developed further and re-distributed by anyone through a GNU
    General Public License. The Image Map Annotation Notebook was developed by the &lsquo;Systems
    of Representation&rsquo; research group in collaboration with the &lsquo;Learning
    Environments&rsquo; group of Media Lab. The tool supports hypermedia annotation
    capabilities such as text, image, video, and tags over high-resolution images
    like maps. The interface also allows panning and zooming the high-definition
    image, and in addition allows sorting the annotations and supports RSS (Really
    Simple Syndication). RSS, developed by Netscape in 1999, is a syndication
    format that allows people to get content updates from their favorite Web sites
  within a single reader program (<a
href="http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/">http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/</a>).</p>
<p>The design of the interface is based on a concept of layers
    of information that can be organized around a Group or theme, and annotations
    created and added to it. These annotations can be private or public. At
    present, there are two main groups created in the map: a Cultural_Heritage Sites
    group and a Signs group. The first displays annotations about Cultural Heritage
    places in Mexico City, and it is distinguished by a brown color. The second group
    that presents the Digital Signs is distinguished by a green color. As of this
    writing there are more than 173 digital annotations in the group that is
  related to the topic of this paper.</p>
<h2>Building a Hypertextual Form Using Secondary Sources</h2>
<h3>The Signs of the Map</h3>
<p>The original of the Map of Mexico 1550 depicts a large
    collection of signs or glyphs painted in the Mesoamerican writing way and have
    been described as <i>Glifos Topon&iacute;micos</i> by the Mexican anthropologists Miguel Le&oacute;n-Portilla and Carmen Aguilera in
    their seminal book published in 1986, <i>Mapa
    de M&eacute;xico-Tenochtitlan y sus contornos hacia 1550</i>. The Toponymic signs
    refer to the significance of the name of a place, and they also function as
    descriptors of settlements and geographical features. The context of the
    analysis of the signs that we present in this work includes: (1) name, (2)
    formal structures, (3) meaning as they have been elaborated by Le&oacute;n-Portilla
  and Aguilera.</p>
<p>According to these scholars, educated &lsquo;Indigenous artists-painters&rsquo;,
    who were cognizant of both European writing and Nahua representation styles,
    painted the Map of Mexico 1550. The anthropologists believe that they were
    under the guidance of Spanish Monks, and that this might be the reason why some
    new and strange elements, animals, features and styles different from the
    Indigenous writing style were incorporated into the map. The researchers stated
    that there are almost 200 signs illustrating it, and that the signs are used following
  the Indigenous traditional way of signing settlements and geographical points. </p>
<h3>The Signs: Four Groups</h3>
<p>In the project we have followed the division analysis of the
    Toponymic signs set by the anthropologists in their study. This means that they
    have been divided into four large groups according to the characteristics and
    places they represent on the map. The groups are Mountains and Hills (<i>Montes y Collados</i>); Rivers and
    Tributaries (<i>R&iacute;os y Afluentes)</i>;
  Villages (<i>Poblados)</i>; and Places (<i>Parajes)</i>. </p>
<p>The first group &lsquo;Mountains and Hills&rsquo; has 38 signs and
    encompasses the glyphs that have a &lsquo;hill&rsquo; painted within its structure. The
    group &lsquo;Rivers and Tributaries&rsquo; contains 41 signs. The third and the biggest is
    the group called &lsquo;Villages&rsquo;; the authors estimated that approximately 62 signs
    belong to this group, but we have only located 56 signs. The last group is
    denominated &lsquo;Places&rsquo;; it is the smallest one with only 38 signs. The
    anthropologists have reported that this group contains all the signs that have
    unclear associations to any village, mountains, or rivers. There is, however, the
    possibility that they give a name to a settlement, or to a geographical feature
  near to the place where they are located. </p>
<h3>The Location of the Signs</h3>
<p>Le&oacute;n-Portilla and Aguilera&rsquo;s publication has many
    illustrations and photographs of the original map. Though the photographic
    images are not of a high quality, the schematic representation in black and
    white drawings of the map provided in the publication is good. In this
    schematic drawing, or <i>Diagrama del mapa
    de M&eacute;xico-Tenochtitlan y sus contornos</i>, the anthropologists divide the Map into
  eleven sections. </p>
<p>During the data-gathering phase in Helsinki, a similar
    schematic drawing in the form of a matrix was made in order to label and
    classify the multiple photographs - over 200 - used to create the Digital
    Facsimile. However, for the purpose of this study, we decided to use
    Le&oacute;n-Portilla and Aguilera&rsquo;s diagram and classification scheme of the elements
    in the Map. Note that similar schematic drawings of the map have been done
    earlier. A notable example is the work done with the map at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> Century by the noted British artist/archaeologist Adela Breton. We believe that
    the conformation, standardization, or even inclusion of multiples of such
    representation and classification schemes can help to provide different
    perspectives to the data and will be a central issue in the future when editing
  the new classes of digital genres. </p>
<p>In the diagram by Le&oacute;n-Portilla and Aguilera, each of the sections
    of the Map is given a number that it is used to identify the area in which a
    specific sign is located. The signs are also numbered, and their number is used
    as a reference within the text. For example, a sign in the text can be labeled:
    7-31, which means that this specific sign is situated in section number seven
    of the map, and that the sign can be located in that section by finding the
    number thirty-one. In addition, next to the number thirty-one there is a small
    and simplified sketch (or icon) representing that sign; this icon makes easier
  and faster the identification of the sign in the map.</p>
<h3>Form-giving in Digital Media</h3>
<p>Since the first time that Theodor Nelson coined the term
    &lsquo;hypertext&rsquo; as &lsquo;[&hellip;] a body of written or pictorial material interconnected in
    such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented
    on paper [&hellip;]&rsquo;, in 1957; there have been several definitions of what hypertext,
    hypertext systems, and hypermedia are. A comprehensive analysis of what constitutes
    hypertext is beyond the scope of this paper. However, some of the basic
    characteristics  shared are the possibility to access as well as link information
    and media in a non-sequential manner; a network of links to other nodes beyond
    itself; potential random access and multiple navigational paths; addition, annotation,
  and indexing of information.</p>
<p>One of our ultimate objectives is to investigate how to
    create digital networks of information and media, thus augmenting the
    possibility for scholars to work with cultural heritage artifacts. In this
    context, &lsquo;The Digital-Signs in the Map of Mexico 1550&rsquo; is a project about the
    question of what &lsquo;hypertextual form&rsquo; (Landow, 1997) is, how one is created
    using already existing scientific knowledge and a digital annotation tool, and
    what the problematics involved in the use of such tools and processes are. As
    more and more of these tools become available, there is a need to understand,
    in practice, what the limitations and the potential available through the use
    of such instruments are. This is why in this paper we have chosen to present
  the procedures involved as part of such work. </p>
<p>In terms of content, the aforementioned analysis made by the
    anthropologists in their book and the Digital Facsimile of the Map of Mexico
    created in Helsinki were the starting information points (or sources) for the
    &lsquo;hypertextual form&rsquo; created within the Digital-Signs project. We were
    interested in learning about how the annotation process could work for the
    researcher, what sort of practices can be developed to organize the materials,
    as well as what details were involved in converting from a non-digital linear
    narrativeto a hypertext system. We were also interested in studying the
    narrative style and how it differs from one genre to another. In the case of
    Le&oacute;n-Portilla and Aguilera&rsquo;s book, the writing that is cited is very descriptive
    and full of composite information. Is it possible for a researcher to edit the
    writing while preserving the integrity of the original sources, and at the same
  time transfer the knowledge into a hypertext format? </p>
<p>The contents of the digital annotations that were used for
    this study are quoted from the general text of the book, as they are in the
    original Spanish. In some cases, however, we found that the in-depth analyses
    offered by Le&oacute;n-Portilla and Aguilera was too long to fit into the annotation
    window so they were edited into shorter versions. In other cases they were edited
    in order to connect related information from other parts of the general text,
    but always preserving the quotation format and indicating the original source
    from which the text has been cited. Future interface developments for the
    ImaNote tool - or for similar annotation tools - will need to address these
  issues.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Tags&rsquo; (keywords) labeling the connection of the signs
    were created by the researchers in Helsinki in order to allow for searching
    through the sub categories produced by the new connections created. These
    keywords were selected by taking into consideration the attributes and
    significances of the signs, as described in the book by Le&oacute;n-Portilla and
  Aguilera.</p>
<p class="BlockQuote">Cuetzpalan </p>
<p class="BlockQuote">En lo que toca a hidr&oacute;nimos que incorporan glifos de
    animals [&hellip;] la lagartija [puede representar] a un Cuetzpalan, &ldquo;Lugar de
  lagartijas&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="BlockQuote">El &iacute;cono pertenece al grupo &lsquo;De r&iacute;os y sus afluentes
  (hidr&oacute;nimos)&rsquo;. </p>
<p class="BlockQuote">Tags: animal, Cuetzpalan, lagartija, r&iacute;o, r&iacute;o-y-afluentes. </p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Annotation for the sign &lsquo;Cuetzpalan&rsquo; (small lizards&rsquo;
  place)</p>
<h2>Building the Digital-Signs </h2>
<h3>The Annotation Process</h3>
<p>In retrospect, we can report that the active process for the
    annotations took place in three phases: Phase 1, Preparing a Text from
    Le&oacute;n-Portilla and Aguilera&rsquo;s analysis; Phase 2, Preparing the Images; Phase 3,
    Creating the Annotations. After the first phase was completed, the second and
    the third phases were produced simultaneously. It was decided to proceed in
    this way because in order to prepare a .JPG image (second phase) and upload it
    (third phase), it was necessary to locate that image on the schematic diagram
    from the book. If the phases were done at the same time, the process would be
  simplified.</p>
<h4>Phase 1: Preparing the Text.</h4>
<p>The revision and editing of the information in Spanish used
    for the annotations of the Digital-Signs was a long and detailed process. A
    file documenting the summarized text was created using basic &lsquo;TextEditor&rsquo;
    software. The nomenclature assigned by the authors of the book, the sign and
    its information were then included into each annotation. The information was
    written following the order in which the text would be displayed in the
    different fields options of the annotation tool: (1) &lsquo;Title&rsquo; field, name of the
    sign; (2) &lsquo;Annotation Text&rsquo; field, the edited text from the source; (3) &lsquo;URL
    description&rsquo; field, name of the group which the signs belongs to; (4) &lsquo;Tags&rsquo;
  field, the keywords connected to the sign.</p>
<p>The information of the 173 signs was prepared following the
    above description. After the textual information was ready, the second phase: <i>Preparing the
    image files</i> was organized. As already mentioned, the information used
    for creating the &lsquo;hypertextual form&rsquo; comes from the research of one source. As an
    in-depth analysis, the writing style from this book is very descriptive, full
    of composite and valuable information. Note that although only one text was
    used for this study, nothing precludes the use of multiple sources in diverse
    genres. Further analysis of writing styles according to genre and how these
    affect the creation of form-giving in hypertext is an interesting path for
  future research. </p>
<p>Similar practices involving the marking and annotation of
    multiple sources are already available in commercial services such as the
    Questia on-line library. The difference between these services and what we
    envision through the use of a tool such as ImaNote is that with our software
    there would be a free exchange of information where members of CoPs and CoIs
    would retain<i> full control of their Image
  notebooks</i>.</p>
<h4>Phase 2: Preparing the Images </h4>
<p>The digital images of the signs&ndash;which will be called in
    this paper &lsquo;Sign.jpg&rsquo;&ndash;   are close-ups from the painted signs in the original
    map. The Digital Facsimile high-resolution image of the map created in Helsinki
    was used as the source file for these close-ups. The digital images files were
    processed using an image-editing program, and they were saved as JPG files
    using as the name for the file their nomenclature; for instance, 7-31.jpg. To
    store the digital images of the signs, four separate folders were created (e.g.
  Rivers.jpg folder).</p>
<p>The task of creating the &lsquo;Sign.jpg&rsquo; was a slow but not complicated
    process. First, the location of a sign was found by using the book&rsquo;s schematic
    diagram provided (for example, 7-31.jpg); second, the Digital Facsimile
    high-resolution image of the map was opened in the image-editing program;
    third, the equivalent sign was located on the Digital Facsimile; fourth, the
    sign was cropped in the desired view; finally, it was saved as 7-31.jpg and was
  placed inside the corresponding folder (for instance, Rivers.jpg).</p>
<p>The ImaNote interface has an option called &lsquo;Icon field&rsquo;
    which can be used to insert a miniature image related to the annotation. To
    manage the icons, the interface gives the following options: a check box
    &lsquo;Visible for all&rsquo;, to select the availability of the image; and a pull-down
    menu &lsquo;Publish to group&rsquo;, to select the group in which the annotation will be
    displayed on the interface. In the project &lsquo;The Digital-Signs in the Map of
    Mexico 1550&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Icon field&rsquo; option was used to upload an image of the sign,
  it was set &lsquo;Visible to all&rsquo;, and it was published on the Signs group.</p>
<h4>Phase 3: Creating the Annotations </h4>
<p>In contrast to the text editing task and the creation of the
    &lsquo;Sign.jpg&rsquo; file, the final step of making the annotations to create the
  &lsquo;Digital-Sign&rsquo; with ImaNote interface was easier and faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Interpreting the Digital-Signs</h2>
<h3>Signs Layers</h3>
<p>The interface concept of ImaNote opens up the possibilities
    of having several layers of information about the cultural digital object and also makes it feasible
    to approach several points of view over the same cultural digital object. We have referred to
    this as an &lsquo;Open Interpretation&rsquo; approach (D&iacute;az-Kommonen, Kaipainen, 2002). The
  interface can also be used as to display multiple visual layers of information.</p>
<p>The 173 digital annotations drawn from Le&oacute;n-Portilla and
    Aguilera are the core of the present study of the Toponymic signs since they
    present explanations by these authors for the name&rsquo;s meaning, and an analysis
    and a group to which the sign belongs. As a flexible hypertext form within the
    Digital Facsimile that allows for further compilation and comparison with other
    sources, the signs can now function like interpretation-devices for the
    identification of other graphic marks, and to augment and promote the study of
  the Toponymic signs. </p>
<p>Altogether, the project of the Digital-Signs could work as
    the first layer in a repository of information used to support researchers, archeologists, historians, and
    other members of CoPs and CoIs who might not be in the position of having
    access to the original artifact, or the secondary sources that have been
  created about it. </p>
<p>Since the visual
    representation of the Digital Facsimile is of such a high quality, the annotations
    of the Digital-Signs layer can also operate as a type of image-gallery for
    visualizing the formal characteristics of this kind of Indigenous writing, so that
    now they can be compared to other Toponymic signs existing on separate
    Mesoamerican maps, codices, stone monuments, and Colonial manuscripts. This
    comparative study could be done, for example by adding and annotating the signs
    on the same layer (or Group) of the &lsquo;hypertextual form&rsquo;, by linking to them any
  other hypermedia resource from the cyberspace, or by making a new layer (or Group).</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Tags&rsquo; feature of the interface can help to make a more
    comprehensive analysis of the graphical characteristics existing on the
    Digital-Signs. This feature allows entering distinctive information and
    keywords related to each of the signs, and consequently deriving associations
    that might exist. For example, in the current work reported, the tags of the
    signs were decided according to their descriptive information, and also in
    relation to the group to which they belong. For example, the signs can be seen
    by groups (Places), or by things (Jade). If a researcher wants to see a
    connection of one sign to others, s/he can write down with ease a keyword in
    the &lsquo;Search field&rsquo; and then press the &lsquo;Search&rsquo; button; then, the tool will sort
    all the signs connected to that word. With this layer of visual information,
    any researcher will be able to see all the graphical similarities or
  differences of the connected signs.</p>
<h3>The Connections</h3>
<p>In a task search of the keyword <i>r&iacute;os</i> (rivers in English), the tool displays the result of 45 signs
    related to the topic;  44 signs from the &lsquo;Rivers and Tributaries&rsquo; group, plus
    one more from other annotations previously done in the group &lsquo;Cultural Heritage
    Sites&rsquo;. This latter group has annotations about historical places that can be
    found on the map; some of them were built in Mexico City many centuries after
    the Map of Mexico 1550 was painted. The 45 results of this search task are
    displayed in the form of a visual list showing the name of the sign, a good
    quality image of the sign, all the text of the annotation, last date and time
    of the editing, the author, as well as the group to which this sign belongs
    (see Fig.1). Such a list can help users to compare and notice the similarities
    or differences between the signs, and it also allows them to see in close
  detail the painted signs and their formal characteristics.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="acuna.fig1.jpg" width="309" height="640" alt="Figure 1" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 1: The sorting result of r&iacute;os. Detail</p>
<p>Since the ImaNote tool also gives the possibility of making
    several annotations in relation to a sign, or in connection to it, a second
    task was performed to illustrate the case of connecting a sign with other glyphs
    depicted in a different source. For instance, in the Map of Mexico 1550, there
    is a sign that belongs to the &lsquo;Villages&rsquo; group, and it is called <i>Xihco</i> (Nahuatl language), <i>En el lugar del ombligo</i> (Spanish): &lsquo;At
  the bellybutton place&rsquo; (see Fig.2). </p>
<p class="caption"><img src="acuna.fig2.jpg" width="500" height="483" alt="Figure 2" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 2: The annotation of Xihco Sign of the Map of Mexico
  1550. Detail</p>
<p>This sign has a painted graphical structure (icon) which is
    quite similar to the one that belongs to a place called <i>Chalco</i>, &lsquo;bellybutton&rsquo; (Le&oacute;n Portilla &amp; Aguilera 1986). The icon
    of <i>Chalco</i> is also found on the stone
    monument called <i>Piedra de T&iacute;zoc</i> (<i>T&iacute;zoc</i> Stone), which is a Pre-Hispanic
  monument holding engraved names of the places that <i>T&iacute;zoc</i>, a Mexican king, conquered (Le&oacute;n-Portilla 1992). (See Fig.3).</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="acuna.fig3.jpg" width="500" height="483" alt="Figure 3" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 3: The annotation of Chalco Sign from T&iacute;zoc Stone.
  Behind it, it can be seen Xihco Sign of the Map of Mexico 1550. Detail</p>
<p>Comparing the two annotations (1) the Map of Mexico 1550
    sign and (2) the <i>Piedra de T&iacute;zoc</i> sign
    not only gives the possibility to analyze the similarities of the icons, but
    also delivers the connections of the signs, because the annotations work as
    Interpretation-devices. The former examples illustrate the capabilities that
    this hypermedia annotation system has in respect to the documentation and
    scholarship of Mesoamerican studies. Further projects within Communities of
    Interest and Communities of Practice can be developed to increment the
    annotations and connections of these cultural assets; the social features
  implicit in the design of ImaNote as an open tool open up these possibilities. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>One of the main purposes of this project is to research the
    design and building of networks of information and digital media through the
    use of digital tools such as &lsquo;ImaNote&rsquo; for &lsquo;Communities of Practice&rsquo; and
    &lsquo;Communities of Interest&rsquo; within the cultural digital heritage domain. We are
    also interested in acquiring information of how digital annotation tools
    support the practice of research and documentation for specialists
    investigating Mesoamerican studies, and how non-linear research sources can be
    transformed into a hypertext system.The first phase of this project sets a
    foundation by demonstrating how to create one perspective &lsquo;hypertextual form&rsquo;
    on the subject of the graphic marks and Toponymic signs of the Map of Mexico
    1550 as researched, analyzed and published by two experts in Mesoamerican
    studies. This &lsquo;hypertextual-form&rsquo; created is one of the several possible layers
    of information of existing sources about the map that can be build around it,
    using the Image Map Annotation Notebook presented in this project. Continuing
    the development of further layers of content creation from other sources can
    also bring lots of assets for researchers and scholars interested in the
  original Map. </p>
<p>Finally, this project also reports on the functionality of
    the open annotation tool used for the
    creation of the 173 digital annotations as well as commenting on how the
    &lsquo;hypertextual form&rsquo; can be used for connecting separate kinds of digital
  information such as Codices, stone monuments, and Colonial manuscripts. </p>
<p>Taking advantage of the networking possibilities that
    hypermedia systems allow and following with the &lsquo;culture of participation&rsquo;
    shift, the project &lsquo;The Digital-Signs in the Map of Mexico 1550&rsquo; will focus future
    efforts on the development of widespread collaborative research on digital
    heritage. The second phase of the project will include the planning and
    implementation of strategies to integrate CoPs and CoIs into the project, and
    the design of scenarios for social interventions and content creation by the
    members of those communities. The outcome of this on-going  process project will
    be the analysis of research activities intertwined with communities and
  collaboration. </p>
