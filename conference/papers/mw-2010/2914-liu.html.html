        <p class="AbstractText">Dulwich OnView (DOV) is an on-line blog magazine
          associated with the Dulwich Picture Gallery (DPG) in south London. Uniquely, it
          has been set up by some Friends of DPG in the local community, with a symbiotic
          relationship between that community and the museum. DPG benefits from the
          marketing and publicity generated by DOV. DOV benefits from the status that DPG
          brings to it. This paper explores recent developments of DOV in the context of
          its community, including a study based on the Community of Practice (CoP)
          approach and a usability review for a planned redesign of the Web site.</p>

<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</h2>
  <p><i>Dulwich OnView</i> (DOV) is a unique example of a museum blog run by volunteers from its Friends
    and the local community, with posts about both. This combination increases
    exposure and interest in the museum (<i>Dulwich
      Picture Gallery</i> in southeast London, UK), attracting new audiences. It uses
    very little staff time and comes at no financial cost. As Dulwich Picture
    Gallery (DPG) is often perceived as traditional and conservative, Dulwich
    OnView has helped to counteract this image and set the Gallery in the context
    of a local community that loves and supports it.</p>
  <p>The authors believe that DOV is unique and different from a
    regular museum blog in the following ways:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>It is independent from the museum. DOV is run by the community
      for the community, and with DPG at its heart, it renders it a sense of
      belonging within the local area and part of people's everyday lives.</li>
    <li>It is discovered by people not looking for (and perhaps not
      knowing about) DPG (analysis of search terms), who are then introduced to the
      Gallery through the associated articles and numerous links (analysis of Web
      traffic).</li>
    <li>It is not dominated/controlled by official authority, whist still
      benefiting from formal recognition and support from the museum &ndash; which makes
      the contents created by independent volunteers, more believable and able to win
      public trust and further involvement from the local community.</li>
    <li>It uses no DPG resources and staff is under no pressure to submit
      regularly (the director writes or comments about every two months). The minimal
      costs incurred by the editors are covered by sponsorship, and all contributors
      are volunteers, so this promotional tool comes at no cost at all.</li>
    <li>It encourages anyone to contribute content. Although a limited
      number have editorial access, hundreds have written/photographed/made films for
      this hybrid blog/magazine. Consisting of many voices, it has a very wide
      appeal.</li>
    <li>Contributors come from a far wider demographic than the visitors
      to DPG. These contributors tell their peers about their article (evidence in
      numbers of comments), who then in turn discover DPG.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This paper presents the following aspects of DOV:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>An introduction and overview of DOV and its unique aspects.</li>
    <li>The background of DOV, progress of the blog over the last two
      years since it was launched (Beazley, 2008a), including statistical evidence
      collected and correlated from the DOV and DPG Web sites and what this can
      indicate about the benefits of DOV to DPG.</li>
    <li>A wider study for a PhD thesis, investigating a number of varied
      museum-based virtual communities in an art education context using the social
      science <i>Community of Practice</i> (CoP)
      framework.</li>
    <li>A redesign of the blog, aimed at a better structuring of the
      increasing number of articles into categories and the integration of the more
      formal and static DPG Web site (<a
href="http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/">http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk</a>)
      and the more informal and dynamic DOV Web site, with suitable interconnecting
      links. As part of the redesign process for the DOV Web site, a usability review
      has been conducted.</li>
    <li>Some overall conclusions on running of DOV and lessons for the
      future.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Background and
    Progress</h2>
  <p>The village of Dulwich in south London has had a powerful
    sense of community since the days of Edward Alleyn (1566 - 1626, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Alleyn">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Alleyn</a>), an
    Elizabethan actor and founder of Dulwich College. In 1811, Sir Peter Francis
    Bourgeois left his significant collection of paintings to Dulwich College with
    instructions that they should be available to be viewed by the public. These
    comprise the core of the present permanent collection at DPG. Sir John Soane
    designed what was the first public art gallery in England and which receives
    very strong and loyal local community support.</p>
  <p>As the Web has expanded and interactive facilities have
    improved, social interaction on-line has increased rapidly over the last
    decade. Initially much of the interaction was professional in nature (Bowen et
    al., 2003). Individual cultural institutions, including museums, have tried to
    harness this technology for their own ends in engaging with their audiences,
    but with varying success (Beler et al., 2004; Russo &amp; Watkins, 2008). Such
    facilities have even been used for collaborative artistic endeavors (Smith,
    2009). Experimentation is all very well initially, but sustaining such
    audiences has proved more difficult unless the right motivation to revisit can
    be found (Russo &amp; Peacock, 2009).</p>
  <p>There are a number of different Web 2.0 technologies
    available for collaborative support. For example, wikis are a suitable
    technology for projects that involve collaboration and have been utilized in a
    museum context in interesting and varied ways, even if to a limited extent so
    far (Bowen et al., 2007 &amp; 2008). Blogs are more suitable for an ongoing
    magazine-like facility depending on a temporal ordering of article and
    associated comments. For a developing virtual community, this is an appropriate
    technology to use as a basis for support facilities.</p>
  <p>The Dulwich OnView (DOV) on-line blog magazine (see Figure
    1) has grown out of this very strong community atmosphere. (Indeed, Dulwich
    still has the feeling of a village without the suburban expanse of southeast
    London). It was last presented at the <i>Museums
      and the Web</i> conference in 2008 (Beazley, 2008a &amp; 2008b). In this
    section, a number of the developments since then are presented. It is sometimes
    seen as an &lsquo;unofficial&rsquo; museum Web site (Beazley 2009), and this informality
    has allowed the site to be a thriving and dynamic facility for the local
    community in Dulwich, with a strong connection to DPG.</p>

  <p class="caption">Fig 1: Dulwich OnView homepage (<a
href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk</a>)</p>
  <h3>Statistical information</h3>
  <p>The site went live in January 2008 and has seen steadily
    increasing visitor numbers since then (see Figure 2). It can be noted that
    December and January are slightly quieter months each year.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="liu.fig2.jpg" width="500" height="278" alt="Figure 2" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 2: Dulwich OnView views per month.</p>
  <p>With regard to search terms, &ldquo;Dulwich OnView&rdquo; and variants
    are not the most popular keywords. In fact, &ldquo;flamenco&rdquo; is top with 22%. There
    are articles on flamenco (for example, see <a
href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/03/07/flamenco-and-film-at-dulwich-picture-gallery/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/03/07/flamenco-and-film-at-dulwich-picture-gallery/</a>),
    and it is likely that this page has been linked from another popular Web site
    or published in some effective way. There are also flamenco-related Web pages
    on the DPG Web site. The second most popular search term is four variants of &ldquo;St
    Sebastian&rdquo;, at 18%. There is an article on &ldquo;Selling St. Sebastian&rdquo; by the DPG
    shop manager on DOV (<a
href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/04/22/selling-st-sebastian/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/04/22/selling-st-sebastian/</a> ). Variants of &ldquo;Dulwich On View&rdquo; are only the third most popular search term at
    11%. Explicit searches for DOV have increased with time. The term &ldquo;Dulwich
    Picture Gallery&rdquo; is substantially down the list of popular keywords at 2%. Even
    though 98% of visitors arriving at the DOV Web site through a search have
    not selected &ldquo;Dulwich Picture Gallery&rdquo;, 33% of onward clicks go to DPG, which is a
    free benefit for the Gallery.</p>
  <p>Regarding visitors, 28% arrive at DOV through reciprocal
    links from organizations about which DOV has written articles; 25% come from
    local information Web sites and discussion forums; 14% arrive from the main DPG
    Web site via many different links to DOV articles on the site; 12% are from
    other blogs; and 9% from Facebook (e.g., see GalleryFilm at Dulwich Picture
    Gallery &ndash; <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2446446018">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2446446018</a>);
    4% from Flickr (e.g., see Dulwich Picture Gallery flickr Friends &ndash; <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/dulwichpicturegallery/">http://www.flickr.com/groups/dulwichpicturegallery/</a>);
    and 2% from Twitter (see <a href="http://twitter.com/dulwichonview">http://twitter.com/dulwichonview</a>). A
    Wikipedia page from DOV was created in August 2009, (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulwich_OnView">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulwich_OnView</a>) and 3% of
    visitors have come from this source, even though it is a more recent addition.</p>
  <p>There are many outgoing links on DOV. As mentioned above,
    33% of outgoing visitors follow a link to the DPG main Web site or Flickr site;
    20% go to the DPG home page, the what&rsquo;s on page or an exhibition page; the
    other 13% go to Flickr. The figure of 33% travelling from DOV to DPG compares
    to 14% in the opposite direction.</p>
  <h3>Evolving contributors</h3>
  <p>DOV has many people involved to a greater or lesser extent with
    its running (<a href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/about/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk/about/</a>).
    There are two interns working for it, one of whom continues to edit even though
    she has moved to Brussels. The other is a third year student in Arts Management
    at London South Bank University, and her work with DOV is part of her
    coursework. One school girl has written some articles before returning to
    school. Other contributors have included school leavers about to start
    university and young people wishing to work in illustration, who provide
    material for articles (e.g., see <a
href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2009/10/13/conker-those-autumn-blues-by-erica-green-green-light-lifestyles/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2009/10/13/conker-those-autumn-blues-by-erica-green-green-light-lifestyles/</a>).
    DOV acts as a platform for three authors and two professional photographers.</p>
  <p>Overall, contributors find their involvement in DOV to be an
    enjoyable experience. There is good community spirit, and off-line friendships
    are formed directly as a result of involvement. The magazine is managed in an
    informal way, often in social environments (see Figures 3 and 4). For writers,
    it is a good place to experiment with new material and writing styles. More
    recently, there have been a larger number of regular authors, but each of them
    with less commitment. It has become more difficult to find editorial support; a
    new generation of interested volunteers would help to continue and develop the
    project.</p>

  <p class="caption">Fig 4: An informal DOV gathering.</p>
  <h3>The importance of contributors</h3>
  <p>A pool of diverse writers is important as they represent
    different voices and will connect with different audiences. The diversity of
    topics helps to involve new readers as articles are typically passed on by the
    writers to their networks (e.g., see comments under <a
href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/11/21/sexy-hemp/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/11/21/sexy-hemp/</a>).
    DOV supports local causes and is developing a network of friends and links. For
    example, see an article about a new choir in the community (<a
href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/08/22/763/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/08/22/763/</a>). The
    author of the article sent it to all the members of the choir, an example of
    viral marketing.</p>
  <p>Another example is that of a local school that has been
    raising money for a music centre. Children and their parents wrote five blogs
    about it (e.g., see <a
href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/11/18/countdown-to-jags-art-fair/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/11/18/countdown-to-jags-art-fair/</a>).
    They then told their friends. The school now has a link to the articles on DOV.</p>
  <p>There has been an article about war veterans who were old
    boys of a well-known local school. Subsequently, alumni of the school have been
    sending the link to this article (<a
href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2009/11/06/alleyns-old-boys-wwii-casualties/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2009/11/06/alleyns-old-boys-wwii-casualties/</a>)
    to their mailing list.</p>
  <p>The link with DPG has helped in encouraging prestigious
    authors to contribute, including three museum directors (e.g., see <a
href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/10/31/the-proximity-of-art-and-death-dulwich-picture-gallery-and-its-mausoleum/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/10/31/the-proximity-of-art-and-death-dulwich-picture-gallery-and-its-mausoleum/</a>).</p>
  <p>DOV has been increasingly promoting exhibitions by building
    expectations beforehand. For example, there were 13 posts on <i>The Polish Connection</i>, an exhibition at
    DPG (<a
href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/category/dulwich-picture-gallery/the-polish-connection-dulwich-picture-gallery/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk/category/dulwich-picture-gallery/the-polish-connection-dulwich-picture-gallery/</a>).
    A mural was created in the gallery and the progress was photographed on five
    consecutive days for DOV. DOV volunteers visited the artist&rsquo;s studio while he
    was creating the works, and this was recorded in film, text and still images
    for DOV and Flickr. The rehearsals for an associated dance were filmed for DOV.
    The Gallery staff did not have the time to do this. None of this was on the
    main DPG Web site, as its informality was not appropriate, but it provided
    insight for those interested in this aspect of the exhibition.</p>
  <p>Articles are also used to contextualize exhibitions. DPG staff
    were asked by DOV to become involved, e.g., as in the <i>What are YOU Like?</i> exhibition (http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/exhibitions/past_exhibitions/what_are_you_like.aspx).
    The Director of DPG, Ian Dejardin, provided some informal insight into his
    interests (<a
href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/11/25/what-are-you-like-ian-dejardin-director-of-dpg/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/11/25/what-are-you-like-ian-dejardin-director-of-dpg/</a>),
    again something that would not fit in with the ethos of the main DPG Web site.</p>
  <p>The DOV wine reviewer often links his articles to DPG
    exhibitions, e.g., to the <i>Best of British</i> exhibition when he wrote about British wines (<a
href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2009/09/01/best-of-british-wines/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2009/09/01/best-of-british-wines/</a>).</p>
  <p>The feel of DOV articles is personal, informal, chatty,
    warm, and welcoming. It is intended to be in keeping with blogs in general and
    the culture of Friends of DPG in the community. Articles have to conform to
    this style under editorial guidance.</p>
  <h3>Increasing recognition by DPG</h3>
  <p>DOV links to DPG with a prominent graphic included in the
    right-hand sidebar of all pages (see Figure 5). There are also many more
    specific links within individual articles concerning DPG and its activities,
    such as exhibitions.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="liu.fig5-small.jpg" width="500" height="233" alt="Figure 5" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 5: Dulwich OnView link to Dulwich Picture Gallery</p>
  <p>There was initial suspicion of DOV from middle management and
    reluctance to create links from DPG to DOV Web sites. The management of the Web
    site was then moved to the Communications Department, where there was greater
    awareness of the benefits of social networking. About a year ago DPG set up a
    Facebook fan group (<a
href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/London-United-Kingdom/Dulwich-Picture-Gallery/59017148002">http://www.facebook.com/pages/London-United-Kingdom/Dulwich-Picture-Gallery/59017148002</a>)
    and started to link to DOV, but deep within the Web site. Statistical analysis
    of Web traffic in early 2009 revealed no movement of on-line visitors from DPG
    to DOV.</p>
  <p>DOV personnel requested more links, and it was decided that
    the visitor might be confused as to why such links existed to this external Web
    site. So DOV collaborated over a logo that would be next to the links with an
    explanation of the DOV blog in the Friends section of the DPG Web site (<a
href="http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/support_us/friends_of_the_gallery.aspx">http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/support_us/friends_of_the_gallery.aspx</a>).
    Within this section is a DOV page, linked from the sidebar menu, but still on
    the main DPG Web site (<a
href="http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/support_us/friends_of_the_gallery/dulwich_onview.aspx">http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/support_us/friends_of_the_gallery/dulwich_onview.aspx in the
      Friends section </a>).</p>
  <p>It was also decided to have in the Friends section a page of
    links to DOV articles that were always of interest and would not go out of
    date. As the number increased, these were divided into category pages,
    including gallery staff articles (<a
href="http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/support_us/friends_of_the_gallery/dulwich_onview/gallery_staff_articles.aspx">http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/support_us/friends_of_the_gallery/dulwich_onview/ gallery_staff_articles.aspx</a>),
    exhibition reviews, Friends events, and education, linked in a sub-menu within
    the sidebar (see Figure 6).</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="liu.fig6-small.jpg" width="500" height="504" alt="Figure 6" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 6: Dulwich Picture Gallery link to Dulwich OnView.</p>
  <p>The Director of DPG has always been supportive of DOV, but
    has been keen to keep the relationship relatively loose to allow flexibility on
    both sides. For example, DOV included many articles that are not related to
    DPG, but to the local community in general. DPG gives the Director the
    opportunity to write informally, in a way that would not be suitable on the
    current DPG Web site.</p>
  <h3>Success stories</h3>
  <p>To take just one example, DOV has facilitated international
    research with regard to an exhibition of Chinese photographs in 2008 (<a
href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/07/15/chinese-whispers/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2008/07/15/chinese-whispers/</a>).
    This resulted in a number of interesting responses that would have been unlikely
    otherwise. There are further similar examples on DOV.</p>
  <h3>Conferences and workshops</h3>
  <p>DOV personnel have participated in a number of conferences
    and workshops to help publicize its activities in the professional field,
    including a previous demonstration at the <i>Museums
      and the Web</i> conference in 2008 (Beazley, 2008).</p>
  <p>In November 2008, a meeting devoted entirely to DOV was
    organized by the Membership Management Forum (<a
href="http://www.membershipmanagementforum.org/">http://www.membershipmanagementforum.org</a>),
    associated with the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions. The event was
    attended by 44 delegates from around the United Kingdom and involved personnel
    from a variety of arts organizations (film, dance, music, theatre, etc.). As
    well as membership managers, managers involved with development, use of the
    Web, marketing, and patrons attended.</p>
  <p>In December 2008, a workshop on <i>Social Media and Museums and Cultural Heritage</i> at the NODEM 08
    conference in Reykjavik, Iceland, included a presentation on DOV (<a
href="http://www.tii.se/nodem/conference.php?subpage=workshops">http://www.tii.se/nodem/conference.php?subpage=workshops</a>).</p>
  <p>In January 2010,at <i>An
    Introduction to Web 2.0 and the Social Web</i> UKOLN workshop at DPG, DOV was
    used as a case study (<a
href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/cultural-heritage/events/social-web-dulwich-2010/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/cultural-heritage/events/social-web-dulwich-2010/</a>).</p>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>In this section, recent developments at DOV have been
    presented. In the next section, the activities of DOV are explored more
    formally in the framework of a <i>Community
      of Practice</i>. This concept is increasingly being applied to virtual
    communities as well as real communities (Varlamis &amp; Apostolakis, 2010).</p>
  <h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Community of
    Practice Study</h2>
  <p>Dulwich OnView has been part of a set of wider case studies
    for a PhD thesis conducted by one of the authors of this paper (Liu, 2008 &amp;
    2009). The thesis investigates a number of varied museum-based virtual
    communities using the social science <i>Community
      of Practice</i> (Wenger et al, 2002) as its framework. This in-depth case study
    includes several that are run by national museums (Liu &amp; Bowen, 2010). DPG
    is relatively small-scale, but the study concludes that DOV has greatly
    benefited its associated museum as many of its activities conform to the
    principles of a Community of Practice (CoP).</p>
  <h3>The three fundamental elements of a community of practice</h3>
  <p>There are three fundamental elements forming the structural
    model of a CoP; namely, <i>domain</i>, <i>community</i>, and <i>practice</i>. Wenger et al (2002, p.29) state that: &ldquo;When they function
    well together, these three elements make a community of practice an ideal
    knowledge structure &ndash; a social structure that can assume responsibility for
    developing and sharing knowledge.&rdquo; DOV as a virtual community to a large degree
    embraces these three elements that give it the potential of being cultivated as
    a successful community of practice.</p>
  <p>In terms of <i>domain</i>,
    a CoP must have a common interest to be effective. Otherwise, it is just a
    collection of people with no particular purpose participating in the group. At
    first glance, the domain knowledge in the DOV community seems not very
    definite. There is a far broader variety of articles that go beyond the
    Gallery-related topics being included in discussions within the community, making
    a clearly defined domain less obvious. Nevertheless, DOV indicates in the &ldquo;Who
    we are&rdquo; Web page, &ldquo;From East to West Dulwich and beyond we wanted to recognize
    the eclectic nature of life round here, the breadth of people and livelihoods,
    the rude health of the Arts, and the buoyant sense of community...&rdquo;. This on-line
    community does create a common ground that attracts local people coming to
    celebrate the shared culture within their physical neighborhood.</p>
  <p>With regard to <i>community</i>,
    a CoP needs a group of people who are willing to engage with some others in the
    group, so ultimately the entire group is transitively connected as a unified
    entity. This aspect is critical to the effective development of shared
    knowledge within the community. As a hybrid blog/on-line magazine, DOV
    encourages everyone to contribute content to the community, including comments
    on articles, and has enabled many local residents to feel proud of being
    authors, and hence build a sense of ownership in it.</p>
  <p>In terms of <i>practice</i>,
    a CoP explores existing common knowledge whilst also developing practice for
    the future. The term &ldquo;practice&rdquo; denotes a set of socially defined approaches to
    doing things in the shared domain that create a baseline for communication and
    action within the group. As the domain knowledge of DOV more or less engenders
    local people&rsquo;s  emotional attachment in the Dulwich area and their motivation
    for participating in the community, fostering a strong sense of community that
    can hold continuing interactions is indeed achievable.</p>
  <p>Developing a healthy CoP requires the interplay of these
    three elements within a community in a balanced manner, because they are all
    dynamically changing over time. Whilst it is important to have the three
    elements controlled to a degree in a CoP, perseverance in one element will help
    ease the potential problems in another. As Wenger et al. (2002, p.47) point
    out, &ldquo;If the domain is clear and the practice is well established, then people
    can come and go without harming the community.&rdquo; Although  this did happen to
    the DOV community at times, the whole community still has continued to evolve
    healthily and prosperously as time has progressed.</p>
  <h3>The seven principles of cultivating a community of practice</h3>
  <p>The success or failure of a community of practice largely
    depends on the objectives of the community, combined with its interests and
    resources. Wenger et al (2002, chap.3) have identified seven specific aspects
    that should be addressed to enable a CoP to flourish. Nevertheless, these
    principles are recurrent aspects of the life of a CoP itself, rather than
    external rules that are to be imposed on the community.</p>
  <h4>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design for evolution</h4>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Because communities are built on existing networks and
    evolve beyond any particular design, the purpose of a design is not to impose a
    structure but to help the community develop.   (<i>Wenger et al, 2002, p.53)</i></p>
  <p>When DOV was first launched, there was already in the Dulwich
    area a real and strong community that has made the evolution of the virtual
    community possible. Historically Dulwich has had a deeply rooted local
    community, so everything was developed based on the existing local connections
    between people who have long resided in south London. When the Web technology
    became available, these people simply participated on-line, and developments
    naturally happened and progressed.</p>
  <p>In other words, when the DOV community was incubated, it
    naturally attracted local people&rsquo;s attention as it was inherently part of their
    lives, rather than something imported from elsewhere. DOV would not have been
    successful without its original local community. Everything that is brought up
    and discussed on DOV, from a piece of local history to an ordinary person&rsquo;s
    sentiment, has the potential to make the community members feel involved and
    form a strong attachment to the area.</p>
  <h4>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open a dialogue between inside and outside
    perspectives</h4>
  <p class="BlockQuote">As a result of this dialogue, the people who understand the
    issues inside the community and have legitimacy within it are also able to see
    new possibilities and can effectively act as agents of change. <i><span
lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">(Wenger et al, 2002, p.55)</span></i></p>
  <p>Being associated with DPG notwithstanding, the editorial
    team of DOV all work for the community on a voluntary basis. They are
    independent from the museum and have a tighter connection with the local
    community than the museum itself, allowing DOV to more easily incorporate
    outside perspectives. The prosperity of the DOV community actually has much to
    do with the team members&rsquo; social networking life in the real world. This helps
    them continuously find interesting people in the wider community, with varied
    backgrounds, who can potentially join the DOV community and contribute articles
    with their own unique local stories. Very often such stories add value to DOV
    by injecting into the community into the community outsiders&rsquo; creative ideas that
    may not have evolved if it was purely a museum blog.</p>
  <p>On one hand, embracing authors from the local community
    helps engage their own friends to read their articles and include more
    comments. This indeed has opened dialogues between inside and outside
    perspectives as DOV serves as a channel for the local community to voice
    themselves. On the other hand, the increasing visibility of local people&rsquo;s
    personal stories helps them get more opportunities to improve their lives.
    Owing to a sense of belonging to DOV, people tend to reciprocate with their
    loyalties to DPG by supporting events or bringing in useful resources to enrich
    the museum programs.</p>
  <h4>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Invite different levels of participation</h4>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Alive communities, whether planned or spontaneous, have a
    coordinator who organizes events and connects community members. But others in
    the community also take on leadership roles. <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">(</span><i>Wenger
      et al, 2002, p.55)</i></p>
  <p>There are typically three main levels of participation in a CoP,
    as in DOV (see Figure 7). The first is at the heart of the community, which
    constitutes a core group of members who are actively involved and devote their
    time taking on projects. As the community develops, the core members take on
    more of the leadership, playing an auxiliary role to the coordinator. The principal
    coordinator in the DOV community, who is one of the authors of this paper,
    often works on encouraging members in the editorial team to take personal
    responsibility for the blog. The editorial team members also benefit from
    writing articles for some local events (e.g., free theater tickets, etc.) and
    they are reasonably sustained.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="liu.fig7.jpg" width="500" height="417" alt="Figure 7" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 7: Degrees of participation in the DOV community.</p>
  <p>The next level outside the core is a group of active
    members. As mentioned above, there have been many local people contributing
    articles to the DOV community. Although some of them have written no more than
    once and have become less involved, others have remained active in the
    community in a long-term manner. The active members from the local community post
    articles illustrating their personal pursuits, as part of a series of stories
    occasionally, and have also helped attract curious readers to leave comments in
    this eclectic community.</p>
  <p>Outside the core and active levels is a large portion of
    peripheral members. They rarely contribute and normally stay on the sidelines
    observing what is happening in the community. The steadily growing hits on the
    DOV Web site may give an idea about the large size of readership. As Wenger et
    al (2002, p.56) explain, these peripheral members are often not as passive as
    we perceive, and in fact they should be seen as an essential part of a CoP.
    Since they mainly participate in DOV as readers, they may continue receiving
    information on the Web site and come to an evening party, a film club event, a
    walk in the local area, a lecture or concert at DPG ,and hopefully enjoy seeing
    the museum collection, etc. That is to say, these people are contributing in
    their own way with their different levels of participation in the community.</p>
  <h4>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop both public and private community spaces</h4>
  <p class="BlockQuote">The heart of a community is the web of relationships among
    community members, and much of the day-to-day occurs in one-on-one exchanges&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Wenger et al, 2002, p.58).</p>
  <p>Wenger et al (2002) point out that a common mistake in
    designing a community is to put too much emphasis on public aspects. Individual
    relationships and private communication are very much worth encouraging in a CoP
    because they often help enrich public events in the community. In the DOV
    community, the coordinator often tries to organize opportunities for private
    interactions and informal networking during an event, or between meetings,
    inside or outside the community. In the Gallery Film events at DPG, for
    instance, participants are offered drink and snacks to mingle with each other
    and are invited to continue the evening after the film somewhere outside the
    Gallery &ndash; to foster private connections among a more limited number of people
    in the community.</p>
  <p>The interplay between the public and private community
    spaces can also be observed in the subtle &ldquo;role changing&rdquo; between being an
    author and a reader on DOV. As mentioned above, there are many local people
    participating in the DOV community as peripheral members; namely, the readers.
    However, their role does not necessarily remain unchanged forever. As an
    example, one reader who has never contributed read an article on DOV about a
    local cooking competition. She was inspired and had her husband enter the
    competition. After her husband was chosen to be the winning cook on a TV
    series, she decided to share this interesting experience on DOV as many of the
    other authors do. She changed her role from long-term reader (private) to author
    (public) only when the opportunity arose.</p>
  <p>This example reveals that DOV readers, even as peripheral
    members having private conversations outside the community, gain their own
    insights by reading articles on DOV and put them to good use. These &ldquo;back
    channel&rdquo; connections, as Wenger et al (2002, p.58) describe them, actually help
    DOV gather momentum and are key to a successful CoP.</p>
  <h4>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus on value</h4>
  <p class="BlockQuote">A key element of designing for value is to encourage
    community members to be explicit about the value of the community throughout
    its lifetime. <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">(</span><i>Wenger et al., 2002, p.60)</i></p>
  <p>Over the last two years of running DOV, the value of this
    virtual community has been widely recognized by the local people in the Dulwich
    area and south London. As was commented by a community member on the DOV Web
    site:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Hi Dulwich OnView &ndash; May this new contributor to your lively
    on-line magazine say how much fun it is to see his copy transferred from the
    page to the screen so quickly, presented with such flair and added links galore
    &ndash; and all before breakfast too. &ndash; I have laid down my quill pen for ever! ...</p>
  <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">(</span><a
href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2009/08/28/the-ideal-cover-girl-for-drawing-attention/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2009/08/28/the-ideal-cover-girl-for-drawing-attention/</a><span
lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">)</span></p>
  <p>It is evident that the value of DOV lies in its facilitating
    very inclusive discussions in the local area and achieves mutual benefits for
    the people involved, DOV itself, and DPG &ndash; their supported museum. The
    editorial team of DOV always endeavors to help promote local people, including
    some artists, musicians, and little-known people who work hard behind the
    scenes, and at the same time celebrating culture, events, and other subjects.
    With these kinds of altruistic and reciprocal motives, the coordinator and some
    core members do have a sense that making the community more valuable is to the
    benefit of everyone. </p>
  <p>Inevitably, there are cases where people wish to promote
    their own business on DOV because it is such a popular community site. This is
    certainly not encouraged, unless it is done in ways that mean the article
    itself will enrich other people&rsquo;s lives and interests in a non-commercial way.
    The efforts made in building many personal networks around the local area
    always result in more contributions being generated for DOV. As Wenger et al
    (2002, p.37) state, it is a poor sort of social capital that allows people to
    make contributions whilst believing that &ldquo;at some point, in some form, they too
    will benefit&rdquo;. This sort of understanding of mutual value will hopefully
    continue to be nurtured and extend in the DOV community over time.</p>
  <h4>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Combine familiarity and excitement</h4>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Routine activities provide the stability for
    relationship-building connections; exciting events provide a sense of common
    adventure  (<i>Wenger et al., 2002, p.62</i>).</p>
  <p>At the heart of the DOV community, DPG is often perceived as
    traditional and conservative with its official Web site presenting exhibition
    and collection related information in a more formal and conventional way. The
    DOV Web site, however, plays a counteractive role, providing the local
    community a focus for interaction with more informal narratives and timely
    discussions. When introducing any exhibitions to the readers, DOV articles
    rarely focus on explaining or explicitly promoting an exhibition. It normally
    provides perspectives from different angles, guiding the readers to look at the
    exhibitions with fresh eyes &ndash; e.g. relating the exhibition to wine (<a
href="http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2009/09/01/best-of-british-wines/">http://dulwichonview.org.uk/2009/09/01/best-of-british-wines/</a>),
    showing how children enjoyed visiting the exhibition, interpreting artworks
    with witty and frank comments, etc. Most of them are presented in a personal
    tone and sometimes challenge the formal way of thinking. In this sense, DOV
    serves as a place providing a feeling of excitement, energy, and pleasure that
    complements the familiarity of the museum Web site.</p>
  <p>As for the DOV itself, the common style of funny and quirky
    articles has settled into a kind of familiarity as the community matures. The
    periodical real-life events held in the Dulwich area can be seen as the
    enthusiasm that is generated to engage more local people and newcomers to join
    the community. Because it always surprises the core/active members when new
    people are attracted to community events, the sense of excitement motivates
    them to continue establishing social networks and aiming to attract even more
    people.</p>
  <h4>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a rhythm for the community</h4>
  <p class="BlockQuote">At the heart of a community is a web of enduring relationship
    among members, but the tempo of their interactions is greatly influenced by the
    rhythm of community events. <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">(</span><i>Wenger et al, 2002, p.62)</i></p>
  <p>The rhythm of a community is the most powerful indicator of
    its aliveness. There are various rhythms in the DOV community &ndash; the number of
    articles being updated per week, the pattern of regular real-life events, the
    frequency of private interactions, the pace of the community&rsquo;s overall
    evolution, etc. Generally speaking, the rhythm of the DOV community is very
    lively, strong, and energetic. There are around 5&ndash;6 new articles uploaded to
    the community each week; i.e., almost one article per day on average.</p>
  <p>This gives DOV a very healthy and vigorous heartbeat,
    rendering a sense of evolution in the community. Because of the considerable
    amount of articles being served to the readers on a weekly basis, a wide range
    of interests can be covered, helping to attract continuous attention from
    different readerships. All this is due to the enthusiastic contribution from
    local people, so in order to make authors feel worthwhile, the editorial team
    has to publish their articles as quickly as possible. By doing so, the
    heartbeat of the DOV community remains rhythmic and energetic over time.</p>
  <p>Very often, DOV articles also announce a future date for a
    follow-up article, allowing readers to anticipate the sequels. The series of
    articles, with a sense of rhythm, not only sustains the readers staying in the
    community in anticipation, but also provides a feeling of familiarity amongst
    the other completely new articles. Typically, there is an article published
    just before and after the Gallery Film events and some other on-gallery
    programs, giving the community a temporal structure, providing participants
    with a sense of progress and achievement. All these rhythms are established in
    different ways, but as Wenger et al (2002, p.63) explain, there is no right
    rhythm for a community and the heartbeat will vary as the community evolves;
    therefore, &ldquo;finding the right rhythm at each stage is key to a community&rsquo;s
    development.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3>The stages of community development</h3>
  <p class="BlockQuote">A community<span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">&rsquo;</span>s development,
    like an individual<span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">&rsquo;</span>s, is rarely smooth. It frequently
    involves painful discoveries, difficult transitions, and learning through
    hard-won experience.<i> (Wenger et al, 2002, p.69)</i></p>
  <p>The ethnographic studies conducted by Wenger et al (2002)
    have provided a developmental model of community of practice which comprises
    the typical five stages of community development: Potential, Coalescing,
    Maturing, Stewardship, and Transformation. Although the ways communities
    experience these stages and the sequence may vary, this model generally
    provides a sense of a community&rsquo;s maturity and informs the challenges of
    running it through its growth, expansion, and transformation. </p>
  <p>Overall, DOV as a community of practice has gone through the
    earlier stages of potential development over the last two years and has reached
    the relatively mature stages of a CoP lifecycle. Observably, DOV is at around
    stage four, namely Stewardship, in which the key issue is sustaining the
    community&rsquo;s momentum
    through its transition of practice, technology, and relationship to the
    organization (ibid, p.104). In relation to this, the DOV coordinator has recently
    undertaken two major tasks aiming to maintain the freshness of the community
    and keep its tone lively and ever-engaging. </p>
  <p>The first task is, as Wenger et al (2002, p. 106) suggest,
    institutionalizing the voice of the community. Communities at their maturity
    often find it necessary to be recognized by the organization and to gain a
    voice in it. Since the DOV community exists to support its associated museum,
    it is important for DOV to become a recognized part of DPG; e.g. through a
    senior management liaison, in order to influence the museum for mutual benefit.
    In light of this, the DOV coordinator recently organized a meeting with the
    Gallery Director, with two other independent professionals who are the authors
    of this paper; the result is a formalized commitment from the Gallery (see Figure
    8). Giving the community this kind of voice, such as an allocation of staff
    time for writing Gallery-related articles on DOV and an increased presence of
    DOV on the DPG Web site, will greatly strengthen the community along the way. </p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="liu.fig8-small.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Figure 8" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 8: The meeting with the DPG director.</p>
  <p>The second task also coincides with what a CoP is suggested
    to address in this stage of community development: to &ldquo;rejuvenate the community&rdquo; (ibid, p. 106). As communities commonly face questions about their future
    direction &ndash; whether to become part of the organization or remain &ldquo;below the surface&rdquo;, whether to stay informal or adopt
    a more systematic approach in their domain, etc. The DOV coordinator has
    pondered these questions since the community&rsquo;s
    Web site, which is a blog, has inevitably buried many of the very precious
    articles in the deeper layers of Web pages. Designing a new Web site for the
    community with a good set of categories seems to serve as a solution
    rejuvenating the community and helping people easily retrieve articles. With
    blogging becoming mainstream nowadays and DOV members having a habit of reading
    articles on the Web, the design of the new DOV Web site needs to take user-related
    issues into account. In considering this, a usability review was conducted, as described
    in the following section.</p>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>In this section, the community activities of DOV have been
    explored in the formal framework of a <i>Community
      of Practice</i> (CoP). DOV presents itself to the outside world as a web-based
    blog, so it is important that this interface aids the community in accessing
    DOV. In the next section a usability review of the DOV Web site is presented,
    aimed at improving the next Web site for DOV.</p>

  <p>As part of the redesign process for the Dulwich OnView (DOV)
    Web site, a usability review was conducted (McDaid, 2009). It is just one tool
    available to a usability expert for use during an iterative user-centered
    design process. The aim is to identify those parts of a design that might
    adversely affect the overall usability of a Web site - usability defined as &ldquo;the
    extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified
    goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of
    use&rdquo;(ISO, 1998). Usable Web sites allow users to attain their goals fully
    without, for example, causing frustration, anxiety or negative feelings towards
    the site.</p>
  <p>Some of the advantages of this process are that it is
    cost-effective, requires no advanced planning, and can be done at an early
    stage of the development process (Nielsen &amp; Molich, 1990). Recommendations
    on how the usability of the site can be improved are based on each usability
    expert&rsquo;s own experience, and supplemented by research-based usability
    guidelines (e.g.: Nielsen &amp; Tahir, 2002; Usability.gov, 2009) and
    recommendations for accessibility (W3C, 1999). In addition, a reviewer should identify
    those elements that meet specific guidelines well.</p>
  <p>Alongside the usability review, it was suggested that other
    user-centered design techniques such as user testing should be undertaken
    during the DOV re-design and development process in order to confirm that the
    terms, labels, and structure of the site were appropriate to the target user
    group. Even at this early stage of the design, the review identified a number
    of inconsistencies in the positioning, organization and labeling of navigational
    elements. Since these areas of concern were highlighted before the main DOV Web
    site development process had begun, they could be addressed easily.</p>
  <p>For the new DOV Web site evaluation, two wireframes of the
    proposed design were available: the homepage and the new posts page. The posts
    page displays the full text, a related image, and the latest comments for a
    post to the site, as well as a description of the author and a text input area
    for new comments to be added.</p>
  <h3>Target end users and context of use</h3>
  <p>The aim of the site owners is that DOV should appeal to a
    broad range of users who through the blog site will discover DPG and the people
    who work there and will ultimately join as Friends of the gallery.</p>
  <p>However, for the review, no detailed demographic information
    regarding the users of the blog was available. In general, the main type of
    visitor was described as a local person whose objective in going to the site
    was to look for a good read with a local connection, information on local
    events, and/or information about ticket sales for DPG events. The age of
    visitors to the site ranged from teenagers, posting comments on articles, to
    older people accessing photographs and posting memories. There are also a
    significant number of international users (Australia, United States of America,
    Canada, Italy, etc.), requesting more information about DPG-related posts or
    trying to make contact with an expert. Therefore, for this review, the target
    user profile in terms of age, gender, educational level, previous technology
    experience and attitude, etc., was not well defined and had to be taken as very
    broad.</p>
  <p>For the same reason, an assumption was made regarding the
    context in which the new Web site would be accessed. This was taken to be an
    average domestic or office environment on either a mid-range laptop or desktop
    computer. It was not suggested that the new site would be accessed, for
    example, using PDAs, iPhones, or other handheld mobile technologies, and
    therefore the design was not reviewed for its usability on a small screen.</p>
  <p>It is generally suggested that the most important elements
    of content for the Web site visitor should be visible immediately on arrival at
    the site; that is, in the first screen of the homepage and without the need to
    scroll down (Nielsen Norman Group, 2009a). In 2009, the most commonly used
    computer screen resolution was estimated to be 1024x768 pixels (Nielsen Norman
    Group, 2009b) and therefore the design was reviewed at this resolution. Even
    when a larger resolution screen is available, it is suggested that, rather than
    filling the whole screen with the browser window, users open multiple windows,
    and therefore reviewing at this resolution is still pertinent even for users
    with higher specification screens. Figure 9 and Figure 10 give an impression of
    how the new design layouts might look when viewed on a 1024x768 pixel screen.</p>

    resolution screen.</p>
  <h3>General findings</h3>
  <p>The report (McDaid, 2009) made a number of recommendations
    regarding the overall layout of the designs and also identified those elements
    of the design that met usability guidelines and those that could be usefully
    revisited. As the review was done on paper-based design wireframes, the quality
    of the interaction in terms of response times, etc., could not be judged at the
    time, although elements in the design that could impact on, for example,
    download time, such as large or numerous images, were highlighted.</p>
  <p>The review found that a number of features of the design
    were generally in line with usability guidelines. In particular, the name, logo
    and tagline of the organization were clearly visible on the homepage and in an
    appropriate area of the screen. The tagline summarized the purpose of the site
    and enabled the visitor to quickly identify this intention.</p>
  <p>The pages also included information regarding the creators
    of the site and how they could be contacted. This information and short
    biographies of the main authors of the posts help to increase the perception of
    the site&rsquo;s trustworthiness. In addition, it was suggested that a &lsquo;privacy
    policy&rsquo; similar to the one on the existing DOV site would increase visitor
    trust.</p>
  <p>Other elements that supported usability included the
    grouping of similar items together, the availability and location of a &lsquo;search&rsquo;
    function, and the inclusion of links to recent, popular, and archive posts with
    fully spelled months to avoid confusion between UK and US formats.</p>
  <h3>Some recommendations</h3>
  <p>The new designs exhibited two main usability issues. These
    related to the allocation of screen space to the different elements of the page
    (main content, navigation, banners, etc.) and inconsistencies in the location,
    organization and labeling of the main navigation links.</p>
  <h4>Screen layout</h4>
  <p>One of the main recommendations was that the space allocated
    to the content of interest to the visitor should be increased and the percentage
    of space allocated to navigation, banners, etc., reduced. Nielsen (2000)
    suggests that as a general rule the main content of a page should take up at
    least 50% of the page area and ideally should be closer to 80%.</p>
  <p>In the new DOV homepage design, it was found that only
    around 25% of the visible content related to the primary user task of finding
    local information. Of this area, over half was taken up by an image, with the
    DOV banner taking up another 17% of the screen area. Added to this, on the new
    post page, only 13% of space was allocated to the local news item, which meant
    only a headline, author, and half a picture were visible.</p>
  <h4>Navigation</h4>
  <p>Consistency is one of the major indicators for usability. It
    is a sign of the cognitive load placed on users when they utilize the site or,
    in other words, how hard they must work to learn and recognize elements of the
    Web site. Regarding the design and location of navigation areas, a number of
    inconsistencies in the placement and naming of links would adversely affect the
    usability of the new Web site.</p>
  <p>The location of the main navigation area differed on the two
    page designs. Inconsistency occurred also in the naming of links and the order
    in which the groups of links were placed on the page. For example, during the
    review there was confusion regarding the difference between &lsquo;Around Dulwich&rsquo;,
    &lsquo;Around Dulwich Links&rsquo;, &lsquo;Links&rsquo; and &lsquo;Environment&rsquo; and why &lsquo;South London People&rsquo;
    sometimes occurs under the heading &lsquo;Around Dulwich&rsquo; and sometimes under &lsquo;Community&rsquo;,
    etc.</p>
  <p>Apart from those links that appeared as buttons, what was
    and was not a link was hard to identify. It was recommended that the visibility
    of text links should be increased both in terms of the format and the use of a
    color that contrasted strongly with the background. The combination of low
    contrast, variable size, and the compact way some of the links were presented
    on the page could have created an accessibility issue for older visitors to the
    site. In general, the usability of text links is increased by the consistent
    use of color and style to indicate that they are clickable, with an alternative
    consistent style to show that a link has been visited. In addition, providing links
    that can be distinguished from the remainder of the page content allows users
    to easily scan sites for the information in which they are interested.</p>
  <p>On the homepage in particular, the placement of the
    navigation buttons gave the impression that there was only one page of
    information on the screen. Only the first article was visible, with all other
    articles accessed by clicking on links rather than scrolling further down the
    page. In fact, the homepage design was over 2,300 pixels long, meaning that
    items such as the &lsquo;featured video&rsquo; were unlikely to be viewed as the user would
    have to scroll down at least two pages to see them, without any indication on
    the first screen that they were there.</p>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>A usability review aims to identify areas which could
    impinge on the usability of a site and cause users to have difficulty or become
    frustrated with it. In extreme cases, this may result in the users not
    returning to a site and potential continued use being lost. Two main usability
    issues were identified at an early stage in the new DOV Web site redesign
    process. These related to the allocation of space to screen real-estate and
    inconsistency in the navigation areas and link text.</p>
  <p>Reviewing the designs near the beginning of the development
    process means that these issues can be addressed more quickly and with minimum
    cost. Many of the latter issues could be mitigated by creating a style guide
    for the site. Ideally, a series of usability reviews should be done along side
    user testing at each stage of an iterative design and development project
    lifecycle.</p>
  <h2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion and
    Future</h2>
  <p>This paper has presented the on-line blog/magazine Dulwich
    OnView (DOV), that is associated with Dulwich Picture Gallery (DPG). The
    facility is believed to be unique amongst museums with its thriving local
    community. It is a model that other museums could follow if there is an
    existing real community and at least one &lsquo;champion&rsquo; that has the time and
    ability to take a sustained lead role. The informality and activity of DOV
    contrasts well and appropriately with the formality and slower pace of the DPG
    Web site.</p>
  <p>The paper has examined DOV in the context of a Community of
    Practice (CoP), which includes three fundamental elements, seven major
    principles, and five stages of community development. All of these apply to DOV
    to a large degree, so although CoP is mainly seen in a scientific, engineering,
    business, or educational context, the model can be extended to the museum field
    as well.</p>
  <h3>The future of DOV</h3>
  <p>DOV has been developing and continues to expand. A redesign
    of the Web site is being considered as the number of articles increases and
    needs better organization and categorization. A usability review of a proposed
    Web interface has been undertaken. </p>
  <p>DOV is always striving to reach new readers and find new
    authors. Reviews are encouraged with the offer of free tickets. A competition
    is planned to create an image of DPG in the style of Paul Nash, in association
    with a coming exhibition. It is intended to display submissions on DOV, with a
    short biography of the participant. Public voting will be undertaken using the
    comment boxes at the end of each article, and a prize will be awarded at the
    end of the exhibition. This will be promoted via the DPG emailing list, amongst
    other places.</p>
  <p>DOV&rsquo;s visitor figures have increased consistently since its launch,
    apart from annual winter dips in numbers (see Figure 2 earlier in the paper).
    This pattern is likely to continue as interest in DOV grows among the local and
    wider community.</p>
  <p>Recently there have been increasing contributions by DPG
    senior management. In the past, contributions from DPG staff have been somewhat
    irregular and random. It would be beneficial if articles were produced from all
    DPG departments, for example. In addition, the large and increasing number of
    articles on DOV, many still relevant as time progresses, need to be organized
    more conveniently into different sections, covering various interests. It is
    planned that one of these will be DPG itself (see Figure 9 above). In this
    case, DPG will probably link directly to this section rather than to the main
    page of DOV. From the DOV viewpoint, it can be seen as a subset of the local
    community&rsquo;s interests. From the DPG viewpoint, this section could be considered
    as a more informal and dynamic part of the DPG site. It is hoped and intended
    that the symbiotic synergy between DOV and DPG will continue for the
    foreseeable future.</p>
