        <p class="Author">Paul F. Marty, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, School of Information 
          Studies, Florida State University, USA</p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
         <p class="AbstractText">This paper uses results from a study of information 
          professionals currently working in museums to determine the changing 
          role of the museum Webmaster. It explores the past, present, and future 
          of the museum Webmaster, and examines how the responsibilities have 
          changed since 1997. It presents an analysis of how present-day museum 
          Webmasters view their jobs, and argues that the museum Webmaster of 
          the future should assume the role of the user's advocate in order 
          to ensure that the needs of the users of on-line museums continue to 
          be met. The skills and abilities of the museum Webmaster have evolved 
          from a more technology-oriented to a more user-centered perspective; 
          future Webmasters should acquire the necessary expertise to determine 
          the needs of the museum's users and then create museum Web sites 
          that best meet those needs.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>It has been seven years since the first Museums and 
          the Web conference, and what it means to be a Webmaster in a museum 
          has changed dramatically over those years. The notion that the museum 
          Webmaster should be concerned only with designing and developing Web 
          pages is now as anachronistic as the term Webmaster itself. Modern 'information 
          professionals' in a museum must possess expertise in collections 
          management, database systems, metadata standards, Web-casting, interface 
          design, and data mining. Moreover, they must be able to apply those 
          skills for multiple audiences, inside and outside the museum, over the 
          Internet or on the museum's Intranet.</p>
        <p>When simple Web design responsibilities can be delegated 
          to a twelve-year-old child, what is the role of the 'new' 
          museum Webmaster in the modern museum? This paper will answer that question 
          by presenting results from a study of the information literacy skills 
          of information professionals working in museums today. This study was 
          designed and implemented by the author in 2003 to </p>
      <ol class="listwithbullets">
        <li> help museum administrators in the hiring 
            of new personnel and in the planning of future directions for their 
            museums; and </li>
        <li> help in the education of a new generation 
            of students interested in the use of information technology (IT) in 
            museums. This study represents the first step in a long-term research 
            project to determine and provide the information literacy skills that 
            future museum professionals will need.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>During the summer of 2003, twenty-one museum 
          professionals were interviewed to determine their information literacy 
          needs and skills. All of these individuals were responsible in some 
          fashion for managing information resources, tools, or technologies in 
          a museum. Most of them were responsible for manipulating information 
          on-line over an intranet, on the Internet, or both. The interviews were 
          analyzed using grounded theory methods to chart the rise of the information 
          professional in the museum. The results of this analysis can be used 
          to answer questions such as: 
      </p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li>  What is the role of the information professional 
            in the museum?</li>
        <li>  What are the information literacy skills 
            museum professionals need to effectively manage the information resources, 
            tools, and technologies they use on a daily basis?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Answers to these more general questions will be addressed 
          in a forthcoming article that will cover the characteristics of the 
        information professional working in the museum.</p>
      <p>This paper focuses on one particular aspect that emerged 
          from this study: the changing role of the museum Webmaster. Ten of the 
          information professionals interviewed in this study used the term 'Webmaster' 
          when referring to their own job titles. By their own accounts, however, 
          their jobs required them to do significantly more than simply design 
          and develop Web pages. The descriptions they provided of their responsibilities 
          and the ways their jobs have changed over the years should be extremely 
        useful to the Museums and the Web community. </p>
      <p>This paper is organized into three sections. First, 
          we explore the past of the museum Webmaster, examining the changing 
          nature of the Webmaster's responsibilities since 1997. While necessarily 
          brief, this review serves to highlight the need for museum Webmasters 
          to be aware of the changing needs and expectations of visitors to museum 
        Web sites. </p>
      <p>Secondly, we explore the present of the museum Webmaster, 
          drawing upon interviews with information professionals currently working 
          in museums. In their own words, a representative sample of museum Webmasters 
          tell us about their changing skills, needs, and expectations with respect 
        to the daily challenges of being museum Webmasters.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, we explore the future of the museum Webmaster, 
          presenting a hypothetical argument about the role museum Webmasters 
          will need to play over the next few years. While necessarily speculative, 
          this section argues that museum Webmasters will need to assume the role 
          of user advocate, and take steps to ensure that museum Web sites in 
          the future continue to serve the needs of the museum's on-line 
        visitors. </p>
      <h1>The Past: The Museum Webmaster Since 1997</h1>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Perhaps there is a new role in museums for an 'information 
          manager' who is charged with caring for the museum's information. 
          The information manager should know standards, understand how they can 
          be implemented for each museum system, and, most important, advocate 
          their use within the museum. Few, if any, museums have a staff position 
          with this title now, but the function will become increasingly important 
          as we integrate information systems into our daily work</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Hermann,  1997, p.75</span></p>
      <p>Today, more than seven years after this passage was 
          published, most museums still do not have the luxury of a dedicated 
          information handler, information manager, or chief information officer. 
          Nevertheless, many museum administrators, even those unable to afford 
          to hire a dedicated information specialist, understand the need for 
          someone on their staff to be able to cope with information management 
          issues. They know full well that if a museum is to be an active participant 
          in the information society, someone at the museum needs to be well versed 
          in metadata standards, controlled vocabularies, database design, and 
          the latest Internet issues. While some technical jobs (including Web 
          design) can be and will continue to be outsourced, museums that do not 
          have at least some information technology skills in-house will likely 
          find themselves paying increasingly expensive consultants if they wish 
          to continue to meet the constantly evolving demands of their information-savvy 
        audiences.</p>
      <p>In many museums, the museum Webmaster is often the 
          only person who possesses the necessary skills to satisfy the demand 
          for on-line access to museum resources. Sometimes this is because the 
          museum Webmaster was specifically hired because of his or her IT skills; 
          sometimes this is because the most technically-skilled museum employee 
          was selected to become the museum's Webmaster. In either case, 
          it is quite often to the museum Webmaster that museum directors turn 
          when they wish, for example, to contribute data about their museum's 
          collections to an on-line consortium. It is usually the museum Webmaster 
          who will be expected to take the lead in converting the museum's 
          electronic resources to the required data format. Far from being a passive 
          encoder of static content, the museum Webmaster is required to take 
          an active role in the development of the museum's digital content, 
          dynamically linking collections data to on-line information systems. 
        How, and when, did this happen?</p>
      <p>In most ways, the evolution of the museum Webmaster 
          and the use of the Web by museums parallels the evolution of Webmasters 
          and the world wide Web in general. The heyday of the dot-com boom - 
          where young programmers could earn top-dollar simply based on their 
          ability to code HTML - is long gone; with it, perhaps, went the original 
          notion of what a Webmaster actually does. The modern Webmaster (for 
          want of a better term) has to be able to do much more than code HTML. 
          Given the increasing prevalence and capabilities of WYSIWYG Web site 
          authoring tools, the act of creating Web sites has become technically 
        nearly trivial. </p>
      <p>To be successful in today's information society, 
          the modern Webmaster has to be able to position an organization's 
          resources in a rapidly changing on-line environment so that the right 
          information is delivered to the right people at the right time. This 
          is not, and never was, a matter of simple programming. Doing this well 
          requires a wide variety of skills, some technical and some not; in particular, 
          the modern Webmaster needs skills in information organization and information 
          management above all others. The museum Webmaster is no exception to 
        this rule. </p>
      <p>Over the past seven years, museum Web sites, have become 
          increasingly complex. Even before the first Museums and the Web conference, 
          museums were well on their way to having well-established Web presences 
          (Bowen, 1997). In the mid-1990s, the number of museum Web sites grew 
          rapidly; during these early years, museum Web sites were often mere 
          on-line brochures. This changed quickly, however, as more museum professionals 
          adopted the latest interactive technologies for their on-line exhibits. 
          No longer a collection of passive text and images, the on-line museum 
          landscape became more complex, more interactive, infinitely more interesting, 
        and much more challenging. </p>
      <p>Museum professionals and museum visitors both saw great 
          potential in the future of museum Web sites. Virtual museums offered 
          visitors new opportunities to examine digital representations of museums 
          artifacts - opportunities that could not be duplicated in the physical 
          museum (Schwarzer, 2001; Schweibenz, 1998). Museums could offer unprecedented 
          access to their collections (Cameron, 2001); instead of static information 
          pages, on-line museums could offer interactive exhibits dynamically 
          linked with data from the museum's collections management systems 
          (Besser, 1997). Museum visitors, curators, and other experts could interact 
          on-line and have virtual experiences spanning time and space (Paolini, 
          2000; Galani &amp; Chalmers, 2002). Educational opportunities were dramatically 
          enhanced by new on-line technologies (Teather &amp; Wilhelm, 1999; Rayward 
        &amp; Twidale, 2000; Adams, et al. 2001; Frost, 2001; Bennett &amp; 
        Trofenko, 2002). In more ways than can be counted, the concept of the 
        Wired Museum revolutionized the very idea of what the museum should 
        provide on the world wide Web (Jones-Garmil, 1997; Bearman &amp; Trant, 
        2000; Marty, Rayward, &amp; Twidale, 2003). </p>
      <p>These increased potentials, however, led to increased 
          expectations. If a museum were to survive in the new world of the Internet, 
          a museum simply had to have a Web site &#8212; and that Web site could 
          not survive long as unchanging, outdated pages of static text. Museum 
          visitors, as well as museum professionals, were becoming more Web-savvy; 
          they expected museums to have high-quality, fully-interactive Web sites. 
          To survive in the new world of the Web, museum Web sites had to evolve 
          from passive pages of static content to highly interactive on-line exhibits. 
          At the same time, museum Webmasters had to evolve from passive producers 
          of on-line material to active participants in the development of dynamic, 
        interactive Web sites.</p>
      <p>To meet these new expectations, museum Webmasters had 
          to learn many new skills. They had to understand the latest data standards 
          and metadata schemes to participate in data sharing initiatives (Bearman, 
          1994; Gladney, et al., 1998; Moen, 1998; Perkins, 2001). They had to 
          learn the latest digital imaging techniques (Mintzer, et al., 2001) 
          and the best ways of applying multimedia technologies in the exploration 
          of digital images of museum artifacts (Douma &amp; Henchman, 2000). 
          They had to experiment with innovative interface designs, resulting 
          in projects such as the Smithsonian's <i>Revealing Things</i> 
        or <i>History Wired</i> (Gillard, 2002). They had to learn the best 
          ways of integrating on-line activities with in-house experiences, such 
          as the Minneapolis Museum of Art's <i>Restoration On-line</i> 
        project (Sayre, 2000). Suddenly, to succeed in the new world of the 
        Web, on-line museum projects required the involvement of extremely skilled 
        museum Webmasters. </p>
      <p>As on-line museum projects became more sophisticated, 
          it quickly became clear that technical skills, while important, were 
          only half the story: the truly skilled museum Webmaster needed to bring 
          more to the table than mere technical skills. As museum Web sites became 
          more and more interactive, museum Webmasters needed to know more and 
          more about their audiences. What are the information needs and wants 
          of the on-line museum visitors? Are their needs being met? Are they 
          satisfied with the on-line museum experience? Is the museum offering 
          them what they want? As the number of on-line museum visitors grew, 
          the answers to these questions became more and more important - and 
        yet for many of these questions there were no good answers.</p>
      <p>This situation placed museum Webmasters in a difficult 
          situation: they found themselves developing extensive on-line offerings 
          despite a critical lack of data about the needs of their on-line visitors 
          (Cunliffe, Kritou, &amp; Tudhope, 2002). Even as late as 1999, three-quarters 
          of art museum Web sites were being designed and developed without the 
          slightest attention paid to the needs and wants of their on-line visitors 
          (Pierroux, 1999). Not understanding these needs meant that it was not 
          possible for museum Webmasters to know whether they were creating sites 
          that actually satisfied the needs of their intended users (Hertzum, 
          1998). This lack of useful data was not only a nightmare for museum 
          Webmasters, but also a potentially disaster for the on-line museum community 
        as a whole.</p>
      <p>One of the disadvantages of not knowing your users 
          is not being able to dispel myths about who they are and what they want. 
          One of the myths faced by museum Webmasters was that visitors to on-line 
          museum Websites would no longer feel compelled to visit physical museums. 
          As museum Webmasters worked to create elaborate Web sites that provided 
          access to a wide variety of museum resources, they faced early opposition 
          from individuals who believed that the on-line world posed a threat 
          to the physical museum (for some information on this phenomenon, refer 
          to McKenzie, 1997; Bowen, Bennet, &amp; Johnson 1998; Bowen, 1999). 
          That this myth took so long to dispel was directly related to the lack 
          of solid data about the needs, activities, and preferences of on-line 
          museum visitors. Recently studies have gathered excellent data showing 
          that visitors to virtual museums are also visitors to physical museums 
          (Kravchyna &amp; Hastings, 2002), and it seems that at last this persistent 
          worry may fade away. Nevertheless, the fear that virtual museums will 
          in some way harm physical installations serves as an excellent example 
          of how incomplete data about on-line visitors can pose a threat to the 
        on-line museum community.</p>
      <p>Despite the recent increase in visitor needs assessment 
          studies, the incompleteness of available data about the users of museum 
          Websites remains a serious concern for museum Webmasters. Recent studies 
          have focused on the need for museum Websites to become more user-centered, 
          but they cannot become so until museum Webmasters learn more about the 
          needs and expectations of their on-line visitors (Streten, 2000; Hertzum, 
          1998). If a museum Website is truly to serve the needs of its on-line 
          audience (an audience that for many museums easily outnumbers their 
          physical visitors), museum Webmasters must have at least as much data 
          about their on-line visitors as museum educators and curators have about 
          their face-to-face visitors. While recent studies have taught us a great 
          deal about the demographics of the on-line visitor (Booth, 1999; Chadwick 
        &amp; Boverie, 1999; Ockuly, 2003), we still have much more to learn 
          about what virtual visitors do, how often, why, when and with whom. 
          To have a successful on-line project, it is important for the museum 
          Webmaster to bring these and all relevant data to the project planning 
        table. </p>
      <p>As well, museum Webmasters need to be conversant with 
          theoretical areas such as interface design, human-computer interaction, 
          and usability engineering (Streten, 2000; Cunliffe, Kritou, &amp; Tudhope, 
          2002). As museum Web sites become more sophisticated, it becomes more 
          important that museum Webmasters be able to evaluate the designs to 
          determine whether they are usable (Garzotto, Matera, &amp; Paolini, 
          1998; Harms &amp; Schweibenz, 2001). The recent interest in usability 
          evaluations for museum Web sites is a good start (Cleary, 2000; Peacock, 
          2000; Semper et al, 2000; Arora et al., 2001); nevertheless, museum 
          Webmasters must be encouraged to pursue usability studies with their 
          own sites if museum Websites are truly to meet the needs of the on-line 
        visitor.</p>
      <p>As the design of museum Web sites becomes more complex 
          and more interactive, museum Webmasters find themselves needing a broader 
          spectrum of skills: not just technical skills, but analytical abilities 
          to determine user needs as well. The audience could include external 
          museum visitors or internal museum employees, as many museums now use 
          internal intranets to manage their own information resources. It is 
          extremely important that museum Webmasters, who are often charged with 
          the design and management of both intranet and Internet sites, be aware 
          of their representative users at all times and build sites that meet 
        the needs of their users. </p>
      <p>The need to know the user has totally changed the job 
          of museum Webmasters. They now spend less time concerned with the technical 
          requirements of creating Web pages and more time dealing with audience 
          analyses, information needs assessments, requirements analyses, and 
          usability evaluations. In this regard, the museum Webmaster is becoming 
          more of an information architect (Dillon, 2002; Rosenfeld &amp; Morville, 
        2002) or user-centered designer (Landauer, 1997). </p>
      <h1>The Present: Interviewing Information Professionals in Museums</h1>
      <p class="BlockQuote">A museum cannot afford to sustain many programmers 
          and developers. The industry is changing too fast. You want to be able 
          to take a boutique approach to get the skills in when you need them 
          [and] when you want them. The notion that a couple of people who know 
          Web development can keep up with everything in the back office of a 
          museum is ludicrous. It requires elasticity of staffing and a certain 
        collegial critical mass to really keep up with that stuff. </p>
      <p>With these words, an information professional currently 
          working in a museum proclaims the death of old-fashioned Web design. 
          This quotation (as well as all the ones that follow) comes from a study 
          conducted by the author in 2003 of twenty-one information professionals 
          working in a museum. This primary goal of this study was to analyze 
          the information literacy skills of information professionals in museums, 
          but since a majority (15 of 21) of the individuals interviewed were 
          either Webmasters themselves (10 of 21) or museum professionals who 
          worked closely with Webmasters on a daily basis (5 of 21), their interviews 
        offer valuable insights into the evolution of museum Webmasters. </p>
      <p>The twenty-one information professionals who participated 
          in this study engaged in semi-structured interviews with the author, 
          each lasting approximately one hour. These information professionals 
          held various jobs (including new media specialists, Webmasters, project 
          managers, and CIOs) in different types of museums (from small to large, 
          including cultural heritage, natural history, science, art, and children's 
          museums), and had worked in museums from anywhere from eighteen months 
          to thirty years. The interviews were analyzed using qualitative analysis 
          methods informed by a grounded theory approach. From this analysis comes 
          a picture of the life of the museum Webmaster and the opinion of these 
        individuals about the skills needed by Webmasters in modern museums.</p>
      <h2>Responsibilities of the Museum Webmaster</h2>
      <p>According to these interviews, therefore, what does 
          a museum Webmaster do? The following quotations represent several viewpoints 
        on the job of the museum Webmaster.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I manage the [museum's] Website and manage the 
          day-to-day updates and maintenance of the Website, and special projects 
          related to the [museum's] Website, ranging from putting the museum's 
          collections on-line to creating on-line-based marketing materials with 
        our marketing department, a range of things.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I am the technical 
          authority for the museum in matters of the Web site and the </span>materials 
          that go up on the Web. I do some Web production myself, and help others 
          in the museum to do Web production in house. I oversee contractors who 
          we pay to do Web production for us. [...] Part of the job is more of 
          a content manager to help to work with the staff of the museum to develop 
        the perfect content for the Web site, and kind of decide what that is.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I oversee the technical aspects of our Website 
          and also try to set some of the directions 
          for the architecture and usability and the way it presents itself to 
        the outside public.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">As Webmaster I</span> 
        have to manage the flow of information from server to workstation, managing 
        and coordinating the review policies and review committees. I also have 
        to do some development for our museum systems. I have to manage our 
        collections information system as it relates to approved Web data from 
        that system. I have to pay attention to administrative tasks, security 
        rules set forth [by the IT office], and I have to do periodic system 
        administration on servers. I have to test products, review products. 
        I sit on several working groups for product assessment [including] digital 
        asset management systems, Web content management systems, collections 
        information systems, and those sorts of things.</p>
      <p>Thus the museum Webmaster must be able to do much more 
          than design and build Web pages. This is not to say that technical skills 
          are not important. Every museum Webmaster interviewed emphasized the 
          importance of technology in the job, and stressed the amount of time 
          spent solving technology problems and dealing with other technology 
          issues. Every individual, for example, had a story to tell about improving 
          bandwidth, installing streaming video servers, installing cache servers, 
          scripting pages to allow for more complicated interactivity, or the 
          like. What was clear from the interviews, however, was that the successful 
          museum Webmaster must develop many new skills, some technical, and some 
        not. </p>
      <h2>Driven to Learn New Skills</h2>
      <p>The acquisition of some of these skills was made necessary 
          by the industry-wide transition of Web sites (whether museum Web sites 
          or not) from static pages of print-like material to interactive pages 
          driven by new technologies. Not only has this transition required new 
          skills and abilities to cope with new technologies, but it also has 
          required a change in mindset for both museum Webmasters and other museum 
        employees as they grapple with the ramifications of interactivity. </p> <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">It is a big challenge for [many museum professionals] 
          to understand the difference between publishing 
          for a book, and publishing for a non-linear platform [such as the Web]. 
        </p> <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">When I first came here, 
          I was making the switch between print and Web work. And now I'm 
          trying to lea</span>rn using databases, ASP, interactive sites, a lot 
        heavier scripting than when I first came here.</p>
      <p>Museum Webmasters found themselves acquiring other 
          new skills as technological advances allowed them to automate older, 
          more time-consuming aspects of their jobs. Automation allowed many to 
          free up a significant percentage of their time - time that was quickly 
          consumed by other responsibilities. As the content of Web pages became 
          more dynamic, for example, museum Webmasters found themselves dealing 
          with issues of project management and interpersonal relations more frequently 
        than they faced typical programming challenges.</p> <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">The biggest part of my job when I first started 
          was updating the calendar. It's gone. I don't 
          do that any more. It's done by an application. The people who 
          own the content for the calendar just go type it into a Web application: 
        it does itself.</p> <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">There's a tendency 
          to want to build automated tools to decentralize Web development or 
          at least the</span> updating of the Web site. Whereas before, early 
          on in Web development, the Webmaster would be the person who would write 
          all the HTML and somebody would say 'hey I have all this information 
          to post to the Web site' so that would just get written directly 
          into the source code, now what I've seen in my own role and heard 
          from other Web managers that I've talked to is that there is more 
          of a desire to build systems that will give a Web interface that will 
          let people update their own content areas of the Web site. And so I 
          think that that means that my role has to be understanding more broadly 
          what the current and future needs of the departments are going to be 
          so I can build systems that will let them do what they need with their 
          parts of the Web site. I think this means looking farther ahead to some 
          extent and just being a little bit more involved in whatever time this 
          frees up from writing code to try to be a partner in finding new content 
          areas of the Web site and kind of fleshing out what we offer on the 
        Web as opposed to just focusing on the technical side.</p>
      <h2>A Necessary Change in Attitude</h2>
      <p>These changes shift the museum Webmaster's focus 
          from inherent self-sufficiency to needing to be able to work with the 
          correct people at the correct time. For many museum Webmasters, the 
          possibilities offered by new technical capabilities came as a bit of 
          a surprise. Understanding the potential of new approaches to Web design, 
          in particular the dynamic nature of content management, took time, and 
        required, among other things, a change in attitude.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteauthor">I think one of the things that we've really 
          done a good job of is expanding our idea of what's available to 
          us. You know, we really thought in terms of HTML in the beginning, very 
          simple Web pages that didn't involve any scripting. They weren't 
          really relying on dynamic content. [Now] we've really stretched 
          that to the point where that same medium is really behaving more like 
          a set of applications. It's gotten far more complex. That was 
          around before, but what needed to happen was an attitude shift. We really 
          needed to start thinking about how can we make this medium really serve 
        the needs of the entire staff. </p>
      <p>This "attitude shift" can be clearly seen 
          in the way other museum Webmasters describe their jobs and how those 
          jobs have changed over time. In particular, the individuals interviewed 
          stressed changes to the way they approached problems they faced on the 
          job, how they began new projects, faced problems, and found solutions. 
      </p> <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">My job has changed. It used to be more for me 
          about basic updates to the Web site, and there the only information 
          I would need is if there were a coding problem I had a question with 
          and I would have to go out on the Web and find it, and now that's 
          become more about project planning and strategic planning, having the 
          Web there as a resource, as sort of like the 
          boxed library on the desk, has been especially helpful just to see what's 
        out there and as something to kick start ideas.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">We don't know 
          the right answer when we start [a Web design project], and maybe even 
          by the time we finish we don't kn</span>ow the right answer, but 
          an awareness of what the options are [...] to research those and try 
          to come to some point of conclusion, having that internally, having 
          that on the museum staff is really important to the way we work, so 
          that we're not dependent on contractors and vendors selling us 
          their solutions instead of looking at what's [...] readily available 
        out there.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">The job has developed in a variety of different ways. 
          I think maybe part of the reason for that is that this is such a new 
          field, and where [my job] started as just a Webmaster job initially, 
          and then because of my involvement with some of the software projects 
          for exhibits it expanded to educational technology, and like I said, 
          I think the focus seems to shift depending on what the key projects 
        are at any given time. </p>
      <h2>Constantly Shifting Job Requirements</h2>
      <p>These changes are forcing museum Webmasters to concentrate 
          even more on content management in the daily workings of their job than 
          they ever did before. The practice of design and the skills of the Web 
          developer are shifting from the more technical level of computer programming 
        to the more conceptual level of information architecture. </p> <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Design is becoming less and less of the powerhouse 
          it was in the early days of the Web [...] those skills are less important 
          than the overall architecting of the Web site, which 
        is the much harder skill.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">[I succeeded because] 
          I knew how to handle information. Forget about the technology. Anybody 
          can learn the technology. It's a lot more difficult to 
        learn information.</p>
      <p>This shift in the nature of the museum Webmaster job, 
          combined with the ability to automate previous job responsibilities, 
          has even inspired some museum Webmasters to write themselves out of 
        a job (a circumstance that they describe as "exciting").</p> <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">There's a certain level of excitement over 
          the ability to be able to do something once and really reuse that so 
          that the next time around you can spend more time doing something more 
          interesting. One of the things we're always trying to do is take 
          the boring parts of our jobs and automate them, so that we never have 
          to do them again. And to be perfectly honest I think I've written 
        myself out of a job maybe four times since I've been here. </p>
      <p>Writing oneself out a job, as in this example, is not 
          seen by museum Webmasters as a bad thing at all. By relieving themselves 
          of some of the tedium of Web design, they are allowed to focus on new 
          applications, new principles, and new areas of interest. The mere fact 
          that they can write themselves out of a job shows the changing expectations 
          of their clientele, both outside and inside the museum, and reflects 
          the increased support provided to the museum Webmaster in order to meet 
        these expectations.</p> <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">People expect things to be bigger, faster, flashier, 
          and more interactive. That's pretty much been the trend I've 
        seen going on.</p> <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">[Our IT department] 
          has gotten so much support</span> that we have been able to get involved 
          in everything. The more we reach out, the more people expect higher 
        quality, and more inclusion [of the IT department] in projects.</p>
      <h2>Constantly Changing Expectations</h2>
      <p>In many ways, these changing expectations are due to 
          a growing demand for Web projects from both museum visitors and museum 
        employees.</p> <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">The demand is always growing, at least is has 
          been for the past five years. [&#8230;] People are starting to rely 
          on [the IT department] more, and as we face budget cuts and as we face 
          restrictions on what we can do in other places, instead of printing 
          a brochure, people might think 'let's 
        put that on-line instead' and so our demand has gone up.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Even very small, very focused museums are branching 
          out and putting things on the Web as an outreach program. We in our 
          museum find that a lot of our visitors go to the Web first for information 
          about where we are, and hours, and programs, and things like that. So 
          I think as the general population learns to go to the Web pages instead 
          of the yellow pages for more information then museums are forced to 
          have a Web presence and to pay a lot of attention to what it looks like 
        and how it works.</p> <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Five years ago we went 
          around looking for people to put things on the Website, now we 
          have a list that reaches out almost a year with people with requests 
          for the Website. [&#8230;] [Back then] the time horizon for a new project 
          was about two weeks. Now we're looking at about a year. If you 
          came to me with a brand new idea, and we thought it was a perfectly 
        good idea, we might get to it in a year.</p>
      <p>These expectations reflect changes in how museum professionals 
          think about the importance of on-line offerings. As the value of the 
          on-line museum becomes more and more obvious, the museum Webmaster is 
        more likely to assume a position of importance. </p>
      <p class=BlockQuoteAuthor>People in our museum at least are really catching 
          up, in maybe not skills but mode of thinking, to the relative importance 
          of the on-line offerings. And when I say relative importance, what I 
          mean is comparing numbers of people that come to the Website vs. that 
          come to the physical museum. [&#8230;] There is some recognition that 
        this is really important.</p>
      <h2>Meeting New Demands</h2>
      <p>To meet these new demands and face these changing expectations, 
          the museum Webmaster must become involved in nearly all aspects of museum 
          operations. The key to successful Web design is early integration of 
          the museum Webmaster into the project development lifecycle. If integration 
          is to work, then two things must happen. First<b>,</b> other museum 
          employees must learn more about the role of the museum Webmaster, and 
          understand the role of the museum Webmaster in the successful implementation 
        of many different types of museum projects. </p>
      <p class=BlockQuoteAuthor>There's an awareness of some of the things that 
          are possible, but not an awareness of the environment it is all happening 
          in, not an awareness of the surrounding issues. We find it always kind 
          of our responsibility to make people aware of some of those things as 
          ideas come up. Our role is definitely a two way role. There are very 
          few projects that come in [to the IT department] and get finished without 
          some modification, without some bit of added insight or added perspective 
          from our viewpoint, being the people who are really familiar with the 
        technology.</p>
      <p>Secondly, museum Webmasters must acquire the ability 
          to work well with others on a variety of projects. This includes working 
          with other employees within the museum and other individuals outside 
        the museum, from on-line visitors to subcontractors. </p> 
		<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">[When we got email and the Internet] that 
          revolutionized how the interoffice workings worked and also how we dealt 
        with the outside world.</p>
      <p class=BlockQuoteAuthor>[My job is to] run and administrate the Web server. 
          There are approximately thirty other people who do design work for our 
          site, and so I also manage [the uploading of their work] and help them 
        with they have problems.</p> 
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">My whole job is basically 
          deciding what to put on the net and how to put it on the net. I don't 
          do the programming. We subcontract the programmers, and I call 
          the programmers, and say, 'Can you make it do this?', and 
          they say, 'Yes', and I say, 'Well, can you make it 
          do that?', and they say 'No, but we can make it do this 
        instead.'</p>
      <p>Museum Webmasters already have experience working with 
          on-line museum visitors, as many Webmasters are already the first line 
          of contact for people e-mailing the museum, requesting assistance or 
        information (cf. Gaia, 2001). </p>
      <p class=BlockQuoteAuthor>[As Webmaster] I have a public role in dealing with 
          e-mail. All kinds of stuff comes into the Webmaster. I'm the first 
          contact point for people who ask a lot of questions. So I feel that 
          I have a public role as that first contact point as I get all that e-mail 
          that comes in: general questions, crazy questions, good questions, all 
          kinds of things, and the first line of defense there, that role has 
        a bit of a PR slant to it.</p>
      <h2>Working as Information Professionals</h2>
      <p>Successfully working with others to design and develop 
          information management projects means learning skills that are much 
          more difficult than simple technological know-how. Figuring out what 
          needs to be done is usually more challenging than figuring out how to 
        do it technologically.</p> <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">[As part of project planning,] we sat down and 
          spoke for a half hour to an hour, and I took notes about what kinds 
          of data she keeps, what kinds she needs to additional keep that she 
          isn't able to right now, what she would need, what kind of reports 
          she would need, things like that. And then I went back and put together 
          as best as I could what I thought she had agreed to, and they I go back 
          and show her and she says 'no, instead 
          of this I need that changed to that' and then I tweak it and then 
          I go back and there is an iterative process that we go through where 
        she reviews it and we make changes and review those changes.</p> <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">You need to be able 
          to receive the requirements given to you and be able to query and find 
          out in more detail what the real requirements are. A lot of time people 
          think they are telling you what they need, but you need to be 
          able to probe it to find out really what's underneath that. I 
          think the requirements gathering for specific needs is the most challenging 
        part of any information job.</p>
      <p>In developing these skills, the museum Webmaster is 
          taking a huge step on the road to becoming a true information professional 
          in the museum. The museum Webmaster is rapidly becoming the one individual 
          who has not only the technical skills to get the job done, but also 
          the practice and experience needed for working with all walks of users 
        to satisfy constantly changing needs and expectations.</p>
      <p>Users of today's museum Web sites expect to 
          find the best state of the art, interactive multimedia technologies 
          when they visit a museum's Web site. As these expectations evolve 
          and become more elaborate, Webmasters will need skills in requirements 
          capture, needs assessment, survey data analysis, interaction design, 
          and usability evaluation. Only then will they build sites that truly 
        satisfy the needs of the museum's on-line visitors. </p>
      <h1>The Future: The Museum Webmaster and User Advocacy</h1>
      <p class=BlockQuoteAuthor>[In the future,] technology is just going to be a 
          stepping stone; people will be experts at technology and interface design 
          or human-computer interaction, or people will be specialists in technology 
          and education, or [...] I could go on and on, but different aspects 
        where technology is a means to an end and not the end itself.</p>
      <p>One of the main problems with predicting the future 
          of the museum Webmaster is that no one seems to have a clear idea of 
          where the museum Webmaster belongs in any given museum hierarchy. Should 
          the Webmaster be part of a standalone IT department or integrated within 
          some other section of the museum, such as the education department, 
          administration, or perhaps new media? Each museum seems to take a different 
        approach</p>
      <p>Perhaps the problem is that the Webmaster has traditionally 
          been seen as a neutral occupation. For most museums, the Webmaster occupies 
          a unique, perhaps hallowed, spot, working with other museum employees 
          or departments to develop content for on-line dissemination. The museum 
          Webmaster position, by definition, crosses intra-institutional boundaries 
          and defies simple categorization. This must end. If the modern museum 
          is to meet the demands of its on-line audience, the museum Webmaster 
        can no longer afford to remain neutral. </p>
      <p>If the museum Website is to function in the future, 
          the museum Webmaster will have to become extremely biased in one particular 
          direction &#8211; toward the user. The museum Webmaster must become 
          the user's advocate. The museum Webmaster is most likely the employee 
          best suited to become an information professional with the necessary 
          skills to interpret user needs and ensure the museum's on-line 
          offerings actually meet those needs. The user typically has no voice 
          within the museum; therefore, someone must argue from the user's 
          perspective. If ever the needs of the users are threatened, it will 
          likely be the museum Webmaster who must forsake neutrality and argue 
        the user's case.</p>
      <p>The museum Webmaster must become the user-centered 
          mediator between the museum and its on-line users. As the user's 
          advocate, the museum Webmaster must perform this role for multiple users 
          with different information needs. For everyone from on-line visitors 
          searching collection databases over the Internet to internal museum 
          employees looking for important documents on the museum's intranet, 
        information must be readily available. </p>
      <p>Future museum Webmasters, already in the front line 
          and used to interacting with on-line visitors, will position themselves 
          as the user's advocates for good usability as well as for appropriate 
          data.. They will ensure, as much as humanly possible, that each individual 
          user has the most successful on-line interaction with the museum's 
        available resources. But they will not be able to do this alone.</p>
      <p>Even the most talented and capable museum Webmaster, 
          fervently driven by the desire to support the user's needs, will 
          need the support of the museum's administration if the fight for 
          user rights is not to be in vain. Museum directors must understand that 
          information technology is not an end in and of itself, and that a successful 
          IT implementation depends not so much on having the latest, greatest 
          technology as it does on assessing, analyzing, and meeting user needs. 
          The principles of user-centered design, while powerful, need to be supported 
          by individuals in positions of authority. As they enter the complicated 
          world of information architecture and information technology management, 
          museum Webmasters need to be given the authority to make their sites 
        usable and ensure that the on-line museum continues to meet user needs.</p>
      <h1>Conclusion: Where to Turn for Help</h1>
      <p>This paper has argued that the museum Webmaster in 
          the future must assume a role of user advocate. Museums that do not 
          consider this important will be left behind in the information society. 
          If the on-line museum is to survive in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, 
          the Web site's intended users must gain stature as the site's 
          primary customers. By developing skills, expertise, and experience in 
          working with users in on-line settings, the museum Webmaster is ideally 
        positioned to become the user's advocate. </p>
      <p>The author wishes to make one final suggestion. Any 
          museum Webmaster who needs help fighting for the rights of the user 
          should consider seeking assistance from Schools of Library and Information 
          Science, institutions which for years have led the way in user studies. 
          LIS faculty are experts in conducting user-oriented research, and they 
          specialize in training information professionals whose primary concern 
          is the user. Now is the time for museums to form collaborations with 
          the LIS community to explore the best ways of ensuring that museum on-line 
          resources actually meet the needs of museum on-line audiences. Such 
          collaborations would benefit all involved parties, and are perhaps the 
          best way of ensuring that the museum Website of the future will remain 
        both usable and relevant for the museum's on-line clientele. </p>
