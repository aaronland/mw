          Classroom &mdash; On-line Content Management and Presentation System 
          (CMAP)</p>
        <p class="Author">Julia Borst Brazas, Benjamin Lorch, and Sean York, University 
          of Chicago, USA</p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract </p>
         <p class="AbstractText">This paper describes Chicago WebDocent Project's 
          newly developed on-line Content Management and Presentation System (CMAP), 
          a database-driven, Web-based curriculum production tool that facilitates 
          the development of high-quality on-line materials through partnerships 
          between Chicago Public School teachers and several Chicago museum collections. 
          Using CMAP, teacher content-creators can outline and organize lessons 
          via a Web-based interface by inserting lesson text and digitized museum 
          media. Students who use the resultant Chicago WebDocent lessons engage 
          museum content guided by a story-telling character (or docent). They 
          read text, explore high-resolution images, watch video, listen to sounds, 
          and learn through interactives. Students also have ready access to glossary 
          terms and definitions with standard pronunciation symbols, audio pronunciation 
          clips, and illustrative media all within a unified lesson interface.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Content Management and Presentation System (CMAP) developed by 
          Chicago WebDocent system is an excellent example of community informatics 
          at work in Chicago. After several years of work with its partners, CMAP 
          embodies the cultural expertise of museum curators, the educational 
          expertise of teachers, the technical expertise of the Chicago WebDocent's 
          programming staff, and the community outreach/development expertise 
          of Chicago Public Schools / University of Chicago Internet Project. 
        </p>
        <p>The museum partners Chicago Web Docent works with each have different 
          priorities, policies, and practices regarding documentation of their 
          collections. One challenge comes in acquiring, digitizing, storing, 
          and accessing content from various museum partners. At the same time 
          teachers are generally not experienced in interpreting objects and images 
          for educational goals, nor in using technology to develop curriculum 
          . We have achieved the twin goals of making digital museum content and 
          teacher content-creators central to the development process by implementing 
          CMAP.</p>
        <h1>About the Chicago WebDocent Project </h1>
        <p>The Chicago WebDocent Project (CWD) (<a href="http://www.chicagowebdocent.org/" target="_blank">http://www.chicagoWebdocent.org</a>) 
          is a collaboration of the University of Chicago, the Chicago Public 
          Schools (CPS), and eight Chicago cultural institutions to develop on-line 
          curriculum modules featuring Chicago museum and library collections, 
          (the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum, Art Institute of Chicago, 
          Chicago Historical Society, DuSable Museum of African American History, 
          Field Museum, Museum of Science and Industry, Newberry Library and the 
          Oriental Institute).</p>
        <p>CWD lessons are created with urban school children 
          in mind and employ a cross-disciplinary approach to learning through 
          storytelling. Teachers write lessons as first-person narratives in the 
          guise of a docent who is usually a peer of the student who will read 
          the lesson. The docent character gives a personal account of a historical 
          event, era, or scientific discovery while sharing details and particulars 
          of his or her life. Storytelling personalizes and humanizes historical 
          events and makes them appealing to students because the details of the 
          docent's life and experience become the anchors students connect 
          to formal learning goals. The historical story-lesson approach, coupled 
          with the interactive features of CWD, supports language arts standards 
          for reading, writing, researching, and developing word analysis strategies. 
          Likewise, lessons use the context of the story to support math and science 
          standards through simulations and animations.</p>
        <p>Since it was founded in 1999, Chicago WebDocent has 
          published 6 curriculum modules focusing on social studies and science 
          topics for grades 3-8, integrating primary resources and cultural material 
          from our institutional partners. </p>

        <p>Three new modules are currently in development for 
          grades 6-8: <i>Africa Today, Origins of the Elements and Stories of 
          Their Discovery</i>, and <i>Where Do the Elements Come From? </i>The 
          Chicago WebDocent Project is funded by the Chicago Public Schools, University 
          of Chicago, The U.S.A. Education Charitable Trust, and NASA.</p>
        <p>CWD is staffed by two full-time employees of the 
          University and two part-time student workers. All phases of the curriculum 
          development process are contracted to full-time CPS teachers. In addition, 
          we contract Web software developers to build and improve server- and 
          client-side software that support our efforts. Rounding out the personnel 
          are a host of volunteer museum educators, archivists, curators, and 
          University of Chicago faculty who participate in teacher training and 
          serve as expert readers of curriculum modules to ensure intellectual 
          quality. The process for developing CWD curriculum modules draws upon 
          many relationships, beginning with the Chicago Public Schools / University 
          of Chicago Internet Project (CUIP) and extending outward to the community. 
        </p>
        <h2>Strong Connections to Local Education Communities</h2>
        <p>The Chicago WebDocent Project is an initiative of 
          the Chicago Public Schools / University of Chicago Internet Project 
          (<a href="http://cuip.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">http://cuip.uchicago.edu/</a>). Since 1997, CUIP has partnered with local 
          schools neighboring the campus of the University on Chicago's 
          South Side. Currently CUIP works on-site with 26 schools with the goal 
          of making information technologies an integrated and effective part 
          of teaching and learning in classrooms, libraries, and computer labs. 
          The six-member full-time staff of CUIP are joined by 45 part-time paid 
          students who work in five areas:</p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li> 
           technology leadership among principals;</li>
        <li> 
           hardware and networking equipment provision;</li>
        <li> 
           technical support; </li>
        <li> 
           teacher training and professional development; 
        </li>
        <li> 
           integration of technology and curriculum.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>A key to the success of the WebDocent Project and 
          CUIP alike are the strong working relationships and trust that have 
          formed over the years. CWD enjoys ready access to teachers and students 
          in the CUIP schools for field-testing curriculum modules and can observe 
          first-hand the challenges involved in technology integration. The relationships 
          held by CUIP and CWD with teachers, school technology coordinators, 
          principals, and district administrators have helped ensure that our 
          on-line curriculum offerings meet the needs of the schools while appealing 
          to urban public school students. (For more information on the Chicago 
          Public Schools / University of Chicago Internet Project and the Chicago 
          WebDocent Project, see 2003 International Cultural Heritage Informatics 
          Meeting paper 101C, <i>Key Success Factors for Museum-University-Public 
          School Partnerships.</i>)</p>
        <h2>Core Mission: Building Bridges</h2>
        <p>A core mission of CWD is fostering relationships 
          between the formal and informal education communities. For each curriculum 
          module developed by CWD there are numerous working relationships that 
          form bridges between the schools and cultural institutions.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="brazas.fig1a.gif" alt="Diagram: working relationships between museums, universities, schools, CUIP and CPS" width="400" height="409"></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 1: Working relationships in the development of 
          a Chicago WebDocent curriculum module </p>
        <p>The cultural institutions in the WebDocent collaboration 
          are a diverse group. While they share the common goal of extending their 
          educational outreach through technology, they differ in physical size, 
          collection scope, and staffing levels. There is also wide variation 
          with regard to active digitization programs. CWD's approach has 
          been to work with the institutions at their levels in a service orientation 
          to encourage participation in the project.</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>The number of contacts in the institutions has expanded 
          every year as the CWD gains more attention and working relationships 
          are strengthened. Because CWD works so closely with a multitude of educators, 
          experts, and institutions, the process of creating a module is time- 
          and resource-intensive. Aside from managing the various relationships 
          involved in the development of a module, our production process involves 
          many steps. As we ramped up our production schedule to meet the goal 
          of producing two modules per year, we identified problems in our process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          
            It was difficult for teachers to access museum materials while writing 
            their lessons.</li>
        <li>
          
            For weeks or months, teachers would not see the final form of the 
            lessons they wrote. </li>
        <li>
          
            The process of writing, editing, and producing a lesson was cumbersome, 
            redundant and time-consuming.</li>
        <li>
          
            Image production involved many steps, and final images were too small 
            to afford the detail that engages students in active viewing.</li>
        <li>
          
            There was no good system for reuse of work such as images and dictionary 
            terms.</li>
      </ul>
      
        <p>The result was that teachers felt disconnected from 
          the process, and CWD staff spent too much time on mundane production 
          processes and less and less time on our core missions: supporting teachers, 
          building teacher and museum relationships, weaving content from multiple 
          museums and libraries into the curriculum, and creating rich, imaginative 
          and engaging educational experiences for Chicago Public Schools students. 
        </p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>In order to re-tool our production process, we needed 
          to empower and engage teachers by giving them better access to digitized 
          museum and library collections, and show them the results of their work 
          immediately. We needed to streamline lesson writing and production and 
          optimize media management in order to liberate CWD staff to focus on 
          core missions. The solution was to build a database-driven system with 
          an easy-to-use front end for both teachers and administrators, one which 
          would also deliver the finished lessons to students in the Chicago Public 
          Schools. We applied the imaginative moniker of "Content Management 
          and Presentation System, and the CMAP project was born. One year 
          later CMAP is a reality, and we have made great progress towards our 
          goals.</p>
        <h1>CMAP Overview</h1>
        <p>CMAP consists of two content databases and one usage-tracking 
          database (MySQL). Of the former, the first is the media database which 
          accommodates images, sounds, video, and interactives, as well as the 
          associated metadata. The second is the lesson database which keeps track 
          of all lesson elements such as page text, dictionary terms, journal 
          questions, and customized media captions. The third database tracks 
          student usage of lessons, including what museum objects were accessed 
          during a lesson.</p>
        <p>The system has four role-based interfaces: Writer, 
          Reviewer, Administrator, and Student. There are Flash-based graphical 
          interfaces for Students and Writers, while the Administrator and Reviewer 
          Interfaces are HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). All interfaces communicate 
          with the databases via PHP middleware. (PHP is a recursive acronym for 
          &quot;PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, a widely-used Open Source 
          general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for Web 
          development and can be embedded into HTML. See figure 2.)</p>

        <p class="caption">Figure 2: Students, reviewers, writers, and administrators 
          access and modify the core lesson and media databases via PHP middleware</p>
        <p>CMAP's relational database architecture allows 
          CWD staff, teacher-writers, students, and expert reviewers to view, 
          enter, and edit content in the ways that best suit their particular 
          roles.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="brazas.fig3a.gif" width="400" height="337"></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 3</p>
        <p>CMAP creates efficiencies of labor by minimizing 
          redundancy in the production process and allowing reuse of lesson materials. 
          It empowers teachers by providing them with sophisticated yet intuitive 
          tools for developing their lessons and with direct access to digitized 
          content from multiple cultural institutions. Most important, it helps 
          us achieve our goal of delivering engaging, on-line curriculum materials 
          featuring the collections of Chicago's outstanding museums and 
          libraries. </p>
        <h2>The Student Interface</h2>
        <p>In 2001, we began development of a Flash-based template 
          to present the lessons. Over the next two years the template was improved 
          as it underwent multiple field tests in the schools. The resulting interface 
          design combines the elements of a storybook with interactive features 
        </p>
        <p class="caption"><a href="brazasFig4.html"><img src="brazas.fig4a.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: Lesson Interface" width="400" height="297" border="0"></a></p>
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig4"></a>Figure 4: The Chicago 
          WebDocent Lesson Interface featuring many interactive 
          components</p>
        <p>The latest version of the Student Interface includes 
          new and updated features and makes the leap from static text files to 
          dynamic database-driven content in CMAP. </p>
        <p>The student using CWD chooses an assigned lesson 
          within a curriculum module and is greeted by the docent character, who 
          introduces the lesson topic. A lesson may include up to 10 chapters, 
          or sections. Within each section there are 1 to 5 pages of text. The 
          docent appears on every page of the lesson and can be animated to prompt 
          students to explore the interactive features on the page or to provide 
          feedback. Students can move between pages using a forward- or back-arrow 
          button. They can also navigate through the lesson by clicking on page 
          numbers listed in the sections.</p>
        <h2>Media Interaction</h2>
        <p>Lesson pages include digitized images of primary 
          source materials from our institutional partners. This content is presented 
          as a clickable museum icon that opens full screen to reveal a high resolution 
          image. We have incorporated a Zoomify viewer into our template so that 
          students may zoom within this window to closely inspect and navigate 
          images and texts (<a href="http://www.zoomify.com/" target="_blank">http://www.zoomify.com</a>). Each image window includes 
          a caption, source information, and perhaps bookmarks to specify areas 
          of an image and text identified by the teacher for special attention. 
          The image window can also include video.</p>
        <h2>Journal Interaction</h2>
        <p>Lessons include an on-line journal. The journal appears 
          "grayed out until students activate a page where a journal 
          question appears; then the journal pops open to signal the presence 
          of a question. Students answer the on-line journal questions and print 
          responses at the end of the lesson or class period. The journal can 
          include images, audio, and video in addition to text that presents open-ended 
          questions, quizzes, and numeric or math word problems.</p>
        <h2>Dictionary Interaction</h2>
        <p>Definition terms are listed on the page in the Words 
          to Know box. The complete listing of vocabulary words for an entire 
          lesson is accessible on every page. When a vocabulary word appears in 
          a lesson for the first time, it is underlined and clickable. Clicking 
          on an underlined word or one listed in the Words to Know box activates 
          a window containing the definition and pronunciation, using standard 
          dictionary symbols. The definition window can include images, audio, 
          and video.</p>
        <h2>Interactive Media Elements</h2>
        <p>Some lessons include interactive media elements, 
          which are key enrichment activities that use the context of the story 
          to integrate interdisciplinary skills and knowledge standards. Interactives 
          present a simulation or problem-based scenario in which students apply 
          what was learned in the lesson to arrive at an answer, solution, or 
          new idea. Students use the keyboard or mouse to participate in simulations, 
          answer questions, manipulate screen items, or complete tasks, among 
          other uses. See figure 5.</p>
        <p class="caption"><a href="brazasFig5.html"><img src="brazas.fig5a.jpg" width="400" height="299" border="0"></a></p>
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig5"></a>Figure 5. Sample Chicago WebDocent Interactive: Make Your 
          Own Mummy</p>
        <p>]Both students and teachers have cited the interactives 
          developed for CWD materials as exciting and effective. The experiences 
          that interactives offer are difficult or impossible to achieve with 
          traditional classroom media, and help develop students' skills 
          as information seekers, problem solvers, and visual thinkers.</p>
        <p>A wrapped gift box on the page signals that there 
          is an interactive media element present. Some lessons have a global 
          interactive media element that may be accessed from any page within 
          the lesson by clicking on the gargoyle icon. For example, students using 
          CWD's science lessons use an interactive Periodic Table that appears 
          as a global media element on every page.</p>
        <h2>Teacher and Parent Users</h2>
        <p>While the intended audience is students, CWD modules 
          include features of specific interest to teachers. Each curriculum module 
          includes a comprehensive teaching guide. In addition, each lesson includes 
          its own teaching guide, suggestions for extending the lesson offline, 
          and links to high quality Web sites on eCUIP, a digital library initiative 
          of CUIP (http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/ecuip). Instructional scenarios 
          for using CWD materials in a variety of classroom teaching arrangements; 
          such as electronically supported lecture, individual work among students, 
          or cooperative learning, are described for teachers. </p>
        <p>Each curriculum module contains 6-12 lessons, with 
          each lesson equal to approximately one hour of study. CWD lessons are 
          structured so that teachers can flexibly use chapters within a lesson 
          or cover the entire lesson in single class session. Strategies for using 
          CWD lessons incrementally are included in the teaching guide.</p>
        <p>The CWD interface helps teachers monitor student 
          work through a progress bar. The progress bar appears at the top of 
          the page and indicates how many pages the student has visited, and whether 
          he or she completed the interactive or journal activity on that page. 
          This bar also functions as an alternate navigation method, allowing 
          teachers or students to click on a page number to move to a desired 
          page.</p>
        <p>Many Chicago WebDocent modules are portable to Internet-connected 
          homes where students can follow up on their classroom activities or 
          explore the site further, with or without parental support. </p>
        <h2>Administrator Interface</h2>
        <p>Before a teacher begins writing, CWD staff create 
          an entry for the lesson in the database and associate it with a module, 
          manage users and permissions, and add media with metadata.</p>
        <h3>Adding Media to the Database</h3>
        <p>We add media, including high-resolution images from 
          our institutional partners, to the database using a Web-based interface. 
          Images are automatically processed using a custom server script that 
          creates multiple versions at various resolutions, including a Zoomify-enabled 
          version. Images can be uploaded to the server over the Web from a client 
          machine, or placed on the server locally and batch-processed overnight.</p>
        <h3>Metadata</h3>
        <p>The media database includes approximately 30 searchable 
          metadata fields. Most of these are mapped to a subset of VRA Core and 
          Dublin Core fields, while the others are specific to our system and 
          include fields such as Date Acquired, Method Acquired, etc. A simplified 
          search function is available in the Writer Interface.</p>
        <h2>The Writer Interface</h2>
        <p>CMAP provides an interface for writing lessons and 
          accessing media elements so that teachers can now create and instantly 
          preview their lessons on-line. Teachers can use the Flash-based Writer 
          Interface to enter the text of a lesson directly into the lesson database. 
          They can drag and drop sections and pages in the outline view to rearrange 
          the lesson as they work. To add desired elements to each page, they 
          can search and select objects, images, texts, sounds, video, and other 
          media elements and incorporate them into the lesson using a drag-and-drop 
          interface. High-resolution images can be "bookmarked to 
          bring attention to specific details. These features appear in a unified 
          interface, making CMAP a user-friendly tool for developing lessons. 
          The ease with which teachers can add digitized museum and library resources 
          encourages them to enrich every page in their lesson with media. We 
          have trained several teacher-writers in the use of the CMAP Writer Interface, 
          and they are now using the system. The early results of this process 
          are very promising.</p>
        <h3>Searching for Media</h3>
        <p>Through the Writer Interface, a teacher can search 
          the media database by Title, Description, Subject, Source, Creation 
          Date, Creation Period, and Media Type. The search results show image 
          thumbnails and metadata, and can be previewed within the Writer Interface. 
          A simplified search that includes the fields mentioned above is provided 
          within the lesson creation interface. A more advanced search is available 
          through the Administrator Interface. </p>
        <h3>Adding Media to a Lesson</h3>
        <p>Once a teacher finds the best image, s/he can add 
          it to the lesson using a drag-and-drop, shopping-cart-like interface. 
          Multiple media can be added to pages, journal questions, and dictionary 
          terms. A global media element can also be added to the tour, such as 
          the Periodic Table, the Constitution, or a map that can be accessed 
          from any point within the lesson. Teachers can refer to a special tab 
          which shows them recommended images for their lesson. They can also 
          request an image that is not in our collection, so that CWD staff can 
          obtain it from a museum partner.</p>
        <h3>Viewing and Bookmarking High-resolution Images</h3>
        <p>The Zoomify viewer incorporated into our template 
          allows high-resolution images to be viewed in a streaming fashion over 
          the Web without long download times. This is an impressive piece of 
          functionality that allows us to present museum objects in crisp, clear 
          detail for students and teachers to explore and learn from. Using Zoomify's 
          Flash API (Application Program Interface), we built a bookmarking system 
          that allows teachers to create a guided viewing experience for students, 
          walking them through the details of these engaging images.</p>
        <h3>Docents</h3>
        <p>Teachers have creative license to develop the docent 
          characters that guide students through the lessons. They can use the 
          Docent Dossier to outline each character with fields such as gender, 
          time period and geographical location, ethnic and cultural background, 
          likes and dislikes, family members, and more. Each lesson can have multiple 
          docents with up to two per page, and each docent character can have 
          multiple guises. For example, a lesson could span the entire life of 
          a character and show him or her at different ages as the story progresses. 
          Docent artwork is created by CWD staff.</p>
        <h3>Journal Question and Quiz Creator</h3>
        <p>Writers can attach one or more questions to any page 
          of a lesson. Questions can be of multiple types such as essay, multiple 
          choice, true/false, etc. The quiz creator allows a writer to specify 
          scoring method, multiple levels of feedback, randomized questions, and 
          more. Questions can be presented in multiple formats using custom "skins.</p>
        <h3>Dictionary</h3>
        <p>Writers can select a term in the text of their lesson 
          and search for it in our database dictionary. They can customize dictionary 
          terms for their lesson by adding media and by choosing from multiple 
          definitions. Entries display definitions, thumbnails as links to media, 
          parts of speech, and pronunciations with standard dictionary symbols.</p>
        <h2>Reviewer Interface</h2>
        <p>Expert reviewers use a straightforward HTML interface 
          to review the lessons. This displays all of the same content as the 
          Flash-based Student Interface, but in a straightforward, printable interface. 
          This interface also allows reviewers to annotate the lesson on a page-by-page 
          basis. When they type comments and click Submit, the comments, along 
          with the reviewers' user IDs and date/time stamps, are recorded 
          on those pages. These comments show up on a tab along with the page 
          text on the writer side, so reviewer comments can be easily integrated 
          into the lesson. This interface is also being used by our writer groups 
          as a collaborative module development tool. </p>
        <h1>The Impact of CMAP</h1>
        <p>CWD has achieved the twin goals of making teacher 
          content-creators and digitized resources from multiple institutions 
          more central to the curriculum development process by implementing CMAP. 
          This set of technological tools has dramatically improved the management 
          and delivery of content and will allow us to publish materials with 
          greater speed. The key efficiency has been to remove CWD staff from 
          processing teacher lessons as text files and uniting them with media 
          elements before publishing them in Flash. Before CMAP, this step required 
          about 20 hours per lesson and depended on a flow of work from the teacher 
          to the CWD Director to the CWD Creative Director. </p>
        <p>With CMAP, a completed lesson can easily be entered 
          in the database in 1-2 hours, complete with definitions, journal questions, 
          and media elements. In the Student Interface teachers can immediately 
          preview their lessons as they develop and can refine them, adding more 
          elements or revising image captions. Some teachers chose to compose 
          their lessons as they enter them into the database rather than working 
          from a completed text. While these iterations require more time, it 
          is effort spent on the creative aspects of teacher work and does not 
          impact CWD staff time. At this writing we have not finished our current 
          development cycle and therefore cannot report accurately on the increased 
          production speed; however, we believe it will be possible to complete 
          production of a module of 10 lessons in one month. </p>
        <p>Once media elements are loaded into CMAP, they are 
          readily available to teachers using the interface to write their lessons. 
          The first set of 154 high-resolution images, along with partial metadata 
          records, was loaded into the CMAP database in approximately 4 hours. 
          This represents a remarkable improvement in our process because images 
          no longer need to be hand-tooled to show details or resized to fill 
          the screen. The speed with which images can be acquired and made available 
          is greatly reduced when content is received in digital form. Nearly 
          all of our image content was acquired in analog form and digitized by 
          CWD. Last year a project to acquire approximately 250 images from a 
          partner museum required several weeks of staff time to retrieve materials 
          from the donating institution, perform scanning, make CDs for the donor, 
          and return the materials to the institution.</p>
        <p>We recently piloted a process by which we acquired 
          a set of high-resolution digital images from a museum partner who performed 
          digitization in-house through a grant from the State of Illinois. The 
          images came to us on CD with accompanying metadata in an Excel spreadsheet. 
          Within a few hours of receiving these materials in person at the museum, 
          the images and metadata were available in the CMAP database. In the 
          span of an afternoon, CWD staff put together a short demo lesson featuring 
          the newly acquired content to show the technology board of the donor 
          museum later the same week. </p>
        <h1>Long-Term Goals</h1>
        <p>As a result of CMAP, goals that were in our peripheral 
          vision have moved front and center. Advocating the benefits of digitization 
          programs to our institutional partners is one goal, which we demonstrate 
          through presentations to show how digitized museum and library content 
          can be delivered as on-line curriculum to public school students. Another 
          key goal now underway is improving training to better prepare teachers 
          for using primary resources and material culture for teaching. Often 
          museum and library content is illustrative in a lesson, rather than 
          driving the lesson content itself. With the media database, a teacher 
          can search on the term "coal" and retrieve text and images 
          from multiple museums and libraries, interactives on coal mining, animations 
          that demonstrate the environmental impact of mining, machinery sounds, 
          music, or video of miners at work, so that the lesson is generated from 
          a collection of various media. Such an array of content can be used 
          flexibly for a lesson on science, engineering, social history, or any 
          other learning goal.</p>
        <p>Techniques of the museum educator are being integrated 
          into training for teacher-writers to foster skills in working with an 
          object or collection, images, text, documentary material, and narrative 
          art. Likewise, CWD training for end-user teachers and field testers 
          now includes demonstration of these techniques. Field tests have shown 
          that teachers often ignore or spend little time with the image content; 
          in contrast, students more frequently look at images and spend more 
          time with them. If teachers do not engage students during instruction 
          to observe, describe, and analyze primary sources and material culture 
          presented in the lessons, then we are missing an important interaction 
          that develops critical thinking skills and visual literacy.</p>
        <p>CMAP has allowed us to refocus our goals and consider 
          future directions. Even with production and management efficiencies, 
          CWD still relies on a multitude of good working relationships with teachers 
          and our institutional partners to keep the flow of content and curriculum 
          going. Strengthening and expanding the connection between the schools 
          and greater cultural community will remain an important part of CWD's 
          mission as we continue to develop new efficiencies in production.</p>
