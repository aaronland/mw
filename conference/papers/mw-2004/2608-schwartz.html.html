  <h1>Introduction </h1>
  <p>With a newly energized commitment to young audiences, The 
      Museum of Modern Art has recently developed two Web sites: <b>Destination 
      Modern Art</b>, for children ages 5 to 8, and <b>Red Studio</b>, for teenagers 
      ages 13 to 18. In the process, the Museum's Educators and the Digital Media 
      team who collaborated on these projects used the opportunity to incorporate 
      the voices and ideas of children and teens, introduce the curatorial staff 
      to some new, playful approaches to the collection, and explore how the resources 
      developed for these sites might interface with other agendas within the Museum. 
      This paper describes the development of the sites and explores various modes 
      of audience input, the development of software for multiple purposes, and 
      strategies for marketing sites to young audiences.</p>
  <h1>Goals and Aspirations</h1>
  <p>The Museum of Modern Art's Department of Education is dedicated to teaching 
      and learning about the complexity and diversity of modern and contemporary 
      art. Through courses, museum visits, workshops, publications, and collaborations 
      with schools, cultural institutions, and universities, MoMA's Education Department 
      engages audiences of all ages in the process of looking carefully, exploring, 
      questioning, and analyzing works of art. Central to this process are the voice 
      of the artist who makes the work and the viewer, whose curiosity is essential 
      to the museum experience. </p>
  <p>The need to expand MoMA's efforts to reach audiences through 
      the Web has been equally championed by the Departments of Education and Digital 
      Media. Our common goal has been to provide greater access to the Museum's 
      collection and resources that do not exist in other contexts or formats, carefully 
      considering the correct mix of audience and content for the Web tools environment. 
  </p>
  <p>Further, the goals for these sites include creating projects 
      that can withstand the vagaries of technology and that can expand and evolve 
      organically based upon what we learn from working directly with the intended 
      audience - all without breaking the bank! </p>
  <h1>Background</h1>
  <p>The Museum of Modern Art has an excellent history in developing 
      Web-based materials for children and teachers. <b>Art Safari</b>, for young 
      children, was the Museum's first effort to create a children's site. On the 
      site, children could explore works of art from the Museum's collection and 
      create their own related pictures, which initially could be submitted to 
      the Museum for posting on its Web site. However, after years of technological 
      advancement, several of the site's initial functions -which relied on ongoing 
      staff attention and maintenance - no longer worked as intended, and some features 
      were removed. As a result, the need for a new children's site became more 
      urgent, and the commitment to create <b>Destination: Modern Art</b> was made 
      by both the Education Department and the Digital Media team.</p>
  <p>The Museum had also developed a series of Guides for Looking, 
      which are based on teaching strategies and were originally developed for use 
      in the Museum galleries. The guides employ questioning strategies and visual 
      comparisons that teachers and students may find very useful, relying more 
      heavily upon 'looking' skills than on contextual information. These guides 
      will be expanded in the coming years to take advantage of the opportunities 
      that the Web provides for cross-referencing and linking to other sites. </p>
  <p>Perhaps MoMA's most successful use of the Web has been 
      with its exhibition-related sites, from the highly regarded <b>What Is a Print</b> 
      resource (on-line since 2001) to the more recent <i>Russian Books</i> and 
      <i>Kiki Smith</i> sites. These sites are designed to feature the work of a 
      current exhibition but are extremely effective in extending the life of an 
      exhibition well beyond its closing date. </p>
  <h1>Building on Prior Experience </h1>
  <p>In focusing two new Web ventures on young people, the Museum 
      was in an excellent position to utilize a great deal of expertise. The Museum's 
      school programs for grades K through 12 are extensive, taking place in both 
      the galleries and the classrooms. Attendance at our family programs for younger 
      children and their parents is always at capacity. Our programs for teens have 
      included a highly successful after-school program, high school internships, 
      a series of after-school discussions, and, most significantly, an innovative 
      Museum Studies Program in which high school students have the opportunity 
      to curate an exhibition of work by their peers. From this extensive experience 
      in family and children's programming, staff members were confident that they 
      could create winning children's and teen sites that would have meaning beyond 
      the local level. </p>
  <p>One of the first tasks in creating the teen site was to 
      assemble a teenaged advisory group (TAG) that would embrace the excitement 
      and challenge of working on a project with enormous public exposure and in 
      collaboration with MoMA staff. Several questions loomed over the teen project. 
      Did the sensibilities and values of New York City public school students have 
      significance for a larger national audience? Would the likes, dislikes, and 
      interests of this group 'play' in a larger arena? Ultimately, we agreed that 
      if this site was constructed thoughtfully and seriously by participating artists 
      and teens, the authenticity of the participants' experience would be meaningful 
      to others. </p>
  <p>We also wondered if all the excitement and energy of a 
      face-to-face meeting between a student and an artist would translate over 
      the Web. Would the lessons be less powerful if taken out of time and context? 
      Therefore, the question remained. What were the chances that the artist and 
      students would connect and communicate well, and how would the results of 
      their experience be conveyed to a larger audience? </p>
  <p>These are profound questions exploring the relationship 
      between teaching and learning, and the extension of these experiences on the 
      Web. Therefore, this project was in all respects an experiment, one that involved 
      risk and exposure for the Museum, the teenage advisory group, and participating 
      artists. </p>
  <h1>A Web Site for Teens</h1>
  <p>Red Studio marks the Museum's deepening commitment to teen 
      audiences, their need for participatory activities, and their strong sense 
      of connection to the unexpected and challenging qualities of contemporary 
      art. For years MoMA staff has worked with adolescent audiences in a variety 
      of programs, some formal and classroom-based, others voluntary, drop-in programs. 
      From these programs, we discovered that students are most interested in the 
      producers of the work. Who makes a work? Why? What makes it art? These are 
      the fundamental questions raised by teens. Moreover, this is an audience that 
      questions authority, embraces risk, and, in many respects, is quickest to 
      empathize with the experimental nature of contemporary art.</p>
  <p>In that spirit, MoMA introduced Red Studio (http://www.moma.org/redstudio), 
      a subsite of MoMA.org, featuring numerous projects about artists and art 
      making - all of them driven by teen advisors. The first of these projects 
      is an extensive interview and exploration of the work of artist and architect 
      Vito Acconci. The site also features varied interactive components, the first 
      being a design competition to which students may submit their own designs 
      inspired by Acconci's work. </p>

  <p>The Education Department spent several years developing the idea of a Web 
      site for teenagers. Focus groups with teens revealed their interests and concerns. 
      The prevailing question that arose from this research concerned the precise 
      nature of art and why some of the work produced by artists was considered 
      art. In fact, <b>You Call that Art?</b> was a working title for the site. 
      Consequently, our team worked towards a site model that would enable teens 
      to find the answers to these questions. Amy Horschak, one of the lead Educators 
      on the project, was the first to point out that MoMA's greatest asset in this 
      venture was our immediate and relatively easy access to working artists. From 
      that point on, the site developed as a series of features that gave teens 
      the opportunity to observe, research, and ultimately engage in conversation 
      with an established artist; the results of these investigations would comprise 
      the core component of the site. </p>
  <p>In the early stages of Red Studio, the project team spent 
      hours looking at other teen Web sites, some built by museums, others created 
      in the commercial sphere. We wanted to understand what our colleagues had 
      done to date, and we wanted to know what was selling well in the teen market. 
      We noted the exceptional teen Web sites that already exist at the Walker Museum 
      and at the Whitney Museum of American Art. We also acquainted ourselves with 
      blogs and with the hundreds of commercial sites that poll teens about everything 
      from fashion to television shows. The breadth of activity was impressive, 
      but we felt it was important to create something that was unique to MoMA. 
      Interestingly, our teenage partners reiterated this conviction. </p>
  <p>While we felt sure that the site needed to reflect our 
      teenage constituents, the advisory group was equally sure that MoMA's site 
      should not pretend to be inelegant to cater to its younger audience. In fact, 
      the TAG liked the idea that their work was part of a sophisticated Museum 
      effort, and they preferred to have their work embraced by the look and feel 
      of the larger institution. This was important and unexpected information for 
      the staff. </p>
  <p>The first TAG originally came together in a six-week after-school program, 
      for which members received a modest stipend. They had opportunities to see 
      and read about Acconci's work, discuss issues raised by it, and eventually 
      meet the artist. In the first of two meetings with Acconci, we asked him to 
      talk about himself and to present a brief history of his work. After this 
      meeting, an entire session was devoted to the development of interview techniques. 
      The students developed questions for Acconci and talked about how to handle 
      sharing the stage with him and with each other. This preparation culminated 
      in a videotaped session in which the students conducted a two-hour Acconci interview 
      that would eventually became a core component of the Web site. </p>
  <p>As the program progressed, students and staff devoted extra time to the development 
      of the site. At the same time, Chopping Block, the company developing the 
      site with MoMA, became eager to hear from the ultimate clients. The teens 
      were invited to Chopping Block's offices to see how the site was being developed 
      and to meet the team. The exchange was an important episode in the development 
      of the site. </p>
  <p>In addition, the ongoing goal to make this site relevant 
      to teens beyond the initial six participants created an interesting question: 
      What would make this site meaningful to teens all over the country? Three 
      primary components became clear as we tried to ensure broad interest in the 
      site:</p>
  <h2>1) The Interview</h2>
  <p>Whatever came out of the interview between Acconci and 
      the kids had to be edited and organized so that even a novice teen (e.g. a 
      teen who knew very little about art) could find relevance and meaning in the 
      site. As a result, great effort was put into finding universal themes in the 
      content of the interview: What did Acconci have to say about politics, working 
      as part of a team, or growing up? </p>
  <h2>2) The Competition: <i>youDESIGN</i></h2>
  <p>A competition seemed like an excellent way to 
      call meaningful attention to the launch of the site. Team lead Victoria Lichtendorf 
      explains, </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">We realized a building activity alone might go unused and 
      unnoticed without some interesting way of hooking teens' interest. MoMA historically 
      held contests, and it seemed fitting to bring them back. Having a professional 
      jury with esteemed judges and prizes underscored the value of good design 
      and underscored the fact that people can be rewarded and paid for creativity. 
  </p>
  <p>The idea of design contests also seemed pertinent given the very public dialogue 
      about Ground Zero and the Pentagon. The relevance of architectural designs 
      and competitions today, along with classroom projects, also broadens the appeal 
      of the site to teachers.</p>
  <p>In addition, the contest and activity organically 
      grew out of the Acconci interview. In the activity, <i>youDESIGN</i>, students 
      are encouraged to be very creative. Some of the elements - such as spheres, 
      ramps, organic and inorganic textures, different environments, et cetera - 
      are Acconci-influenced. Students have to decide whether their designs relate 
      to their environments, a major focus of Acconci's work. </p>

  <p>The teen interviewers were very interested in 
      how Acconci performed under the pressure of competition. One of our 'Know 
      More' fun facts highlights the fact that only 15% of Acconci Studio Designs 
      are actually built. This statistic holds true for many architectural firms 
      and design studios. The fact that the majority of work coming out of such 
      firms is creative and theoretical was of great interest to the teen interviewers.</p>
  <p>Needless to say, the competition revealed layers of questions 
      that none of us had anticipated: laws about competitions, rules and regulations 
      about the age of participants and crossing state lines, disclaimers, et cetera. 
      (Indeed, the lawyers might deliver another talk on these issues alone!)</p>
  <h2>3) Teens and Polling</h2>
  <p>Finally, although the assembled adults were not entirely 
      sure about the phenomenon, it became clear from talking with our TAG and in 
      looking at other Web sites that <b>polling</b> was a hugely appealing characteristic 
      of teen-oriented Web sites. Could we use this structure to any good or appropriate 
      effect? The development team began to examine questions about art, its relationship 
      to music, society, and creativity  all questions we thought might appeal 
      to the targeted audience. At the time of writing, the site has not yet launched, 
      but we will know this spring if polling translates well in the museum realm.

  <h1>The Kids' Site</h1>
  <p class="caption"><img src="schwartz_fig3.jpg" alt="Destination Modern Art" width="400" height="274"></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 3: Destination: Modern Art title screen</p>
  <p>Destination: Modern Art (<a
href="http://www.moma.org/destination/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.moma.org/destination/index.html</a>) 
      was originally conceived as a small, internally produced project exploring 
      ways in which The Museum of Modern Art could provide resources specifically 
      for younger children via the Web. While Red Studio had a dedicated funder, 
      the resources allocated to this site were very modest, with the bulk of the 
      budget going to the illustrator who was brought onboard. The rest of the 
      site was designed and programmed in-house at minimal cost. As the project 
      developed, our goals became clearer; the primary one was to provide younger 
      children with the tools they needed to begin looking critically at art. We 
      would do so through a series of activities focused on particular artworks. 
      A secondary goal was to inspire children and their parents to do that 'looking' 
      at MoMA and its affiliate, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center. Consequently, the 
      project team decided to introduce the two at particular locations, providing 
      a setting for the site. Due to the current expansion and renovation project 
      at MoMA's original midtown Manhattan location, the site presently situates 
      visitors at MoMA QNS, the Museum's temporary home in Queens. However, the 
      site was structured so that images of MoMA QNS could later be replaced with 
      images of MoMA in Manhattan, without having to deconstruct the site.</p>
  <p>This structure of the MoMA QNS gallery space can be enlarged 
      indefinitely and serves as an expandable testing ground for discovering how 
      some of the Education programs in the Museum translate to on-line experiences. 
      What can be done on-line that can't be done in a museum, and vice versa? 
      How do you introduce both on-line and offline activities via the Web?</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="schwartz_fig4.jpg" alt="Gallery Image" width="400" height="274"></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 4: Destination: Modern Art gallery screen</p>
  <p>One of our first steps was to enlist the help of an illustrator. 
      We selected an illustrator whose work showed a clear sense of place, who created 
      illustrations of children who were not easily categorized, and whose visual 
      sensibilities were in keeping with our goals for the project. Once we had 
      narrowed the selection, we showed the final candidates' work to the Chief 
      Curator of Prints and Illustrated Books before finalizing our selection. 
      The illustrator, Brian Biggs, brought a great deal to the table, not only 
      in terms of his illustrations, but by listening to what we were trying to 
      accomplish and then taking that beyond our original concept. </p>
  <p>We also looked at other sites directed towards this audience, 
      including several wonderful sites produced by our colleagues at other museums 
      and those created in the for-profit arena. We particularly noted the frequent 
      use of animals to make an idea or activity more accessible. While this approach 
      was successful in many of its uses, we decided that since the goal of our 
      site was to get kids looking at art, we would prefer children to populate 
      our virtual museum space. To incorporate an added element of discovery and 
      curiosity, we introduced another character to accompany the young visitors 
      though our virtual Museum: a friendly and inquisitive alien, whose lack of 
      familiarity with the art environment allows questions that range from the 
      simple to the complex. In this way, the alien could serve as the impetus for 
      discovery and allow the <i>children</i> to interact directly with the art.</p>
  <p>The site initially launched with a set of activities designed 
      for five works in MoMA's collection. Two types of activities are consistent 
      for each work of art: an interactive artist biography and the At Home activity, 
      which provides ideas for offline activities. Other activities were created 
      specifically for each work, with an emphasis on looking more closely, listening, 
      and using words to respond to works. The works were selected to convey the 
      breadth of the collection - from painting to sculpture to collage - and from 
      the Museum's earliest works to its contemporary acquisitions. One of the 
      artists represented, Polly Apfelbaum, is a living artist, and we were able 
      to show her the site and get her response. She was very supportive and helpful 
      in providing information and other resources. </p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="schwartz_fig5.jpg" alt="Help me figure ot what Blossom is made of" width="400" height="273"></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 5: Destination: Modern Art activity screen</p>
  <p>While initially only five works are represented, we intend 
      to add works to the site over time and to include works from other collecting 
      areas of the Museum - film and illustrated books being two examples.</p>
  <p>We knew from the beginning of the project that we wanted 
      to include MoMA's affiliate, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, in the site. Because 
      P.S.1 has very few works in its permanent collection and is focused on an 
      ongoing series of temporary exhibitions, it was challenging to determine how 
      to properly represent the Center on-line. Lacking the resources to swap works 
      on the site with the same frequency as the constantly revolving P.S.1 exhibition 
      schedule, we decided to focus more on P.S.1 as a treasure hunt destination 
      where the goal was to find the permanent artworks scattered throughout the 
      building. While this approach may not represent P.S.1's primary program of 
      changing exhibitions, we felt it did introduce P.S.1 as a great place for 
      families to visit.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="schwartz_fig6.jpg" alt="Going to PS 1" width="400" height="274"></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 6: Destination: Modern Art screen: P.S.1</p>
  <h1>The Project Teams</h1>
  <p>For the teen site, the team consisted of members of the 
      Education and Digital Media departments (including a Web editor), the first 
      group of teens, and Chopping Block, the design firm we hired for the first 
      installation of Red Studio. The kids' site team consisted again of Education 
      and Digital Media, with the addition of the illustrator and a writer from 
      the Marketing Department. The Graphic Design department made key contributions 
      along the way, particularly in regards to the naming and visual identify of 
      the teen site. Marketing and Communications were involved in promoting both 
      sites. </p>
  <p>The teen site team evolved and was adjusted over the course 
      of the project. There were initially five people involved from Education, 
      but once the parameters were set and the project was underway, that number 
      dropped to three: the Deputy Director of Education and the two project leads, 
      one of whom was designated as a primary contact. This streamlined communications 
      with Digital Media. Digital Media, in turn, was the primary contact for Chopping 
      Block, so that company received one coordinated set of responses instead of 
      seven.</p>
  <p>The project was a good learning experience for all, helping 
      us recognize the importance of clear and structured communication and strong 
      writing. We found that we had initially underestimated the time commitment 
      that was involved in completing a project of this scale. Unlike our exhibition 
      subsites, which usually draw from existing content, all of the content for 
      the two sites had to be created specifically for each project. The interview 
      with Vito Acconci also became much more in-depth than initially projected. 
      Furthermore, the lack of a driving deadline (such as an exhibition opening 
      date that might expedite the creation of a subsite) allowed production to 
      continue much longer than anticipated. Since we have been through the development 
      of the umbrella Red Studio site and one feature, we are planning to take what 
      we have learned from that process and streamline the development of the next 
      feature.</p>
  <h1>Marketing and Branding</h1>
  <p>Both the kids' and teen sites went through a lengthy naming 
      process; in fact both had other names during parts of their development. The 
      teen site went from 'inFlux' to 'Red Studio' after the logo was in its final 
      design phase, and the kid's site was renamed once the entire site was completed. 
      This indicates the importance we placed on name and identity, as well as the 
      difficulty we had in coming up with something that really met our requirements. 
      The name for the teen site had to be broad enough to cover all we wanted to 
      do with future features while appealing to this age group. We settled on Red 
      Studio, because not only did it reference a key work in MoMA's collection, 
      but it also indicated a space where people might come together to create or 
      talk about art, and this was the main message we wanted the name to convey. 
      The kid's site name needed to be catchy and make reference to the 'intergalactic' 
      element of the site.</p>
  <p>In terms of visual identity, the question for the teen 
      site in particular was how to relate the name and visual identity to the overall 
      MoMA.org site. Red Studio is an umbrella site for this particular audience, 
      so we felt it should have its own identity. How do we create a fun and fresh 
      identity that neither condescends to our young audience nor seems inappropriate 
      in relation to the Museum's identity? In addition, 'Red Studio' has the potential 
      to apply to offline initiatives, but its initial application is only for this 
      on-line project. Therefore, we asked ourselves, What kind of name and identity 
      meets our current needs but can potentially be expanded to fit future needs?</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="schwartz_fig7.jpg" alt="Vito Acconci and the teens are featured on teh home page of Red Studio" width="400" height="325"></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 7: Red Studio screen: Home page<br>
    <a href="http://www.moma.org/redstudio/" target="_blank">http://www.moma.org/redstudio/</a> </p>
  <p>Chopping Block spent a lot of time with us talking about 
      the teen site and its visual intent. They also showed the TAG a number of 
      teen-oriented sites to get a sense of what their age group responded to visually. 
      The naming and identity-creation processes were nonetheless incredibly challenging 
      and involved key input from Graphic Design, Marketing, Education, and Digital 
      Media.</p>
  <p>As the sites neared completion, Marketing developed a promotional 
      plan which targeted both Web and print publicity in newspapers and on postcards. 
      We recognize the importance of word of mouth and viral marketing through e-mail, 
      so e-cards are built into the activity areas of both the teen site and the 
      umbrella site.</p>
  <p class=xl73>To promote the Web sites, Marketing decided 
      on two complementary goals: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>driving traffic to both 
          sites; </li>
    <li>raising awareness that 
          MoMA.org is a resource that makes modern art accessible, understandable, and 
          enjoyable for young people.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class=xl73>In conjunction with the Museum's Communications 
      Department (Press Office), Marketing recommended the launch of both sites 
      together, to reinforce MoMA's commitment to education and outreach. </p>
  <p class=xl73>MoMA Communications compiled an extensive 
      list of publications read by parents, teachers, and teens to which publicity 
      could be given. In addition to mailing them press releases, a press representative 
      personally met with key editors and writers to pitch stories. </p>
  <p class=xl73>We segmented our target audience for the marketing 
      campaign as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The MoMA community, which includes visitors, members, staff, 
          and Trustees </li>
    <li>Teachers </li>
    <li>Parents who participate in cultural activities with their children, 
          especially in the NYC area </li>
    <li>Teenagers who read Web sites and publications with nonprofit, 
          mission-driven, or do-it-yourself orientation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class=xl73>We further broke down our segments to help 
      identify their interests and resources. As parents are usually the 
      familial decision-makers, our kid site audience was defined as parents looking 
      on the Web for creative activities for their kids, rather than kids themselves. 
      Conversely, teens were our target for Red Studio. We realized that the most 
      efficient way to reach teens is through teen publications.</p>
  <p>Once we established our target audiences, we approached 
      a variety of Web and print publications, many with a national readership. 
      We were also able to stretch our budget by looking at free or low-cost marketing 
      options such as free listings and internal publications to members.</p>
  <h1>Feedback and Evaluation</h1>
  <p>Both Web sites have received a notable amount of feedback from constituents, 
      both internal and external. In the case of the children's site, there was 
      a desire to ensure that the curatorial staff were aware of our work and were 
      comfortable with the playful art history approach that was being proposed. 
      Curators joined the team in choosing an illustrator and reviewed early drafts 
      of the activities. Curatorial questions about the goals of the site strengthened 
      the process, and curators often had great ideas about comparisons, images, 
      and connections that could be made between featured works of art. </p>
  <p>Undoubtedly, the most important evaluative moment for Destination: Modern 
      Art was a formative study conducted after the interactivity of the site was 
      up and running. Generously, the Children's Museum of Manhattan agreed to allow 
      MoMA staff to spend a weekend in its galleries interviewing children and observing 
      their responses to the site. The lessons learned were invaluable; the future 
      of the site changed dramatically. It was determined that the site had too 
      much text: children often did not read even the simplest text. Their interest 
      was far more intuitive, and, we realized, appropriate to the age group (5 
      to 8) that we had identified as the core constituency for the site. The text 
      was rewritten, and a voice-over session was immediately scheduled so that 
      all text was reinforced by audio. </p>
  <p>Interestingly, many of this young group of users already understood certain 
      Web conventions, but others did not. Their use of the mouse was notably different 
      from adult users, and careful notes were made about when and what children 
      wanted to click on the site. Where certain objects had not been clickable, 
      they were made so, and new tools were developed to create multiple options 
      for navigating the site. </p>
  <p>Our formative research with the teens was quite different. Because six teens 
      were part of the development team, we had a constant feedback loop throughout 
      the planning process. The advantage is obvious; the disadvantage is worth 
      noting. The teens were close to the project, invested in it, and partial to 
      the ideas that were developing out of their work. So, while their thoughts 
      about the name of the site or the design were highly valued, the TAG could 
      not be a reliable source of feedback on the usability of the site. This portion 
      of testing will have to come from teens who have not been involved in the 
      planning and with whom we will be staging substantive summative research. 
      The results of this research will be ready this spring, and lessons learned 
      will be applied to the second feature of Red Studio.</p>
  <p>Once both sites are up and running, we will employ two 
      important forms of summative research. In the quantitative realm, we will 
      track use of the sites, the number of hits, the amount of time spent on the 
      site, and the paths taken by users. Quantitative research will be conducted 
      by observing pairs who will be asked to explore the site while they talk to 
      one another about what they are doing and their response to what they find. 
      This observation technique provides the researcher with slightly more authentic 
      reactions than straight interviews, because children tend to be more natural 
      and honest in their reactions when conversing with one another. The results 
      of these observational studies will also be factored into the planning of 
      phase two of both sites. Participants in these studies will be solicited both 
      in the Museum and in schools where MoMA has ongoing access to appropriately 
      aged students</p>
  <h1>The Future</h1>
  <p>When both Web sites are launched, they will be tested extensively, as described 
      above. In both cases, a second set of modules is being prepared and may well 
      introduce new elements of design and content, depending upon feedback from 
      users. </p>
  <p>As of this writing, the design competition is underway, and the judging of 
      the contest will take place this summer. The quality of the entries will tell 
      us a great deal about our marketing efforts and about the interest teens have 
      in responding to a Web-based competition put forth by the Museum.</p>
  <p>While the primary target audience for these sites is individual users, we 
      are interested in learning about the potential use of these sites in a school 
      setting. We know that computer teachers are always eager for new resources 
      and that humanities and art teachers may be able to create research projects 
      via the sites. How might these sites find their way into preexisting curricula? 
      Are the sites dynamic enough to spur varied assignments? What tools might 
      enhance their use in a school setting? </p>
  <p>As Red Studio evolves, it will become an umbrella site for all of MoMA's 
      teen programs - a location within MoMA.org where teens can go to learn about 
      programs and events, create their own submissions to new Web activities, or 
      see interviews with participating artists.</p>
  <p>Discussions are now underway with colleagues in Marketing 
      and Retail about whether the Museum should extend the life of this site through 
      collateral materials for teens, be it through Museum brochures or items for 
      the MoMA Design Store. This site did not have the initial goal of creating 
      a visual identity for this age group, but that may end up being a byproduct 
      of it.</p>
  <p>Because both sites have been developed in episodic formats, 
      the staff will be able to apply the lessons learned from feedback and to build 
      resources that can be part of a continuum, rather than starting new sites 
      from scratch. With the sensibilities of young audiences in constant flux, 
      these sites will allow for new tools and aesthetics. If these two sites succeed 
      in capturing the attention of their intended audiences, these first iterations 
      will provide a gateway to more communication and knowledge about how to exploit 
      these new technologies to reach young audiences.</p>
  <p>In closing, it is worth noting that the relationship of 
      these Web sites to the actual Museum experience is synergistic. Indeed, museums 
      are only beginning to understand the possible ways in which the Web can create 
      unique tools that are challenging, creative, and engaging for youth, and that 
      are authentic experiences in themselves while simultaneously signaling the 
      irreplaceable experience of original works of art. </p>
