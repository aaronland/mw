      <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>In 2000, the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes 
          of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, committed to developing an exhibition 
          about the history of America's women physicians. Through the use 
          of biography, <i>Changing the Face of Medicine: Celebrating America's 
          Women Physicians</i> illustrates the larger themes in the history of 
          women in medicine. The Library's Exhibition Program worked with 
          a twenty-five-member advisory group comprised of representatives from 
          the medical and history communities to nominate over 300 notable and 
          accomplished women for inclusion in the exhibition. </p>
        <p>The women's stories are exciting, moving, compelling, inspiring. 
          There are stories about many different kinds of women practicing medicine 
          in many different ways with different patients. The project team strove 
          for diversity in all areas, wanting everyone to find someone in the 
          show to identify with and to find that person in the Digital Portrait 
          Gallery of physicians.</p>
        <p>This commitment to diversity and access to the exhibition's content 
          extended into the creative process. Working with Second Story - technically 
          proficient, intellectually capable, conceptually innovative people &mdash; 
          and working closely with the Library's information technology 
          office created a visually compelling Web site that provides an equivalent 
          experience for all visitors.</p>
      <h1>Eliminating Barriers in Information Technology: Background</h1>
        <p>In 1998, Congress amended the 1973 Rehabilitation Act to require federal 
          agencies to make their electronic and information technology (EIT) accessible 
          to people with disabilities. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act was 
          enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology because inaccessible 
          technology can interfere with an individual's ability to obtain and 
          use information quickly and easily.</p>
        <p>Section 508 is vital, since, according to the United States 2000 Census, 
          there are approximately 50 million people in America with some type 
          of disability. This number is expected to grow dramatically as the population 
          ages. The 2000 Census further estimates there are 48.4 million people 
          living in the United States who are 55 years of age or older, with this 
          figure projected to skyrocket to over 100 million by 2025.</p>
        <p>As this population ages, there will be heavier reliance upon electronic 
          and information technology to support information dissemination. The 
          1998 amendments to Section 508 directed the Architectural and Transportation 
          Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) to develop and publish standards 
          and the technical criteria necessary for achieving accessibility to 
          electronic and information technology by individuals with disabilities. 
          The criteria for Web-based technology and information are based on access 
          guidelines developed by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World 
          Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Many of these provisions ensure access to 
          Web-based information for people with vision impairments who rely on 
          various assistive products, such as screen readers which translate what's 
          on a computer screen into automated audible output.</p>
        <p>For those unfamiliar with accessibility issues pertaining to Web page 
          design, the need for Section 508 compliance is clear: we must understand 
          that many users may be operating in contexts very different from our 
          own:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
           Users may not be able to see, hear, move, or process 
            some types of information easily or at all. </li>
        <li> 
           Users may have difficulty reading or comprehending 
            text. </li>
        <li> 
           Users may not have or be able to use a keyboard 
            or mouse. </li>
        <li> 
           Users may have a text-only screen, a small screen, 
            or a slow Internet connection. </li>
        <li> 
           Users may not speak or understand fluently the 
            language in which the document is written. </li>
        <li> 
           Users may have an early version of a browser, a 
            different browser entirely, a voice browser, or a different operating 
            system.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>To accommodate users' different needs, as stated 
          above, the National Library of Medicine is required to comply with Subpart 
          B - Technical Standards, Section 1194.22 Web-based Intranet and Internet 
          information and applications of the Section 508 final standards. In 
          order to provide accessible design solutions for problems that users 
          with certain disabilities may encounter, the following are the 16 Access 
          Board guidelines that must be followed by the National Library of Medicine's 
          Web masters: </p>
      <ol class="listwithnumbers">
        <li> A text equivalent 
            for every non-text element shall be provided (e.g., via &quot;alt&quot;, 
            &quot;longdesc&quot;, or in element content). </li>
        <li> Equivalent 
            alternatives for any multimedia presentation shall be synchronized 
            with the presentation. </li>
        <li> 
          Web pages shall be designed so that all information 
            conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from 
            context or markup.</li>
        <li> 
          Documents shall be organized so they are 
            readable without requiring an associated style sheet.</li>
        <li> 
          Redundant text links shall be provided for 
            each active region of a server-side image map.</li>
        <li> 
          Client-side image maps shall be provided 
            instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot 
            be defined with an available geometric shape.</li>
        <li> 
          Row and column headers shall be identified 
            for data tables.</li>
        <li> 
          Markup shall be used to associate data cells 
            and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels 
            of row or column headers.</li>
        <li> 
          Frames shall be titled with text that facilitates 
            frame identification and navigation.</li>
        <li> 
          Pages shall be designed to avoid causing 
            the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower 
            than 55 Hz.</li>
        <li> 
          A text-only page, with equivalent information 
            or functionality, shall be provided to make a Web site comply with 
            the provisions of this part, when compliance cannot be accomplished 
            in any other way. The content of the text-only page shall be updated 
            whenever the primary page changes.</li>
        <li> 
          When pages utilize scripting languages to 
            display content, or to create interface elements, the information 
            provided by the script shall be identified with functional text that 
            can be read by assistive technology.</li>
        <li> 
          When a Web page requires that an applet, 
            plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret 
            page content, the page must provide a link to a plug-in or applet 
            that complies with §1194.21(a) through (l).</li>
        <li> 
          When electronic forms are designed to be 
            completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology 
            to access the information, field elements, and functionality required 
            for completion and submission of the form, including all directions 
            and cues.</li>
        <li> 
          A method shall be provided that permits users 
            to skip repetitive navigation links.</li>
        <li> 
          When a timed response is required, the user 
            shall be alerted and given sufficient time to indicate more time is 
            required.</li>
      </ol>
       
        <p>The intent of Section 508 is to ensure that federal employees and/or 
          members of the public with disabilities have access to and use of electronic 
          and information technology comparable to that of the employees and members 
          of the public without disabilities. Since the National Library of Medicine 
          is a federal agency that provides information to the public and to their 
          employees through their Web sites, the Library must ensure that these 
          sites are accessible to all people, including people with disabilities. 
          That is why the National Library of Medicine is committed to the spirit 
          of the Section 508 Law.</p>
        <h1>Dynamic Design Solutions</h1>
        <p>Over the years, the Web community has defined standards for creative 
          developers to use in order to publish materials on-line. These standards 
          serve as guidelines for developing accessible Web sites and their content 
          for people with disabilities; however, it is often left to subjective 
          interpretation as to <b>how well</b> the standards have been implemented 
          and <b>how</b> <b>well</b> they meet the checkpoints of the three priorities: 
          Must, Should and May satisfy the requirements of Section 508. In developing 
          the <i>Changing the Face of Medicine</i> exhibition Web site for the 
          National Library of Medicine, the designers and programmers overcame 
          a variety of challenges in order to realize the two main project goals, 
          which were to</p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          Incorporate media-rich interactive experiences; 
            including the creation of four Flash based games, over 40 documentary 
            videos and five artifact interactives.</li>
        <li> 
          Create a Web site that is compliant with Section 
            508 requirements.</li>
      </ol>
       
        <p>Developing a Web site that meets the requirements of Section 508 and 
          also offers a variety of media-rich interactive experiences is a tremendous 
          challenge because there is often a series of compromises or trade-offs 
          that need to occur in order to meet both of these goals. There are two 
          main reasons for creating Web sites: to provide access to information, 
          and to create an interactive experience. If all the developer needed 
          to do were just to provide access to information, the creation of a 
          Web site that is compliant with Section 508 requirements would be much 
          easier. In this scenario, developers often create page-based content 
          comprised of a series of templates and text-based information that uses 
          HTML, XML and CSS programming languages to create a series of Web pages 
          that function as a publishing tool. </p>

        <p class=MsoCaption><span class="caption">Fig. 1: Home </span>page of 
          Changing the Face of Medicine</p>
        <p>The challenge arises when you try to take this content and put it in 
          the context of a time-based, dynamic interactive experience. Creating 
          an immersive, engaging, cinematic experience through Web publishing 
          is very challenging because it takes advantage of media-rich graphics, 
          audio, video, and animation and in essence layers information over a 
          period of time.</p>

        <p class=MsoCaption><span class="caption">Fig. 2: </span>an interactive 
          page. </p>
        <p>In order to reach the largest audience possible, the Web site needs 
          to employ an overall information architecture that makes the content 
          understandable and navigable. The interface design needs to accommodate 
          a high degree of flexibility so that users with assistive products can 
          customize the viewing of the content specific to their needs. This is 
          our challenge: to design a controlled, graphic rich, visual interface 
          with the flexibility of an ever-changing environment that can adapt 
          to any tools and technology being used by the end user to view the Web 
          site. There is a variety of programming languages and checklists in 
          place to help developers create accessible Web sites that ensure graceful 
          transformation so that content remains accessible and visual graphics 
          and layout retain a level of graceful integration across all pages, 
          browsers and platforms. </p>
        <p>The following is a checklist of priorities:</p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li> 
          Integration of graphic images and alt identification 
            tags for all artwork</li>
        <li> 
          Use of color that allows for the highest contrast 
            and visibility</li>
        <li> 
          Use of flexible fonts that can be adjusted to a 
            variety of sizes</li>
        <li> 
          Creating external style sheets that let users define 
            their own styles according to their unique needs</li>
        <li> 
          Providing keyboard commands for navigating the Web 
            site and making meta navigation language clear and understandable, 
            along with the use of headers and footers at the top and bottom of 
            each page</li>
        <li> 
          Creating pages that do not rely on just one type 
            of hardware or software, so as to better serve a variety of visitors 
            such as those who do not use mice, or have small screens, or view 
            in low resolution, or possibly do not view content with a screen at 
            all and only have text output. </li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>The exhibition team at the National Library of Medicine provided early 
          concept documents and content outlines. These revealed graphically rich 
          interfaces with animations and illustrations that communicated highly 
          complex concepts and game-like environments to engage and educate students 
          and users of all ages. Immediately it was clear that these objectives 
          could not be met in a traditional page-based Web interface using standard 
          programming languages such as HTML, XML, etc. Rather than clicking from 
          page to page to have access to information, the user needed to navigate 
          through a variety of time-based content that layered information based 
          on user input (with unique options and choices)  to complete the activity. 
        </p>
        <p>The development of these concepts required the use of  Flash Player, 
          a Plug-in that can be used in a variety of Web browsers. Although some 
          of the latest Web browsers are distributed with the Flash Player, it 
          is still viewed as an additional requirement for viewing the Web site, 
          and is thus a technological barrier to accessing information. This challenge 
          requires the development of multiple, alternate versions of the content 
          for it to be accessible to the largest possible audience and to fulfill 
          the priorities of Section 508 compliance. </p>
        <p>But the degree to which one develops and accommodates the highest priority 
          of Section 508 requirements undermines the overall development costs. 
          In terms of development, it is technically possible to achieve the highest 
          compliance amongst Section 508 requirements for media-rich, time based 
          interactive experiences; however, it is not cost effective. Often in 
          developing these types of interactive experiences a series of goals, 
          objectives and specifications need to be outlined before the concepts 
          are further defined and the programming is implemented. This allows 
          all team members to review and assess the alternative options that will 
          need to be developed in order to satisfy the priorities of Section 508 
          compliance.</p>
        <p>The creation of the Educational Activities, Video Documentaries and 
          Artifact Interactives all required content to be presented in a time-based 
          environment and required development authoring using either Macromedia 
          Flash or Apple QuickTime. Developers had to ensure graceful transformation 
          across the alternative options as well as employ the standard page-based 
          Section 508 compliance checklist. </p>

        <p class="caption">Fig 3:  An interactive screen</p>
        <p>The levels of complication began to multiply, and additional programming 
          and scripting were implemented to allow the Educational Activities  
          to be functional for visitors who do not use mice and/or use E-Readers 
          for the Web browser (see fig.3).. </p>

        <p class="caption">Fig. 4: alternative print screen</p>
        <p>An alternate text only option was made available to visitors who prefer 
          not to view graphics, animations or other interactive content (see fig 
          4). </p>

        <p>With the newer versions of QuickTime (4.1-6.5), videos were authored 
          to display in-line captions which are accessible on demand through activating 
          system links (see fig.5). For visitors who prefer not to view and download 
          videos, text only transcripts were made available (see fig. 6). </p>
        <p>The Artifact Interactives were developed as kiosks for the exhibition. 
          Each kiosk is placed directly in front of a physical exhibition artifact, 
          and via computer-run touch screen monitors, visitors can bring to life 
          each artifact in ways that cannot be done to the real artifacts since 
          they sit enclosed in a glass case. These Artifact Interactives had to 
          be modified from the kiosk versions in order to be presented on the 
          Web to meet Section 508 compliance (see fig.7).</p>

        <p class=MsoCaption><span class="caption">Fig.7: artifact visual, interactiv</span>e</p>
        <p> Since they require the Flash Player, specific programming scripting 
          was put into place to prompt visitors and offer a text-only alternate 
          (see fig.8).</p>

        <p><b><i> </i></b>The role that the presentation plays in the contextualization 
          of content is very important. Although these alternate options and versions 
          that were provided tend to strip the content of its context, there is 
          often little that can be done about this issue due to the types of tools 
          and technologies available for development. These alternative options 
          provide the opportunity to reach the largest, most diverse audience 
          possible and ensure graceful transformation of all media-rich, time 
          based, dynamic interactive experiences so that they are accessible to 
          people with disabilities. As the tools and technologies continue to 
          evolve, there will be greater strides towards developing more powerful 
          technology  to deliver accessible Web content to people with disabilities.

        <h1>Evaluation of the Accessibility of <i>Changing the Face of Medicine</i></h1>
        <p>John Slatin examined three specific pages from <i>Changing the Face 
          of Medicine</i> to evaluate the merits of two different approaches to 
          interactive multimedia used in the on-line exhibition. He looked at:</p>
      <ol class="listwithbullets">
        <li> 
          the home page,</li>
        <li> 
          an Activities Interactives page, and</li>
        <li> 
          the biography page for Dr. M. Joycelyn Elders.</li>
      </ol>
       
        <p>He also looked at two of the four activities linked from the Activities 
          Interactives page, The Doctor Is In and Sickle-Cell Anemia.</p>
        <p>His review included three steps: testing with an automated tool (Bobby 
          Worldwide), manual compliance checking (to follow up on the Bobby report), 
          and an expert review in which he compared his own sense of the pages 
          as I experienced them through the JAWS screen reader against the results 
          of the automated review and the compliance checks. This third component 
          was where things got more complicated (and more interesting). </p>
        <p>Before discussing his findings, however, let us say a few words about 
          screen readers.</p>
        <p>Screen readers are <i>the </i>essential tools for people who are blind. 
          In case you've never encountered one, in essence, screen readers 
          do what the name suggests: they read the screen aloud. (It's actually 
          a good deal more complicated than that, but this will do for present 
          purposes.) Reading starts at the top of the page and proceeds left to 
          right, line by line, until it comes to the end or the user stops it. 
          If there's text on the page, the screen reader speaks it aloud 
          in a synthetic voice. It also identifies different types of links, including 
          graphical links, image map links, and this-page links to other locations 
          on the current page. Screen readers also indicate the presence of graphics 
          and other elements such as tables, lists, frames, headings, and forms. 
          Some screen readers, including JAWS, can also handle multimedia and 
          animation created with Macromedia Flash. </p>
        <p>It's worth noting that it isn't easy to pass both automated 
          tests and what Bobby calls 'user checks,' as these pages 
          do. Passing these tests and meeting Section 508 requirements mean, for 
          example, that every image element has an alt attribute to provide something 
          for screen readers to use in place of the image. It also means that 
          color isn't used as the only means of conveying information -an 
          important thing for people with color deficient vision, including most 
          seniors, and people whose monitors don't display color. </p>
        <p>The pages still make sense without style sheets, too. Cascading Style 
          Sheets (CSS) are the best way to control everything from font- and color-selection 
          to spacing and layout, but there are people who use browsers that display 
          only 'plain vanilla' text, while others substitute style 
          sheets that meet their own special needs. Moreover, screen readers ignore 
          visual effects created by style sheets (including the visual order of 
          text and images). Section 508 requires that pages make sense under these 
          circumstances. </p>
        <p>The video clip of Dr. Elders speaking about her life meets all the 
          Section 508 requirements: the window in which it appears includes a 
          link to turn on captions (these text equivalents for audio are essential 
          for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, and important also for people 
          who aren't native speakers, students who are developing readers, 
          and people viewing the site in a facility that doesn't provide 
          speakers (such as many school libraries). There's even a text 
          transcript so that people who use those text-only browsers and people 
          who are deaf-blind can read what Dr. Elders has to say. Finally, there's 
          also a link to download the QuickTime player needed to watch the video, 
          another Section 508 requirement. The Activities Interactives page meets 
          this same requirement with a link to download the Macromedia Flash player 
          needed to take full advantage of the interactive aspects of the learning 
          activities </p>
        <p>In addition, every page on the site has a <i>Skip navigation</i> link. 
          This isn't visible to the naked eye: its purpose is to allow people 
          using screen readers (which also drive the refreshable Braille displays 
          that some blind users prefer) to jump over tall navigation blocks at 
          a single bound. That is, the Skip navigation link lets you avoid listening 
          to all the navigational links that appear across the top and down the 
          left side of the pages on this site (and most other sites on the Web). 
          This may seem like a small thing, but remember that screen readers read 
          from left to right and top to bottom: Without the Skip navigation link, 
          people using screen readers will hear all those links <i>first</i> on 
          every page, <i>before </i>they hear the real substance of the page; 
          this takes over 40 seconds, according to my stopwatch. By contrast, 
          most users who are sighted don't even notice those navigation 
          bars are there until they want to move on. Part of the point of good 
          visual design is to draw the eye smoothly to important material; the 
          navigation bars are at the periphery. Skip navigation links help provide 
          a similar experience for users who are blind.</p>
        <p>But there are flies in the ointment, too. One set of issues involves 
          things that appear at first to be 508-compliant, but turn out not to 
          be. Another set of concerns involves what are best described as usability 
          issues whose impact on people with disabilities is disproportionately 
          greater than it is for people who don't have disabilities. </p>
        <p>The list of things that appear to be 508-compliant but really aren't 
          includes the following:</p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li> 
           graphical links on the Joycelyn Elders page 
            have 'empty' alt attributes where empty alt attributes 
            aren't allowed;</li>
        <li> 
           images in the Photo Gallery have redundant 
            alt text but don't have extended descriptions as they should; 
            and</li>
        <li> 
           text-only versions of learning activities 
            don't really provide 'equivalent alternatives' to 
            the activities as implemented in Flash.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p class=listwithbullets>On the usability side of the ledger, there is 
          some confusion about link text (including alt text for graphical links); 
          there are duplicate (and not-quite-duplicate) links; and there are links 
          that open without warning in new browser windows (this <i>is </i>an 
          accessibility issue under the World Wide Web Consortium's Web 
          Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0, however). The 14 photographs of 
          women physicians that appear at the top of each page and change whenever 
          a page is loaded or reloaded pose a potential distraction for people 
          listening to the constantly-changing alt text, and for users with learning 
          disabilities or cognitive impairments. We don't have room to discuss 
          the usability issues here, but mention them in hopes that readers will 
          work to avoid confusing link text and needless duplicate links on their 
          own sites.</p>
        <p><i>Alt text </i>is text associated with the images on a Web page via 
          the alt attribute of the &lt;img&gt; element; alt text is what screen 
          readers read when they encounter an image, and what text-only browsers 
          display. The Joycelyn Elders page includes a Photo Gallery consisting 
          of five images. There are three thumbnail-sized photographs and a link 
          that says, "Launch Photo Gallery (five images)." The first 
          time we visited the page, we were sure that the alt text for some of 
          the images was missing. Here's what JAWS said when it got to the 
          Photo Gallery section:</p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li>
          Link graphic gallerythumb/098_01</li>
        <li>
          Link graphic gallerythumb/098_02</li>
        <li>
          Link graphic gallerythumb/098_05</li>
        <li>
          Launch Photo Gallery (5 images)</li>
        <li>
          Link graphic img/icon_gallery</li>
      </ul>
      
        <p>When JAWS says <i>Link graphic gallerythumb/098_01 </i>or <i>Link graphic 
          img/icon_gallery,</i> we hear a filename&#8212;what JAWS reads by default 
          when an image has no alt text. This is why we ran <i>Bobby</i>. The 
          program is very good at uncovering images without alt text, so we were 
          sure it would find these four&#8212;but it didn't find anything 
          wrong. We looked at the source code. Sure enough, each image had an 
          alt attribute that read <i>alt=""  </i>This is called "empty 
          alt text"; it's designed to force screen readers to skip 
          over images that don't carry meaning, like the spacers used to 
          create white space on the page or decorative frames for images.  JAWS 
          should have ignored those images. What was going on?</p>
        <p>That was when it hit me: all four of these images (the three thumbnail 
          photos and the icon that links to the Photo Gallery) are <em>links­. 
          </em>They may be graphical links, but they're links. And graphics 
          that serve as links <i>must not have empty alt attributes.</i> A graphic 
          that serves as a link <i>does </i>carry information - about the destination 
          of the link. Therefore, there must be <i>meaningful </i>alt text on 
          all graphical links. The screen reader speaks the alt text whenever 
          it encounters the image; for example, when the user tabs to the image 
          or brings up a list of all the links on the page. (The link shows up 
          in the links list even when the alt text is empty; the screen reader 
          has to say <i>something</i>, so by default it reports the filename. 
          At best this is ugly; at worst it's confusing and nullifies the 
          user's ability to navigate the site.)</p>
        <p>But there are cases where it's acceptable to put empty alt text 
          on a graphic that serves as a link. As a case in point, there are actually 
          two links to launch the Photo Gallery - a text link (Launch Photo Gallery) 
          and an adjacent icon that goes to the same place. Sighted users see 
          them as a unit; and in fact both the text and the icon could have been 
          treated as part of the same HTML element, in which case it would have 
          been acceptable  to make empty alt text for the icon! (The code would 
          look something like this: &lt;a href="photogallery.html"&gt;Launch 
          Photo Gallery&lt;img src=" img/icon_gallery" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).) 
        </p>
        <p>The empty alt attribute (alt="") could also have been used 
          to good effect in the Photo Gallery itself. The gallery contains five 
          images, shown one at a time. The user can select them by number or simply 
          use the Next link each time to go through the sequence. There is a caption 
          beneath each image, and the alt text is identical to the caption; people 
          using screen readers hear the same thing twice. This redundancy could 
          have been avoided by setting the alt text to empty and allowing the 
          on-screen caption to do the work for everybody. If these images conveyed 
          more information than the caption (or alt text) could reasonably provide, 
          then an additional description should have been provided, either on 
          the same screen as the image or on a linked page.</p>
        <p>Let's turn now to the Activities Interactives. As we noted earlier, 
          there are actually two versions of each activity: the Flash version 
          (which is the main one, the 'real' one) and the text-only 
          version, provided for those who don't or can't use Flash. 
          This may sound like a good solution, but in fact it's not. Section 
          508 explicitly says that text-only variants may be provided only as 
          a last resort, when the page cannot be made accessible in another way. 
          The text-only variant must then provide as nearly equivalent an experience 
          as possible. we don't believe this standard has been met, at least 
          in the case of The Doctor Is In and Sickle Cell Anemia.  we believe 
          that an accessible version of these activities could have been provided, 
          one that would include both images and text and allow for user interaction 
          as well.  </p>
        <p>Central to both activities are images that reveal additional information 
          when the student user mouses over them. Text on the screen calls the 
          student's attention to specific aspects of those images ('See 
          the orange areas?' for example). The text-only versions contain 
          exactly the same text, right down to the (now very rhetorical) question 
          ('See the orange areas?'). In other words, the text-only 
          versions don't make sense unless students can see the images. 
          In order to meet the 508 standard, there would have to be additional 
          descriptions of the images, equivalent to what students who are sighted 
          can see. The text-only versions aren't interactive, either: whereas 
          the Flash activities comprise a sequence of screens, the text-only version 
          is a single file that isn't linked to anything else. </p>
        <p>It needn't have been so flat. The graphics could just as easily 
          have been .gifs or .jpegs (the most widely used image formats). Each 
          image might have actually consisted of several smaller images (though 
          sighted users would perceive just one). A detailed text description 
          could have been associated with each of these constituent images. This 
          could be done using an attribute called longdesc, designed expressly 
          for people who use screen readers, or via an explicit link on the screen 
          (which would make the descriptions available to anyone who wanted them). 
          All students could step through the sequence using the Next and Previous 
          buttons. And so forth.</p>
        <p>Are these violations of Section 508 fatal? No. Users can ignore the 
          thumbnail images and use the text link to launch the Joycelyn Elders 
          photo gallery, though in the absence of long descriptions, users who 
          can't see those images will learn less than they might otherwise. 
          By the same token, students reading the text-only versions of the Activities 
          Interactives won't have quite as rich an experience as peers who 
          get the Flash versions, though much of the core <i>information</i> is 
          there. But there's the rub: learning isn't just about information. 
          Imagine a classroom full of middle-schoolers whose teacher is introducing 
          them (as often happens these days) to the idea of a career. The teacher 
          especially wants to give the girls in the class reasons for keeping 
          up with their work in science and math now that they're reaching 
          the age when many girls drop out of the sciences. She sends them to 
          visit <i>Changing the Face of Medicine</i> and suggests that they find 
          out about Dr. Elders and check out some of the things doctors do. The 
          class includes a girl who is blind and another with cerebral palsy who 
          doesn't use a mouse. What will be the quality of <i>their </i>experience 
          compared to the experience of their classmates? How will the differences 
          affect them?</p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>So. How does this case study answer the questions: What does this mean 
          to users of the internet? To government agencies? To the creative community?</p>
        <p>These are big questions - questions we all have to answer for ourselves. 
          The goals for this paper were to raise the issue, to spark a debate, 
          to assist in creating change or, in some cases, to simply reconfirm 
          the status quo.</p>
        <p>The Exhibition Program is part of a public institution whose mission 
          includes organizing and disseminating information to a world audience. 
          Our visitors and patrons matter a great deal to us, and we try to respond 
          to each person's individual questions and specific needs. I also 
          want to gain recognition and respect for the quality of our projects 
          within the different communities where we work: the scholarly, the creative, 
          the technical, and the education communities, as well. </p>
        <p><i>Changing the Face of Medicine</i> became a vehicle to push these 
          goals for our program to a new level. We wanted a dynamic and sophisticated 
          approach to our Web site - not the standard government-issue design. 
          We didn't want a two-Web site solution, with one portal for 'them,'  
          and one portal for 'you.' We strove for an equal but different 
          experience for all our visitors. And, overall, we succeeded. </p>
        <p>The questions John Slatin raises at the end of his comments about the 
          Web site focus on precisely the kind of review and evaluation the project 
          team experience for the entire Web site. They are important to us, of 
          course, but all choices involve some compromise:</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">I made decisions to compromise on the experience we 
          would offer the young girl who is blind and the student with cerebral 
          palsy. Looking back, knowing what I know now, would I make that same 
          decision? I don't know. I don't know if I can put myself 
          in that state of being again: weighing administrative pressures, financial 
          limitations, schedule issues, personality crises. Sometimes the disabled 
          visitor's needs seemed a distant reality. For our next on-line 
          exhibition, though, we will plan more carefully so we have the time 
          to consider more deeply how we can develop equal and different content 
          when something is going to be lost during the transition between different 
          technologies and formats. </p>
