         <p class="AbstractText">In this paper we present a critical overview of 
          an experiment in collaborative teaching/learning using Web-based tools. 
          Collaborating institutions were the University of Art &amp; Design in 
          Helsinki, Finland, and the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, USA. 
          Graduate level students attending different (but with substantial overlap) 
          courses in Finland and the US were connected using Future Learning Environment 
          (FLE) developed at the Media Lab of University of Art &amp; Design.&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
        <p>Within the past several years there has been a dramatic 
          increase in the number of institutions offering 'distance education' 
          courses.  Although many of these courses include Web-based tools like 
          'chat rooms' and discussion lists, the prevalent conceptual 
          model is that of a traditional correspondence school.  This model works 
          well in a number of cases but is not as efficient in knowledge building 
          for 'ill-defined domains' like most of the Arts and Humanities 
          subjects.  The model that seems more promising in this area is the one 
          of <i>technology supported collaborative learning/teaching</i>. In this 
          model the focus shifts from building more efficient tools for information 
          distribution to the development of tools that support collaboration 
          in knowledge building. Although the model has been considerably conceptually 
          developed (see Koschmann 1996, for an overview, or Leinonen at al. 2002 
          for recent practical implementation) the number of practical applications 
          is relatively small.  The reason for this probably is that the population 
          who would benefit most from implementation of such tools is traditionally 
          technology shy.  This presents specific design challenges that require 
          cross-disciplinary input.  In this paper we describe an attempt to create 
          a collaborative learning environment for the students from US (University 
          of the Arts, Philadelphia) and Finland (University of Art &amp; Design, 
          Helsinki) as well as their connection with experts and content providers 
          (Finnish National Gallery).</p>
        <h1>2. Division Of Work And Goals</h1>
        <p>What follows is the short description of the courses 
          offered at the two Universities.</p>
        <p>The course at the University of the Arts was designed 
          to prepare art and museum educators for the development, supervision 
          and assessment of the use of new technologies in the art classroom, 
          museums and outreach education programming. During the course the 
          students learned, in a hands-on fashion, how to design and create an 
          interactive multimedia project.  In addition, this course covered a 
          variety of issues and approaches in regard to educational programming 
          using interactive media.  The potential for use of new technologies 
          for effective communication with various audiences was examined via 
          related literature, field observations and critiques/assessments.  The 
          main focus of the course was on the development of technology supported 
          collaborative teaching/learning environments. </p>
        <p>The goal of the course at the University of Art &amp; 
          Design (Helsinki) was to allow the students to create models of interaction 
          with the works of art. They focused on creating a prototype of an interactive 
          interface that would enhance the user experience and facilitate knowledge 
          transfer. The interface could be either between the user and the knowledge 
          base (using chat bots, avatars, interactive applications), or between 
          an expert and the user/learner (in this case the interface should facilitate 
          communication between the two &mdash; Web-based video, interactive whiteboard, 
          etc.)</p>
        <h1>2.1. E-team Building</h1>
        <p>The members of the student teams working on projects 
          chose teams based on their individual expertise and background. Ideally, 
          each team had students coming from different educational backgrounds 
          and interests; for example, an educator, industrial designer and new 
          media designer. Each team member was able to contribute to a different 
          aspect of the project &mdash; an educator brought the knowledge of appropriate 
          content and learning theories, industrial designers contributed to the 
          design of actual physical environment where collaboration takes place 
          and multimedia developers were able to prototype the proposed solutions. 
          Media designers studied the models of human communication and users 
          behavior in order to design user-friendly interfaces when executing 
          the concept. Expected number of students for this course was 12-16 at 
          the University of the Arts, Philadelphia and 6-8 students from the University 
          of Art &amp; Design in Helsinki. This would allow building of 4-5 E-teams. 
          Finally there were 9 students from Philadelphia and 5 students from 
          Helsinki.</p>

        <h1>3. Collaborative and Course-Specific Projects</h1>
        <p>A sample assignment for the mixed Finnish/American team of students 
          follows:</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Assignment for week 6: </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">1. Create a working group comprised of 2 students 
          from UARTS Philadelphia and one from Media Lab UIAH. </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">2. Choose the target of your evaluation, a museum-Web 
          page, or other similar kind of a place in the internet, </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">3. Evaluate the media, paying particular attention 
          to use of interaction design, other mediadesign (animation, film and 
          video). Pay attention to design. Is it accessible, usable? Write up 
          critique (2-4 pages) in a group with students from Philadelphia. (write 
          1-2 pages each for a total of 3-6 pages with urls). Use e-mail or FLE 
          to communicate and evaluate. Put critiques to FLE-discussion knowledge 
          building area. (<a href="http://virtu.uiah.fi:7070/ant" target="_blank">http://virtu.uiah.fi:7070/ant</a>).</p>
        <p>Although assignments of this kind were interesting to students and 
          were carried out successfully, the collaboration between two groups 
          did not extend much beyond working on a common topic and reviewing each 
          other's project proposals.  For the factors that affected the 
          quality of collaboration see the Analysis section.</p>
        <h1>3.1. UARTS / Interactive Media</h1>
        <p>The goal of the Interactive Media course at the University of the Arts 
          in Philadelphia was to prepare art and museum educators for the development, 
          supervision and assessment of the use of new technologies in the art 
          classroom, museums and outreach education programming. A large part 
          of the course was devoted to teaching the students how to design and 
          create an interactive multimedia project using a (relatively) simple 
          authoring environment (MetaCard). In addition, this course covered 
          a variety of issues and approaches in regard to educational programming 
          using interactive media.</p>
        <h2>3.2. Media Lab UIAH / Mummi-group</h2>
        <p>The aim was (and still is) to create a model of interaction 
          between the piece of art and visitor of an exhibition. We decided to 
          create a chat-bot which communicates with the visitor, gives information 
          (some kind of, according to its character and nature) and leads the 
          visitor to see different aspects from the piece of art. For this conceptual 
          and demo-version we chose one painting from the coming exhibition of 
          Urban Images and created one interactive chat-bot. </p>
        <h1>4. Analysis of the collaborative study project</h1>
        <p>Analysis of the collaborative activities between 
          cross-national teams of students revealed numerous problems but also 
          great educational potential of this approach.  </p>

        <li> 
           lack of awareness of partners study design 
            and production processes (museum wanted only an illustration for their 
            ideas, UARTS students worked on their individual projects, UIAH students 
            worked for the models and ideas of interaction) </li>
        <li>

        <h1>5. Study projects</h1>
        <h2 class=SubHeader>5.1 UARTS &mdash; Interactive media </h2>
        <p>The initial purpose of the common study project was 
          to promote the methods and good practice of user centered design, visitor 
          studies and accessibility matters (Design for All principle) and to 
          unite the expertise of both institutions for common objectives. The 
          project aims to incorporate the content rich and versatile cultural 
          heritage information with the latest innovations on digital interactive 
          applications and installations. It also aims to enhance the understanding 
          of museum visitors, their expectations of museum visit (both on-line 
          and in-site) and their various needs during the visit.</p>
        <p>During the course the students created a model of 
          interaction with the works of art. They were focused on creating a prototype 
          of an interactive interface that would enhance the user experience and 
          facilitate knowledge transfer.  The interface could be either between 
          the user and the knowledge base (using chat bots, avatars, interactive 
          applications), or between an expert and the user/learner (in this case 
          the interface should facilitate communication between the two &mdash; 
          Web-based video, interactive whiteboard, etc.)</p>

        <p class="caption"><a href="maenpaa.fig1.html">Figure 1: Greetings from Philadelphia: UARTS students 
          presented their projects &mdash; UIAH students commented.</a></p>
        <h2 class=SubHeader>5.2. Media Lab, UIAH and MUMMI</h2>
        <p>The Media Lab of University of Art and Design Helsinki 
          was formed in 1993. Today the Media Lab coordinates two 2-year masters' 
          programs: the MA in New Media and MA for New Media Professionals, both 
          programs with interdisciplinary students. The mission of the Media Lab 
          is to explore, discover and comprehend the new digital technology and 
          its impact in society; to find and exploit the possibilities it opens 
          to communication, interaction and expression and to evaluate, understand 
          and deal with the challenges it poses to design and creative production.</p>
        <p>The MUMMI as a &#8220;Design for All &amp; accessibility 
          to art history&#8221; - study project aims to benefit from the concepts 
          like accessibility and usability, and methods like Design for All, Universal 
          Design. Another goal is to gather together all the cumulative knowledge 
          and research done in Media Lab about these issues. What do these principles 
          mean when designing and planning media for wide audiences, media presentations 
          for museums and virtual museums? Naturally, these methods should also 
          be self-evident principles when designing new media solutions for every 
          kind of public usage. To study Multimodal interfaces is to understand 
          the conversational interface design of the future. (Jokinen, Raike 2002)</p>
        <p>In order to serve museum visitors better, the MUMMI 
          project wishes to create cultural heritage content that is meaningful, 
          intelligible, and communicable for its users - regardless of their backgrounds, 
          skills and learning styles or strategies. (Haapalainen, M&auml;enp&auml;&auml;, 2003)</p>
        <h2 class="SubHeader">5.3. Designing A Chat-Bot In Collaborative Study 
          Project</h2>
        <pindent3>Media Lab UIAH students started to plan alternative, 
          realistic models of interaction. At the beginning they had pictures 
          from the collection of Finnish National Gallery; they chose <i>S</i><i>kating 
          rink</i> by Sulho Sipil&auml; from 1932. They wrote different scenarios; 
          finally one scenario about chat-bot on the museum wall near the painting. 
          In the demo they created user can communicate with the chat-bot with 
          the keyboard and written words; group will continue its work and tries 
          to find more user friendly way to communicate.
        <pindent3>Durign the design process Medialab students 
          communicated and presented their ideas in the commonn Web-based platform. 
          Their aim was to make communcation with UARTS students and mentors from 
          Finnish Nartional Gallery as transparent and open as possible. The aim 
          was to share ideas, evaluate each others' projects and give feedback 
          and have comments. Unfortunately FLE - the Web-based environement - 
          did not work fluently and students became frustrated when they had to 
          solve technical problems instead of problems of the content.
        <p class="caption"><img src="maenpaa-fig2.gif" alt="discussion threads" width="460" height="683"></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 2: Collaboration in Future Learning Environment. 
          In knowledge building area students are solving problem-oriented tasks 
          and evaluating each other's projects.</p>
        <h2 class="SubHeader">5.4. Problems of Communication</h2>
        <p>Because the intercontinental communication didn't 
          work fluently, students from both universities thought that there might 
          have been differences in working and studying cultures. Both groups 
          were eager to give and have feedback and they were ready to spend more 
          extra time to build common understanding. Whereas Medialab students 
          expected that the study projects' working methods were on both 
          sides on collaborative, problem based learning, self-directed by students, 
          students from USA were more used to studying under exact guidelines 
          and well-designed given exercises.</p>
        <p>It was obvious that more precise tasks and objectives 
          for both student groups would have helped their communication. The benefits 
          of common knowledge building were not clearly announced. </p>
        <p>It is clear that the role of the tutors is emphasized 
          in flexible and distance education. It means twice as much work as physical 
          lecturing. Also the building of a virtual team is a difficult task. 
          Finally, in this case too few resources were devoted to collaboration 
          and building a real working virtual e-team.  Professor Tapio Varis writes 
          about how a competent e-Learning team should function:</p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">A team for producing quality e-learning material would 
          consist of something like 16 members. First, one person is needed for 
          managing the whole project. Secondly, three members are needed for designing 
          the course, including a lead designer, module designers, and subject 
          matter experts. Thirdly, six members are needed for building the content. 
          They would include course integrator, writers, graphics specialists, 
          multimedia developers, html/xml coders, and programmers. </p>
        <p class="BlockQuote">Fourthly, three members are needed to provide the 
          technical infrastructure. These people are network/service administrators, 
          server/database programmers, and technical support specialists. And 
          fifthly, three members are needed for conducting e-learning. They are 
          an administrator (curriculum), course facilitator, and online instructor. 
          (Varis, 2003)</p>
        <h2 class="SubHeader">5.5. Attract, Engage, Motivate, Activate, Satisfy: 
          The Mission of the Museum</h2>
        <p>Chat-bot is a virtual character helping users to 
          communicate with a written language. Chat-bot technology is based on 
          the metadata of words and lines; a certain word or line written by the 
          user gets a certain answer from chat-bot. The user could have a feeling 
          of natural communication when chatting with a chat-bot. (Saarinen 2001) 
          The metadata of words and lines is collected after research of the potential 
          user groups &mdash; middle aged women, school pupils and others most 
          common museum visitors.  </p>
        <p>The assignment to design a concept for an interactive 
          situation was at the beginning from Finnish National Gallery. Basically, 
          the chat-bot provided background information concerning a certain piece 
          of art in a certain exhibition, in this case the exhibition <b>Images 
          of Urban Finland.  </b>All the history of art and sources for the chat-bot 
          project were from the Finish National Gallery. When the media were designed 
          in open virtual platform, all the experts could comment on the discoveries 
          of students.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="maenpaa-fig3.jpg" alt="user with computer chat screen open" width="425" height="318"></p>
        <p class="caption">Figure 3: Conversation with cat-bot Sanelma, background 
          Sulho Sipil&auml;s painting Skating Rink from 1932. </p>
        <p>The aim is to represent the background of the art of Sulho Sipil&auml;, 
          the urban culture of Helsinki from 30's. Sulho Sipil&auml; used to look out 
          from his apartment window to the Viiskulma and Punavuori districts and 
          paint the scenes from his window. The second aim is to represent the 
          changes in the atmosphere in mental life in Finland; nationalism turned 
          to internationalism, National Romanticism turned to city optimism. </p>
