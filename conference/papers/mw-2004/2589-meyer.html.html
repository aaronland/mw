<p class="PaperTitle">Digitising African Oral Narratives In A Global Arena
</p>
<div class=Section1>
  <p class="Author">Renate Meyer, Centre for Popular Memory, UCT, South Africa</p>
  <p class="URL"><a href="http://www.popularmemory.org/" target="_blank">http://www.popularmemory.org</a></p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
   <p class="AbstractText">While technological advances provide new preservation 
    and dissemination practices for African archives, they rely largely on internationally 
    developed standards for digitisation and prioritisation of material. What 
    that means is African concerns relating to Intellectual Property, community 
    property and access to technology, as well as connection to global forums, 
    are largely ignored: technology is controlled by trans-national organizations 
    off the African continent. Issues such as ‘global homogeny’ focus the world 
    on the West - its practices, icons and language. Multi-lingualism for Web-based 
    media and digitisation/ transcription procedures for languages other than 
    English remain under-developed and under-prioritised. In short, there are 
    concerns that are specific to the African continent which are not being addressed 
    on a global level. Through the Centre for Popular Memory’s (CPM’s) audio visual 
    archive and the collection of narratives of urban terror and power relations 
    in the diasporas, these concerns are explored with relation to digitisation 
    procedures, storage mediums/customised digital repositories, and virtual archives 
    in a global context.</p>

  <h1>Introduction </h1>
  <p>South Africa is an interesting place: it lies on the southern tip of Africa 
    and yet is seen to be central to Africa’s ‘renaissance’. It is one of the 
    youngest democracies in Africa, but holds the power to lead the 53 countries 
    on the continent forward. It has one of the most liberal constitutions in 
    the world, set in place by a former prisoner, Nelson Mandela. It is a country 
    of 9 provinces, 11 official languages and 44 million people affected by previous 
    racist legislation but now acting as one nation. While colonial visions of 
    lions running through the streets being chased by people with spears are hopefully 
    being altered with the global environment, Africa is receiving a new fracturing 
    in being left behind in the technological ‘revolution’ that is structuring 
    the world with its servers, domains, (wireless) cabling and software. </p>
  <p>In this paper I intend to concentrate on the following questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the current African situation with regard to ICT’s?</li>
    <li>What are the positions of South African archives/museums-globally?</li>
    <li>What does the Centre for Popular Memory actually do?</li>
    <li>Looking in the digital crystal ball, what does the immediate 
      future hold?</li>
  </ul>
  <p class=listwithbullets><b>The Current Situation For Africa 
    </b></p>
  <p>In exploring my theme of Africa’s relation globally 
    with regard to digital representation, let 
    me start with mapping the current situation with regard to ICT. I will 
    be using South Africa as a case in point - as it is not only the country I 
    represent, but also one that, due to the racialised nature of its economy 
    and the legacy of Apartheid,  has a ‘dualistic economy and society that has 
    elements of both a developed and developing country’ (Adeya, Cogburn 2002).  
    Also, South Africa relies on its relationship with the world economy for about 
    50% of its GDP (Davies, 2004), and so isolating ourselves could only be implemented 
    at huge cost. We have also learned some valuable lessons with regard to S.A’s 
    position in the world economy. The country produces less than half a per cent 
    of the world’s GDP, and so it is the current government’s view that SA will 
    not be one of the “losers’ on the globalization scale. For government officials, 
    the key to being effective in international forums is creating partnerships 
    - such as NEPAD and wider South / South collaborations. This is coupled with 
    a number of other factors that make it an interesting case study. Some of 
    those factors include current government policy that involves large investment 
    in ICT. For instance, in 1999,  ICT expenditure in SA was at 7.2% ,  higher 
    than the world average of 6.6% and higher than high-profile countries like 
    Japan, Ireland, Denmark and Malaysia (Digital Planet, 2000).</p>
  <p>South Africa has a relatively sophisticated technology network. We have ISDN 
    (Integrated Services Digital Network), GSM, video conferencing and WAP.  Also,  
    according to Adeya and Cogburn, South Africa’s GSM Cellular network is the 
    ‘largest in the world outside of Europe and the percentages of digital switches 
    is higher in SA than in many industrialized 
    countries’ (p18).  Our computing infrastructure has increased dramatically 
    since 1992 when the number of installed PCs was just over five hundred thousand. 
    By 1999, over 3 million were in use. Of those, 65 % are networked, and SA 
    is ranked 17<sup>th</sup> in the world regarding Internet host computers. 
    According to netsizer.com the penetration of Internet in SA is 30 times that 
    of Egypt, its nearest competitor in Africa. There are over 75 Internet service 
    providers, 100 cities with local Points of Presence (POPs) and an estimated 
    on-line population of 650,000 dial-up subscribers. Considering the statistics 
    that suggest the on-line population for the whole of Africa is estimated at 
    3.4 million,  SA holds a considerable part of the pie.</p>
  <p>While these figures statistically 
    reflect very well on South Africa, they need to be understood in context of 
    the country and continent. The percentage of SA households with telephone 
    lines,  31%, sounds promising when compared to 19% in China or India, but 
    pales when compared with the USA at 92% or Denmark at 143%.  </p>
  <p>The most important feature that is missing is distribution amongst the population. 
    So while SA has a population of 43 million, previous regimes have skewed  
    distribution and access to training and technology within that population. 
    Prior to the 1990’s, only 13% of South Africans,  basically the white population 
    of South Africa, had access to many information and communication technologies 
    and skills.</p>
  <p>But since 1996, SA has drawn up rigorous e-commerce (Green Paper on e- Commerce) 
    and ICT policies.  Since the change to democratic leadership in 1994, key 
    government officials have tended to harness the potential of the digital economy 
    and information age.  In the words of the S.A Minister of Arts and Culture, 
  </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">We (SA) believe that the ‘next wave’ technologies can ultimately 
    create an impact in both developing and developed societies, which can promote 
    global appreciation of technology for constructive business exchange and economic 
    growth for all. (Ngubane, 2002)</p>
  <p>Leaving the statistics, I will briefly explain what it actually looks like 
    on the ground.  Remember that SA is geographically large in proportion to 
    its population.  One example we like touting is that the entire United Kingdom 
    can fit geographically into our national game reserve- the Kruger National 
    Park. Of course, in response, the Americans say the whole of South Africa 
    is roughly the size of Texas, so I guess it is relative!</p>
  <p>From the ground, SA’s major cities and even smaller towns are fairly well 
    connected virtually. You can easily access any number of Internet café’s in 
    the cities, and both land lines and cellular communication are stable and 
    comprehensive. If you walk along the streets in the urban centers, it seems 
    that everyone, from the newspaper seller at the street corner to the shop 
    owner, has a mobile phone, but the substantial use of cellular communication 
    is not necessarily a symbol of affluence. Cellular contracts and pre-paid 
    systems mean that for about R 60 (about 8 dollars) a month, a person can afford 
    to own a mobile phone. It is seen to be a very worthwhile acquisition as often 
    many family members occupy a small house, frequently having only one room. 
    Within the townships, a mobile phone offers the opportunity of, on the one 
    hand being available directly 24 hours a day, and on the other affording the 
    status of upward mobility. </p>
  <p>While up until the 1990’s, schools were racially divided, this is no longer 
    so, and scholars (in the urban centers) now all have access to computer training 
    and Internet facilities at their schools. Of course, there is still a huge 
    backlog with regard to the generations preceding the current group of learners, 
    but the government has employed a number of strategiess to try to  rectify 
    the problem. </p>
  <p>It seems then that while the infrastructure has been ‘folded out,’ the largest 
    challenge is actually in the form of human capabilities.  SA shows a severe 
    shortage  of people with the necessary skills to harness the ICT industry.  
    According to Statistics SA, this is exacerbated by widespread emigration of 
    skilled South Africans: 77% of emigrants have tertiary education.</p>
  <p>While access to personal computers is still low in the township areas (and 
    obviously the rural areas of SA), government operators such as Telkom and 
    the Post office are placing public Internet terminals in places where communities 
    gather.  This, coupled with telecentres, comes close to addressing SA’s universal 
    access goals (Adeya, Cogburn:2002). According to the Department of Communications, 
    90% of SA households are within 30 minutes’ walk of a telephone or telecentre.</p>
  <p>From this macro overview I want to look now at how that relates to the world 
    of museums and archives in this country.</p>
  <h1>South African Archives And Museums’ Global Positions</h1>
  <p>In the 1970’s, provincial and government-run museums became very popular 
    in South Africa, and almost every national, provincial and local government 
    department or enterprise had a museum section. Of course, these structures 
    were very oriented toward a white South African audience. Thus representation 
    and subject matter were very skewed. This legacy has left a large representation 
    of public and private museums and galleries throughout the country, although 
    often these museums represent an exclusionary past as opposed to a public 
    intervention or access space. It is not in the scope of this paper to explore 
    them systematically, but I would like to highlight a few factors.  Most, if 
    not all, museums and archives have relatively small and complex budgets; on 
    a government level, funding has been slashed over the last few years, with 
    the cultural budget taking a large knock. </p>
  <p>But at the same time, there is often understanding of the importance of international 
    collaboration and trade. One example is the Cape Town International Convention 
    Centre (CTICC) that is aimed at encouraging international conferencing and 
    cultural interaction. In line with this understanding of the importance of 
    international tourism, there is a growing representation of international 
    brand hotels such as the Sheraton and Hyatt, and more urban hotels are providing 
    digital communication centers and Internet ports in hotel rooms in line with 
    the growing need to be globally connected. </p>
  <p>More important, most government institutions, cultural and otherwise, are 
    available on the Web and have digital connectivity amongst user groups/ education 
    forums and listserves. But the level of Web presence is what is interesting. 
    As the majority of museum sites are done using basic, servers tend to be slow 
    and images cumbersome. Search facilities within these sites are also not comprehensive 
    nor user friendly; thus the access the site provides only acts as a type of 
    ‘on-line brochure’ rather than harnessing the World Wide Web’s capacities. 
    This leads me into my third area: What does the centre for popular memory 
    actually do?</p>
  <h1>The Centre for Popular Memory</h1>
  <p>Based at the University of Cape Town, the C.P.M is essentially a public service 
    archive and resource center. It has four main areas of work: research, training, 
    archiving and dissemination: dissemination is at the core. These streams are 
    all inter-related. For instance, in 2002, we trained students who were selected 
    from an associated postgraduate course: the Post Graduate Diploma in Museum 
    and Heritage Studies. Over a nine-month period we taught the three interns 
    skills around oral history interviewing, transcription, archiving, and exhibition 
    design. During the internship they chose a theme for their practical interviews 
    and recordings.  They each chose to conduct 20 interviews with long-term residents 
    of Langa, concentrating on the residents’ memories and stories of shebeens 
    and the alcohol trade between 1930-1980.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Black people weren’t allowed to have shebeens.  They were 
    raided, arrested and paid fines. They couldn’t even enter bottlestores or 
    stand near a bottlestore. They weren’t allowed to deal in liquor or buy liquor.  
    It is only in the 1960’s that black people were allowed to enter bottlestores<i>.</i><i> </i></p>
  <p class=BlockQuoteAuthor>Ms PM (Audio 1: Ms PM WAV. File)</p>
  <p>Until 1962, black people in South Africa were not allowed to consume or buy 
    alcohol, or even make traditional beer (umqomboti) without a permit. Yet people 
    drank and smuggled alcohol into the townships, and the shebeens (which were 
    often no more than a chair at a kitchen table) became places of recreation 
    and resistance.  One of the points that was often raised in interviews was 
    that most shebeens were run by women: </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Yes, they managed to survive, I am telling you…  the shebeens 
    had to survive.  One wouldn’t have liked to be a shebeen queen, but though 
    one thing, you will find…Here is the lady, she has got about 4 children that 
    are at school, what must she do?   So, to survive you know, she had to sort 
    of do it illegally [sell liquor] so that she can make ends meet. </p>
  <p class=BlockQuoteAuthor>Mr M. (Audio 2: Mr M WAV file)</p>
  <p>What is significant (for this paper) is that the information that came out 
    of the research, as often happens, is very different from any written textual 
    accounts of the era described. So the research provided an alternate view 
    of how the history of that time was presented. While this paper does not explore 
    these complexities, it serves to highlight that stories provide invaluable 
    material regarding what people remember and forget about living in that country. 
    What were/are conditions like? What were the experiences and memories of that 
    time? How do they relate to other people’s experiences? and so on.</p>
  <p>We completed the process with close to 60 interviews conducted in English 
    and Xhosa with residents of Langa.  These recordings are all transcribed and 
    translated and the images, artefacts and interviews are archived. Our concern 
    is that the research not just sit in our archives and get indexed into our 
    digital repository. If we are to have a social purpose, the stories that we 
    record need to go out into the world.</p>
  <p>For this collection, we decided to create <i>Umqomboti, Utywala and lucky

  <p>The idea behind having a movable exhibition was that it could alter with 
    space available and conditions, but most important, the research would go 
    beyond the archival stacks. For more information regarding the exhibition

  <h4>Living Archives</h4>
  <p>Derrida in his book <i>Archive Fever</i> (1995) demonstrates that the archival 
    trace implies both process (its power) and place.  In postmodern terms this 
    control of  process and place is partially what archiving entails. Another 
    issue that Freud and Iriguray draw on is the instinct to forgetfulness. In 
    Freudian terms the notion of forgetfulness cannot be separated from processes 
    of memorialisation. So, then, the archive has a lot to do with knowledge and 
    power, and is about remembering and forgetting at the same time.  To expand 
    the notion, Harris notes,  </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">The archive seems to draw us forward as we look to the past…the 
    idea is not to concretise memory and create fact…but to acknowledge that fact 
    is contextual and disturbed by what is left or forgotten or gathered and not 
    gathered. (Harris: 2000).</p>
  <p>The archive cannot be viewed as a neutral space where records (or archival 
    traces) are stored. In Post-modern terms the archive is a construction, and 
    archivists are responsible players in this construction. The relevance this 
    has is that theory informs practice.  The recording has a life of its own; 
    it not only is given meaning through the process of archiving, but also can 
    gain meaning through historical/sociological and ideological debates and contexts.</p>
  <p>This acceptance of the subjectivity and active participation of the archivist 
    and archive in the process of production further suggests that we need to 
    play active roles in getting the stories we have in our archive into the communities 
    we serve.  For us at the CPM, that doesn’t mean just making the archive accessible 
    through an effective catalogue system, digital database on the Web or simply 
    an open door. It means finding ways to step out of our doors.</p>
  <p>To do that, we must confront intellectual property issues, copyright issues, 
    and legal issues. The line we take is quite simple. Our <b>first </b>step 
    is establishing and not breaking trust with interviewees, so that they feel 
    comfortable and protected. The <b>second</b> is ensuring that their wishes 
    are legally ratified, through our copyright release form. <b>Third,</b> even 
    if we have copyright on the material, we have an ethical  responsibility to 
    use it in a sensitive, contextual and reverent manner.</p>
  <p>Much effort goes into the recordings and correct archival procedure, but 
    that is not enough. Expanding audiences and negotiating difficulties also 
    lie at the heart of a useful A/V Archive. I know that in South Africa, and 
    I don’t believe it’s confined to there, archives are not seen as being the 
    most inviting places: they are often frequented only by tenacious researchers 
    and students trying to complete last-minute assignments.  But we need to change 
    the notions of both what the archive or museum does and what it holds. After 
    all, we hold people’s stories, and surely those stories belong beyond our 
    temperature-controlled vaults.</p>
  <p>To do that we need legal copyright forms and understanding from interviewees 
    as to what we are doing with their recordings. Also, due to the nature of 
    A/V archiving, we need to follow <b>migration/preservation strategies</b>.  
    In our case, many of our older recordings are on analogue cassettes; we digitise 
    them to 96/24 data, which are stored as multiple copies across multiple media 
    in different locations. We also enter all the recording metadata information 
    into a digital repository and hold electronic copies of all sound clips, transcriptions 
    and translations. </p>
  <p>But while the bits and bites of our technical jargon are essential to us, 
    we need to remember what we are working with. While we can get immersed in 
    building cyber architecture and discussing which cartridge stylus provides 
    the most accurate rotation (or is it revolution?), we also need to keep in 
    mind that those digital 1 and 0’s and the subsequent metadata hold the voice 
    of a person. We all understand the importance of our senses, being able to 
    speak, be heard and be seen.  In the same way the archive needs to work more 
    cohesively by not only providing text transcripts, but also allowing users 
    to listen to the sounds, read the quotes, connect the pictures and, through 
    this layered process, make interpretations.</p>
  <p>One of the uses of having a digital version of an analogue or physical trace 
    is that it means access is increased while the original is protected.  As 
    such, digital technology suggests a desire to communicate - to create ways 
    of using, sharing and accessing information. It provides the platform to start 
    exploring those desires. While all that is international practice, what differs 
    is the relation to signs and signifiers that are the Internet. There is still 
    a vast portion of South Africans who are not computer literate, and there 
    is a further issue that while English is one of South Africa’s 11 official 
    languages, it is not the first language of the majority of the population.</p>
  <p>We believe that even if a group constitutes only an almost invisible fragment 
    of the world population, there should be at least access for them to first 
    language narratives and transcripts on-line. </p>

  <h4>Virtual Archives</h4>
  <p>We are developing a partnership with a project that is working in Brazil, 
    Namibia and South Africa. A <i>virtual archive</i> is being developed, available 
    through our center,  navigated using gaming technology. So language is not 
    isolating but unifying for people who are not used to Internet/ archive navigation 
    techniques.</p>
  <h4>The Threat of Cultural Imperialism</h4>
  <p>There is a growing concern regarding the use of African content in worldwide 
    forums. The most radical or conservative of them is  ‘cultural imperialism’ 
    (Henriot, 1998) driving new technologies and the ‘McWorld’ of MacDonalds, 
    Macintosh and MTV. There is a view that Africa is being recolonised in the 
    virtual environment, as international technology partners are looking to provide 
    technical expertise for the “globalizing” of African content. African partners 
    for the most part do not control the servers/ programmes or technology that 
    houses their content.</p>
  <p>There are further concerns over Intellectual Property and community property 
    of African songs, narratives and content management. This is something that 
    lies both within the continent and without. There are partners that have funding 
    and others that do not. What has happened in the past is that funded (African) 
    partners  go into rural areas to record traditional narratives, but never 
    return those rights to the community. This is not confined to visual culture, 
    as Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) are being recorded or networked and 
    then patented outside of the community that traditionally used them. To use 
    an example, the Khoi San people have a mixture of roots they use to suppress 
    hunger while they are hunting (since they hunt with a poisoned arrow in the 
    desert, they can track spoor for days before even seeing a buck). This combination 
    is now being packaged and traded to the international slimming market, which 
    as you know is huge! There is currently an investigation into this product, 
    and until the rights and IKS issues have been secured, it has been withdrawn 
    from the market.  I think this is one of the largest fears within the traditional 
    groupings around the world: that technologically advanced and moneyed groups, 
    however altruistic their original aims, will hold the rights to another community’s 
    content.</p>
  <p>Just for the record, I along with many other forward- minded people see the 
    possibility and accept the responsibility of international partnerships and 
    digital representation. I would rather be forging paths through the I.P haze 
    of the digital domain than closing the stories in our archive out of fear.  
    Take a look at our partnership with Matrix at MSU in the next and final section.</p>
  <h1>The Digital Crystal Ball - The Immediate Future</h1>
  <p>Conway (1997) suggests, “the biggest challenge may not be embracing digital 
    technology, but rather building a common language to describe the transformations 
    that […] take place”. One way to protect traces in the digital domain is using 
    metadata, as that is the way our new digital trace is recognizable over time. 
    For us it includes different sectors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Descriptive metadata - referring to the trace and the 
      description thereof – title, collection, interviewee, interviewer, date of 
      interview, location etc</li>
    <li>Technical metadata - referring to the digitisation process 
      and its description - i.e. file format, bit rate depth, size, duration, compression</li>
    <li>Structural metadata - how to reassemble the trace-</li>
    <li>Source information - 
      audio analogue cassette, photograph, and physical description</li>
    <li>Rights and restrictions  - copyright holder, copyrights, 
      distribution restrictions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For us, metadata is about creating a common Underground for the accessing 
    and migrating of digital information. It is imperative that the entered data 
    fulfil a number of functions. For one thing, it must be compliant with terms 
    discussed through initiatives such as the Dublin Core, METS and ILAC. </p>
  <p>Metadata repositories can be created anywhere in the world and ported through 
    FTP (file transfer protocol) - so you can enter information at one station 
    and have it  immediately available to anyone who has access to that repository.  
    In our case, we are looking to have the software on a local drive. In that 
    way we can provide localised searches, both from within our resource centre 
    and globally through our server and the space we occupy on our partners’ servers 
    in Michigan.</p>

  <p class="caption">Figure 4b. ‘Repos’ defined</p>
  <p>By September this year, ‘repos.’ (as our American partners like to call it), 
    which is currently serving as a metadata back end, will be on-line and user 
    friendly. The aim is that through the interface, users can access CPM holdings 
    on-line. We are including all copyrighted material we have; they will be able 
    to do detailed searches that will bring them to a page with all relevant information: 
    sound clips in the original language, text transcript in pdf, translations, 
    related images and background information. This will all be immediately downloadable 
    and comprehensive.</p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p> Africa is a continent both near to and far from technological stability. 
    Through well-constituted partnerships and intelligent and proactive methods 
    extending from the continent, there are ways for technology to be harnessed 
    for our purposes, not the other way around. At the Centre for Popular Memory, 
    our primary aim is the dissemination of people’s stories under conditions 
    that are stable and founded on integrity. For us there are global ways to 
    do this. And there are also ways for us as archivists, technicians and cultural 
    activists to walk outside our doors and engage with the communities we serve 
    in multiple ways.  </p>
