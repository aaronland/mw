      <p class="PaperTitle">Influences of Concepts and Structure of Documentary 
        Cinema on Documentary Practices in the Internet</p>
      <p class="Author">Melahat Hosseini and Ron Wakkary, School of Interactive 
        Arts and Technology, Simon Fraser University, Canada</p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
       <p class="AbstractText">This paper investigates the emergence of documentary 
          practices on the Internet. It is potentially beneficial to researchers 
          and practitioners in the emerging area of documentary Web work, and 
          for museums or cultural institutions who utilize Web sites for exhibition 
          programming and thematic presentations. The goal of the paper is to 
          develop a methodological framework for analyzing Web documentaries based 
          on current film theory, since to date, documentary practice has been 
          rooted in filmmaking. A secondary goal is to describe the current state 
          of Web documentaries as well as potential benefits and hurdles in its 
          future development. A review of potentially relevant film theories assists 
          in building a framework for analyzing documentary practices on the Internet. 
          The framework proposed is based on Bill Nichol's theory of documentary 
          film. The study includes analysis of five documentary Web sites ranging 
          from independently to institutionally produced sites. Our aim is to 
          contribute to further investigations of the relationship between documentary 
        cinema and documentary practices on the Internet.</p>

      <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
      <p class="normal">Defined by film theorists, documentary cinema is a genre 
          of representing the historical world. In this genre, information in 
          the form of images, sequences, sound, and speech are drawn from different 
          places and linked to each other in order to express an argument or to 
          reflect a certain perspective. The Internet can be a perfect medium 
          for developing documentary practice due to its capacity to store and 
          convey a vast amount of information and to hyperlink the information. 
      </p>
      <p class="normal">In this study we tried to create a framework to help 
          us define documentary practices on the Internet. To do so, we looked 
          at film theory as a starting model for our framework. The theory proposes 
          key dimensions for analysis of film documentaries. These include subject, 
          perspective, the role of speech, evidentiary editing, and voice. We 
          modified the framework for our analysis to align it better with documentary 
          practices on the Internet. While dimensions such as voice and perspective 
          maintain their importance, we re-interpreted some of Nichol's 
          terms to address Web-based issues such as information design, design 
          logic, and interaction design. We also held the assumption that the 
          strong language and tradition of documentary film may have influenced 
          those who have chosen the new media for this practice. We wanted as 
          well to define and explore these influences in order to utilize them 
          in our own practice. We tried and tested our framework by analyzing 
          five documentary Web sites. The results of this analysis provided us 
          with information about the influence of concepts of documentary cinema 
          on Web-documentaries; a clearer picture of the structure of the Web-documentaries 
        on the Internet; and the limitations of our framework.</p>
      <h1>2. Overview</h1>
      <p class="normal">This study draws on theories of film and new media in 
          order to develop an analysis framework for documentary practices on 
        the Web. These include the writings of Bill Nichols and Lev Manovich.</p>
      <p class="normal">The film theorist Bill Nichols proposes a framework 
          for documentary film that analyzes film from four different perspectives: 
        <b>institutions</b>, <b>practitioners</b>, <b>texts</b> (films and video) 
          and <b>audience</b> (Nichols, 1991, p.22). In Nichols' view, the 
          practitioners of documentary film shape and change our understanding 
          of the concept of documentary. Through dialogue among themselves and 
        "engagement with institutes, critics, subjects, and audience" 
        the borders of documentary are defined and re-defined (Nichols, 1991, 
        p26). Nevertheless, Nichols looks back to the traditions and repeated 
        patterns in documentary films for its definition. He argues that most 
        documentary films are engaged with representing the historical world 
        and are constructed by "an informing logic" that "supports 
          an underlying argument, assertion or claim about the historical world." 
        Therefore a documentary film is more concerned about relating its content 
        according to historical linkages than creating a sense of credibility 
        and continuity of time and space through continuity editing. Compared 
        to fiction film, in documentary film we may see more disparate shots 
        which are organized not by the "narrative organized around a central 
          character" but by the" rhetoric organized around a controlling 
          logic or argument". Nichols suggests that instead of continuity 
          editing we may call this prevalent form of editing in documentary films: 
        "evidentiary editing" (Nichols, 1991, p. 26-35).</p>
      <p class="normal">Finally, the expectations and assumptions of the audience 
          define a documentary film. The audience share several expectations 
          and assumptions about the genre. Among them are expectations of an indexical 
          relationship between what they see in the film and reality in the historical 
          world, an engagement with the historical world, and finally the offering 
          of a perspective, knowledge or insight about the historical world (Nichols, 
          1991,p. 35-41). Nichols suggests that documentary film has absorbed 
          the traditions of "cinema of attractions", narrative cinema 
          and avant-garde cinema, in <i>showing</i>,<i>telling</i>, and <i>poetic 
          forms</i>, and created a voice distinctive in itself (Nichols, 1991, 
        p. 94).</p>
      <p class="normal">Nichols describes voice in the context of documentary 
          cinema as "how the logic, argument, or viewpoint of a film is 
          conveyed to us."(1991, p. 26) He suggests that the filmmaker 
          uses all the means at his disposal to speak his point of view. In cinema 
          these means vary and range from decisions about capturing the shots, 
          their content and visual appearance to decisions about sounds, music, 
          speech, and voice-over. Decisions about editing and the nature of the 
          documents with respect to the arrangement of events and the use of outside 
          footage and documents are made during the process of filmmaking; and 
          finally the mode of representation of the documentary (expository, poetic, 
          observational, participatory, reflexive or performative) is established 
        (Nichols 1991, p.42-60) .</p>
      <p class="normal">New media theorist Lev Manovich points to the dominance 
          of database over narrative in the structure of new media artifacts. 
          He draws our attention to a shift in the nature of these works from 
          that of previous media; In most new media artifacts, a database of items 
          and elements is tangibly present while the narrative which is usually 
          formed by linking and associating these elements in a particular way 
          is implicit. In Manovich's words, the database is "material" 
        while' the narrative "which is the trajectory leading from 
          one element to another" is "virtual". (2001, 
          p. 229-232 ) In fact, in many new media works such as Web sites and 
          CD-ROMs, a large proportion of the body of the work is made of a database. 
          These databases can be comprised of various items in the form of texts, 
          movies, and images. The audience can "perform various operations 
          on the database: view, navigate, and search" through an interface 
          (Manovich, 2001, p 219). Manovich argues this quality in new media works 
        is in contrast with that of film.( 2001, Chapter 1 and 5)</p>
      <p class="normal">In the process of making the film, a larger database 
          of images, texts and sequences is narrowed down to a smaller which can 
          serve the narrative. The viewers of the film can explicitly see the 
          narrative trajectory of the film. But they cannot reach beyond the 
          film information and access the footage. In other words, they cannot 
          reach into the database. Rather, they are limited to what has been presented 
          by the filmmaker. On the other hand Manovich explains that the <i>modularity</i> 
        and <i>variability</i> of new media objects allow them to be subject 
          to changes in content and provide <i>random access</i> to the audience 
          (Manovich, 2001, chapter 1), in contrast to film where the sequence 
          and content of the material is fixed and solidified at the end of the 
        process of editing.</p>
      <h1>3. Creating a Framework</h1>
      <p class="normal">In creating a framework we have drawn heavily on Nichols' 
        theory of documentary films and the expectations of the audience of 
        documentary practices. We have considered four criteria for analyzing 
        documentary practices on the internet: <b>subject</b>, <b>perspective 
          and informing logic</b>, <b>role of speech,</b> and <b>design</b>. In 
          analyzing the Websites according to this framework, we draw on Nichols' 
        definition of voice and translate it to design, and view voice in Web 
        documentaries as elements and modes of site architecture, visual design 
        and interaction.</p>
      <h2>3.1 Subject</h2>
      <p class="normal">The subject of the documentary cinema is the historical 
          world. Engagement with the reality of the historical world and the real 
          people who live in it is the main element that distinguishes documentary 
          cinema from fiction. While representing the historical world has been 
          a tradition in documentary films, audiences also expect to see the historical 
          world behind the lens of the camera; they seek an indexical relationship 
          between what they see and what has been happening in front of the camera. 
          What we mean by <i>indexical relationship</i> between the image and 
          historical world is an authentic relationship between the outside reality 
        and its recorded form on media such as film, photograph or tapes. </p>
      <h2>3.2 Informing Logic/perspective</h2>
      <p class="normal">Most theorists of documentary cinema refer to John Grierson's 
          famous definition of documentary as "a creative treatment of actuality" (Nichols, 
          1991, p. 24). Nichols says, "we usually understand and acknowledge 
          that a documentary is a creative treatment of actuality not a faithful 
          transcription of it" (Nichols, 1991, p. 38). A tradition in documentary 
          film is to organize its information around a logic, poetics, or rhetoric 
          which supports a "perspective, claim or argument" about 
          the historical world. On the other hand, the audience of documentary 
          film expect the film to give "information, knowledge, insight 
          and awareness" about the reality of the historical world (Nichols, 
        1991, p. 40).</p>
      <h2>3. 3 The role of speech</h2>
      <p class="normal">Speech in documentary is often used as a narrator voice 
          that suggests an interpretation of the events shown, or a re-interpretation 
          of the speech of the film's subjects. Other forms of speech in 
          documentaries include the direct speech of the protagonists or interviewees. 
          Of course, not all documentary films contain or incorporate speech, 
        but those that do, use speech to convey their arguments. </p>
      <h2>3. 4 Design</h2>
      <p class="normal">The style of editing in documentary films follows an 
          informing logic and is more engaged with providing historical links 
          between events and images or, in Nichols' words, it rather follows 
          an "evidentiary editing" than continuity editing (Nichols, 
          1991,p.30). In this type of editing, the editor and filmmaker are not 
          concerned with organizing the shots in a way that give an impression 
          of continuity of time and place; rather, they organize them in order 
          to "present the impression of a single, convincing argument supported 
        by a logic" (Nichols, 1991, p.30).</p>
      <h2>3.5 Voice</h2>
      <p class="normal">The voice of the documentary manifests the engagement 
          of the filmmaker with the world around him and reflects his social, 
          ethical or political stance. Nichols suggests that the documentary 
          may address us in two ways: voice of commentary and voice of perspective 
          (Nichols, 1991, chapter 3). In the first form, the audience is addressed 
          directly and the film expresses its perspective explicitly. In the second 
          form, the film's claim is conveyed to us implicitly, and the logic or 
          rhetoric works on us in subtle layers. In this case, we try to infer 
        the filmmaker's perspective.</p>
      <h1>4. Sample Web Sites</h1>
      <p class="normal">Using the definitions above as a framework, five Web 
          sites were chosen and analyzed. In order to adapt the criterion of <i>structure</i> 
        to hypermedia works, we interpreted structure as the <i>design logic</i> 
        of the sites and their story line(s). Within design logic, different 
        aspects of design, such as interaction design, treatment of space and 
        images, and information design, were briefly analyzed. As far as we 
        could determine, the five sites have documentary practice as their main 
        goal. All are engaged with the historical world, and all look at certain 
        events from their own perspective. Some of these sites were supported 
        by an editorial group, like Cultures on the Edge (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com</a>), 
          while some were built by individuals, like Korean War Project (<a href="http://www.koreanwar.org/index1.html" target="_blank">http://www.koreanwar.org/index1.html</a>) 
        As with Cultures on the Edge, some provided a wide range of documentaries 
        focused on a single theme, while others, like No Back Roads (<a href="http://www.nobackroads.com/" target="_blank">http://www.nobackroads.com</a>) 
          and Kingdom of Kensington (<a href="http://www.torontonians.com/" target="_blank">http://www.torontonians.com</a>), 
          were single documentaries. Also, some documentaries, such as Woodward 
          Squat (<a href="http://www.inter-mission.org/woodwards" target="_blank">http://www.inter-mission.org/woodwards</a>), 
          were presented as Internet&#8211;based art projects, along with other 
          on-line art projects. A few of the sites, such as Korean War project, 
          also had a large database of documents and material, all related to 
          the documentary topic. This database was expanding by accepting contributions 
        from the visitors. </p>
      <h1>5. Analysis</h1>
      <p class="normal">For this paper, we focused on the analysis of the Web 
          site Cultures on the Edge. It is highly representative of the key arguments 
          in this paper. The analysis follows the structure of the framework outlined 
        above.</p>
      <h2>5. 1 Analysis of the documentary magazine <i>Cultures on the Edge</i></h2>
      <h3>5.1.1 Subject</h3>
      <p class="normal">The subject of Cultures on the edge (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com</a>) 
          is the cultures on the planet that are being diminished for geographical, 
        political or economical reasons. </p>
      <h3>5.1.2 Role of Speech</h3>
      <p class="normal">Speech is present throughout the site and inside the 
          documentaries in various forms: speech that addresses the audience of 
          the site and explains the site and its mission; speech that comprises 
          the body of the travelogues and articles; and speech that accompanies 
        the photographs and is found within digital movies. </p>
      <p class="normal">In most travelogues, the speech is first person in diary 
          form describing the personal journey of the travelers. The speech comments 
          on places, people and events. The travelogues may also contain short 
          conversations with locals. In captions, the speech comes in different 
          forms from commentary to poetic. In one instance, Steve McCurry's 
          essay on South and South-ast Asia, the main speech is in the form of 
          an interview with the photographer: it is presented in question and 
          answer format through short movie clips. Overall, the text of the speech 
          provides the audience with information about life within the indigenous 
          cultures, the values and lifestyles of the people, and their struggles 
        when they come in contact with larger and more technological cultures.</p>
      <h3>5.1.3 Informing logic and design</h3>
      <p class="normal">The informing logic of the site follows its mission 
          as explained by its editors: providing a space where the voice of diminishing 
          cultures can be heard and more global awareness about the concepts of 
        cultures and diversity may be attained.</p>
      <p class="normal">The site achieves this goal by providing in the two 
          main sections<i>: Gallery</i> and <i>Learn</i>, a collection of travelogues, 
          photo-essays, articles and interviews about diminishing cultures. We 
          are provided with ongoing information about cultural events in a <i>News 
          and Events</i> section. A discussion space about the cultural issues 
          throughout the world appears in the section <i>Forums</i>. The site 
          introduces its contributors and editors and its mission under a separate 
          section, <i>About</i>. The editors express openness and a desire for 
        direct contact with thes audience by encouraging their support and contributions.</p>
      <p class="normal">The sequence of the links on the homepage and the configuration 
          of the design elements on the homepage indicate that the <i>Gallery</i> 
        section as the most important section of the site. The documents found 
        within this section seem to be highlighted and given significant focus.(See 
        fig1).</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="hosseini.wakkary.fig1.jpg" alt="Cultures on the Edge" width="400" height="286"></p>
      <p class="caption">Figure 1. Home Page of Culture's on the Edge, (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com</a>)</p>
      <p class="normal">The gallery contains two major exhibitions: Pablo Vega's 
          travelogue on the Andes (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/exhibits/pablo_corral/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/exhibits/pablo_corral/index.html</a>) 
          and Steve McCurry's photo-essay on South and South-east Asia (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/exhibits/steve_mccurry/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/exhibits/ 
        steve_mccurry/index.html</a>). </p>
      <p class="normal">Each of these exhibitions opens in a separate window 
          on top of the main <i>Gallery</i> window and introduces a region by 
          presenting the documents contributed by selected photographers. These 
          exhibitions introduce the photographers and make their visions and ideas 
          available to the audience by presenting biographies, personal Web sites 
        and video interviews of them.</p>
      <p class="normal"><span class="SubHeader">Pablo Vega's travelogue 
          </span>(<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/exhibits/pablo_corral/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/exhibits/pablo_corral/index.html</a>) 
          uses a range of formats for presentation. This multimedia piece is comprised 
          of Vega's diary-form travelogue in text as the main axis, with 
          an interactive map and images of the area. The multimedia are accompanied 
          by streaming music of the Andes region. Vega's text is divided 
          into chapters and is laid side by side with an interactive map of South 
          America along the Andes. The documentary invites the audience to become 
          engaged in interacting with the map and therefore identify with Vega's 
          travel along the Andes. Vega's intimate text provides insight 
          and information about the social, political and geographical features 
        of each place he has visited. </p>
      <p class="normal">The documentary provides a visual view of the Andes 
          through four or five embedded photographs of the region. The images 
          do not exactly illustrate Vega's text; rather they provide an 
          additional view of the topic. They pique the audience's curiosity 
          and invite them to go back and forth between the images and Vega's 
          text in order to interpret them accordingly. The audience also has the 
          option to zoom in on the images by clicking on them. This opens a window 
        with a larger version of the image accompanied by Vega's poetic 
        caption.</p>
      <p class="normal">The <i>Learn</i> section, which appears to be only second 
          in importance to the <i>Gallery</i> section, contains more travelogues 
          and some articles on different cultural issues. The site categorizes 
          documentaries in this section according to the intensity and urgency 
          of the issues they represent. Those documentaries which reflect more 
          pressing human issues are categorized in a section named <i>hot topic</i> 
        and come first in the order of links in the <i>Learn</i> section. Most 
          travelogues and articles here are in a similar format and are spread 
          in two windows. The main part of each article or travelogue is comprised 
          of text. The few images that are embedded within the text act as gateways 
          to a parallel representation that opens in a small colorful window on 
          top of the main window. This new window provides an interactive slideshow 
          or photo-essay that closely or indirectly relates to the travelogue 
        or article. (See fig2).</p>

      <p class="normal">The slide shows and photo-essays allow the audience 
          to view the content in any given order, as is found in <b>Preserving 
          Bhutan</b> (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/learn/articles/of_promise_and_protection/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com/learn/articles/ of_promise_and_protection/index.html</a>)and <b>Hell is close for Yanomami

          The audience may also follow a sequential journey like that in <b>A 
        People Without a Country</b> (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/learn/hot_topics/spring_2001/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com/learn/hot_topics/spring_2001/index.html</a>).</p>

      <p class="normal">In this photo-essay, the photographs have been categorized 
          and divided according to the refugee camps of the Karen People which 
          the photographer visited in Thailand. The camps are numbered by the 
          order he visited them. Once the audience enters the section belonging 
          to each camp, they can see images of the people who live in that camp. 
          The photographer's caption tells a short narrative about the life 
        of each of the people who are shown in the images.</p>
      <p class="normal">Each photo-essay engages the audience with the culture 
          it represents, but in a different way. In Preserving Bhutan (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/learn/articles/of_promise_and_protection/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com/learn/articles 
          /of_promise_and_protection /index.html</a>) (fig2), the photographer 
          chose a small Bhutanese girl named Dechen as her subject and companion. 
          She explains the culture, people and struggles of the area by traveling 
          along with Dechen and engaging the audience through her life, surroundings 
          and future. The photo-essay provides the audience with a selection of 
          images which can be chosen randomly. After clicking on each image, the 
          viewers can see a larger view of that image along with a caption which 
        describes the image in context of Dechen's life.</p>
      <p class="normal">The images within the photo-essays and slide-shows throughout 
          the site open a window to the landscapes, life-styles, personalities 
          and visual culture of each region. They allow the audience to explore 
          patterns and colors of fabrics and objects, the design of the tools 
          and clothes, and the architecture of the places people dwell. Angela 
          Fisher and Carol Beckwith's photographs of Africa (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/archives/ceremonies/photos/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/archives/ceremonies/photos/index.html</a>) 
          focus on different ceremonies in different parts of Africa. Peter Magubane's 
          photographs (<a
href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/archives/peter_magubane/index.html">http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/archives/peter_magubane/index.html</a>) 
          of the Ndebele, Ntwana, Xhosa and Zulu tribes of South Africa try to 
          capture the cultural identity and the meaningful costumes of these vanishing 
          tribes. And Stephen Ferry's photojournal of Potosi region (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/archives/potosi/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/archives/potosi/index.html</a>) 
          takes the audience to the streets, outskirts, houses and mines of the 
          Potosi region during a period of 18 days, between August 19 and September 
        8, 1998. </p>
      <h3>5.1.4 Voice in &#8216;cultures on the edge' </h3>
      <p class="normal">The "voice" of the on-line documentary site 
          can be heard through the range of material it includes, the range of 
          the voices it reflects, and the visual style of the overall site that 
        extends within the contributed documentaries as well.</p>
      <p class="normal">The site is designed as an international showcase or 
          study center on diminishing cultures. It presents documentaries from 
          all over the world and accepts contributions from both developed and 
          under-developed countries. Each of the documentaries looks with a different 
          eye at the issue of indigenous cultures and their ways. Some like Pablo 
          Vega's travelogue on the Andes, (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/exhibits/pablo_corral/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/exhibits/ 
          pablo_corral/ index.html</a>) and Stephen Ferry's photo-journal 
          on Potosi region (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/archives/potosi/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/archives/potosi/index.html</a>), 
          invite the audience into the geographic location and culture of the 
          region the photographers belong to and offer an intimate experience 
          and view of an insider. Some other documentaries like Preserving Bhutan(<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/learn/articles/of_promise_and_protection/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com/learn/articles 
          /of_promise_and_protection /index.html</a>) attempt to create the same 
          experience of intimacy and arouse the audience's concern about 
          a culture by drawing viewers close to one of the people of a certain 
          culture and building a friendship with that individual. Phil Borges 
          photo-essay on Kenya and Ethiopia (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/archives/phil_borges/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/archives/phil_borges/index.html</a>) 
          looks at diminishing cultures from a larger scale; he stages the indigenous 
          people in surrealistic compositions in order to create a romantic, mythic 
        vision of the diminishing tribes of the world.</p>
      <p class="normal">The intimate insider look does not prevail in all of 
          the documentaries in Cultures on the edge. Some documentaries back the 
          audience off and look at the indigenous cultures from a distance, focusing 
          more on recording anthropological facts or visual exotic delights. For 
          example, Steve McCurry's photo-essays on South and South-east 
          Asia (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/exhibits/steve_mccurry/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery 
          /exhibits/steve_mccurry/index.html</a>) provide a pleasurable showcase 
          of exotic colors and patterns seen in the region without much record 
          of the cultural, economic ,political and religious tensions in that 
          area. Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher's photo-essay on Africa 
          (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/archives/ceremonies/photos/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/archives/ ceremonies/photos/index.html</a>) 
          present the audience with anthropological views of rites and rituals 
          of people of different part of Africa through colorful and attractive 
          compositions, and Peter Magubane's photographs (<a href="http://www.culturesontheedge.com/gallery/archives/peter_magubane/index.html" target="_blank">http://www. 
          culturesontheedge.com/gallery/ archives/peter_magubane/index.html</a>) 
          record the cultural identity of vanishing tribes of Africa by capturing 
        their costumes.</p>
      <p class="normal">If we infer the voice of the site from the information 
          design and the name attributed to its spaces, we should say the site 
          tends to <i>exhibit</i> facts and visions about the indigenous cultures 
          and <i>teach</i> the audience about the life of the people in indigenous 
          cultures, their issues and struggles. Using the concept of gallery 
          and exhibition space for organizing and housing facts and images about 
          the indigenous cultures; and treating them as objects to look at, or 
          preserve, may be somewhat contradictory to the mission of the site: 
          to provide a non-hierarchical outlook into the life of indigenous cultures. 
          Yet the contributions in the site are mainly by people who have traveled 
          into indigenous cultures; and it seems the concept of taking the audience 
          on similar travels prevails in designing the structure of the site. 
        Most documentaries, and especially photo-essays, open in new windows 
        on top of the main browser window of the site and allow the audience 
        to go back and forth between the text within the main browser and the 
        images and content within the window. Interactive maps create the feeling 
        of traveling along with the author; and most photo-essays deliberately 
        allow the audience to roam in a visual data-space.</p>
      <p class="normal">The look of the site itself does not portray a particular 
          social or political bent. The general feel of the site is formal, yet 
          exotic and attractive. Highly saturated colors and repeating patterns 
          reminiscent of the traditional arts and handicrafts of early cultures 
          on the top or bottom of browser windows invite the audience to a pleasurable 
        and aesthetic visit and create a friendly warm atmosphere. </p>
      <h2>6. Results</h2>
      <p class="normal">The results of the study are described as similarities 
        and differences between documentary film and Internet-based documentary.</p>
      <h2>6.1 Characteristics Shared with Documentary Film</h2>
      <p class="normal">Web sites that clearly introduce themselves as Web documentaries, 
          along with other sites such as documentary magazines that are involved 
          with documentary practice, share certain characteristics with documentary 
        film. The following are some of these shared characteristics:</p>
        <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li>          Documentary 
          practice on the Internet intends to reflect the historical world.</li>
        <li>          Some of 
            the elements of documentary practice on the Internet have indexical 
          relation with the real world.</li>
        <li>          Documentary 
            hypertext is built around an informing logic and provides historical 
          and informative links to events and elements.</li>
        <li>          Documentary 
            practice in the internet utilizes a body of text in the form of commentary 
            or interview. As in films, this speech can share conventions with 
          diaries, essays, and also incorporate rhetoric devices and rules.</li>
        <li>
          <div class=listwithbullets> Documentary 
            hypertext can use modes of representation to convey their perspective</div>
        </li>
        <li>          The voice 
            of documentary hypertext is built from the treatment of each of the 
          consisting elements as well as their arrangement. </li>
        <li>  The practice 
            of creating a documentary hypertext can be an individual practice 
            or be supported by organizations that are known as supporters of documentary 
            practices (such as the National Film Board of Canada).</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>6.2 Specific Characteristics of Web Documentaries</h2>
      <p class="normal">Web documentaries have characteristics that are <b>specific</b> 
        to them and are <b>not</b> shared with documentary films.</p>
      <h3>Web-documentaries are hypermediated. </h3>
      <p class="normal">They demand the audience's participation and interaction.. 
          Different events and documents are <b>not</b> re-presented to the audience 
          in a coherently perceived three-dimensional world on a screen that is 
          representative of the historical world; rather, they are laid out in 
          different windows and layers in which two-dimensional and three-dimensional 
        views are presented. </p>
      <p class=normal>The audience of a documentary film is the spectator of 
          a sequence of images that follow each other without his control in a 
          coherent space/time reality. Web-documentaries use a model of exhibition, 
          magazine, or map to organize their data in a perceived digital space 
          and invite the audience to move through this data space and explore 
          the documents. As a result, equivalents to temporal or continuity editing 
          are almost absent in Web documentaries. The audience proceeds through 
          the material and retrieves information through participation in the 
          digital space and through getting physically and cognitively engaged 
        interacting with the interface.</p>
      <p class=normal>In most Web-documentaries, the main narrative is written 
          in text and is laid out as the main layer of data. This type of speech, 
          either in form of first person narration or interviews, has the role 
          of communicating information in most Web-documentaries. The material 
          of the speech is usually organized in chapters or sections so it can 
        be browsable and studied separately. </p>
      <h3>Media is secondary material.</h3>
      <p class=normal>Images, movies and sounds are usually given a secondary 
          role, mainly used to illustrate the text within the speech. These secondary 
          materials are laid out within the text and are hypermediated or organized 
          in linked sequences, such as albums or photo-essays. They can be accessed 
          through links provided beside the text or images laid out inside the 
          text. These albums and photo-essays are sometimes accompanied with captions 
          and often provide the audience with <i>exploratoriums</i> and small 
          side-trips to the main text. These either engage the audience with closer 
          details of the subject matter and illustrate the text, or provide additional 
          perspective to the subject. Additional documents may also be compiled 
        in databases that the audience can access through internal search engines.</p>
      <p class=normal>Many Web-documentaries also attempt to expand their perspective 
          and coverage by providing links to other Websites that contain material 
        related to their subject. </p>
      <h3>Web-documentaries are clusters of information. </h3>
      <p class=normal>The Web-documentary may be presented in a collection of 
          similar documentaries or be individually presented as part of a site 
          involved with documentation of material according to an informing logic. 
          In this case, the overall database of the site may not have a particular 
          plot but rather may be made up of piles of information, catalogues and 
        chains of events which are all related to the area which the site covers.</p>
      <h3>Web-documentaries may have multiple authors and contributors. </h3>
      <p class="normal">Web-documentaries may have more than one author/creator 
          and can be an ongoing process of documentation. In some Web documentaries, 
          the documentary process is supervised either by individuals or organizations. 
          With others, documents are provided by "external" sources 
          such as photographers, journalists, and individuals brought in to build 
          a documentary. The documentaries may be re-structured by the authors 
          at anytime. The database can be expanded at any time by either the author 
        or by contributions accepted from the audience in the form of images, 
        interviews, links etc .</p>
      <h3>Web documentaries can have forums.</h3>
      <p class="normal">Discussion forums add to the quality of the Web documentaries 
          and account for aspects of their voice. The forums provide the audience 
          of the site with a space to review documents and share interpretations. 
          This discussion may go further than the specific topic documented on 
          the site and therefore add new branches to the mainstream of the idea 
          within the documentary. Depending on whether these forums invite open 
          discussion or narrow the discussion toward views that may support the 
          perspective of the documentary, they can account for the voice of the 
        site, augmenting the perspective or suggestion of the documentary maker(s).</p>
      <h3>Web documentaries' use visual design, information architecture, 
        and interaction as voice. </h3>
      <p class="normal">The voice of the site and Web-documentary is a factor 
          of the categories of data presented, the range and depth of the information 
          in each, and the arrangement of these clusters of information. Also, 
          the architecture of the hypertext and the way the audience is moved 
          through the data space account for viewers' experience of conceiving 
          the story or the organization of information in their minds. As well, 
          the way the subject is treated in the visual re-presentations such as 
          movie-clips, VRs and photographs and the overall visual design of the 
          site (colors, patterns, areas ) - all contribute to the voice of the 
        documentary. </p>
      <h3>Web-documentaries can broadcast their material in real-time.</h3>
      <p class="normal">Web-documentaries may use digital cameras and Web-cams 
          to distribute their material in real-time. The broadcast may be part 
        of the documentary or constitute the entire documentary. </p>
      <h1>7. Conclusion</h1>
      <p class="normal">Although film documentary does not rely on continuity 
          editing to create a spatial or temporal continuity between shots of 
          the film, it still invites its audience to participate in a three-dimensional 
          storyworld which represents the historical world visually. Web-documentaries,however, 
          do not attempt to represent the three-dimensionality of the historical 
          world; instead, they create a perceived three-dimensional data-space 
          where the audience can move between the documents deliberately. Most 
          Web documentaries up to now have tried to contain the main narrative 
          or logic of the documentary through written text; other media such as 
          images and movies are tied to the body of text though hyperlinks. These 
          hyperlinks provide the audience with additional narrative trajectories 
          to explore and may enhance understanding of the text that lies in the 
        body of the work as its main axis.</p>
      <p class="normal">While some Web documentaries have shown efforts at utilizing 
          the experience of navigating the data space for the narration and for 
          managing hierarchies of knowledge (using metaphors such as interactive 
          maps and sequential photo-essays), there is much more room for exploring 
        this in creating Web-documentaries.</p>
      <p class="normal">Overall, the framework we have derived from documentary 
          cinema shows that the traditions of documentary film are present in 
          Web-documentary too; although Web documentaries seem to fulfill audience 
          expectations, such as engagement with the historical world, it is hard 
          to say that they have absorbed these concepts under the influence of 
        the traditions seen in cinema. </p>
      <p class="normal">Regarding perspective and organizing logic, our framework, 
          based on Nichols' theory, may need some modifications to be applicable 
          to many other forms of documentary practices on the Internet (such as 
          those seen on scientific sites and museums sites, allowing the audience 
          to explore specific objects, historic eras or scientific phenomena.) 
          This is the direction for our future work in this area. We would like 
          to continue to apply and refine the current framework with the aim of 
        evolving it into a tool for analyzing Web documentaries. </p>
