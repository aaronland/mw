  <p class="PaperTitle">Learning from Amazon and eBay: User-generated Material for 
      Museum Web Sites</p>
  <p class="Author">Gail Durbin, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, United Kingdom</p>
  <p class="URL"><a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/">http://www.vam.ac.uk</a></p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
   <p class="AbstractText">Museums have a way to go in understanding what has long 
      been apparent to commercial sites: you don't have to sweat it out over all 
      your content if you are prepared to allow visitors to generate it for you. 
      eBay and Friends Reunited have sites entirely built on user-generated content, 
      and Amazon is increasingly leaning on users to develop content that adds depth 
      and vitality. Museums can learn lessons from this approach. </p>
   <p class="AbstractText">At the V&amp;A we aim to be the Number One museum Web 
      site for art and design, and our curators are world experts in their fields. 
      In these circumstances it would be easy for the site to communicate in one 
      direction only, but we are keen to ensure the site works in both directions 
      and that we draw on the expertise and enthusiasm of visitors as well. We also 
      want visitors to our Web site to feel they can contribute to the work of the 
      museum and develop their own creativity. We have not yet persuaded a curator 
      to moderate a chat room or ventured into any of those other potentially labour 
      intensive Web activities, but in the last year we have used a wide variety 
      of ways of incorporating visitor-created content into our Web site.</p>
  <p class="keywords">Keywords: user-generated content, creativity, museum web 
        strategies</p>
  <h1>User-generated Material at the V &amp; A</h1>
  <p>At the museum we have run events which we have translated into Web content 
      at its most basic. Two exhibitions run in our Photography Gallery discussed 
      the moment of the shot. They were<i> Stepping In and Out: Contemporary Documentary 
      Photography</i> and <i>100 Photographs: A Collection by Bruce Bernard</i>. 
  </p>
  <p>In response to these exhibitions, we asked visitors to leave on our response 
      wall photographs or written cards about a defining moment in their lives, 
      or a moment they considered a defining moment for society. Over 50,000 people 
      took part, and many were prepared to share very personal events and perceptions 
      with other visitors. When the exhibitions closed, we employed someone to sift 
      though the responses and make a selection for the Web. Here are some of the 
      contributions: </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">When my husband entered an addiction clinic by himself 
          to give up alcohol &#8211; 3 years ago. Every moment since has been 
        bliss!</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Getting my BA degree and bus pass both in the same 
        week!</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">When I made a pot on the wheel that stood up for 
        the first time. Potter </p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">The day I first did a headstand! Brilliant.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">My husband&#8217;s 60th birthday when we had a party 
          and our three children and their spouses and our eight grandchildren 
          were all together for the first time. All live a long way from each 
          other, one family Lincolnshire, one family Glasgow, the other family 
        Spain.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Watching my Dad go mad and realising I have to look 
        after him now&#8230;</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">The first bite of a huge breakfast with good friends 
        after dancing all night in my favourite dress. Kate Catalina, NZ 24/11/02</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Finding my great grandfather&#8217;s furniture in 
        the British Galleries</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">In Barbara Hepworth&#8217;s garden modern art finally 
        made sense.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Gaining confidence to go traveling on my own &#8211;

  <p class="BlockQuote"> President Kennedy died because I didn&#8217;t pray 
          hard enough. Sister Rita Margaret said so &#8211; I was 7. <em>Paula 
        H </em></p>
  <p>For the <i>Ossie Clark Exhibition </i>Web site, we tried e-mail. People were 
      asked to e-mail their recollections of wearing Ossie Clark clothes, together 
      with any scanned images they might have. There is always a fear that staff 
      will be overwhelmed by the response to such requests, but in this case, with 
      a Web site that is pushing 3 million visits a year and an exhibition that 
      has run for over seven months, we have received only about 25 written contributions 
      and no images. (The image we have put on the site was a contribution from 
      our head of exhibitions, used by us to seed the site.) It does not matter 
      that contributions were few. Their quality was excellent and they bring vividly 
      to life the excitement and emotion of wearing these clothes in a way simple 
      museum labels could never have done. Here are a couple of examples:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">It was my very first dinner/dance. I bought a black 
          crepe and satin ankle length evening dress which at £20 represented 
          a weeks salary. It fitted beautifully, with the deep front opening almost 
          to the waist it clung with the weight of the crepe to a then youthful 
          size 10 figure making it almost impossible to wear anything underneath. 
          It was effortless and sensual to wear and lives on in my memory as the 
          most beautiful dress I have ever worn. I still have the dress. It has 
          traveled around the world with me though sadly never worn again as that 
        youthful size 10 no longer exists. <em>Gill Barker</em></p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">I first became aware of Ossie Clark when I was aged 
          about 12. What inspiration there was at the time &#8211; Biba, Bill 
          Gibb and the master Ossie Clark! Ossie&#8217;s designs were the ultimate 
          in innovation, genius pattern cutting and fabulous prints by Celia Birtwell 
        &#8211; I was fascinated and intrigued. More than anyone else he was 
          the designer who inspired me to carry on and carve out a future in fashion 
        &amp; textiles, albeit as a swimwear designer! In eager anticipation 
          of the forthcoming exhibition I dug out my boxes of archive cuttings 
          and magazines and yes, I am still amazed by the genius of Ossie. To 
          anyone thinking of a future in fashion, go along and prepare to be inspired! 
        <em>Maureen Smythe</em></p>
  <p>This kind of participation in the Web site uses visitors' expertise to broaden 
      understanding of art and design. It was an easy task checking the texts and 
      putting them on the Web, and we will repeat the activity with our forthcoming 
      Vivienne Westwood exhibition.</p>
  <h1>An Experiment</h1>
  <p>For <i>Westwood</i>, as well, we have embarked on another experiment. The 
          first phase of an exhibition Web site launches 6 to 8 weeks in advance 
          of opening to encourage the advance booking of tickets. On this occasion 
          we will also ask visitors to e-mail us questions for Westwood and the 
          curator of the exhibition. We plan to select a range and put the answers 
          on the phase two site, which launches a few days before the show opens. 
          Here is another way to encourage visitor participation without creating 
        too much work but at the same time bringing variety to the Web site.</p>
  <h1>Rationale</h1>
  <p>The Victoria and Albert Museum was founded in order to improve the quality 
      of British art and design, so it is entirely appropriate that our Web site 
      should include images and other creative work by visitors. The <i>Snap Happy 
      Days</i> half-term photography event took place over nine days. With support 
      both from the BBC and the Lomographic Society, visitors experimented with 
      three different styles of photography: lomo, instant cameras, and photo booths, 
      and added their work to the display to create a growing exhibition of public 
      art. This was the ideal museum activity: everyone from kindergarten child 
      to senior citizen could do something age and ability appropriate and come 
      away feeling proud of the work. Lomo photography is very democratic. 'Don't 
      think, just shoot' is its mantra, and the lenses and filters create random 
      effects which encourage people to look at the museum, and their own creativity, 
      in a whole new light. Nearly 8,000 visitors came to look at the exhibition 
      and to take part in the activities, and a sizeable number of the results were 
      uploaded to the Web site, together with 'How to do it' instructions, examples 
      of work by specific artists, and articles explaining the philosophy of this 
      type of photography.</p>
  <p>There is, of course, a big difference in a museum uploading examples of people's 
      work to a Web site and people doing this for themselves.</p>
  <h1>Examples</h1>
  <h2>Every Object Tells a Story</h2>
  <p> In our next major project we are grasping the nettle of a moderated site 
      where people can upload not only text and images, but video clips and audio 
      as well.</p>
  <p> <i>Every object tells a story</i> is a major collaboration of the V&amp;A, 
      Channel 4, and Ultralab, funded by Culture on Line, a government agency tasked 
      with broadening the range and audience for cultural activity on the net. The 
      site is about telling stories (historical and fictional) about objects. </p>
  <h2>Snap Shot Stories</h2>
  <p>Last summer we used our holiday activities <i>Snap Shot Stories</i> to test 
      some ideas that we will turn into activities on the site. 'Photostories' were 
      created starring museum objects. Experimenting with imaging techniques, pictures 
      were arranged onto a storyboard using speech bubbles to bring the characters 
      to life. In another activity, mini-books were made telling the life of a museum 
      object, and 'Transformation' allowed visitors use four images taken in a photo 
      booth to morph snap shots into a museum object.</p>
  <p>      We will put a minimum of 1,000 V&amp;A objects on the site as well as 600 
      from our regional partner museums as a core resource but visitors will be 
      able to upload their own images if they choose. Ultralab is creating software 
      that will allow visitors to comment on other people's stories, creating threads, 
      and we hope also to be able to send out text messages to tell people when 
      someone has added to their story. We aim to have 40,000 stories in the first 
      year. The site launches in July 2004, so perhaps further discussion of this 
      site should wait for Museums and the Web in 2005.</p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>When looking at museum Web sites, I find there is disappointingly little 
          in the way of contributions from visitors. What is there is largely 
          in the form of text with little variety of approach. It seems a pity 
          that when museums are becoming themselves much more interactive, we 
          are not using our Web sites to draw visitors into making real contributions. 
          We are surrounded on the Web by commercial sites that have learnt the 
          value of inviting this sort of participation. We should be leading, 
        not following.</p>
