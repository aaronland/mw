  <p class="PaperTitle">From Virtually Impossible to the Virtual: Building a Dream 
    Exhibition </p>
  <p class="Author">Kirk Alexander, University 
    of California at Davis and Janet Temos, Princeton University, USA</p>
  <p class="URL"><a href="http://www.princeton.edu/etc/" target="_blank">http://www.princeton.edu/etc/</a></p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
   <p class="AbstractText">A map, some engravings, 
    the records of a vanished city . . . neglected artists, scattered works, and 
    a compelling story to tell: these words describe two recent projects undertaken 
    by the Educational Technologies Center (ETC) at Princeton University. In 
    the first instance, a decade-long collaboration between Kirk Alexander and 
    John Pinto, Professor of Architectural History, had resulted in an interactive 
    exploration of Rome using Giambattista Nolli's 1748 map of the city as interface 
    to a database of images and text. When Professor Pinto suggested using Nolli's 
    map to contextualize Piranesi's etchings of Rome, the challenge was to combine 
    the digitized works of two of the 18<sup>th</sup> century's greatest graphic 
    artists to recreate a view of 18th century Rome. The most recent version, 
    discussed here, extends the simple database queries to a Flash visualization 
    which reveals the relationships between Piranesi's prints and the monuments 
    they depict. In the second instance, Lionel Gossman, Professor Emeritus of 
    Romance Languages and Literature, wished to explore the works of the German 
    Nazarene artists. These painters enjoyed enormous popularity in the early 
    19th century, but had since fallen from favor, and their works had never enjoyed 
    a comprehensive viewing. The possibility of displaying the work of these artists 
    seemed beyond the practical scope of a museum exhibition. ETC designed an 
    interface in which Professor Gossman's narration provided the intellectual 
    context for an exploration of the life and works of this group of artists 
    as a geographically disparate group of art works are examined. In both cases, 
    the combined interaction of scholarship and technology has resulted in the 
    virtually impossible becoming virtual reality.</p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p class="normal">The Educational Technologies Center (ETC) at Princeton 
    serves as the portal for Princeton faculty members who wish to use technology 
    in teaching. Kirk Alexander, former Director of ETC, developed the goals and 
    mission of this center over a decade of collaboration with Princeton professors. 
    Today, ETC, under the direction of Janet Temos, continues to serve the interests 
    of the Princeton community. This paper describes two projects recently undertaken 
    by ETC. One of them builds on collaboration a decade in the making. The other 
    is one of the Center's newest projects. In each case, ETC was approached by 
    a professor who had a clear concept -- but no practical way to carry it to 
    fruition. This paper addresses the planning, conception, and execution of 
    two virtual exhibitions in which the navigation and context enabled by technology 
    make the virtual into something the real world cannot easily offer.</p>
  <p class="normal">A ten-year collaboration between Kirk Alexander (then of 
    ETC) and John Pinto, Professor of Architectural History (Princeton University), 
    had resulted in an interactive exploration of Rome using Giovanni Battista 
    Nolli's 1748 map of the city as the digital interface to an extensive database 
    of images and texts. This project continues to serve as a basis for classroom 
    teaching, and had already been transformed into a successful distance-learning 
    course, "Walks in Rome." When Professor Pinto wanted to expand the Nolli map 
    interface as the contextualizing element for Giovanni Battista Piranesi's 
    prints of Rome, the challenge faced by ETC was in repurposing the map interface 
    to show not only the scope and extent of the monuments represented in each 
    print, but also to use the prints to provide added dimension to Nolli's ichnographic 
    plan. To this end, a database of Roman monuments and related documents, the 
    latest visualization tools, and the efforts of a team of scholars combined 
    to produce a fluid interface. The project (although still under development) 
    attempts to combine these disparate elements into a refreshing interactive 
    view of 18th century Rome that combines plan, map and elevation, by combining 
    the digitized works of two of the 18th-century's greatest graphic artists.</p>
  <p class="normal">The second project represents the work of Lionel Gossman, 
    Professor Emeritus of Romance Languages and Literature (Princeton University), 
    who had developed a strong interest in the German Nazarene artists. These 
    painters enjoyed popularity in the first half of the 19th century, but had 
    since fallen out of favor with the fashions of the art market. The result 
    is that their paintings are scattered in a number of major and minor art collections 
    throughout Europe, but have never enjoyed a comprehensive viewing. The possibility 
    of displaying the work of these artists seemed beyond the logistical scope 
    of a museum exhibition. However, with the resources of an exceptional art 
    history library and some high quality scanning equipment, ETC designed an 
    interface that combined the best of both worlds: Professor Gossman's narration 
    provided an intellectual context for a multimedia exploration of the life 
    and works of this group of artists. Scanned images (and a concerted effort 
    to secure copyright permissions) followed, and the resulting course simulates 
    the path of the informed eye through a geographically disparate group of art 
    works. What follows describes the origins and evolution of both of these projects.</p>
  <h1>I. The Nolli Map Interface</h1>
  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p class="normal">One of the most important considerations for urban historians 
    is the physical context of buildings set within the complex urban fabric of 
    a city like Rome. After twenty years of teaching an undergraduate course on 
    Rome as a center of artistic production through the ages, our colleague John 
    Pinto remained frustrated by the difficulty his students experienced in grasping 
    the urban context of buildings such as the Pantheon and the Trevi Fountain. 
    In 1995, Professor Pinto came to Kirk Alexander with a proposal to employ 
    technology to overcome this difficulty by using an 18th century plan of Rome 
    by Giovanni Battista Nolli as the front end of an interactive database of 
    texts and images relating to the urban history of Rome. Over the intervening 
    years the database has grown, and its applications have multiplied to everything 
    from supporting Freshman Seminars to an on-line course for Princeton Alumni, 
    with an enrolment of over one thousand.</p>
  <h2>Map as a front end of database</h2>
  <p>Nolli constructed an Enlightenment version of a modern database. His index 
    of 1320 monuments lists them not only in numerical order, but also according 
    to categories, such as antiquities, churches, streets, etc. By using the map 
    as the front end of the database, we enable students to come to understand 
    the relationship of individual buildings and streets to the surrounding urban 
    fabric. At any point, they can also take their own "virtual walks" through 
    the city, clicking on monuments as they encounter them on the map. The direct 
    links to the database provide historical and art context for each monument. 
  </p>
  <p>In order to provide a flexible tool for analysis and discussion, one needs 
    to be able to see the city both in its entirety and in great detail. Some 
    urban features, for example the Aurelian Walls and streets such as the Via 
    del Corso and the Strada Felice, extend across much of the city. Also, to 
    show the distribution of fountains, obelisks, or other features, one needs 
    to see the entire plan. The first available level of resolution does just 
    that, highlighting features for which there are records in the database. A 
    second level of resolution provides more detail, while still maintaining the 
    color overlays. Finally, there is a third level, without overlays, which respects 
    the integrity of the original plan and reproduces every detail visible on 
    the printed plates. </p>
  <p>Just as the database allows viewers to contextualize individual buildings 
    within the city, it can also be used to explore the spatial and architectural 
    context of specific works of art. One example developed by a student in a 
    Freshman Seminar is Bernini's Apollo and Daphne. The sculptural group is nested 
    as a component of the Villa Borghese, which allows its Ovidian theme &mdash; the 
    origin of laurel &mdash; to be seen in the context of the gardens surrounding the 
    Casino for which it was carved. The database also allows its display within 
    the Casino to be studied, both in its present state and as originally experienced.</p>
  <p>One feature unique to the database and its Web interface is its ability to 
    dynamically generate overlays for the Nolli plan that are related to searches 
    of the data records. For example, if one comes upon a record such as the 
    one for the Trevi Fountain, one can drill down in the database by clicking 
    on this monument's type (fountain) to display a list of all other fountains 
    recorded in the database. A link below that list will generate a new presentation 
    of the Rome map with just the fountains highlighted and color coded. Unfortunately, 
    in this typical Web based serial navigation process it is very awkward to 
    see simultaneously the list of these fountains, their location within the 
    city, and visual imagery depicting their form. As we will see, there are 
    additional situations in which more readily available visual comparisons between 
    imagery and the Nolli Plan are valuable.</p>
  <h2>Using the map to analyze works of art</h2>
  <p>From the beginning, we were concerned to complement Nolli's plan with printed 
    views by his contemporaries Vasi and Piranesi. Stated more broadly, we wanted 
    to extend the relationship between the map and features represented on it 
    to include other works of art representing those features. To this end, we 
    engaged two graduate students to digitize the sites represented in Piranesi's 
    <i>Vedute di Roma</i> series. With this data it becomes possible to plot the 
    approximate location of the viewpoints for each <i>Veduta</i>. If one could 
    put Piranesi's prints in visual relation to Nolli's plan, one could gauge 
    the degree to which Piranesi manipulated or distorted his compositions and 
    suggest reasons for the decisions he made.</p>
  <p>An excellent example is provided by the Piranesi's <i>Veduta</i> of the Palazzo 
    Chigi-Odescalchi. Piranesi's composition is contrived to set off the palace 
    facade, which had been dramatically extended in 1746, following the designs 
    of Nicola Salvi and Luigi Vanvitelli. As noted in Michelle Taylor's excellent 
    entry on this print in the catalogue <i>Piranesi, Rome Recorded</i>, Piranesi 
    pushed the Colonna palace &mdash; situated on the eastern side of the Piazza Santi 
    Apostoli opposite the Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi &mdash; further to the north in order 
    to make it more visible. He also sharply foreshortened &mdash; compressed, really 
    &mdash; the buildings to the north of the Palazzo Colonna: the Basilica of Santi 
    Apostoli and the Palazzo Riario. See Figure 1, Palazzo Odescalchi. 
    </p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="alexander.fig1.jpg" alt="Engraving of the Palazzo Odescalchi"></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 1: Palazzo Odescalchi</p>
  <p>Piranesi's shift is even more interesting if one takes the street system 
    into account, as the Nolli plan allows one to do. A glance at the plan shows 
    that the North portal of the Palazzo Colonna (the one shown in Piranesi's 
    print) actually lines up with the Vicolo del Piombo (which is not even visible 
    in the <i>Veduta</i>), instead of standing opposite the Portal of the Palazzo 
    Odescalchi, as Piranesi presents it. See Figure 2, Nolli Near the Palazzo 
    Odescalchi. </p>

  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 2: Nolli Near the Palazzo Odescalchi</p>
  <p>In other prints by Piranesi and Vasi there are several monuments depicted 
    in the same print. A search of the database for prints representing the Domus 
    Aurea yields four results as shown in Figure 3: Prints for Domus Aurea,<b><i> 
    </i></b>which show multiple monuments in each of the prints. What 
    is needed to better comprehend the content and composition of these prints 
    is an ability to see each of the prints in relation to the Nolli plan and 
    to understand from where each print is viewed. Figure 4: Map Prints for 
    Domus Aurea shows a section of the Nolli Plan with the Domus Aurea outlined 
    and circles indicating the locations from which each of prints was drawn.

  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 4: Map Prints for Domus Aurea</p>
  <p>In Figure 5: Arch of Constantine, Colosseum and Fountain, we show a single 
    print and all the monuments depicted in it. The names of these monuments 
    are also listed on the data record for this print when it is displayed. What 
    is needed now is a way to represent all of this data simultaneously to enable 
    the viewer to work with it in a coherent way.</p>

  <h2>Flash Visualization</h2>
  <p class="normal">A Flash module has now been built to combine a high resolution 
    image of the entire Nolli plan with outlines of each of the monuments in the 
    database as well as with each of the viewing locations for the Piranesi prints.
    In this interface (shown in Figure 6: Nolli Flash Interface) we see the same 
    four prints and, in the example shown, all of the buildings represented in 
    the print on the lower right (Campo Vaccino [Forum Romanum] viewed from the 
    Capitoline.) Interactively the interface also does the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Rolling the mouse over a thumbnail reveals the title of the 
        print and highlights the corresponding outline over the map.</li>
    <li> Rolling the mouse over a circle on the map highlights the corresponding 
        print thumbnail.</li>
    <li> Any set of prints or monuments can be selected for interaction 
        by choosing their titles from the search lists on the right of the interface.</li>
    <li> Each image can be enlarged into its own window by clicking on 
        the magnifying lens on the thumbnail.</li>
    <li> Database records for each image can be displayed in their own 
        window by clicking on the text icon over each thumbnail.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Concluding Comments</h2>
  <p>The recent emergence of technologies that permit the tight integration of 
    visual interactive environments such as Macromedia Flash with on-line databases 
    now makes it possible to construct rich visual data exploration and data mining 
    applications for museum and academic audiences. The visualization tool presented

	<h1>II. Unwilling Moderns: The Nazarene Artists </h1>

    <p>Another, much later view of Rome comprises part of the content of the second project discussed in the paper, the on-line course, <em>Unwilling Moderns: The Nazarene Artists. </em>This course discusses a group of German-speaking artists who were active in Rome in the first half of the 19th century. The project represents the scholarship of Professor Emeritus Lionel Gossman, and documents the works and lives of the Nazarene artists within the intellectual context of early 19th-century Europe.</p>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p><em>Unwilling Moderns: The Nazarene Artists</em> is the ninth course of its kind produced by the Educational Technologies Center (ETC) at Princeton University. It is in a format ETC defines as @princetonCourseware&trade;. Created using Macromedia Flash and released both in CD-ROM format and on the Web, @princetonCourseware uses various digital assets, including recorded narration, video, music, and image files, to produce the virtual equivalent of a scholarly lecture or undergraduate course. These courses are produced for the benefit of the wider University community, defined as all faculty and staff at Princeton, and all current and past students. The audience for these courses was narrowly defined to fall within a reasonable definition of academic &ldquo;fair use.&rdquo; To that end, in the interests of protecting rights of the University and of copyright holders who have allowed us to use their materials, @princetonCourseware is offered to registered users only, the courses are password-protected, and they are created using a technology that makes it difficult to gain access to any of the individual assets used in the courses. The courses are provided to our audience at no charge.</p>
    <h2>Project Initiation</h2>
    <p>Professor Gossman first approached ETC in the autumn of 2002 with the request that we assist him in making a scholarly Web page that showcased his past career, recent publications, and current research interests. Among his projects was a digital essay on the German Nazarene artists active in the early 19th century in Europe. Professor Gossman had worked with another technologist at Princeton to produce this essay in a PDF format that had images inserted within the text. The entire document was laid out in a way that approximated a published work. It was Professor Gossman&rsquo;s intention to put the essay on his own Web page. He had earlier hoped to found an on-line journal as a venue for digital essays by younger scholars, and had produced his own essay on the Nazarenes as an example of such a work. However, Professor Gossman soon realized that he himself lacked the technical expertise to achieve this end, or to maintain such a page, and was content to post his own work to an accessible place on the World Wide Web.</p>
    <p>The Educational Technologies Center routinely helps members of the Princeton faculty use technology in their teaching and scholarship, and Professor Gossman got both his Web page and his scholarly article posted on the World Wide Web at <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~lgossman/" target="_blank">http://www.princeton.edu/~lgossman/</a>.</p>
    <p>Because of Professor Gossman&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the new digital media and their application to scholarly publication, we invited him to work with us in presenting his article on the Nazarenes in a different format, one we thought would be particularly well suited to the essay he had written. As he was a well-liked professor, and had organized a very successful alumni course (taught both via the Web and at two weekend campus events), we knew his course offering would be welcomed by our target audience. ETC proposed to make his essay into a multimedia course, approximately an hour long, to be delivered on-line for broadband users, or via a CD-ROM mailed to the course participant.</p>
    <h2>Preparing Course Content</h2>
    <p>Since ETC had already created several similar courses, we knew that the first step was to edit the content of Professor Gossman&rsquo;s written work in order to achieve approximately one hour of spoken narration and to break the text into segments that suited the capacity of individual Flash movies to deliver content effectively. The essay <em>Unwilling Moderns: on the German Nazarene Artists</em> was fifty-five pages long, contained roughly 20,000 words, and was rounded out by various appendices, citations, bibliographic references, and other elements of the scholarly apparatus. Clearly, editing the article to suit multimedia delivery was the most essential task. </p>
    <p>While not wishing to undermine any of the scholarship contained in the original essay (it was always our intention to include a link to the original PDF version of Professor Gossman&rsquo;s work in the multimedia course), the task that faced ETC&rsquo;s scriptwriter was that of adapting the content of a comprehensive written work into a spoken lecture that would introduce all of the main points discussed in the essay, as well as provide compelling references to any image files that would eventually illustrate the final work. Ironically, we had already discovered that the process of dramatically cutting a written text to suit our format also involved the need for greatly increasing the number of images needed to sustain the narration and engage the viewer&rsquo;s visual interest. As the topic of the course constantly referred to images that may or may not have been represented by illustrations in the original essay, the number of appropriate images - ones either directly referred to in the text or supportive of more general observations - also had to be included in the visual outline of the script. As it has never been ETC&rsquo;s practice simply to videotape a given lecture - a form of delivery that we found never equaled the actual experience of the lecture itself - we preferred instead to record the lecture in a professional recording studio and illustrate the narration with still images, animations, and occasional video clips.</p>
    <p>In the end, the written version of <em>Unwilling Moderns</em> was shortened to less than half its original length, while the number of illustrations and supporting images increased more than fourfold. The script was divided into eleven sections, each of which contained a &ldquo;chapter&rdquo; in the course, and images were chosen to support the points being discussed.</p>
    <h2>Interface Design</h2>
    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <p>Since <em>Unwilling Moderns</em> was not the first lecture of its type that ETC had designed, we already had a good model in place for navigating a linear narrative of similar length. The interface was designed to give the viewer the maximum amount of control in looking at the lecture, while minimizing the user input. The course is designed entirely in <em>Flash</em>, with one &ldquo;parent&rdquo; movie that remains constantly onscreen and provides consistent navigational tools and a target for the loading and unloading of &ldquo;child&rdquo; movies that contain the actual lecture content. </p>
    <p>The navigation tools in the parent movie (see Figure 7) <strong></strong>provide the physical frame (the black portion of the screen) into which the smaller lecture sections are loaded and unloaded. The top portion of the navigational menu contains the course title and numeric buttons representing each chapter, allowing a user to go to any part of the lecture. Once initiated, each sub-section is programmed automatically to load the next section in the sequence so that the playback can be a continuous, seamless presentation of the lecture. If desired, the viewer can watch the entire course at one sitting, or pause, or skip playback to see the course in segments. In the lower portion of the navigation frame is a series of buttons that provide a help screen, an &ldquo;image library&rdquo; giving the copyright information for each image used in the course (with hotlinks to the respective museum and collection in nearly all cases), a reference section containing biographies of the artists mentioned in the course, and a link to an abbreviated bibliography of works cited in preparing the lecture and to the PDF version of the Nazarene article. Immediately below the black frame where the movie segments play are navigational controls that govern playback of the currently selected chapter in the lecture. These controls allow the user to go forward, backward, pause, and resume play within any section of the course, as well as provide information on the time remaining in the currently loaded chapter. </p>

  <h2>Production and Animation</h2>
  <h3>Gathering content</h3>
  <p class="normal">The largest challenge in making this particular course 
    was finding a sufficient quantity of suitable images. Because of the obscurity 
    of this group of artists, there were few available monographs that described 
    their individual careers and only a handful of publications dedicated to this 
    artistic movement as a whole. The actual works were scattered throughout European 
    collections and archives. Fortunately, most of Professor Gossman's own research 
    had been conducted in Princeton's Marquand Library of Art and Archaeology, 
    where the holdings are particularly rich, and his comments centered on images 
    that had been published in books owned by the Library. Professor Gossman and 
    some student researchers were enlisted to find illustrations in secondary 
    sources to increase and enhance the number of digital images that had already 
    been gathered for the original print article, and to record the locations 
    of the original artworks. The script was recorded, and as the animations of 
    the sections progressed, lacunae were filled in by suitable images. Almagest, 
    the local teaching database administered by ETC, was used to store the images 
    and catalogue their information, before the final task of seeking image permissions 
    from copyright holders. </p>
  <h3>Making movies</h3>
  <p class="normal">Once the scriptwriting and image research was done, a team 
    of three Flash animators and a graphic designer worked from a common template 
    to design the project. The voice recordings for each of the eleven movie subsections 
    defined the length of each chapter, ranging from just over two minutes to 
    fifteen minutes. Care was given to establishing a consistent mood and style, 
    presenting information about each work in an unobtrusive but comprehensive 
    way, with small captions used for the more important images in the course, 
    much in the way that museum labels provide essential information to the viewer. 
    Other important didactic points of the lecture appear on screen when necessary 
    to provide emphasis (See Figure 8).</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="alexander.fig8.jpg" alt="Richard Muther on the Nazarenes" width="400" height="203"></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 8, a screenshot from the final chapter of the course</p>
  <p class="normal">A textured black background was chosen to make the images 
    stand out as vividly as possible without looking too stark. Typefaces were 
    chosen for clarity and design suitability.</p>
  <h3>Finishing details</h3>
  <p class="normal">Because the final movies had assumed something of the quality 
    of a documentary film, Professor Gossman suggested that each section be introduced 
    by a short phrase of music contemporary to the Nazarene artists. Schubert, 
    in fact, had written musical settings of poems by the philosopher Friedrich 
    Schlegel, a key figure in the Nazarenes' intellectual circle, and much to 
    our surprise, (considering the current climate in the recording industry), 
    Hyperion Records of London graciously allowed us the use of short clips from 
    their recordings of these works, with no other compensation other than mention 
    of their company's Web site. The titles and music clips that open each section 
    have a dual purpose. Most obviously, they set a particular mood for each section 
    of the course. More practically, by moving the first image in the individual 
    movie section further down the Flash timeline, they allow the movies to load 
    more smoothly.</p>
  <p class="normal">Apart from these small design decisions, the last thing 
    we did in creating the <i>Unwilling Moderns</i> course was to provide some 
    adaptation of the traditional scholarly apparatus. This included bibliography 
    and links, a small reference section that provided information about the Nazarene 
    artists mentioned in the text, as well as the usual "Help" and "Credits" sections, 
    and an Image Library.</p>
  <p class="normal">The Image Library contains a set of thumbnail images of 
    every significant image used in the course. Each chapter is presented by a 
    page of thumbnail images in their order of appearance in the course. When 
    a thumbnail is selected, the image enlarges in a new window, and a text panel 
    provides basic information about the work of art, including artist name, creation 
    date, physical dimensions (where provided), and a link to the museum or collection 
    that houses the work of art. The Image Library allowed us to satisfy the criteria 
    of many different copyright holders who gave us permission to reproduce their 
    images: these criteria dictated the design of this feature. </p>

  <h2>Didactic goals</h2>
  <p class="normal">While we were making the course <i>Unwilling Moderns</i>, 
    it became clear to us that we had something of a hybrid product. Unlike a 
    Web page or publication made to accompany a museum exhibition, this interactive 
    course was simultaneously an 'exhibit' as well as its supporting documentation. 
    While the multimedia presentation was obviously unable to represent the physical 
    reality of the artwork in terms of scale or texture, it had the advantage 
    of being able to show multiple views of the same work, to enlarge and focus 
    on details, and to animate the images on screen in a way that precisely matched 
    Professor Gossman's description. In this way, the course assumes the additional 
    role of tour guide, and provides the viewer with both narrative context and 
    the advantage of being led by a 'learned eye' through the virtual exhibition 
    as the animations zoom, pan, and highlight the part of the work that is being 
    discussed. (See Figure 11.)</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="alexander.fig11.jpg" alt="Detail of drawing" width="400" height="203"></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 11, Unwilling Moderns, a drawing (left) and an 
    enlarged detail of the same work, illustrating the allegorical significance 
    of elements in the composition</p>
  <p class="normal">The advantages to this dynamic way of illustrating the 
    art works were made particularly clear in the penultimate chapter of the course, 
    where the linear narrative was interrupted to provide the viewer the opportunity 
    to explore independently three works by Johann Friedrich Overbeck and Franz 
    Pforr, co-founders of the Nazarene movement, in greater detail. Professor 
    Gossman narrated a careful formal and stylistic analysis of each of the three 
    paintings, and his points were illustrated for the most part by manipulating 
    the scale or visibility of the image under discussion to focus on fine details 
    or call out certain pictorial elements by bringing them into greater prominence. 
    It was this section of the course that, according to Professor Gossman, most 
    particularly achieved what he had hoped to convey to his audience.</p>
  <h2>Copyrights and Permissions</h2>
  <p>The final task of obtaining copyrights and permissions for the images used 
    in the <i>Unwilling Moderns</i> course was time consuming. Because most of 
    the museums who owned the works were in Europe, the level of complexity and 
    confusion about rights, ownership of images, and the unfamiliar multimedia 
    format became exponentially more difficult as requests were made and answered 
    in several different languages. It was sometimes quite difficult to explain 
    precisely what we wanted to do with these images in technical terms that had 
    any meaning to the copyright holder. In the end, we posted a draft version 
    of a portion of the course to the Web so that the people who were considering 
    our image requests could get some idea of the nature of the project. In some 
    cases, the transaction was straightforward; digital images were exchanged 
    for fees that were often reduced or waived. In others, especially when the 
    archive in question had no experience of digital images, was unused to answering 
    requests about usage, or had no clear policy on rights and reproductions, 
    the agreements we reached were less clear. In the end, ETC made a comprehensive 
    effort to get permissions for every image used in <i>Unwilling Moderns</i>, 
    although in a few cases, it was impossible to determine to whom these rights 
    belonged.</p>
  <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
  <p class="normal">Despite the fact that Professor Gossman was, and remains, 
    delighted with the <i>Unwilling Moderns</i> course, he and the team that worked 
    on this project found it more difficult than most to bring to a conclusion. 
    ETC's past courses were less tied to a precise set of images than was <i>Unwilling 
    Moderns. </i>Whereas in other courses, any among a number of similar images 
    might have been chosen - for instance, given the need to illustrate a reference 
    to warfare in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, one might have chosen among several 
    options - in the case of <i>Unwilling Moderns</i> there were many fewer instances 
    of non-specific illustrations. In the process of building past courses, ETC 
    had established relationships with several museums that allow us use of images 
    for nominal fees. Most of these institutions had undertaken their own digital 
    initiatives; their understanding of this process made them agreeable to permit 
    low resolution images to be used by ETC for educational multimedia courses. 
    In the case of <i>Unwilling Moderns</i>, only small parts of the course could 
    be illustrated by using 'general' images. In fact, any refusal by a museum 
    to give us permission to use an image evoked in the script would have significantly 
    altered the course content and made production difficult at a point when much 
    effort and time had already been expended on the project. Fortunately, this 
    did not happen, but gaining permissions seemed by the end to be a far greater 
    undertaking than any of us had imagined, and raised some doubt about the viability 
    of creating such image-specific and image-intensive courses for academic use. 
  </p>
  <p class="normal">In seeking permissions to reproduce images, we stayed well 
    within the terms of fair use by establishing the following criteria:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Our courses are only freely available to users in the princeton.edu 
        domain</li>
    <li>Any user beyond the princeton.edu domain would have to be part 
        of a narrowly defined group belonging to the university community</li>
    <li>All users in this "community" would be required to register 
        for the course, and be given a secure password to access course material</li>
    <li>All registered users would agree not to share the course with 
        members outside the defined user group</li>
    <li>There is no charge for any @princetonCourseware</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal">Unfortunately, this same set of criteria necessarily makes 
    the audience for the course a very small one.</p>
  <p class="normal">There is an equally compelling set of technical criteria 
    that operate in favor of the interests of copyright holders in the way that 
    @princetonCourseware is produced. These were more difficult to explain:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>While not impossible, it is difficult to extract individual 
        files from within a published Flash movie (.swf) other than by taking a screen 
        shot. Decompiling a .swf file is beyond the capability of most average users</li>
    <li>To facilitate the on-line delivery of our courses, most of the 
        assets contained in them are highly compressed. The sound files are MP3 audio 
        files; the images are .jpgs saved using Photoshop's "Save for Web" option. 
        The size of the "chapter" movies in <i>Unwilling Moderns</i> is 1024 pixels 
        by 384 pixels</li>
    <li>Given the above considerations, even if the movie were to be 
        successfully decompiled, the image files contained in the movies are too small 
        to be commercially useful, and could not be seen to deprive any copyright 
        holders of the advantage they have in owning the rights to a high quality 
        image</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal">Lack of clarity on these issues of use and intent has occasionally 
    led us into almost adversarial relationships with copyright holders, particularly 
    when a multimedia method of delivery is unfamiliar. As we at ETC believe we 
    add value to the assets we use by including comment, providing context, and 
    generating interest in the originals, it is never our intention to deprive 
    the copyright holders of the fair market value of their own assets. We can 
    only hope that better understanding will eventually lead to better cooperation.</p>
  <h2>Concluding remarks</h2>
  <p class="normal"><i>Unwilling Moderns</i> represents an effective use of 
    technology to represent a multimedia version of a work of scholarship. The 
    resulting course combines some aspects of a museum exhibition, of an art history 
    publication, and of a guided virtual tour. The course content is aimed at 
    a general audience, while simultaneously preserving much of the scholarly 
    content of the original work. The added value of the animations and visual 
    effects makes it possible to look at works of art discussed in the course 
    in ways that could not be achieved by more traditional forms of publication. 
    Unfortunately, since copyright permissions were negotiated within the context 
    of fair use to keep costs reasonable, it is necessary to restrict the audience 
    of the course to a limited, campus-based community.</p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>Both of the projects discussed in this paper pursue the notion of "exhibition" 
    in unconventional ways. Each achieves a presentation that is not possible 
    either physically or in print and each gains added value from its on-line, 
    interactive format. <i>Unwilling Moderns </i>brings together images from 
    around the world to shape a narrative account of the artistic movement that 
    fashioned them; the multimedia presentation simultaneously enables the student 
    to browse the "catalog" information related to each image, and to learn more 
    about the artists mentioned in the course. The <i>Nolli</i> interface enables 
    the collocation of 18<sup>th</sup>-century images with a contemporary wall-scale 
    map in a way that permits the simultaneous exploration of the virtual and 
    the real, of fact and fantasy, all anchored to geographic and object-based 
    cataloguing. The result in both cases is an exhibition in the best sense 
    of the word &mdash; a contribution of context and meaning to a particular grouping 
    of individual works completely enabled via a "virtual" delivery.</p>
