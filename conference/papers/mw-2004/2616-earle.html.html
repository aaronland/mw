      <p class="PaperTitle">Pictures and People: Distributed Query Database Collaboration</p>
      <p class="Author">Edward W. Earle, International Center of Photography, 
        New York; Roger Bruce, George Eastman House, Rochester, NY, USA</p>
      <p class="URL"><a href="http://www.photomuse.org/" target="_blank">http://www.photomuse.org</a></p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
       <p class="AbstractText">In 1998, the George Eastman House (GEH) and International 
          Center of Photography (ICP) formed an alliance to create joint exhibitions 
          and share collections and collection information. To strengthen the 
          collection management data infrastructure, GEH and ICP studied a range 
          of database solutions for managing the artifact collections. Eastman 
          House had a legacy VAX system that desperately needed to be migrated 
          to a modern database, and ICP was prepared to begin its first serious 
          cataloging project. In 2000 and 2001, the two museums jointly licensed 
          The Museum System from Gallery Systems. As part of this effort, the 
          two institutions planned to design a joint Web site as a portal into 
          databases representing the photographic collections of both organizations. 
          The two museums are now working with Gallery Systems to test a distributed 
          query system between the two institutions allowing Web visitors to enter 
          a single query at the joint Web site (<a href="http://www.photomuse.org/">www.photomuse.org</a>), 
          which will spawn queries to both ICP in New York City and Eastman House 
        in Rochester, NY. </p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>When new technology enters a culture, there is an 
          initial struggle to domesticate the foreign. We need to use analogies 
          to understand how the new technology works and to make it less threatening. 
          For example, the horse was the main mode of transportation during much 
          of American history, so when the steam locomotive was invented it was 
          called an "iron horse." Similarly the phrase "horseless 
          carriage" was applied to the first automobiles. These terms helped 
          to domesticate the potentially threatening technology and make it palatable 
        to the populace. </p>
      <p>The language of assimilation has been used for today's 
          technology as well. Fortunately, very few people, except perhaps politicians, 
          talk about the "information super highway" any longer. However, 
          technological change within the information sciences has also often 
          required bringing along old legacy forms to instill comfort. How many 
          database programs used the index card analogy to convince the user that 
        this new technology at least looked like that which was known and understood?</p>
      <p>Just as the culture of 19<sup>th</sup> Century America 
          resisted new technology, museums were slow to reach the level of comfort 
          that libraries have long had with information systems. Even when databases 
          were introduced, there were legendary fights among museum departments 
          over conflicting use of field structures and nomenclature. Early on, 
          many museums and even departments within a museum went at it alone, 
          developing complex databases suited to their local idiosyncratic needs 
          (often defined by the need of the moment rather than longer term assessment). 
          At the same time, these early efforts helped to define the unique needs 
          of museums as distinct from the hierarchy of library science. Early 
          work at the George Eastman house resulted in one of the first networked 
          image databases (on a very experimental level). In the mid 1980s the 
          Eastman House and California Museum of Photography, University of California, 
          Riverside, experimented with networked data via 1200-baud dial-up modem 
          to a VAX with a local videodisk in California displaying images based 
          on records accessed from Rochester.  By the turn of the century, this 
          data and videodisk represented a legacy in both senses of the word. 
      </p>
      <h1>Conditions In The Field Of Photography</h1>
      <p>Today, the number of museums and galleries exhibiting 
          photography is testimony to the medium's broad acceptance within 
          the art museum and visual arts fields. However, the very incorporation 
          of photography within the institutionalized art world has, in some ways, 
          limited general understanding of the unique nature of the medium. Photography 
          as a medium can participate in many fields of study simultaneously. 
          While an image can be understood to be an exemplary piece of artwork 
          made by a noted photographer, it can also be seen as an agent of social 
          change, or as a document that records a cultural or historical phenomenon, 
          or as a tool for scientific, historical, or educational research. This 
          is a level of complexity rarely claimed by other means of visual expression. 
          The various strata of meanings present a challenge to all custodians 
          of photographic collections. Reflecting both institutions' mission 
          to advance the understanding of photography and to promote scholarly 
          research and recreational inquiry into photography, the alliance is 
          well-suited to employ information science and new database tools to 
        help meet this challenge. </p>
      <p>To truly exploit the value of photography collections 
          for this expanded research agenda requires yet another level of institutional 
          commitment. Over the past four years, ICP and GEH have dedicated themselves 
          to establishing good internal collection management standards, while 
          installing a solid information infrastructure and accessible Web site 
          to disseminate collection information.  As intended, the development 
          of collection-based information will lend itself to a shared field-centric 
          structure which features distributed search and retrieval through both 
          collections via the <a
href="http://www.photomuse.org/">www.photomuse.org</a> Web site. While it is a 
          descriptive and cataloguing problem to bring new layers of information 
          to better understand a single collection, it is a very different priority 
          to work to support the larger field of knowledge. Herein lies the challenge 
          to the partners' multi-institutional plan and the area of greatest 
        potential change throughout the museum and photography fields.  </p>
      <p>Museums, by their very nature, are often institutional 
          versions of the very artists they exhibit: possessing a level of institutional 
          ego which emphasizes the singular museum above others. This self-service 
          may be a consequence of the competitive nature of the business, but 
          this process can ultimately be a disservice to the field that the museum 
          purports to serve. As collection-centric organizations, museums rarely 
          follow a cooperative field-centric model, supported by a consortium 
          of institutions, which could bring a richer range of resources to the 
          public. The partners hope not only to promote the ICP-GEH alliance as 
          a model for integrated information systems, but also to encourage other 
          institutions to share and participate within this framework, thereby 
        supporting and emphasizing the field-centric model.</p>
      <p>Unlike other art forms, photography is uniquely suited 
          to being represented in digital media and within a distributed query 
          mechanism.  While many photographs at ICP and Eastman House are fine 
          art works which need to be experienced as elegant prints, others exist 
          only as film or glass plate negatives.  Here the transformation of the 
          negative image into a high resolution digital image file has helped 
          rescue the image from obscurity and given it a new life performing two 
          functions: preservation and access. There is also the recognition that 
          photographic works often exist in many variants. Photographers will 
          revisit their work over time and print very different renderings from 
          the same negative.  A photograph by Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, W. Eugene 
          Smith, or Bernice Abbott will look very different from original vintage 
          prints, to renderings made by the photographer decades later. For these 
          many reasons, a distributed query mechanism across institutions will 
          allow for discovery of new work and also comparison of similar works 
          created over time. While museums of photography generally collect artifacts, 
          be it a fine art print by Cindy Sherman or a daguerreotype by Southworth 
          and Hawes, museums will have to contend with work that is born digital. 
          Today we might collect a fine archival print made on an Epson 2200 printer, 
          but in the future that photographer or her estate might offer an archive 
        to a museum in the form of digital image files. </p>
      <p>Institutions have employed various methods to share 
          and collate databases about object collections. Historically there is 
          the <i>catalogue raisonné</i>, which is dependent not upon any special 
          technological tool but only on the resolute hard work of a scholar seeking 
          out all instances of an artist's work among public and private 
          collections. There are concerted efforts among consortia of institutions 
          in the form of union lists, which are also often dependent upon a central 
          editor/publisher and a lot of individual gumshoe work.  Within advanced 
          technology there are hierarchical efforts such as AMICO (Art Museum 
          Image Consortium) where organizations contribute to a central repository 
          of both data and images. To simplify integration, that data is provided 
          in strict fields and the images in specific formats. As a subscription 
          model, AMICO's users are higher education institutions, allowing 
          for controlled access and carefully maintaining copyright or proprietary 
          rights. This model brings back revenue to AMICO and then to the participating 
          collections over time &#8211; an excellent community model, but very 
          complex; thus it has been hard to grow within the current economy. The 
          next exciting centralized model, also with education as the target audience, 
          is ArtStor from the Mellon Foundation. ArtStor takes a much broader 
          view of the image to go beyond a representation of an artifact with 
          secondary material such as large-lot slide collections used in art history 
        curricula. </p>
      <p>All of these methods require highly structured central 
          repositories of information and images. AMICO and ArtStor have shown 
          great promise partly due to their structure and goal of servicing a 
          known audience of scholars and students. This is well suited to art 
          historical research and classroom presentation on university campuses. 
          While George Eastman House was a charter member of AMICO and an avid 
          contributor, there was the recognition that not all photographs are 
          limited to art historical analysis. Photographs participate in many 
          histories, ranging from social to cultural, technological, political, 
          regional, and local history. ICP and George Eastman House also realized 
          that our audience is beyond the academic researcher or the student in 
          an art history class. We view the "recreational scholar" 
        as both a consumer and potential contributor to the history of photography. 
        For these many reasons, a third way was needed - one between the individual 
        museum repository accessible on the Web and the large-scale hierarchical 
        database delivered by a central authority. </p>
      <p>The model of the Internet itself is not a hierarchical 
          structure but one with many nodes and self-mending routes from machine 
          to machine. After all, the basic concept of the Arpanet - the original 
          defense department "internet" from 1969 and into the 1970s 
          - was intended to survive a nuclear attack by allowing nodes to continue 
          to communicate when one is down. In the 1980s and 90s, there were many 
          models for sharing information among computers, including WAIS (wide 
          area information server), Gopher hypertext server from University of 
          Michigan, the library machine query protocol (Z39.50), and, of course, 
        the Web. </p>
      <p>The most spirited form of a sharing protocol is Napster, 
          starting in 1999. Despite the lawsuits by the Recording Industry Association 
          of America (RIAA), they cannot put the genie fully back into the bottle. 
          The success of iTunes suggests that many people are quite willing to 
          pay a reasonable fee for a good product, but Napster epitomized the 
          basic concept of file sharing and demonstrated the degree to which a 
          loose amorphous community can be formed using networked systems. This 
          concept employs a central server to point to content on a myriad of 
        large and small computer nodes operating on a peer-to-peer level. </p>
      <p>Gnutella is a more generic and pure peer-to-peer 
          (P2P) file sharing protocol. Gnutella combines client and server functions 
          into one program (sometimes called "servent" for SERVer 
        and cliENT). </p>
      <p>Of course, intellectual property issues abound on 
          the subject of peer-to-peer file sharing. The great debate is where 
          to place the responsibility and liability. The central issue for museums 
          interested in forming distributed query collaboration or more informal 
          circles of common interest is that each institution will still be responsible 
          for properly representing control over copyrighted works in its collection. 
          They can always just choose to share the text citation for the work 
        and not an image.</p>
      <p>While a P2P system returns to the spirit of the early 
          Internet, it also presents a cacophony of voices and chaos of information. 
          A third way for museum collections combines the authority of the individual 
          archive with the centralized services to assist in discovery and retrieval. 
          The project that the International Center of Photography and George 
          Eastman House is conducting with Gallery Systems provides authority 
        without authoritarianism. </p>
      <h1>Distributed Query System: Plans</h1>
      <p class=listwithnumbers>The Museum System (TMS) from Gallery Systems 
          is one of the most widely used integrated collection management systems. 
          It is based on an SQL engine, generally Microsoft SQL server, but it 
          also runs on Oracle. It is a rigorous and complex program. While some 
          have criticized it for offering a one-size fits-all approach, the standardization 
          of most fields was an asset for ICP and George Eastman House. There 
          are still many user-defined fields, but knowing that the core information 
          is in largely the same place facilitates sharing database information 
        between the two museums. At the outset we planned a four-phase project:</p>
        <ol>
        <li> 
          Set-up: Install and implement TMS (GEH migrated 
            over 140,000 records with images, ICP transcribed an initial 3,500 
            records from index cards and began original cataloguing and imaging 
            in 2001. ICP now has about 25,000 records linked to images). </li>
        <li> 
          Local Web Access: Install Web access to each 
            museum's databases independently (ICP and GEH licensed Gallery 
            Systems' <i>eMuseum</i> server at the end of 2003). </li>
        <li> 
          Cross-collection sharing: install distributed 
            query mechanism employing Gallery Systems' "central server" 
            and individual "nodes."</li>
        <li> 
          Cross-domain sharing: Link retrieved records 
            to rich tangential data including extended biographical records, chronologies, 
            and bibliographies. Invite scholars and classes in the history of 
            photography to contribute to these extended records via Web services. 
            This next level will also include calls to a library OPAC like the 
            Voyager system. </li>
      </ol>
       
        <p>This project is individually and collectively funded 
          by grants from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), 
          the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and the support of Trustees 
          and individuals at both museums. </p>
        <h1>Use of Standards</h1>
        <p>While ICP and GEH decided to license The Museum System 
          (TMS) as part of our long-term strategy, Gallery Systems realized they 
          could not assume that in a distributed query mechanism, all participants 
          would be running TMS. It would be delightful for their bottom line, 
          but not realistic. For this reason the company adopted a more open system 
          that fits well with the goals of ICP and GEH to create an enhanced distributed 
          query mechanism for the <a
href="http://www.photomuse.org/">www.photomuse.org</a> Web host. While TMS itself 
          is written in Visual Basic and runs on Microsoft Windows operating system, 
          the distributed query Central Server and individual nodes are Java applications. 
          This allows the query nodes to run on many different hardware configurations 
          with a number of operating systems. A field mapping strategy allows 
          the distributed query node to communicate with a home database also 
          running software applications including, but not limited to, TMS. </p>
        <p>Gallery Systems prototype is code-named "Latitude." 
          It employs several standardized software components:</p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li> 
          Web services, http host</li>
        <li> 
          Extensible Markup Language (XML)</li>
        <li> 
          Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)</li>
        <li> 
          Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)</li>
        <li> 
           Application programming in Java as stated 
            above</li>
      </ul>
       
        <h1>The Procedures For Implementing This Server-Node Model</h1>
      <ol class="listwithbullets">
        <li>
          Each museum's 
            TMS database is fully protected. The data is copied from the core 
            Collection Management tables to a separate server running Microsoft's 
            SQL Server, a Web server, and the Gallery Systems application <i>eMuseum</i>. 
            This allows each museum to host its own database with its own branding. 
            These data tables then also become a node in the distributed query 
            system, thereby performing two functions. As more data and images 
            are entered into the protected collection management system, the content 
            is copied over to the online server. A firewall protects these two 
            different Ethernet networks at both the International Center of Photography 
            and the George Eastman House. Both organizations are served by T1 
            lines for Internet access. </li>
        <li>
          To reduce 
            load on the local T1, ICP plans to host the collection images on an 
            offsite Web host (Verio.net). In this way, only database queries and 
            html text responses will be passed from the local icp.org host. Eastman 
            House may employ this procedure in the future. </li>
        <li>
          The java 
            application supporting the local node in the distributed query procedure 
            is mounted on the same server as <i>eMuseum</i>. </li>
        <li>
          The distributed 
            query broker, or Central Server, will initially be mounted at Gallery 
            Systems during the early phase (March &#8211; July, 2004), then at 
            ICP on a third server starting in the Fall 2004. Gallery Systems refers 
            to participants in a distributed query group as a "collection 
            circle." </li>
        <li>
          To progress 
            to next level of the project, a cross-domain distributed query mechanism 
            will be introduced. Tangential tables will be added, functioning as 
            an additional node (either at ICP, GEH or both). The content will 
            be a chronology of the history of photography, extended biographies 
            from the long-term GEH research projects (that started on the VAX 
            in the 1980s), and additional "information collections" 
            that might be acquired by the two museums. </li>
        <li>
          An aspect 
            of the cross-domain query will include bringing in expertise from 
            outside of the two museums. </li>
      </ol>

        <h1>Information Collections</h1>
        <p>Most collection management databases offer the salient 
          information about the catalogued object. Some also have provisions for 
          more extended text (wall label), bibliography, etc. To give the photographic 
          objects within the ICP and GEH collections greater context, the two 
          museums plan to develop "information collections." These 
          collections will afford the Web visitor an opportunity to understand 
          the object in a larger context or to conduct research across very different 
          disciplines. One example is the large repository of biographical information 
          at the George Eastman House. This data was compiled initially for their 
          own collection, then later to support work on the <i>Index to American 
          Photographic Collections</i> (1982, 1990, 1998). This information could 
          become part of a series of tangential tables related to the core database 
          and retrieved as part of a distributed query. Another example is a chronology 
          of the history of photography prepared by ICP as part of the original 
          prototype for <a href="http://www.photomuse.org/">www.photomuse.org</a>. 
          This chronology will be an information collection and a separate node 
          in the distributed query database. </p>
        <p class="caption"><a href="earleFig2.html"><img src="earle_illus_2-t.gif" alt="A query routed to both instituitons" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a></p>
        <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2"></a>Figure 2: Chart, ICP and GEH together using cross-collection 
        distributed query</p>
        <h1>Users as Authors</h1>
        <p>To develop these information collections, colleagues 
          in photography museums and teachers of the history of photography will 
          be invited to participate. Areas of research will be divided among participants. 
          For example, a class in the history of photography at the University 
          of New Mexico might be asked to conduct chronological research on the 
          period 1880 to 1899, two decades. The chronology is a series of structured 
          tables so it will be a simple task to organize the research accordingly. 
          Using fill-out Web forms, the classes will upload chronological submissions. 
          These will be reviewed, edited and then added to the live database if 
          appropriate. This will also allow the project to expand the chronology 
          to other nations using a similar approach. For example, a group in the 
          Netherlands might be asked to submit information on milestones in the 
          history of photography in the Low Countries. While our initial work 
          will be only in English, we are preparing the tables to accept text 
          in Unicode format to accommodate other languages. (This also brings 
          up complex questions about future search strategies). </p>
        <p class="caption"><a href="earleFig3.html"><img src="earle_illus3-t.gif" alt="other contribute " width="400" height="300" border="0"></a></p>
        <p class=MsoCaption><a name="Fig3"></a>Figure 3: Chart, ICP and GEH showing "authoring" 
          by outside parties with permission.</p>
        <p>The International Center of Photography and George 
          Eastman House also plan to collect and help refine existing information 
          collections. For example, there are several large-scale bibliography 
          projects that have been developed by private individuals. We hope to 
          be able to reward this hard work through selective acquisitions (or 
          licensing). These larger long-term aspects will require additional fundraising, 
          but we hope that offering these services to the larger field of photographic 
          research will lead to outside support. </p>
        <h1>Where It's Headed: Texts and Contexts</h1>
        <p>Given the prevalence of Napster, Gnutella, and Grokster 
          among young people growing up in a computer culture, in the future it 
          will be expected that museums offer services that create extended communities 
          of interest. One way is to move beyond a "collection centric" 
          approach to a "field centric" model for understanding artifacts 
          in context. </p>
        <p>We also need to move students from a reliance on 
          &quot;Googling,&quot; which will only expose material within a statistical 
          arc, to more studious means of research that brings them closer to "getting 
          dusty" in a library. Collaborative Distributed Query mechanisms, 
          linked not only to objects but also to rich affiliated primary documents 
          and secondary contextual sources, will give both researchers and the 
          &quot;recreational scholar&quot; a closer approximation of the surprising 
          discoveries afforded by getting lost in the stacks.</p>
        <p>Without making a virtue of reporting on a decidedly 
          unfinished project, we are operating with the optimistic assumption 
          that we will continue to encounter new applications for information 
          tools conceived originally as merely collection management catalogues. 
          We view distributed query as but one of several initial steps in the 
          transformation of what is fundamentally an inventory control system, 
          albeit digitally enhanced for museums. Photography archives may present 
          exceptional opportunities for their custodians who have come to understand 
          that their images contain significantly more than has been described 
          or referenced in their catalogue.  Specifically, photographic meaning 
          and content are proving to be resistant to terms of classification. 
          Especially problematic would be terms that could enable retrieval by 
          users untutored in the specifics of a collection's structure, 
          a photographer's oeuvre, or the historical/social contexts from 
          which particular images may have been derived. Populating the subject 
          fields in photography data records presents an especially confounding 
          problem. A controlled vocabulary of descriptors for a medium that continues 
          to map the entire visible universe is a conundrum - even if we assume 
          a single language and an infinite labor pool for data entry.</p>
        <p>But the fact remains that searches among photography 
          archives, especially those that increasingly derive from inter-collection 
          search strategies, will target what we generally think of as subject 
          matter. Anticipating the increasing demand for subject-related search 
          results born of the virtual merging of photography archival data, we 
          are looking beyond the subject field as an organizing principle for 
          the grouping of images. Is it possible that a solution to the conundrum 
          of subject searching in photography archives may rest in directly mapping 
          relationships among images and between images and texts? </p>
        <p>For the moment, forget about naming the subject, 
          and look instead to the less precise but less demanding process of affiliating 
          photographs by using texts, of any kind, that that have the capacity 
          to link one image to another. Such texts, existing outside the image 
          object record, might be an exhibition checklist, a list of images licensed 
          for a particular publication, an essay referencing collection images, 
          or any other document that could be marked up in ways that could be 
          used to obtain an image. It would even be possible to employ the "activity" 
          of individual images in a collection to generate useful affiliations 
          for browsers of the archives. There is a kind of automatic authority 
          in the taxonomically dumb, yet statistically powerful, merchandizing 
          engine used by Amazon.com: "Customers who purchased this book, 
          also purchased&#8230;." </p>
        <p>Implementation of affiliations, such as those hypothesized 
          above, would have the effect of generating multiple overlapping lots. 
          And systems left to the accumulation of automatic links of affiliations 
          could easily introduce data noise into a system that is already rather 
          imprecise. </p>
        <p>With all of the liabilities, the potential utility 
          of affiliation tools remains sufficiently compelling to warrant a more 
          aggressive program to digitally acquire texts relevant to key groups 
          of images. The Alliance of ICP and Eastman House has already begun to 
          photograph and transcribe the correspondence of Daguerreotypists Southworth 
          and Hawes, as a function of the routine preparation of the exhibition 
          treating these important 19<sup>th</sup> Century photographers. As we 
          refine our systems, both institutions plan to incorporate this kind 
          of document capture as a standard function of project development. By 
          taking every opportunity to feed the potential of image affiliation, 
          these two great photography venues will at least be making an investment 
          in expanding access to collections via connections that we may never 
          be able to name.</p>

          organizations. </p>
        <p><b>Distributed Query, cross domain:</b>     <i>domain</i> 
          in the sense of type of collection; for example, a query to a photograph 
          collection for works by Lorna Simpson and a query to a library database 
          for books about Lorna Simpson, and perhaps exhibition texts for an exhibition
