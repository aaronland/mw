          User Evaluation (MOAC II) is a two-year study funded by the Institute 
          of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) that seeks to evaluate the needs 
          and behaviors of four key user constituencies of MOAC: 1) K-12 teachers; 
          2) university students; 3) academics in the humanities and social sciences; 
          and 4) museum professionals, librarians, and archivists, with the goals 
          of generating recommendations for improving the usability and value 
          of MOAC as well as encouraging its use in research and learning contexts.  
          The study seeks to contribute to the continued enhancement of MOAC, 
          first conceived in 1997, a museum/library collaboration that is building 
          aggregated, publicly accessible collections of digitized museum content 
          and their metadata.  This paper first reviews the development of MOAC, 
          with a particular emphasis on the nature of its contents as well as 
          its metadata infrastructure.  It then discusses the triangulated research 
          design that is being applied by the study.</p>

        <h1>I. Building it: Museums and the Online Archive of California (MOAC)</h1>
        <p>MOAC is the museum component of the Online Archive 
          of California (OAC), a Web-based collaborative cultural information 
          resource managed by the California Digital Library (CDL), designed primarily 
          for users engaged in research and learning activities at every level.  
          The OAC comprises over 7,400 on-line finding aids and related digitized 
          primary sources that have been contributed by a diversity of California 
          archives, libraries, and museums.  The primary sources, of which there 
          are over 120,000 digital surrogates and 50,000 pages of transcribed 
          texts, include letters, diaries, manuscripts, legal and financial records, 
          photographs, maps, architectural and engineering records, scientific 
          logbooks, electronic records, sound recordings, moving images, oral 
          histories, artifacts, ephemera, paintings and drawings, sculpture and 
          ceramics, masks, textiles, cultural objects, and artists' books.</p>
        <p>Finding aids provide detailed, highly-structured 
          documentation of the context and contents of selected holdings from 
          the over ninety museums, archives, and libraries participating in the 
          OAC.  A finding aid generally takes a hierarchical approach that begins 
          with an overall collection level description, followed by descriptions 
          of each series or subset or thematic component within the collection, 
          and finally, detailed item level descriptions within each series, as 
          appropriate.  Examples of types of finding aids include collection indexes, 
          inventories, registers, and guides.  MOAC partners create finding aids 
          or collection guides and provide them to the OAC, which delivers them 
          as part of the resources provided by the California Digital Library.</p>
        <p>MOAC was first conceived in 1997, when several California 
          museums, led by the Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive (BAM/PFA), 
          approached the CDL with the idea of forming the MOAC collaboration to 
          build upon the newly developed Online Archive of California by integrating 
          descriptions and digital images of museum collections drawn from partner 
          institutions throughout the state<b>.</b>  Through the support of an 
          Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) National Leadership 
          / Library and Museum Collaboration grant (1999-2002), the MOAC collaboration 
          extended the potential of the OAC in several ways: </p>
      <ol class="listwithnumbers">
        <li> 
          It tested the viability of using Encoded Archival 
            Description (EAD) as a data structure standard for museum objects 
            as well as archival materials; </li>
        <li> 
          The nature of collections of individual museum 
            objects provided a rich basis for examining how well EAD could cope 
            with item as well as collection level description and provide a navigation 
            structure for both; and </li>
        <li> 
          It addressed issues involved with aggregating 
            cultural materials described by museums, with a range of professional 
            and disciplinary perspectives, with cultural materials collected and 
            described by archives and libraries.</li>
      </ol>
       
        <p>As mentioned above, EAD is the data structure standard 
          used to provide the basic metadata infrastructure for all of OAC, including 
          MOAC.  EAD is an Extensible Markup Language / Standard Generalized Markup 
          Language Document Type Definition developed by and for the archival 
          community.  The impetus behind EAD was principally to find a standardized 
          way for archivists to develop finding aids that prior to this were frequently 
          idiosyncratic and in paper form, and then to distribute and integrate 
          them over the Web.  A less overt impetus was a desire to develop an 
          archival descriptive structure that specifically addressed the characteristics 
          of archival materials; in particular, their status as primary sources 
          and their organically collective nature, beyond what was possible using 
          library cataloguing approaches such as MARC.  MOAC's use of EAD 
          to describe collections of museum objects was experimental (and remains 
          so).  With support from IMLS, partners spent the first years of MOAC 
          developing and contributing finding aids or collection guides to the 
          OAC.  This required that, at the outset, partners reach agreement on 
          parameters for representing museum descriptions in EAD: parameters that 
          would be in keeping with practices and guidelines influencing partners 
          in their regular, non-MOAC work, such as cataloguing new acquisitions.</p>
        <p>The Society of American Archivists and the Library 
          of Congress's Network Development / MARC Standards Office are 
          the agencies that are chiefly responsible for the maintenance of EAD.  
          As part of their activities, they have developed a Tag Library of metadata 
          elements and attributes that are included in EAD, together with notes 
          on the definition and scope of each element and attribute and where 
          it may be used in the hierarchical description.  By design, some of 
          these data elements are not highly defined at this point, in order to 
          accommodate a range of institutional practices.  This aspect has allowed 
          MOAC partners to develop rules and guidelines for how certain data elements 
          can be used in order to reflect museums' specialized descriptive 
          practices and anticipated use of the materials they are contributing 
          to the OAC.  While this approach accommodates what might be different 
          about all or any museums' descriptive practices and holdings, 
          it still facilitates the aggregation of museum and archival material 
          in OAC because of the use of a common metadata structure (White, 2002).  
          The resulting <i>MOAC EAD Guidelines</i> are based on the OAC's <i>EAD 
          Retrospective Conversion Guidelines</i>.  Because EAD is a data structure 
          standard and not a data content standard, MOAC partners have also drawn 
          upon relevant content standards such as REACH (Record Export for Art 
          and Cultural Heritage) and the Categories for the Description of Works 
          of Art.</p>
        <p>Participation in MOAC is only one response, however, 
          on the part of its partners to external expectations that digitized 
          museum content will be available.  Each partner is also engaged in other 
          public access projects and programs related to their permanent collections.  
          No partner could afford, financially or politically, to develop content 
          in such a way that it could be used solely for MOAC.  Partners cull 
          the information they need to include in their finding aids or collection 
          guides from their local information systems.  In other words, they export 
          to EAD the descriptive, administrative, and technical metadata specified 
          by the MOAC project.  In developing MOAC, the museum partners did not 
          test EAD to see whether it could play a role in primary object cataloguing, 
          documentation, or management, since the metadata necessary to sustain 
          these activities is much more complex and layered than that contributed 
          to the OAC.</p>
        <p>For MOAC, partners are assisted in the production 
          phase by digitization management tools developed in part to automate 
          conversion of metadata to the targeted EAD format.  Several museum partners, 
          for example, use a digital assets management database first developed 
          by the Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive (BAM/PFA) to produce 
          EAD collection guides (Waibel, 2000).  The tool makes it easy for partners 
          to export collection and object data to OAC-compliant EAD.  MOAC partners 
          also implemented the Making of America 2 (MOA2) standard and are preparing 
          to implement the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) 
          in order to present structured records for objects having more than 
          one image; such as portfolios, scrolls, and artists' books (Rinehart, 
          2001).</p>
        <p>The hierarchical design of EAD reflects the archival 
          practice of organizing holdings into broader to narrower arrangements 
          - that is, into collection (or other type of aggregation), series, and 
          item level components.  Similarly, MOAC collection guides may follow 
          the museum practice of placing objects into meaningful collective arrangements.  
          Unlike archival aggregations, however, which are dynamic to the extent 
          that they may either be weeded or continue to accumulate over time but 
          which never fundamentally shift from their intellectual arrangement 
          according to provenance, museums move objects in and out of arrangements 
          based on curatorial or programming interests, as evidenced by some collection 
          guides contributed by partners to the OAC.  For example, the Grunwald 
          Center for the Graphic Arts's <i>Guide to Old Master Prints</i> 
          describes a selection of prints dating from 1500-1800, arranged by artist, 
          nationality and period.  The Center acquired these prints from different 
          donors and print dealers over many years; the prints in this collection 
          do not share a common provenance.  EAD makes it difficult, if not impossible, 
          for individual objects such as these prints to live in more than one 
          collection at a time - which may be a limitation for museums, given 
          the ephemeral nature of museum contexts.  Museums certainly acquire 
          self-contained collections that may be described in an intellectual 
          arrangement based on provenance: for example, BAM/PFA's <i>Guide 
          to the Theresa Hak Kyung Cha Collection</i> is a collection guide which 
          describes a large, single collection of mixed media by Cha, a conceptual 
          artist.</p>
        <p>In early 2003, the OAC launched a content management 
          system (CMS) for searching and displaying METS digital objects, independent 
          of finding aids.  Prior to release of the CMS, images and texts - METS 
          digital objects - were accessible solely through browsing or searching 
          the finding aid.  Implementation of EAD and METS prepares the way for 
          users not only to search within a single finding aid and across the 
          entire collection of finding aids, but also to search within the OAC's 
          collection of METS digital objects (Fig. 1).  Initially, testing EAD 
          as a standard for representing museum collections on the Web was one 
          interest of MOAC partners.  Contributing finding aids or collection 
          guides to the OAC to be aggregated with other digitized content was 
          another interest.  Most partners assumed users would find such centralized 
          access to library, archival, and museum content to be efficient or useful.</p>

        <p>As the project progressed, partners opened a point 
          of access directly to MOAC digitized content from the project Web site, 
          hosted by BAM/PFA.  Prior to Fall 2003 the MOAC Web site only presented 
          MOAC finding aids or collection guides in the common interface used 
          by the OAC.  In October, 2003, MOAC was the testbed for CDL's 
          new access integration toolkit, developed to provide users with customized 
          access to the METS digital object repository.  The underlying content 
          contributed by partners to the OAC remains the same and is still delivered 
          via the CDL.  Using the access integration toolkit, the MOAC Web site, 
          however, now presents METS objects in a MOAC stylesheet, removed from 
          their respective MOAC EAD collection guides.  In essence, the MOAC Website 
          presents a snapshot of MOAC digitized content.  Employing the access 
          integration toolkit, the MOAC stylesheet uses a specific query syntax 
          to structure a search of the CDL's METS digital object repository.  
          Users starting searches from the MOAC Web site must link to the OAC 
          if they wish to view the related EAD collection guides or search across 
          the entire collection of finding aids.  In implementing the MOAC stylesheet, 
          partners expressed an interest in providing multiple ways for users 
          to get at their content.  The OAC supports discovery of museum content 
          within the context of diverse institution types, while MOAC provides 
          a Website rich in images, object-centric, and museum focused.</p>
        <h1>II: Using it: MOAC II User Evaluation</h1>
        <p>As described above, MOAC partners select collections 
          and objects, prepare object descriptions and digital images, and package 
          that into EAD collection guides and METS digital objects for contribution 
          to the OAC, where they can be searched and also aggregated with digitized 
          content from other libraries, archives, and museums.  However, we are 
          very interested in knowing whether the current structure and content 
          of MOAC are the most effective for use by our intended audiences, and, 
          even more importantly, perhaps, whether those audiences find the material 
          we have selected for inclusion to be interesting and of use.  With funds 
          from a second IMLS National Leadership grant (2002-2004), MOAC partners 
          are collaborating with researchers from the UCLA Department of Information 
          Studies on a formal evaluation of MOAC - the MOAC II User Evaluation.  
          The goals of the study include the following:</p>
      <ul class="listwithnumbers">
        <li> 
           Conducting, analyzing, and documenting a 
            formal evaluation of targeted MOAC user groups;</li>
        <li> 
           Integrating what is learned from this evaluation 
            into routine production and distribution activities;</li>
        <li> 
           Developing strategies to encourage the application 
            of cultural resources such as MOAC in research and learning activities;</li>
        <li> 
           Recommending strategies to the California 
            Digital Library for enhancing both MOAC and OAC; and,</li>
        <li> 
           Recommending strategies to the museum, library, 
            and archival communities for improving the value and use of their 
            on-line resources, particularly in research and learning activities.</li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>It is hoped that this evaluation will help MOAC partners 
          understand which content and design decisions result in more, and more 
          effective, use; and where improvements in content, presentation, and 
          delivery might be made.  Such improvements might include tying selection 
          of content more closely to particular subjects, themes, or curricular 
          requirements; and tailoring descriptive metadata and also the presentation 
          of collections and associated digital objects to different user needs 
          and tasks: for example, through implementing task or community-specific 
          navigation and retrieval mechanisms, as well as presentation, searching, 
          and navigating interfaces.</p>
        <h1>III. Research design</h1>
        <p>Relatively little evaluative work has been done to 
          date on access to and use of museum digital content by researchers, 
          teachers, and learners, let alone on issues associated with aggregating 
          museum content with library and archive content.  Bennett et al. (2002) 
          report on the Digital Cultural Heritage Community Project, which built 
          and tested an electronic database of historical information collected 
          from participating museums, libraries, and archives and based in part 
          around curricular requirements, then tested its efficacy as an educational 
          resource in upper elementary school classrooms in three schools in Illinois.  
          The recommendations of this project, considerably smaller in scope than 
          that of MOAC II, included the following: </p>
      <ul class="listwithnumbers">
        <li> 
           link digitized content to curricular standards: 
            this was judged to be very valuable by teachers; </li>
        <li> 
           ensure the robustness of the database; </li>
        <li> 
           concentrate more on enabling teachers to 
            utilize images and metadata off-line in the classroom and for assignments, 
            and on high-quality, rather than high-quantity resources;</li>
        <li> 
           undertake continuous evaluation of the database 
            use: this is important;</li>
        <li> 
           ensure that information in the database 
            continues to be &#8216;trustworthy.' </li>
      </ul>
       
        <p>Educators assigned a high value to the availability 
          of &#8216;trustworthy' primary source information via the Web 
          (Bennett et al., 2002).  A much larger and longer-term project that 
          has been evaluated from various perspectives for several years is the 
          Perseus Digital Library Project.  Perseus is a digital library on Greco-Roman 
          antiquity that emanated out of humanities scholarship.  One focus of 
          that project is on how different types of digital objects, published, 
          unpublished, and artifactual, can interact with each other.  Crane et 
          al. (2001), based upon their experience with Perseus, argue that well-structured 
          information objects and an understanding of the nature of humanities 
          research are key factors in building complex digital resources of heterogeneous 
          cultural objects and in addressing item versus collection issues. MOAC 
          II will contribute to these areas of research and generate benchmark 
          data upon which future evaluations may draw.</p>
        <p>Because there are both scope and temporal dynamics 
          that need to be addressed in this study, as well as complex potential 
          interactions between some of the variables under examination by MOAC 
          II, the evaluation has multiple facets.  MOAC and OAC are not artificial 
          test databases; they are live resources which continue to evolve - as 
          Web-accessible resources do - with changes being made to the interface 
          and new or revised content added regularly.  There is not just a single 
          entry point into MOAC - it can be accessed from two locations on the 
          Web (MOAC and OAC).  Each point of access has a distinct style or look; 
          one point offers a broader, contextualized approach (in the EAD collection 
          guides on the OAC), while the other offers a more limited but object-centric 
          approach (using the METS digital objects on the MOAC Web site).  For 
          the MOAC II study, therefore, we are gathering and triangulating both 
          quantitative and qualitative data from several different sources.  Our 
          goal is to obtain a better overall idea of the complexity of issues 
          associated with providing on-line access to museum content in general, 
          as well as to be able to tease apart aspects that relate to the design 
          of MOAC in particular.  This triangulated approach is similar to one 
          successfully employed in the Online Archive of California Evaluation 
          Project (Gilliland-Swetland, 1998).</p>
        <p>MOAC partners want to encourage sustained use of 
          physical objects and their digital surrogates in research and education.  
          Therefore, MOAC II collaborators are examining the needs and behaviors 
          of four key constituencies of MOAC: K-12 teachers, university students, 
          academics in the humanities and social sciences, and museum professionals, 
          librarians, and archivists.  The first three of these groups represent 
          constituencies for whom it has been assumed a resource such as MOAC 
          would be useful.  The fourth group, professionals working in repositories 
          of cultural materials, are often an invisible constituency in the design 
          of on-line resources such as MOAC.  However, they function on the front 
          line in terms of activities such as reference and educational programming 
          and other mediation activities between users and constituencies drawing 
          upon those resources.</p>
        <p>We expect the evaluation to elicit broad issues of 
          concern associated with providing on-line access to cultural content, 
          as well as detailed information about the relevance of MOAC to users, 
          especially in terms of how they might want to use descriptions and images 
          in their work, and the effectiveness of the on-line display and navigability 
          aspects of the OAC and MOAC Web sites.  The following research questions, 
          therefore, are guiding the evaluation of MOAC:</p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li> 
           Why do users use MOAC and how do they use 
            what they retrieve?  In what ways does this vary across different 
            user constituencies and disciplines?</li>
        <li> 
           What do users need to understand about the 
            nature of museum objects as information resources and to what extent 
            does MOAC support and enhance that understanding through both description 
            and presentation?</li>
        <li> 
           In what ways can MOAC be used to enhance 
            classroom teaching at K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels?</li>
        <li> 
           Do the existing structure, representation, 
            and presentation of MOAC privilege certain users, needs, or search 
            strategies over others?  If so, which ones, and in what way?</li>
        <li> 
           Do user search strategies focus on MOAC, 
            or do they extend across all of OAC and other CDL resources?</li>
        <li> 
           What types of search strategies are users 
            attempting, and how successful are they?  To what extent can failure 
            be attributed to user error or system failure?</li>
        <li> 
           What instruction do users need in order 
            to be able to maximize successful use of MOAC, and how should this 
            instruction be best provided (e.g., on-line, in the classroom, in 
            repositories)?</li>
      </ul>
       
        <h1>IV. Data sources</h1>
        <p>MOAC II data sources comprise transaction logs, pre-existing 
          use data, feedback forms, high-level questionnaires, and in-depth interviews 
          with participants (discussed below in further depth).  We are developing 
          the research instruments in phases because we expect data collected 
          in the first phase of user evaluation &mdash; for example, using high-level 
          questionnaires &mdash; will affect task-oriented instruments used for 
          the second phase of evaluation &mdash; the in-depth interviews with 
          participants.  Once gathered, data will be analyzed in light of the 
          goals and research questions guiding this study.</p>
        <p>The Website for the MOAC II study has three main 
          functions: 1) to communicate information about MOAC II to any interested 
          parties; 2) to provide a restricted, collaborative research space for 
          the research team; and 3) to serve as a data gathering tool.  The latter, 
          for example, includes making questionnaires available on-line to evaluation 
          participants and collecting the data submitted by questionnaire respondents.</p>
        <h2>a. Transaction logs</h2>
        <p>Existing transaction logs, which generally yield 
          quantitative data at a fairly generic level, will be re-instrumented 
          by the research team in an attempt to capture more specific data about 
          the volume and geographic spread of traffic on the two Web sites.  We 
          will use transaction logs for the MOAC Web site hosted by BAM/PFA to 
          collect data for users starting inquiries there; we will also examine 
          transaction logs for the OAC, in order first to track users starting 
          at the OAC Web site, and then to track MOAC users directly.  We expect 
          transaction logs to provide data about how people get to MOAC content, 
          what kind of session trajectories they make when inside the sites, and 
          where people go on the Web, after leaving MOAC.</p>
        <p>We will not seek to identify individual users through 
          the transaction logs; rather, we will investigate activities at the 
          broad user level.  We are not concerned about whether one or many individuals 
          are logging in from the same IP address, but are interested in identifying 
          gross patterns that occur from within the same domain: for example, 
          the volume, peak hours of use, and use patterns of users at an IP address, 
          especially if we know that the address corresponds with a school or 
          university site.  We may be interested to know how much traffic is coming 
          from the K-12 community and at what times (e.g., during the school day 
          or in the evening).  That said, we will use transaction log software 
          to track the individual sessions of participants, in conjunction with 
          in-depth interviews.  Quantitative data from transaction logs will be 
          compared against qualitative data collected in high-level questionnaires 
          and in-depth interviews.</p>
        <h2>b. Pre-existing use data</h2>
        <p>What happens after a user visits the MOAC Web site?  
          Do we know if people are currently using MOAC content in their research 
          and learning activities?  To get a picture of the current usage of MOAC 
          content, we asked museum and library partners to forward any statistical 
          or qualitative pre-existing data relating to use that they have gathered 
          since contributing content to the OAC.  This data might suggest that 
          access to MOAC content has affected use of physical collections (e.g., 
          a change in inquiries about collections or objects may be tied to the 
          implementation of MOAC).  Partners were asked to pass whatever data 
          they had, in whatever form, to the research team, excluding any personally 
          identifiable information on individual users, such as patron or visitor 
          names.</p>
        <p>Responses to this request suggest there may be differences 
          between museums and libraries in their readiness for evaluation.  Most 
          museum partners did not have pre-existing use data readily available, 
          whereas MOAC's library partner had statistical and qualitative 
          data at the ready.  Museum professionals may be less likely to keep 
          track of how patrons discover or learn that the museum owns an object.  
          When such data is collected by museums it may be anecdotal and, even 
          then, it could be difficult to tie the effect of MOAC to inquiries about 
          physical collections because a museum's Web presence may not be 
          limited to MOAC.</p>
        <h2>c. Feedback forms</h2>
        <p>The research team developed a generic feedback form 
          to ensure that anyone and everyone (including those outside the four 
          targeted user constituencies) is given an opportunity to comment on 
          MOAC.  The feedback form is used to collect fairly general information 
          about a person's experience using MOAC.  For example, is there 
          enough content?  Were you able to move around the Web site without getting 
          lost?  Were the results satisfactory?  We anticipate receiving feedback 
          from two extremes: from frustrated users lodging complaints, and from 
          satisfied users extending complements.  Partners plan to continue making 
          the feedback form available after the close of the MOAC II project, 
          as a means of collecting data from users on a regular basis.</p>
        <p>For MOAC II, we provide a passive link to the feedback 
          form on the OAC and MOAC Web sites.  The form is packaged in Websurveyor, 
          the on-line surveying service used by the CDL.  We are also making the 
          feedback form available in hardcopy next to public workstations at OAC 
          repositories.  Few MOAC museum partners, however, have public workstations 
          around which to place copies.  Museums that do have public workstations 
          may use them to provide access to the museum's Web site or its local 
          collection database - not necessarily to provide access to MOAC or the 
          OAC.  Given the limited experience of museum partners in evaluating 
          these kinds of activities, one set of recommendations coming out of 
          MOAC II might be about how to improve the collection and evaluation 
          of use data by museums.  Such data could help museums learn what, if 
          any, impact the availability of the on-line resources in which they 
          are investing (like MOAC) is having upon collections and services.</p>
        <h2>d. High-level questionnaires</h2>
        <p>The feedback form provides one means of collecting 
          information from users about their experiences with MOAC.  We will seek 
          additional, more detailed information from the targeted user constituencies 
          through high-level questionnaires, also administered in Websurveyor.  
          Audience-specific questionnaires have been developed for each group, 
          and selected participants will be directed to the questionnaire appropriate 
          for their group.  From responses to these questionnaires, we are hoping 
          to probe what is important to individuals about Web-accessible resources 
          like MOAC.  For example, is consistent presentation important?  Is breadth 
          and diversity of content important?</p>
        <p>The high-level questionnaires are made available 
          on the MOAC II project Web site to selected evaluation participants 
          via password login.  Participants in this phase, therefore, do not have 
          to travel to the researchers, nor vice versa, and the processes of administering 
          and completing the questionnaire is also likely to be faster.  At some 
          point after the research instruments have been administered, we will 
          make the instruments, including the questionnaires, more widely available 
          (primarily to other researchers).</p>
        <p>Museum and library partners in MOAC II have provided 
          considerable feedback about the research questions and instruments, 
          and their involvement has revealed the importance of collaboration in 
          evaluation.  As practitioners, partners bring an understanding of audiences 
          and content to bear when validating the research methodology - making 
          the methodology applicable for this particular project and community.  
          In developing the questionnaire for the information professionals user 
          group, for example, the research team learned - rather, confirmed - 
          from partners that terminology used by museum professionals differs 
          from that used by library and archive professionals. For instance, the 
          words <i>collection</i> and <i>contex</i>t mean different things to 
          different professions, and the closest approximation of the concept 
          of the <i>finding aid</i> as understood by archivists is, in the museum 
          environment, the collection guide.  As a result, the research team adjusted 
          the language in the questionnaire to match, as nearly as possible, that 
          used by professionals.</p>
        <h2>e. In-depth interviews</h2>
        <p>We plan to invite individuals who have completed 
          a high-level questionnaire to participate further through an in-depth, 
          structured interview lasting approximately two hours.  Interviews will 
          be conducted individually wherever practicable, but the research team 
          may choose to conduct some interviews in small focus groups of participants 
          from the same area: for example, a focus group of high school teachers 
          in Northern California.  Focus groups would be used only in situations 
          where the team may have to travel to an interview site and interviewee 
          availability is limited, or in situations where the team believes participants 
          might be more forthcoming or thoughtful when interviewed in a group 
          setting.</p>
        <p>The interviews will include a &#8216;think-aloud' 
          session, with the research team working one-on-one with individuals 
          in controlled sessions, engaging with MOAC and the OAC.  Individuals 
          will be asked to conduct two on-line searches.  The research team will 
          predetermine one search topic for these sessions. In addition, we will 
          ask individual participants to conduct a second search based on a topic 
          of their choosing.  We are interested in identifying the more successful 
          search strategies (that is, successful in terms of whether participants 
          can find objects and can find information about the objects, as well 
          as which on-line resources they use in searching and how efficiently).  
          Transaction log software will be loaded on local machines and instrumented 
          to capture individual user transactions and to help us learn which content 
          participants are trying to locate and how, and in turn, what tools they 
          need to achieve those objectives.  The controlled &#8216;think aloud' 
          sessions will be videotaped to show what is happening on the monitor 
          and with the participant.</p>
        <p>Because these sessions require much more time from 
          the participant and research team, the number of participants may need 
          to be limited by the team, or may be limited naturally by the number 
          of participants who volunteer to participate.  Research has shown, however, 
          that a small number of participants will uncover the majority of usability 
          issues (Neilson, 2003).  The research team is using non-intrusive data 
          collection methods - transaction logs and the generic feedback form 
          - to balance the difficulties of recruiting and keeping participants.</p>
        <h1> V. Research subjects</h1>
        <p>MOAC content, in the form of EAD collection guides 
          and METS digital objects, might be expected to appeal to educators, 
          students, professionals, and independent researchers - or people with 
          a self- or teacher-motivated interest in cultural materials.  MOAC II 
          partners are examining and comparing the following potentially overlapping 
          or complementary user groups.</p>
        <h2>a. K-12 teachers</h2>
        <p>The research team is identifying teachers from a 
          range of grade levels and curricular subjects in two ways.  First, we 
          are approaching teachers who have participated in two other University 
          of California projects that involved teachers working with primary source 
          materials held by the University.  The first of these projects is the 
          UCLA Institute for Primary Resources, a collaborative project between 
          the UCLA Seeds University Elementary School and UCLA Department of Special 
          Collections.  This project brings Southern California teachers to UCLA 
          to work with special collections and integrate them into their course 
          units.  The second project is the Interactive University Cultural Heritage 
          Pilot Project based at UC Berkeley which has worked with a somewhat 
          smaller group of teachers, introducing them to the Berkeley on-line 
          archival collections.  In general, the research team would like to attract 
          to the study people who have used resources like MOAC in the past as 
          well as people who are new to such projects and tools.  To that end, 
          the team asked staff responsible for educational programming and K-12 
          outreach in each partner institution to identify teachers with whom 
          they have already worked so that we may contact them about participating 
          in the MOAC II study.</p>
        <p>Recruiting teachers may be challenging since they 
          are often overwhelmed with their regular work.  The research team has 
          some funds available to support substitute teachers, during the time 
          teachers are engaged in the research activities.  We will also arrange 
          the in-depth interviews with teachers in locales and at times that best 
          suit the teachers' work schedules.  Museum partners may also be able 
          to offer tours and activities in their museums for students while the 
          teachers are participating in the interviews.</p>
        <p>In building MOAC, museum and library partners confirmed 
          differences in how museums and libraries describe and represent objects. 
           For example, museums and libraries use different vocabularies to describe 
          their objects, and these differences become more apparent when content 
          is aggregated on-line.  Added to this, museum and library partners are 
          aware that scholars may expect descriptions of objects and collections 
          to use scholarly terms, while other users may need non-expert terms 
          that match language or subjects used in textbooks and curricula.  Do 
          the finding aids and collection guides privilege scholars over others?  
          Do people want to bypass the finding aid and go straight to the objects?  
          MOAC partners are interested to know from teachers how a tool such as 
          MOAC can be packaged to make it easy for them to use.</p>
        <h2>b. Students in the humanities and social sciences</h2>
        <p>Methodologically, and because of human subjects' 
          constraints, it is difficult to identify students, especially at the 
          undergraduate level, to participate in research of this kind.  We are 
          identifying students for MOAC II in three ways: </p>
      <ol class="listwithnumbers">
        <li>
          by asking faculty 
            members in whose courses students have previously been enrolled or 
            who have advised masters' or doctoral students using archival 
            resources; </li>
        <li>
          by asking staff 
            in participating OAC repositories to distribute an invitation to participate 
            in the research to any students who fall into the targeted student 
            group;</li>
        <li>
          by a call for 
            participation posted within humanities and social science departments 
            on campuses.  </li>
      </ol>
      
        <p>While we are aware that such methods of selecting 
          students are unlikely to yield a sufficiently large sample to be representative 
          of all possible student uses and needs, we believe that this aspect 
          of the evaluation will nevertheless provide us with valuable insight 
          into how students currently or potentially might integrate MOAC into 
          their school activities and workflow.  It will also provide valuable 
          insight into student search strategies and aspects of MOAC that they 
          might find intriguing, difficult, or frustrating.</p>
        <h2>c. Academics in the humanities and social sciences</h2>
        <p>Although MOAC could be valuable to scholarly users 
          in an almost infinite number of disciplinary areas, it is beyond the 
          scope of this project to carry out such exhaustive evaluation.  Instead, 
          we have chosen to focus on those academics who are likely to constitute 
          the most frequent or substantive users of a resource such as MOAC.  
          Accordingly, we are drawing a systematic sample of faculty across the 
          University of California, in the humanities and social sciences, that 
          represents a range of disciplinary areas.</p>
        <p>Taking a systematic survey requires great effort 
          and, in the end, might not result in a large number of participants.  
          Therefore, the team will identify a second group of faculty through 
          their known use of museum resources in their scholarship and teaching.  
          Museum and library partners have been asked to distribute an invitation 
          to participate in the study to any faculty researchers who fall into 
          the targeted faculty group.  These may be faculty with whom partners 
          are already in contact, such as repeat visitors to a collection.  We 
          may also draw information about the usefulness of MOAC from existing 
          faculty advisory committees at partner institutions: for example, soliciting 
          comments from committee members about when and where MOAC resources 
          might be used in teaching and research.  Depending upon resources and 
          the true timeframe of the MOAC II project, partners may work with faculty 
          to get MOAC content integrated into classroom instruction so that it 
          can be tested in a live setting.</p>
        <h2>d. Museum professionals, librarians, and archivists</h2>
        <p>While professionals are heavy users of on-line resources, 
          it is uncommon for user evaluations to focus on them.  The research 
          team will ask information professionals to identify what about MOAC 
          works and what does not for them and their patrons.  One recommendation 
          coming out of MOAC II might be to find ways to better publicize resources 
          like MOAC.  In preliminary work, we are learning that even professionals, 
          often the intermediaries between resources and patrons, may not know 
          about MOAC.  Part of the difficulty is that MOAC content is not readily 
          apparent on the OAC and CDL Web sites - keeping in mind that those two 
          sites offer a vast amount of content and services.</p>
        <p>We have asked MOAC partners and other contributors 
          to the OAC to identify staff members and colleagues who work in capacities 
          such as reference, education, and collection management.  The names 
          of these staff members will be compiled into a list from which we will 
          draw a systematic sample representing each type of institution.  We 
          will then invite the selected staff to participate in the evaluation 
          of MOAC.</p>
        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>MOAC II is about discovering what needs to happen 
          for access to digitized museum content to be useful, usable, and used.  
          From results of the study, MOAC II partners will develop recommendations 
          for improving on-line resources, particularly for education and research 
          activities.  Museum and library partners will also assess the practicality 
          of integrating what users want into routine production and distribution 
          activities - the implication being that partners will integrate what 
          is learned from evaluation into their regular work.  One other expectation 
          is that the project will make recommendations for best practices regarding 
          how to evaluate the use, usage, and usability of on-line systems like 
          MOAC over time.  While the content evaluated in this project is specific 
          to MOAC and the OAC, the research model and analysis should be of interest 
          to the broader cultural heritage community, especially in planning and 
          implementing public access projects - when <i>using it</i> is equally 
          important as <i>building it</i>.</p>
