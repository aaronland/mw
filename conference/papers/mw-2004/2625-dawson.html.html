<p class="PaperTitle">User Evaluation: Sharing Expertise To Build Shared Values</p>
<p class="Author">David Dawson, ReSource;  Alice Grant, Alice Grant Consulting;  Paul Miller, JISC, UK; John Perkins, Mus-Info, Canada</p>
  <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
  <p class="AbstractText">In January 2003, cultural organizations internationally 
      were invited to submit user evaluations of digital resources for review and 
      analysis by the Cultural Content Forum (CCF).   Established in 2002, the CCF 
      exists to allow organizations with a strategic and/or national involvement 
      in the creation of cultural digital resources to share knowledge and experience 
      in the field.   Over 80 responses were received as a result of the call for 
      submissions; these were initially the subject of a broad-based review as they 
      were catalogued and descriptions of the evaluation projects made accessible 
      on-line to the wider cultural community. Although the scope of the submissions 
      received was not as wide as it might have been, many reports received were 
      of a high standard, meaning that further, detailed analysis was possible. 
      In October 2003, a second stage of research was completed; this explored the 
      potential for proposing common methodologies and user profiles for use in 
      evaluation projects.   </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">This paper describes the research in more detail, identifying 
      key issues arising from the research and proposing a way forward for establishing 
      a shared understanding of best practice for evaluation projects within the 
      digital cultural sector.  </p>
  <p class="keywords">Keywords: user evaluation, user studies, metrics, comparative analysis </p>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>In 2002, the Cultural Content Forum (<a
href="http://www.culturalcontentforum.org/" target="_blank">http://www.culturalcontentforum.org</a>) 
      agreed to undertake research to identify and analyse material relating to 
      the evaluation of digital cultural resources. The project was planned in two 
      stages: the aims were:</p>
  <ul class="listwithbullets">
    <li>To research and publish a catalogue of evaluation undertaken 
          relating to digital cultural information resources.</li>
    <li>To undertake and publish an analysis of available 
          evaluation material. The aims of this analysis would be to:
      <ul>
        <li>identify common indicators and trends relating to the development 
              and use of cultural information resources;</li>
        <li>identify common issues relating to the provision of digital 
            cultural resources;</li>
        <li>identify gaps in available research and propose an evaluation 
            research agenda for the future</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
  <p>In January 2003, a call was issued across the international 
      library, digital library, museum and archive domains using professional e-mail 
      lists. Significant interest in the project was stimulated; many of the contributors 
      of the 86 documents received during the initial stage requested access to 
      the results.</p><p>A dataset documenting the material received was prepared 
      using the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set as a basis for the record structure. 
      Headings were adapted for use to reflect the particular nature of the research, 
      in particular to enable the recording of aspects of the evaluation methodologies 
      used by different projects.</p><p>As a result of this process, the CCF agreed in their meeting 
      in Pistoia in March 2003 to pursue the analysis of the material submitted. 
      Following the production of an initial report outlining the scope and nature 
      of the submissions received, a second general call for evaluation material 
      was made, and key organisations were approached individually. This resulted 
      in a limited amount of additional material to be added to the body of documents 
      already submitted in July and September 2003 for analysis. The CCF commissioned 
      this analysis to address two particular aspects of the evaluation material 
      as follows:</p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li> an assessment of the extent to which common user profiles were 
          used in different evaluation projects and whether these could form the basis 
          of a standardised approach;</li>
        <li> an assessment of any metrics used in evaluation projects which 
          could form the basis for a benchmark for assessing digital resources.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>User Profiles</h2>
  <p>For the purposes of this report, a user profile is a means of categorising 
      and defining a user (or potential user) of a digital resource, using one or 
      more different attributes to do so. The term <b>user profile</b> is frequently 
      used to describe the process by which individuals access and use of specific 
      applications is configured, managed and monitored, particularly in technical 
      terms. This use of the expression does not fall within the remit of this analysis, 
      however. </p>
  <p>Of the 94 documents analysed, 27 (22%) either did not use user profiles, 
      or had no discernible intention to target a specific, named audience group. 
      Many (but not all) of this number were theoretical papers or quantitative 
      analyses of statistics. The remaining 78% of the sample either used a profile 
      or, more often, stated the intended audience for their resource.</p>
  <p>User profiles were used at different stages of the projects described in 
      the material. The following were stages in the process where user profiles 
      were defined prior to the use or evaluation of a resource, and where users 
      were sought to fit the specified profiles:</p>
  <ul class="listwithbullets">
    <li> definition of the scope of a project or resource during the 
          project development process;</li>
    <li> describing and grouping users involved in the formative evaluation 
          process;</li>
    <li> describing and grouping users evaluating a resource after development.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>User profiles were also used to categorise users reactively, in the following 
      ways:</p>
  <ul class="listwithbullets">
    <li> grouping users and non-users consulted in market research;</li>
    <li> categorising users who used or provided feedback on resources.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The user profiles identified can be divided into three general types as follows:</p>
  <ul class="listwithbullets">
    <li>General descriptions of users</li>
    <li>Descriptions of users within the digital and/or cultural sector</li>
    <li>Descriptions of users within individual organisations</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>User profile types</h3>
  <ul class="listwithbullets">
    <li><b>Origin, ethnic or cultural categories</b>
          <ul>
            <li>descriptions of users relating to their cultural background, 
              ethnicity or country of origin.</li>
          </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Visit categories</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Description of whether the user intends to visit or has visited 
              a museum, library or archive, and the use of the resource in relation to that 
              visit (or non- visit).</li>
          </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Formal learners</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Users in some kind of formal education: schools, tertiary education 
              (16-18), further education and higher education.</li>
          </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Informal learners</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Users wishing to develop their personal knowledge either for 
              reasons of leisure or to pursue self-directed learning outside the scope of 
              any formal education organisation.</li>
          </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Socio-economic categories</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Categorisation of users by standard demographics, including 
              age and gender</li>
          </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Work-related categories</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Users whose occupation reflected specific information requirements 
              and modes of use.</li>
          </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Users with special needs</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Users with sensory, physical or learning difficulties which 
              may affect the way in which they are able to use a resource.</li>
          </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Access to ICT</b>
          <ul>
            <li>The way in which users access on-line resources, including technical 
              considerations, availability of hardware and connectivity.</li>
          </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
  <p>A number of problematic issues were identified regarding any common approach 
      to user profiles within the cultural sector. These included the following 
      significant issues:</p>
  <ul class="listwithbullets">
    <li><b>Granularity of user profiles</b></li>
    <li><b>Identifying and handling multiple profiles</b></li>
    <li><b>Uneven coverage </b></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Proposing a user profile matrix</h3>
  <p>The analysis of the use of user profiles clearly demonstrates the need to 
      record multiple attributes in order to build a full user profile. In order 
      to accommodate this need, it is proposed that a matrix approach should be 
      adopted, whereby a provider might build a detailed user profile by selecting 
      characteristics from more than one of the User profile types</p>
  <h3>Further research </h3>
  <p>A number of issues need to be addressed before there will be agreement on 
      a standard which the wider cultural community feels able to implement. They 
      include the following issues which contributors should be invited to discuss 
      during the consultation outlined above:</p>
  <ul class="listwithbullets">
    <li>terminology used to describe user profiles, including the definition 
          of a user profile (as opposed to the different user attributes which might 
          comprise a full profile) </li>
    <li>the definitions of the more general descriptions, as well as 
          those which appear to be overlapping</li>
    <li>the scope and evenness of coverage of the existing material: 
          unevenness  remains an issue, with little input from some areas of the cultural 
          sector </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Metrics</h2>
  <h3>What are metrics?</h3>
  <p>In the context of the current analysis, <b>metrics</b> refers to ways in 
      which standard measurements can be applied within the methodologies and results 
      of digital resource evaluation. The aim of this stage of the analysis was 
      to identify common approaches to the use of metrics within evaluation exercises 
      and to explore ways in which these approaches could be implemented across 
      the digital cultural sector. The potential end result of this process would 
      be one or more indices which could be applied to evaluations in order to gain 
      an understanding of their comparative performance in relation to other services.</p>
  <h3>Methodologies and metrics used within the evaluation reports</h3>
  <p>A wide range of methodologies was used within the evaluation reports.</p>

  <h2>Issues 
      in the definition and implementation of metrics within evaluation studies 
  </h2>
  <p>Overall, the submissions to the project did not enable firm recommendations 
      to be made on how metrics might be developed for implementation across the 
      sector. The reasons for this are as follows:</p>
  <ul class="listwithbullets">
    <li>many submissions did not cite any methodological information 
          at all;</li>
    <li>of those submissions which contained methodological information, 
          few provided a sufficiently detailed account of the methodologies used in 
          evaluation  to permit its use as the basis for a proposal;</li>
    <li>those which did provide detailed accounts of methodologies, 
          or which proposed methodologies in detail, did so in a highly specific and/or 
          theoretical manner which was inappropriate for consideration as a scheme suitable 
          for t implementation in other organisations. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Areas of Strength</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Market research<br>
      The market research material submitted 
          was specifically focused  it addressed users responses to digital resources; 
          this was not simply one aspect of broader research exercises.</li>
    <li>Task analysis<br>
      A number of projects included task 
          analysis as elements within evaluation projects. These projects were potentially 
          informative in terms of the specification of the activities users were asked 
          to carry out on applications being evaluated. In one instance, highly detailed 
          information was provided about the observation process.</li>
    <li>Observation and/or interview<br>
        It was the number of projects (over 
        40 projects used one or both of these techniques) which demonstrated the extent 
        to which face-to-face and/or one-to-one contact is regarded as a key element 
        in successful evaluation.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Areas of Weakness</h2>
  <p>The following aspects of the evaluation process were under-represented in 
      the evaluation material submitted:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-user surveys<br>
      Very few evaluation projects explored 
          non-users of digital cultural resources. For some providers (e.g. higher education), 
          it could be argued that their core user base is a strong one which is highly 
          motivated to use digital resources. However, for most domains within the cultural 
          sector there would be clear benefits to be gained from developing a greater 
          understanding of the motivations, priorities and interests of its non-users. </li>
    <li>Impact evaluations<br>
      Only one report dealt with the issue 
          of how cultural organisations affected the subsequent actions and activities 
          of users. No report explored the impact specifically of cultural digital resources. 
          The significance of this type of research is that it provides insights into 
          user behaviour and behaviour changes brought about by resources, and this 
          should inform future development.</li>
    <li>Understanding the use of resources within users activities<br>
          Developing a greater understanding 
          of the use of resources within user activities is a specific aspect of impact 
          evaluation which deserves greater attention in evaluation, and which was not 
          explored in any of the reports submitted. There is evidently a paucity of 
          understanding of how users might, for example, incorporate the use of digital 
          resources into a research project, a school homework project or a plan for 
          a real visit to a museum, archive or library. Knowledge about <i>how</i> users use information from digital resources may affect the modes of access 
          to, and presentation of, digital resources.</li>
    </ul>
  <p> The analysis demonstrated that there exists an opportunity to fill a gap 
            by developing guidelines for best practice, since the amount and quality of 
            evaluation, both formative and summative, applied to most projects is inadequate 
            as follows:</p>
  <ul>
        <li> given the investment in digital resources, 
          insufficient investment is made in the evaluation of individual projects;</li>
        <li> where evaluation is undertaken, the scope and nature of the 
            evaluation methods deployed often results in less information being gleaned 
          from the process than should be possible.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Recommendations</h1>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The following are recommendations 
      for addressing evaluation issues which will need to be considered by the digital-cultural 
      community as it prepares to improve and extend the way in which it evaluates 
      its on-line resources.</p>
  <h2><b>Recommendation 1: Promote skills and training</b></h2>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Cultural organisations should promote 
      the development of appropriate skills within existing staff, providing training 
      where necessary.</p>
  <h2><b>Recommendation 2: Promote organizational change</b></h2>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Cultural organizations should take 
      formal account of the need for evaluation when planning and funding digital 
      projects</p>
  <h2><b>Recommendation 3: Raise awareness of evaluation</b></h2>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The CCF should work to raise awareness 
      of the need for evaluation and promote good evaluation practice</p>
  <h2><b>Recommendation 4: Increase openness and sharing of evaluation results</b></h2>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Cultural organizations should be 
      more willing to share their approaches to, and results of, evaluation projects.</p><p>The review has found strong evidence that there is an emerging 
      consensus for the use of common user profiles across the sector, but that 
      the development of any standard profiles should reflect the need for multiple 
      attributes to be assigned to groups of users.</p><p>The analysis of evaluation material found, however, that 
      there is little if any evidence of a common approach to metrics in place at 
      the present time, and that this is unlikely to become a possibility until 
      the sector has reached consensus on the methodologies to be used in evaluation 
      projects and the integration of evaluation results into the project development 
      cycle. </p>
  <p>At its next meeting, the Cultural Content Forum will consider how to address 
      these recommendations, and identify key priorities for future research.</p>
