      <!-- #BeginEditable "Body of Page" --><p class="PaperTitle">Searching For 
    Meaning: Not Just Records</p>
  <p class="Author">Darren Peacock, National Museum 
    of Australia, Derek 
    Ellis, Massive Interactive, and John Doolan, KE Software, Melbourne, Australia</p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
   <p class="AbstractText">The goal of universal on-line access to museum collections 
    has been one of the most alluring and elusive promises of internet and digital 
    technology. Collections information in the form of text-based records, quantitative 
    data and digital images is available on most museum Web Sites, either dynamically 
    generated in response to user queries or in static presentation formats. Typically, 
    this information is provided through a Web interface to a collections information 
    management system.</p>
   <p class="AbstractText">At the National Museum of Australia, we approached the 
    implementation of a new collections information management system as an opportunity 
    to create an engaging Web interface that not only presented the collection, 
    but use contextualized the objects within a broader knowledge base of Australian 
    history using a range of primary and secondary source material. Working with 
    the vendor of our collections system (KE EMu) and a Web development company 
    (Massive Interactive) with expertise in interface design, we developed a browsing 
    tool to make the most of the museum's digital knowledge assets. The interface 
    is designed to build information relationships based on user queries and click 
    pathways and to present the information in a way which encourages further 
    searching. The interface is highly visual and intuitive, supporting a model 
    of serendipitous searching that offers multiple pathways through the relationships 
    of people, places, objects and events that make up the complex weave of social 
    history. </p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>In the great marketplace of information that is the Web, 
    how well are museums doing in finding, supplying and stimulating the market 
    for historical and cultural information? How could we do better? What are 
    the risks if we fail? </p>
  <p>In the early days of the Web, museums provided some of 
    the best content and some of the most compelling reasons to go on-line (Lynch, 
    2002). A decade of digitization and documentation for the Web has created 
    a rich array of cultural and historical information across the museum, library 
    and archive sectors. However, while much of that information is now available 
    via the Web, it is not always true to say that it is readily accessible. 
    By accessible here we mean not just findable, regardless of literacy, disability 
    or bandwidth, but usable and valuable as knowledge, not just information. 
  </p>
  <p>A range of barriers, only some of them technical, impedes 
    the effective flow of knowledge from source to searcher via museum Web sites. 
    Among the most significant is the fact that much of the museum content that 
    can be found remains as raw information, not readily assimilated into knowledge 
    by the user. The value of that information remains a rich but largely untapped 
    seam, notwithstanding advances in database-generated content, search engines 
    and interface design.</p>
  <p>In ten years of museums on-line, we have succeeded in 
    ways previously unimaginable in creating and distributing entertaining and 
    engaging content. Yet there is a greater distance to travel before the possibilities 
    of museum information on the Web can be fully realized. We need to keep imagining 
    how this still-new medium can support our enterprise and to rethink established 
    practices and paradigms which predate the Web and which may sometimes blind 
    us to its potential. </p>
  <p>At the National Museum of Australia we have wrestled with 
    the problem of unlocking the information embedded within and around our collections 
    to create a living on-line knowledge resource. In partnership with our collections 
    management database developer, <i>KE Software,</i> and Web developer, <i>Massive 
    Interactive</i>, we have created a new interface tool, the <i>History Browser</i>, 
    supported by an integrated back end database, to unleash the potential of 
    collections information as a dynamic and engaging knowledge resource for education, 
    entertainment and cultural development. In the process, we have considered 
    a range of issues which are discussed in this paper, including the purpose 
    and use of collection information and user-centred principles for database 
    and interface design.</p>
  <h1>Information and the Business Of Museums</h1>
  <p>The issues we have considered go to the heart of the museum 
    enterprise. If, as we believe, the essential purpose of museums is making 
    sense of history and culture for a diverse range of audiences, the ways we 
    construct and communicate information are critical to our success. The burgeoning 
    demand for information generated by the internet is a crucial challenge to 
    what we do and how we do it.</p>
  <p>Providing information is one thing. Exhibition descriptions, 
    interpretive essays, curriculum support materials, store catalogues and program 
    calendars are all valid and effective uses of the Web, and most museums on-line 
    have now mastered them. Yet the potential of the medium, and museums, suggests 
    we can go much further. Museums, as repositories of information and experts 
    in interpretive practice, are uniquely placed to utilise the potential of 
    the Web to connect, organise and present information. To do so, we need to 
    re-examine how some of our core collecting, interpretive and information management 
    practices can harness the potential of the internet to organise, connect and 
    present information.</p>
  <p>As suggested by John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid in <i>The 
    Social Life of Information (2000), </i>organizations such as museums have 
    a more vital role to play in the on-line world than just publishing information. 
    Far from facing obsolescence in the wake of the information revolution, museums 
    and other intermediaries between users and the incoming tides of on-line information 
    can offer the essential ingredients of sense, meaning and context that make 
    mere information useful and valuable to its on-line consumers. We should 
    see ourselves not just as other information sources but as skilled experts 
    in generating knowledge that is socially valuable and useful. Doing this 
    successfully on-line is the key to the ongoing relevance of our institutions 
    to stakeholders and audiences alike.</p>
  <p>Digital cultural resources are accumulating at a rapid 
    rate; however, our tools for distributing them and making them useful are 
    not keeping pace. In the face of estimates that overall information production 
    is growing at more than 50% per annum, Brown and Duguid observe that 'a critical 
    task ahead will be to stop volume from simply overwhelming value.' This is 
    particularly true for museums and other keepers or creators of digital cultural 
    material.</p>
  <p>Museums, libraries and archives have always been good at 
    creating, sorting and searching information. Over time, as the sheer volume 
    of information increased, creating structures of meaning and tools for navigation 
    has also been our role. Without them, more things, more data, more images 
    or more texts add diminishing value to the pool of information resources. 
    Increasingly, the challenge for museums in the on-line world is to produce 
    not just more digitized materials, but better tools for using them.</p>
  <p>Like many other museums, the National Museum of Australia 
    has been investigating ways to create an efficient, Web-based method to realize 
    the value to the museum's greatest information asset - its collection. What 
    follows is a description of our journey of discovery, with some sideways glances 
    at the experience of others heading in the same direction.</p>
  <h1>Collections As Knowledge Assets</h1>
  <p>Collections are recognized as the principal asset, if not 
    the raison d'tre of our museums, libraries and archives. In the information 
    age, the nature of those assets and our raison d'tre are being transformed. 
    Rethinking our information management practices to realise the value of those 
    assets and their on-line potential is a major challenge for all collecting 
    organizations.</p>
  <p>Traditionally, museum information management has focused 
    on supporting key collections operations: cataloguing, documentation, condition 
    and treatment reporting, movements and curatorial research. Our information 
    systems have been designed primarily to manage our collections as physical 
    assets rather than to manage the information they represent or embody. Information 
    management is what we do in order to do something else, not just simply what 
    we do. In the information age, it may become what we do best. As noted above, 
    museums are organisations uniquely qualified for the task. Moreover, as virtuality 
    contests the primacy of the real, it may be what our publics and stakeholders 
    want from us most of all. </p>
  <p>If we are in the information business, the ways we manage and present information 
    become central rather than incidental to our purpose. The difference between 
    knowledge and information has been discussed since ancient times and remains 
    hotly contested. Seely Brown and Duguid offer three points of distinction 
    between the two that are useful here. First, knowledge 'entails a knower' 
    - it requires a human participant. Secondly, knowledge attaches to the knower: 
    it is assimilated rather than just held. Thirdly, by virtue of the first 
    two, knowledge is more difficult to package and exchange than information. 
    Knowledge has a human dimension defined by intangibles such as context, meaning 
    and value. If museums are in the knowledge business, we need to think not 
    just about the information, but also about the people using it. We need to 
    re-examine the nature of our data and the interfaces that present it as systems 
    for creating meaning, not just disseminating information.</p>
  <h1>On-Line Collections: Early Discussions</h1>
  <p>At this conference seven years ago, Howard Besser (1997) 
    traced the evolution of museum automation in two separate streams, one 'driven 
    by the need for record keeping and inventory control' leading to collection 
    management systems and the other, led by education departments, creating interactive 
    multimedia exhibits based on structured presentations of fixed content. Besser 
    saw the Web as offering a bridge between the rich, deep, but inaccessible 
    information of the collection system and the user-friendly interfaces of the 
    multimedia exhibit. In his paper he foreshadowed the Web as the means of 
    convergence between these two distinct presentation and technology paradigms.</p>
  <p>Also at that conference, in a paper titled The Best of 
    Intentions: Public Access, the Web and the Evolution of Museum Automation, 
    Kevin Donovan (1997) critiqued common approaches to on-line collection access, 
    arguing that merely providing on-line access to collections data was 'set[ting] 
    the bar too low.' Museums and the Web medium were, he contended, capable 
    of much more. </p>
  <p>According to Donovan, at that time,</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">In format and substance museum Web sites resemble object 
    labels and didactic text panels. This approach reproduces the physical museum 
    presentation method; object centric, jargon-filled and segregated into galleries 
    and wings, all of which are unnecessary limitations within the grammar of 
    the World Wide Web.</p>
  <p>In order to realise the potential of the Web, museum information 
    systems would have to 'evolve from object-centric collection management systems 
    to context capable content management systems.' Donovan argued strongly for 
    the importance of context as the key to making object-based information interesting 
    and useful to the non-specialist user. Moreover, he contended that much of 
    the contextual material needed to bring collection objects to life already 
    existed within museums, but was not made available to the Web.</p>
  <p>What both Besser and Donovan were suggesting was that the 
    Web necessitated a reassessment of established ideas about the value of the 
    information we collect and how we present it. Pre-Web representations such 
    as the OPAC, the separate evolutionary paths of different technologies, and 
    a lack of internal co-ordination could all limit our view of the possibilities. 
  </p>
  <p>Nor were they alone in questioning how organisational practices 
    and priorities might need to shift to come to terms with the challenge and 
    potential of the Web. The challenge Besser, Donovan and others 
    (Teather,1998; Bearman and Trant, 1998) posed was how to rethink, within a 
    Web paradigm, the ways museums created, used and presented information, in 
    particular information related to collections. We believe they are still 
    the right questions. Seven years on from the first Museums and the Web conference, 
    we were curious to find out how the answers are progressing.</p>
  <h1>Seven Years On, How Far Have We traveled?</h1>
  <p>To address that question it seemed useful to survey the 
    current state of collections information on museum Web sites. In January 
    2004, we reviewed the Web sites of 100 of those organisations represented 
    at last year's Museums and the Web conference, looking for what was most common 
    in collections presentation, as well as what stood out. The sites included 
    museums, libraries, archives and historical societies from more than ten countries, 
    albeit with a predominance of North American sites. What we were seeking 
    was a sense of how the issues raised seven years ago were being handled. </p>
  <p>First, some overall statistics (see Figure 1 for a full 
    breakdown). The initial observation from the survey is that most museum sites 
    do present their collections in some way. Seventy-eight percent of the sites 
    reviewed included a link to a collections area on their home page. Typically, 
    those that did not were organisations such as science museums that do not 
    have collecting as a key role.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="peacockFig1.html"><img src="peacock.fig1-t.gif" alt="Survey of Capabilities on Museum Home Pages" width="400" height="320" border="0"></a></p>
  <p class=MsoCaption><a name="Fig1"></a>Figure 1: Statistics re Home page links</p>
  <p>Of those seventy-eight sites that did present collections 
    on-line, what is striking is the variation in how it is done. The tools and 
    options available seem to reflect a range of approaches both to information 
    management and to the needs of site users. Clearly, there is no single way 
    to present collections information on-line.</p>
  <p>The diversity of approaches suggests two things: first, 
    that we are still very much in the experimentation stage of finding out how 
    to do this; and secondly, that there is no consensus - and perhaps no definitive 
    research - on what works best.</p>
  <h2>The Cul de Sac and The Open Road</h2>
  <p>Notwithstanding the overall diversity of approach, two 
    presentation techniques predominate: <b>keyword searching</b> and structured 
    <b>highlight tours</b> of featured objects. </p>
  <p>Interestingly, this split echoes the evolutionary divide 
    in approaches to museum automation observed by Besser seven years ago. Keyword 
    searching draws on catalogued records stored in a database. The results are 
    usually presented with little if any elaboration: just the facts. Conversely, 
    the curated highlights approach of <b>tour</b> is more akin to the interactive 
    multimedia piece. It may employ a richer interface, but its scope and content 
    are typically fixed and finite; it is a set piece with predetermined pathways.</p>
  <p>Both types of collections experience require different 
    things of the user and address different user needs. Keyword searching offers 
    the promise of being open ended and driven by the user. The tour, although 
    bounded by its defined scope, promises an authoritative and guided view. 
  </p>
  <p>Both approaches have frustrations and joys for the user. 
    Without further research, it is difficult to evaluate their relative effectiveness. 
    We each may have a personal preference for one or the other approach, or our 
    preferences may be circumstantial, depending on our particular goal. What 
    is interesting to examine is whether the presentation choices we make for 
    collections information are the best possible for our users and for the information 
    that we hold. We need to ask if the presentation models adapted from catalogue, 
    exhibition and tour experiences of the physical museum are making the most 
    of the medium and of our information assets.</p>
  <h2>Highlights Tours</h2>
  <p>Highlights tours may be defined by audience or by classifications 
    of objects: by period, geography, artist or medium. Images predominate in 
    the presentation of highlights tours, shown one at a time, or in a slideshow 
    or lightbox layout. Thumbnails may be clickable through to a full size image 
    and record. </p>
  <p>The amount and style of text varies. Some provide just 
    a selection of fielded data; others provide the equivalent of an exhibition 
    label or brief interpretive essay. The 'voice' of the text is typically the 
    anonymous curator, although some tours have identified guides such as the 
    museum director or the artist. The scope of the tour may vary from a handful 
    of items to hundreds.</p>
  <h2>Getting Beyond The Record</h2>
  <p>Besser noted in 1997 that</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">though few [if any] museums have yet used their collection 
    management information as a database linked to the Web pages of an on-line 
    exhibit, a number of museums have taken the first step in that direction 
    by putting item-level detailed object information into a database and linking 
    that to a Web-based query.</p>
  <p>Today, almost half (47%) of the surveyed museums that are 
    showing their collections on-line are using some sort of database backend 
    to deliver collection content in response to user queries. A little more 
    than half of those sites (54%) offer the type of keyword searching described 
    by Besser to query the collection database. Yet of the sites surveyed, only 
    17 have taken a step beyond to offer search access by means other than keyword. 
  </p>
  <p>Keyword searching originates from the traditions of library 
    catalogues. As an information discovery tool, it is of most use to those with 
    knowledge of a particular discipline and a sense of what lies behind the screen. 
    It assumes that users know what they are searching for and how to find it. 
    Donovan was highly critical of this approach, suggesting that rather than 
    providing access to data, 'the frightful blank search field method' in fact 
    created a barrier between users and information. It remains, however, the 
    dominant method of presenting collections data on-line.</p>
  <p>If nothing else, the Web has educated us all to the joys 
    and frustrations of searching for information. Never have so many searched 
    so often for so much and so frequently with so little success and satisfaction. 
    Despite its frustrations and disappointments, the Web has introduced us to 
    new ways of sorting and locating information and, in the process, developed 
    our searching strategies and skills. The hypertext paradigm of linked information 
    enabled the concept of <i>browsing</i> to develop, traversing information 
    in an open-ended way, perhaps without a particular goal or destination in 
    mind. With the right tools, Web users are increasingly dexterous in navigating 
    information. Moving sideways can be equally as effective as scaling a hierarchy 
    of information. Searching and surfing may alternate as we move from the known 
    to the unknown and back again. </p>
  <p>Database keyword searching still keeps us on the linear 
    path of goal directed searching. The blank search box and the blinking cursor 
    demand a question, preferably one formed - and spelled - within a recognized 
    vocabulary. Typically it delivers a single, tight-lipped response and has 
    to be asked repeatedly and specifically to yield its secrets. The oracle 
    can be ungenerous and does not like to elaborate. To the uninitiated, the 
    keyword search is often barely adequate as a way of finding information. 
    It is totally inadequate as a tool for stimulating knowledge. </p>
  <p>Obviously, the keyword OPAC model is the easiest way for 
    museums to provide one level of access to collections information. Yet, as 
    Donovan suggested, in lowering the bar for ourselves, we may have raised the 
    bar beyond the reach of the general user.</p>
  <p>Even if the blank search field yields a result, in many 
    cases the data within catalogue records is of limited value to the general 
    user. Like a bibliographic record in a library catalogue, many museum collection 
    records are <b>about</b> rather than <b>representative of</b> the object in 
    question. Unlike library records, however, object records have the potential 
    to actually present the object, even animated interactives, through images, 
    video and audio files, either through linked databases or within the same 
    database that stores the fielded text records.</p>
  <p>An important distinction between 'digital collections' 
    and 'digital libraries' that is relevant here has been drawn by Clifford Lynch 
    (2002). Notwithstanding a common confusion between these terms, Lynch points 
    to a clear and significant difference between <em>collections</em> of raw materials and what he calls 
    <i>digital libraries</i> - the systems and interfaces 'that make digital 
    collections come alive, make them useful for accomplishing work and that connect 
    them with communities.' The important features of the 'libraries' envisaged 
    by Lynch are user-centred design, focusing on purpose and audience: tools 
    that allow users to manipulate, analyze, annotate and comment and, in so doing, 
    define and create on-line communities.</p>
  <h2>New Tools For Searching</h2>
  <p>What is striking about those sites which offer enriched 
    ways of searching collections-based information is the ingenuity and diversity 
    of the approaches taken. A number of examples illustrate this point.</p>
  <p>The Smithsonian's History Wired tool (<a
href="http://historywired.si.edu/" target="_blank">http://historywired.si.edu</a>) employs an innovative approach 
    to data visualization to present a richly cross-referenced set of object records 
    organized into subjects and themes. It enables customized views of the data 
    through a range of tools such as a timeline, as well as interactive features 
    for users to rate their interest in the objects displayed.</p>
  <p>Canada's Museum of Civilization (<i><a href="http://www.civilization.ca/" target="_blank">http://www.civilization.ca</a></i>) 
    offers a choice of search modes, including 'browsing' the aisles of the collection 
    store by collection or by category. The search function includes a list of 
    most popular searches from recent months.</p>
  <p>Similarly, the British Museum's Compass Tool (<i><a href="http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/compass" target="_blank">http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/compass</a></i>) 
    offers a choice between searching and 'tours'. Searches are prompted in the 
    direction of who/what/how/where/when questions. The results returned include 
    clickable thumbnails to related items. Compass also comes in a version 
    designed for children.</p>
  <p>A wealth of image resources is made readily accessible 
    by the search functions offered by the Maine Historical Society (<i><a href="http://www.mainememory.net/" target="_blank">http://www.mainememory.net</a></i>). 
    Users can browse from a topic list, or search by place or contributor. Search 
    results are well presented, with a range of additional easy-to-use features 
    which enable users to send an e-card, collect items in an album or purchase 
    an image.</p>
  <p>London's Imperial War Museum (<i><a href="http://www.iwm.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.iwm.org.uk</a></i>) offers a range 
    of documentary, image, sound and object records grouped into nine main themes 
    in its 'collections on-line'. The themes and subthemes provide a framework 
    for an integrated presentation of diverse source material.</p>
  <p>The Tate museum's (<i><a
href="http://www.tate.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.tate.org.uk</a></i>) search function 
    offers a subject browse function with a built-in thesaurus of terms. Users 
    can view their search results in a list format or lightbox view.</p>
  <p>The Walker Art Center's (<i><a
href="http://walkerart.org/" target="_blank">http://walkerart.org</a></i>) site provides 
    one of the best examples of an integrated collection search function that 
    shows thumbnails of 'related items' alongside the selected object, including 
    related works and artists. Users are also encouraged to register their responses 
    to the works from a list of word associations and to view the aggregated responses 
    submitted by others.</p>
  <p>What these tools and presentations have in common are serious 
    and successful attempts to provide different ways into database-generated 
    content. Great attention has been paid to organizing the content into user-friendly 
    pathways that encourage further searching and discovery. </p>
  <h2>Constraints And Sustainability</h2>
  <p>Notwithstanding these successes, there are obviously a 
    number of constraints affecting how collections can be dynamically presented 
    on-line. Increasingly however it is not technology that is the limiting factor, 
    but our practices and resources for effective information management.</p>
  <p>First, the data itself poses significant limitations. 
    Making the database accessible may be easier than making the data accessible. 
    Most collection records have been written for internal users only. Typically 
    they concentrate on physical descriptions, describing the object in more detail 
    than its context of origin or use. The data may employ specialist or inconsistent 
    terminology that is opaque to the non-specialist user. Turning the information 
    inside out to make it accessible and useful to external users can be a major, 
    time-consuming task. However, guideposts for new object-oriented data structures 
    are appearing, such as the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) for describing 
    cultural heritage resources (<i>http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr</i>).</p>
  <p>Secondly, the database design of most museum collection 
    management systems is first and foremost to support internal functions. Data 
    structures have been designed to manage transactional processes and precision 
    searching on known terms. Traditional relational database structures work 
    less well than object-oriented structures at handling complex relationships 
    and also at integrating other types of information formats such as multimedia 
    files.</p>
  <p>Thirdly, direct integration with a Web interface may be 
    a problem for many older systems. A smaller subset of data may have to be 
    exported into another Web-enabled database. A disadvantage of this approach 
    is that, like the fixed interactive multimedia exhibit described by Besser, 
    the data remains static. For ease of maintenance, to avoid inconsistency 
    and to continually grow the resource, the Web-facing collection database must 
    be integrated within the everyday information management practices of the 
    museum.</p>
  <p>Fourthly, organisational structures and processes may impede 
    the sharing or pooling of information into integrated repositories. Re-engineering 
    business processes to embed integrated information management processes can 
    be an almost impossible task. While a pilot project may succeed, a sustainable 
    on-line knowledge repository requires an organisational commitment to integrated 
    information management for the purposes of Web delivery.</p>
  <h1>Introducing the History Browser</h1>
  <p>At the National Museum of Australia, we embarked simultaneously 
    on two enterprise-wide projects that promised the type of convergence Besser 
    envisaged. A new integrated content management system for Web publishing 
    and a new collections management system offered the opportunity to align our 
    collection data systems and processes to the imperatives of publishing to 
    the Web.</p>
  <p>Recognizing the arguments of people such as Besser and 
    Donovan, we set out to create a Web experience of the collections to maximize 
    the potential of the Web's searching, linking and interactivity ability. 
    More fundamentally, we wanted to extend the capability of our collection management 
    system beyond just an inventory to become a 'context capable content management 
    system,' to use Donovan's phrase, or a 'digital library,' to use Lynch's. 
    We are now at the stage of prototyping this integrated model of collection 
    information management and Web publishing. In the process, we have redesigned 
    our data model for collection information and developed a new Web interface, 
    the <i>History Browser</i>.</p>
  <p>The <i>History Browser</i> presents collection items and 
    related material as a dynamically generated visual map based on relevance 
    relationships. The visual implementation of <i>History Browser</i> is designed 
    to give users an insight into the context and stories behind the collection 
    item whilst encouraging further exploration of these relationships through 
    a range of source material.</p>
  <p>The map visually presents the collection item, its key 
    dates and locations, as well as related people, events, topics, collection 
    items, times and dates. Each of these contextual relationships is color coded 
    to better identify and group categories. The significance of these relationships 
    is represented by the size they appear in relation to the featured collection 
    item  the larger the size, the stronger the relationship. </p>
  <p>The design of the interface and display mechanisms allows 
    users to quickly construct a story around a collection item, rather than viewing 
    it in isolation  providing a much richer engagement with the collection item.</p>
  <p>Users can choose to explore the collection using one or 
    a number of related categories. For example, a user may choose to view only 
    people, or only people and places related to a particular collection item. 
    Users can also control the number of related objects that are displayed, as 
    well as choosing to display the descriptive labels associated with each related 
    item, in effect increasing or decreasing the cognitive load placed on themselves.</p>
  <p>As a related item is selected, that item moves to the middle 
    of the visual map, becoming the central focus from which all related items 
    are generated. Items that were related to the previous item but bear no relation 
    to this item disappear, while other items that are related to the new item 
    appear,  creating a fresh visual map. Users are able to move back to earlier 
    views via the use of a 'breadcrumb' showing the user's browsing path. In 
    this way, forward momentum through the collection is maintained without a 
    sense of getting lost.</p>
  <p>Entry points to the <i>History Browser </i>occur through 
    one of the six data dimensions (people, events, objects, topics, time and 
    date). Alternatively, users can choose to view their search results - generated 
    from a more traditional keyword search or advanced search - within the <i>History 
    Browser </i>interface<i>.</i></p>
  <p>A number of features added to the search result include 
    the ability to save into a personal 'gallery', e-mailing to a friend or participating 
    in an on-line discussion about the item being viewed. A flag within the database 
    will indicate if the object in question is currently on display; this makes 
    the interface useful within the museum space too. Users can also view their 
    own and others' pathways or view most popular searches by category (See Figure 
    2). In this way the results become living resources which the users can 
    manipulate and which also reflect the history of their interactions with the 
    collection.</p>

  <p class=MsoCaption><a name="Fig2"></a>Figure 2: History Browser 
    home page</p>
  <p>The <i>History Browser</i> is a visual representation of 
    complex data stored within the <i>KE EMu</i> Collections Management System, 
    integrated into a singular visual interface. It queries data stored within 
    the system, creating relationships between the individual collection items 
    for presentation through the Web content management system.</p>
  <p>These components generate weighted relationships between 
    the collection items based upon a number of algorithms. The composite of the 
    relationships is then used to display a featured collection item surrounded 
    by related items (the physical size of a related item in the display represents 
    the weight or strength of the relationship). The <i>History Browser</i>, like 
    the Web itself, is based on relationships. Its effectiveness depends on networking 
    all the available information within the collection/content management system 
    and responding to whichever facet or dimension the users choose to explore, 
    allowing them to move seamlessly between people, places, events, objects, 
    dates and topics.</p>
  <p>Relationships can be created within the database in three 
    ways:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Curated</b><br> 
      In this case, a museum curator manually 
        creates relationships between items in the collection management system. These 
        relationships are simple one-to-one definitions whereby each item has a list 
        of related items with an optional strength included. This idea can be extended 
        to introduce degrading strength based upon 'degrees of separation'. A direct 
        relationship between two items would have a strength multiplier of one; a 
        relationship of two degrees would have a strength multiplier of 0.5; and a 
        relationship of three degrees would have a strength multiplier of 0.25. The 
        additions of the strengths of multiple paths between items would produce the 
        final strength of the direct relationship.</li>
    <li><b>Machine and Taxonomy-based Matching</b><br>
      <pindent>Automated machine-based matching, 
        whereby the system matches collection items and creates relationships based 
        upon common words in the keywords and subjects fields of the collection management 
        system, can also be utilized. This produces a taxonomy-based relationship 
        typical of search engine matching.
        
    </li>
    <li><b>Usage Defined</b><br>
    This method creates relationships 
        between collections items based upon the Web browsing characteristics of site 
        users. The advantages of such an approach are that it produces a degree of 
        randomness and changeability in the collection items' relationships that doesn't 
        necessarily come from other methods. Relationships will come and go depending 
        upon the current time period, responding dynamically to generate up-to-date 
        and topical relationships among items.
       
    </li>
 </ol> 
      <h2>Integration of the Interface and Database</h2>
  
  
  <p>The choice of database 
    to support the <i>History Browser</i> functionality was key to its viability 
    and sustainability. KE Software's KE EMu was preferred to other proprietary 
    systems because its object-oriented structure and capacity for handling multimedia 
    files and XML were essential to the proposed functionality. KE had already 
    implemented a 'narratives' functionality that provided for the ready association 
    of contextual material to fielded object records in the form of free text, 
    media files or urls.</p>
  <p>In order to support the <i>History Browser</i> visual presentation, 
    a set of 'Web ready' fields were added to the standard collections management 
    catalogue. These can be populated directly as well as auto populated from 
    object records. Records of individual collection items can be significantly 
    enriched and stored alongside non-object records for people, places, events 
    and topics. Thus not only is the interpretive information stored in KE Emu, 
    but it is also directly connected to the collection records. To the greatest 
    extent possible, the collections management system is automatically generating 
    and storing Web content designed for presentation through the Web interface.</p>
  <p>Communication between the front-end Flash presentation 
    of the <i>History Browser</i> and back-end server components of the <i>History 
    Browser</i> is handled completely via XML, enabling future implementations 
    of alternative interfaces to the data set without complete re-engineering.</p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>In many ways, we are only just starting to discover what 
    the internet means for our collections. As well as dramatically increasing 
    the number of users of collections information, the internet revolution also 
    increases the demand for accessible ways into information, tools to make it 
    meaningful and relevant, and opportunities to interact with and manipulate 
    it.</p>
  <p>If museums are to meet those challenges, we have to reconsider 
    our approaches to how we create, organise and present collections information. 
    Providing catalogues of records and highlights tours is not enough. Embracing 
    a more user-centred view of data requires a rethink of database and interface 
    design for collections data and a new emphasis on facilitating knowledge rather 
    than just delivering information. Our collections need not exist only as 
    inert data obtained through elusive search mechanisms. We can now empower 
    users to explore, connect and contribute to the information that we hold and 
    to develop and share the knowledge those activities create. </p>
  <p>Several museums have started to tackle these issues. Projects 
    such as History Wired and Compass have successfully demonstrated with a relatively 
    small number of records (450 and 5000 respectively) some of the possibilities. 
    However, the future scope and sustainability of initiatives such as these 
    will depend on how well they are supported by the back end databases and information 
    management practices supporting them.</p>
  <p>At the National Museum of Australia, we are seeking to 
    create tight integration between the back end data in our collection system 
    and the front end presentation delivered by a Web content management system. 
    The goal is to create a multifaceted content repository oriented to Web users, 
    not just a catalogue of records designed for internal use.</p>
  <p>The <i>History Browser</i> user interface is a Web tool 
    that employs the internet paradigm of networked nodes to organise and display 
    collections information. For the user, it provides a scaffolding of information 
    relationships to facilitate knowledge building. It presents information as 
    a network of associations, not simply a collection of facts. Users can pursue 
    their interests in an open-ended fashion through a range of information types, 
    across the dimensions of people, places, events, objects, dates and topics. 
  </p>
  <p>For the museum, the knowledge repository model provides 
    for efficient organisation of a range of information assets. It vividly demonstrates 
    that through networking, the whole can be exponentially greater than the sum 
    of the parts. It ensures efficient reuse of information and allows curators 
    and exhibition developers more effectively to identify all of the museum's 
    information assets relevant to a particular item.</p>
  <p class=ReferencesText>To realize the full value of our information and the 
    potential of the on-line medium, we need to continue to develop ways of adding 
    context, meaning and value to raw collections data so that the total becomes 
    useful as knowledge. Only when we succeed in aligning our databases, interfaces 
    and information management practices with the goal of creating integrated, 
    sustainable and participative knowledge repositories will our collections 
    truly come alive on-line. </p>
