   <p class="AbstractText">The National Center was launched in 1997 to take the resources 
    of the American Museum of Natural History directly to classrooms, informal 
    science learning centers, and homes throughout the country. Initial efforts 
    of this program included complete Web site experiences such as <i>Biodiversity 
    Counts</i>, a nine-week middle school science curriculum. Evaluation indicated 
    that teachers preferred to integrate select pieces of the curriculum into 
    their existing lesson plans rather than adopt the entire curriculum. Our 
    challenge was to keep content like <i>Biodiversity Counts</i> useful and available 
    to our audience while minimizing our content development and maintenance costs. 
    In that context, the concept for <i>Resources for Learning </i>emerged. <i>Resources 
    for Learning </i>presents a collection of educational materials that anyone 
    can browse or search for content to augment some learning activity. The project 
    has established a new content-development methodology for the National Center. 
    When a new Museum hall or exhibit opens, we produce a range of content resources 
    and present them in a "special collection" tied to the exhibit. We can scale 
    new content development according to available time and money, and the modular 
    content we produce can be reused in a range of new and different contexts. 
    Evaluation has shown that teachers find the modular content easier to appropriate 
    and integrate into their classroom work. Future developments include a more 
    visual display of resources to better convey the qualities of the content, 
    and ways for visitors to collect and organize favorite resources.</p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>The American Museum of Natural History was founded in 1869 with the twin 
    missions of scientific research into the natural world and education of the 
    public about the world they inhabit. The Museum's educational activities 
    span on-site programs, partnerships with schools and community based organizations, 
    professional development offerings, and the national outreach efforts of the 
    National Center for Science Literacy, Education and Technology. These activities 
    are grounded in the research of the Museum's 200-plus scientists, and strengthened 
    by its 42 permanent exhibitions and active ongoing development of temporary 
    exhibits. In a world increasingly shaped by technology and science, the Museum 
    recognizes that people must have access to scientific knowledge in order to 
    be full participants in the 21st Century. The Museum sees this mission as 
    not just an opportunity, but also its responsibility.</p>
  <p> Launched in 1997, the National Center's charge is to capture the Museum's 
      rich array of resources and make them available to the broadest possible audience 
      of children, families, schools, and community-based organizations across the 
      nation and around the world. Forging key partnerships with schools, universities, 
      publishers, and community-based organizations, the National Center produces 
      content-rich programs and materials using a range of technologies that includes 
      software, video, Web sites, and print. The National Center enables people 
      around the world to experience the Museum's exhibitions, go behind the scenes 
      into the labs and collections, meet and be inspired by scientists, and travel 
      along on research expeditions into the field. </p>
  <p>A key program in the National Center's early strategy was the Educational 
    Materials Laboratory. This group produced science education materials for 
    distribution on the Web, which in 1997 was just beginning to take shape as 
    a popular publishing medium. The group's first efforts included elaborate, 
    polished Web sites, such as the Black Smoker Expedition, and science curriculum 
    such as <i>Biodiversity Counts</i>, a nine-week middle school curriculum that 
    sends students into their schoolyards to collect and share data about plant 
    and insect diversity.</p>
  <p>Evaluation of <i>Biodiversity Counts</i> indicated that teachers preferred 
    to integrate select pieces of the curriculum into existing lesson plans rather 
    than take on an entirely new curriculum. At the same time we realized that 
    complete, polished Web site experiences, such as the Black Smoker Expedition, 
    were too expensive to produce and maintain. We faced a new challenge of 
    making valuable material like <i>Biodiversity Counts</i> relevant and useful 
    to educators in a way that we could maintain economically over time. We would 
    need a flexible and sustainable system to publish these existing resources 
    as well as new materials produced in fulfillment of our mission to extend 
    the resources of the Museum beyond the walls. </p>
  <h1>Initial Development</h1>
  <h2>Project Goals and Target Audience</h2>
  <p>The goal of <i>Resources for Learning </i>was to maximize the availability 
    and utility of the National Center's diverse educational materials for our 
    audience while minimizing the costs of new development, production, and, especially, 
    ongoing operations and upgrading of the site. </p>
  <p>The first task in new development is always to define who the audience is 
    and what experience you want them to have. Clearly, K-12 science teachers 
    were the audience for the curriculum packages that we wanted to reformat. 
    But the National Center also produces materials for a wide range of audiences 
    and informal learning settings. For example, <i>OLogy</i>, the Museum's Web 
    site for kids, is designed for kids to navigate and enjoy at home on their 
    own. What value would <i>Resources for Learning </i>add to <i>OLogy</i>, 
    and for what audience? </p>
  <p>We imagined that a search engine could help a parent or an after-school coordinator 
    find an <i>OLogy</i> feature to answer a child's question or curiosity more 
    efficiently than by using the kid-oriented interface to <i>OLogy</i>. And 
    we thought that learners, such as a middle school student who wants to find 
    something for a homework assignment, also could benefit from this resource. 
    And so the target audience was defined to be "anyone who wants to quickly 
    find natural science learning materials to facilitate their own learning or 
    that of another" including teachers, informal educators, after-school coordinators, 
    parents, and learners themselves.</p>
  <h2>Formative Evaluation</h2>
  <p>Though our audience was broadly defined to include "any facilitator of science 
    learning," we worked with teachers in our formative evaluation. We made a 
    simplifying assumption that teachers would be the most demanding users - they 
    have limited time to use on-line resources, and specific needs for resources 
    that supplement existing curricula. Too, we felt that the descriptive language 
    of formal education, such as school grade level or the length of a class period, 
    would be familiar to everyone who has attended school, and so we could use 
    that language in describing our resources.</p>
  <p>We started with an on-line questionnaire that asked educators what kinds 
    of on-line resources they were using, how they used the Internet to find resources, 
    and what worked and didn't work in their experiences with on-line resources. 
    From the respondents we invited a small number to participate in focus-group 
    sessions at the Museum, where we could probe further into their experiences, 
    and get their reactions to existing resource Web sites and to our own early 
    concept prototypes. These efforts confirmed that our audience would find 
    a Museum-branded on-line resource desirable. Lessons from their on-line experiences 
    gave us some specific usability design challenges to address in our development 
    work.</p>
  <p>From those sessions we pulled simple one-liners, such as "I've got a half-hour 
    before I have to leave, and I need something more for tomorrow's lesson on 
    the Sun as an energy source," which sparked discussions on how to address 
    those design challenges. One-liners like these were our challenge:</p>
  <p class=listwithbullets>
    <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">"I got this <i>Resources for Learning </i>URL at the conference, 
    I've got some free time, let me take a quick tour and see what they've got."</span></p>
  <p class=BlockQuoteAuthor>"There's great material on the Museum Web site, but I can't 
    tell what's relevant to my fifth graders, or what I'll need to present myself 
    and what I can just let them loose on."</p>
  <p class=BlockQuoteAuthor>"This is beautiful material, but does it address the standards 
    requirements I have to meet?"</p>
  <p class=BlockQuoteAuthor>"Do I have to be on-line to use this?"</p>
  <p class=BlockQuoteAuthor>"I've only got two days for this topic; how big a commitment 
    is this activity?"</p>
  <p>We began to outline the features and structure of the Web site, to understand 
    the kinds of descriptive data that would be useful, and to know what functions 
    needed to be up front and at hand.</p>
  <p>It was very useful to look at other, similar learning-resource Web sites 
    for both the good and bad examples they provided. We could try out our one-line 
    scenarios on these Web sites to learn how others had solved certain design 
    problems. One lesson was how important it is to provide the right amount 
    of descriptive information about a resource before presenting the resource 
    itself. It is frustrating, for example, to click on a resource link and begin 
    downloading several megabytes of data before having decided that it might 
    be something useful. But it is equally frustrating to click through many 
    screens of descriptive data before finding a link to the actual resource. 
  </p>
  <h2>Defining Metadata</h2>
  <p>The most challenging design task was defining the metadata. We made it a 
    goal to be compatible with emerging metadata standards for educational materialsin 
    order to serve the larger goal of maximizing the availability of our materials. 
    We found relevant standards at the IMS Global Learning Consortium and the 
    Gateway to Educational Materials (GEM) organizations. These standards were 
    not completely defined when we began development. For example, there were 
    no standard vocabularies to help us describe the particular variety of educational 
    resources at a museum. Getting the category vocabulary right is important. 
    If most of the resources fall into only one or two categories, it doesn't 
    give people a useful way to discriminate among the natural variety of resources 
    in the collection. We worked with database-savvy teachers and education experts 
    to develop our own ad hoc vocabulary for resource types, and took pains to 
    define the vocabulary to our users.</p>
  <p><a href="ganoFig1.html" class="caption"><img src="gano1TN.gif" alt="resources available: activities, curriculum materials, articles, evidence and analysis, exhibition materials, and reference lists" border="0" class="caption"></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1"></a>Figure 1: Explanation of resource types<br>
  <a href="http://www.amnh.org/resources/about.php" target="_blank">http://www.amnh.org/resources/about.php</a>] </p>
  <p>We also worked with a cataloging expert from the Museum library to develop 
    our keyword vocabulary and thesaurus. The keyword search would be the first 
    search people would try, so it was important to create a keyword vocabulary 
    that would both use familiar terms and accurately represent the character 
    of our collection. We began by deriving keywords from the top-level subjects 
    of the Library of Congress Subject Headings, and then added terms that were 
    more specific to the work of the Museum and which would appear frequently 
    in our materials.</p>
  <p>Other dimensions of metadata were easier to define. Grade level required 
    no special definition. Duration - the amount of time necessary to complete 
    a content resource - depends on too many variables to define precisely, yet 
    it is still useful in indicating the relative amount of commitment required 
    to use a resource. We decided to define very approximate durations: "less 
    than a class period," "about one class period," "less than a week," "about 
    a week," and "more than a week."</p>
  <p>Finally, for our browsing directory subject headings, we defined a two-layer 
    hierarchy. The first layer was easy; it simply reflects the science disciplines 
    of the Museum: anthropology, astronomy, biology, Earth science, and paleontology. 
    For the second layer of subtopics, we worked with curators from across the 
    Museum to help us define a set of topics.</p>
  <h2>Prototyping</h2>
  <p>We began creating simple click-through prototypes of the site architecture 
    very early in the process. Having an explicit example of what you're talking 
    about, one that everyone can see, point to, and critique, helps ground design 
    discussions. The early prototypes were also important for formative evaluation 
    by providing concrete examples of site features to which focus groups could 
    react.</p>
  <p>Prototyping also helps the development team better understand the scope and 
    complexity of proposed features. Very often, the full effort required to 
    implement a desirable feature is not known until development begins. Prototyping 
    allows team members to get a preview of both the interface design issues and 
    the implementation challenges before making a final commitment to them. And 
    by anticipating future feature,s we could lay important groundwork for them 
    in our initial development. </p>
  <h2>First Launch</h2>
  <p>As we were finalizing our architecture and user interface design, representatives 
    from McGraw-Hill Education asked us to provide on-line materials to supplement 
    their K-6 science textbook series. We soon realized that this would be an 
    excellent opportunity to focus our efforts and finalize design decisions so 
    that we could begin building a live database of resources. Iit would also 
    be a good proof-of-concept for the <i>Resources for Learning </i>methodology.</p>
  <p>The resources chosen to match their textbooks would help fill out our first 
    data set. We began simultaneously creating database records for these resources 
    and building by hand the Web pages that would display them. Though the final 
    production site would have a search engine and dynamically generated results 
    pages, we decided that the first launch would have only static pages. This 
    would allow us to evaluate and refine our page designs before committing to 
    them with more technically complex programming. We created ad hoc tools to 
    generate the static pages from the database, and also to understand and design 
    the requirements for the publishing tools that we would need for the full-featured 
    site.</p>
  <p>The first version of <i>Resources for Learning </i>was launched in Decembe,r 
    2001, with two special collections, for the Museum's Hall of Biodiversity 
    and for the reformatted <i>Biodiversity Counts</i> curriculum. The McGraw-Hill 
    Science collection was also launched, but was announced only to teachers using 
    the McGraw-Hill Science textbooks. The initial launch demonstrated our ability 
    to curate a range of collections of resources derived from the same data set.</p>
  <h2>Evaluation and Redesign</h2>
  <p>Soon after the first launc,h we began planning the next one and the modifications 
    we needed to make. Foremost among these was a new look and feel that would 
    be cleaner and clearer. We contracted Sean Oakes, who had recently redesigned 
    the Museum's main Web site, to give us a new look and logotype that would 
    blend well with the Museum's on-line identity. Our users consistently reported 
    that the association with the Museum's brand lent authority to our materials, 
    and so it was important to make that association explicit.</p>
  <p>We also wanted to perform more thorough user interface evaluations to make 
    sure that the features and functions of the site were clear to our users. 
    We contracted with Insight, Inc. to evaluate the site's usability. This company 
    conducted two rounds of usability testing. The first round showed that users 
    were consistently having difficulty with orientation within the site and with 
    certain terminology we were using for resource types. We also learned that 
    some of the user interface elements were overlooked or misinterpreted.</p>
  <p>It was very valuable for all team members to observe the evaluations, to 
    see their work through a user's eyes, and enjoy its successes and ponder its 
    failures. Overall, the message we got was to simplify and clarify the interface, 
    and to reduce the number of clicks required to access resource materials. 
    But we were also encouraged by the users' great enthusiasm for the site and 
    for the resources it contained.</p>
  <p>Insight recommended a number of user interface modifications, and we determined 
    some of our own, to address the problems raised in the first round of testing. 
    During the final development work, we tried and discussed different solutions 
    and did informal testing in-house, the kind where just a fresh pair of eyes 
    can tell you whether or not something is working. Before the official launch 
    in Apri,l 2002, Insight did a second round of usability testing that confirmed 
    we had definitely improved users' ability to navigate and find things on the 
    site.</p>
  <p>While the new look and improved interface were under development, we were 
    also able to begin final technical development on the search function and 
    the publishing tools, and to expand the database with additional resources.

  <h1>Technical Development </h1>
  <h2>Selecting a Development Platform</h2>
  <p>We looked into several off-the-shelf content management solutions for <i>Resources 
    for Learning,</i> but none met all our needs. We knew we would be continuously 
    refining the user interface as we incorporated lessons learned from real users. 
    During these iterations we needed to guarantee the continuity of the database 
    that our production team was busy creating. We also anticipated future on-line 
    requirements, such as creating custom special collections and user-created 
    collections, which were not supported by commercial products. In short, we 
    wanted the flexibility that in-house development would allow us, and we had 
    the capabilities on staff to build it ourselves.</p>
  <p>We chose an "open source" technical platform for <i>Resources for Learning.</i> 
    At its heart is a MySQL database of metadata, data that catalogues and describes 
    the educational resource materials. The user interface is Web-based, and 
    includes static pages as well as dynamic pages generated by a custom PhP application. 
    <i>Resources for Learning </i>is accessible by any Web browser and requires 
    no special "plug-ins." Some of the resource materials require additional 
    software to use, such as Macromedia Flash or Shockwave, Quicktime, or Adobe 
    Acrobat Reader, but the descriptive metadata informs people of those requirements 
    before they access the resource. </p>
  <h2>Why Open Source?</h2>
  <p>There are many benefits to choosing open source software for developing applications, 
    particularly for non-profit organizations. Open source is not necessarily 
    free software, but it doesn't have the large, up-front licensing fees of proprietary 
    commercial software. Developers can download, install, and evaluate full 
    versions of the software and, if it proves to be the wrong tool for the job, 
    simply abandon it. </p>
  <p>Open source software depends on a community of developers to provide support 
    and improvements. While there are no 24-hour technical support phone lines, 
    there are many avenues for help in on-line newsgroups and Web sites. Using 
    open source software makes you part of the community, and good citizens support 
    the community by helping others with technical problems and contributing to 
    evaluation, testing, and improvements.</p>
  <p>Not being tied to a particular software vendor allows us more options to 
    use third-party products, and also to make hardware platform choices unbiased 
    by our use of a particular product. In part, this is because open source 
    software, and in particular our platform of Apache Web Server, MySQL database, 
    and PhP application server, is becoming widely accepted as an industry standard. 
    The latest versions of these tools offer most of the functionality of their 
    commercial counterparts.</p>
  <h2>Search Engine Development</h2>
  <p class=MsoCommentText>Our primary goal for the <i>Resources for Learning </i>search 
    engine is to help visitors quickly find the best resource to meet their needs, 
    and to minimize the "noise" of extraneous, marginally related resources in 
    their search results. Quick-search "direct hits" are as rare as they are 
    wonderful, so we provide several search strategies.</p>
  <p>The simplest search is a keyword search, which utilizes a hand-built, controlled 
    vocabulary and thesaurus developed by subject experts and professional science 
    librarians. Every resource has about 10 keyword descriptors that categorize 
    the primary subject matter of the material. If a keyword search fails to 
    return satisfying results, users can expand their searches to include a string-match 
    search of resource titles and their full-text descriptions. If a search returns 
    too many results, the user can sort or filter the search results with metadata 
    descriptors such as grade level, science topic, or resource type to bring 
    forward the most relevant results.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="ganoFig3.html"><img src="gano3TN.gif" alt="List of search results for &quot;biodiversity&quot;" border="0"></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig3"></a>Figure 3: Search results page, with advanced search and sorting options </p>
  <h2>Catalogues and Special Collections for Browsing</h2>
  <p>If the need is less specific, visitors can browse a catalogue of topics and 
    subtopics based on the Museum's scientific disciplines. The catalogue is 
    a simple two-level hierarchy, so visitors are never more than two clicks away 
    from a list of resources. The catalogue also displays the number of resources 
    in each subtopic so visitors can get an idea of the scope and coverage of 
    our collection at a glance. The catalogue pages and resource counts are generated 
    dynamically and so are easy to keep up-to-date as the collection expands.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="ganoFig4.html"><img src="gano4TN.gif" alt="List of Topics Under &quot;Earth Science&quot;" border="0"></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig4"></a>Figure 4: Browse by Topic - Earth Science </p>
  <p>Special Collections are curated collections of resources, handpicked and 
    organized around new Museum exhibits or halls, curriculum materials, or other 
    topics of special interest. Special collection pages have unique organizations 
    and written content, but they are easy to update and maintain because their 
    resource lists are dynamically generated from the most current data in the 
    database. </p>
  <h2>Compatibility with Metadata Standards</h2>
  <p>Early in the development of <i>Resources for Learning </i>we looked for guidance 
    and inspiration from a number of existing on-line resource initiatives, specifically 
    Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE), Gateway for Educational 
    Materials (GEM), and NASA's Space Science Education Resource Directory. Our 
    reason for being involved was twofold: to take advantage of their lessons 
    learned, but more important, to participate in the sharing of resources and 
    to find the largest possible audience for our resources. </p>
  <p>In order to assure cross compatibility with these and other digital libraries, 
    we based our metadata design on the Dublin Core standard, specifically its 
    application to educational materials as defined by GEM. Though our database 
    does not include every metadata field defined by GEM, we made certain that 
    our metadata could be clearly and simply mapped to all of the fields required 
    by the GEM standard. We continue to work closely with GEM to develop methods 
    for automatically exposing our collection to their search engine. Currently, 
    GEM catalogues a small subset of our resources, which are highlighted as a 
    featured collection in its upcoming (early 2004) re-launch.</p>
  <h2>Content Management Tools</h2>
  <p>A key development goal for <i>Resources for Learning </i>was to create a 
    publishing framework that would enable non-technical staff to maintain and 
    expand the resource collection. To that end, we developed a content management 
    system that provides a range of Web-based tools for administering the resource 
    collection. </p>
  <p class="normal">A variety of skills are needed to catalogue new resources 
    for the collection. Professional writers with an education background are 
    enlisted to write clear and concise resource titles and descriptions. Library 
    science professionals marry the resources to the Library of Congress subject 
    keyword taxonomy, as well as to a Museum-specific keyword vocabulary. Where 
    appropriate, expert educators who have many years of experience with the various 
    educational standards review resources and identify which curriculum standards 
    they satisfy. (We correlate our resources to the National Academies National 
    Science Education Standards and the National Council for the Social Studies 
    Curriculum Standards for Social Studies, with the expectation that teachers 
    can reconcile the national standards with their state or local standards).</p>
  <p class="normal">Finally, copy editors and proofreaders review all text 
    for proper grammar and spelling, to ensure the quality of content that people 
    expect from the Museum. </p>
  <p>For each of these roles there is a content management tool that provides 
    a custom editing view on the database. Content editors can read any of the 
    database fields, but can edit only the fields in their purview. They can 
    also preview the data in its final form as they work, for often that is where 
    errors are most obvious.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="ganoFig5.html"><img src="gano5TN.gif" alt="Resource Record for &quot;The ancient City of Petra&quot; a record from Ology" border="0"></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig5"></a>Figure 5: Detailed listing of a resource record </p>
  <p>The role of the central administrator, who has overarching editing privileges, 
    is also defined. The administrator can create new accounts in any role, create 
    new records for resources, assign content editing tasks to specific roles, 
    and track the progress on assignments from a single user interface. This 
    administator can also create custom roles for special editing jobs, and specifically 
    define the scope of each contributor's access. </p>
  <p>It was a challenge to develop a system that could maintain data security 
    and integrity while keeping the administrative system easily accessible to 
    its users, whose schedules vary greatly, and maintaining public access to 
    the resource collection. When the administrator opens an existing record 
    for editing, an interim record is created and assigned to one or more editors. 
    The content management system keeps a history, in the form of an XML data 
    log, of all modifications made to interim records, so that it is possible 
    to roll back changes or recover data if necessary. Once editing is complete, 
    the administrator can move the interim record to the live database. The overlapping 
    editing safeguards enable us to make significant additions and changes to 
    the resource database while maintaining a live and up-to-date presence on 
    our Web site. </p>
  <h1>Developing Content for <i>Resources for Learning </i></h1>
  <p>One of the goals of <i>Resources for Learning </i>was to create a framework 
    into which we could easily assimilate new materials produced by the National 
    Center, and which would provide a uniform interface to existing materials. 
    After the initial launch, we continued to expand the database, both by repackaging 
    existing content and by incorporating new content as it was produced, and 
    we found that the framework had a significant influence on the way we conceived 
    and produced new content.</p>
  <h2>Repackaging existing content</h2>
  <p>The dynamic functionality of <i>Resources for Learning </i>enabled us to 
    repackage existing curriculum materials into the finer-grained content modules 
    that our target audience wanted, as well as into stand-alone resources. For 
    example, <i>Biodiversity Counts</i> was originally developed as a nine-week 
    supplementary curriculum for middle schools, and was designed to be implemented 
    in a sequential format. To adapt it for distribution through <i>Resources 
    for Learning,</i> we divided the curriculum materials into over 90 stand-alone 
    resources, and suggested several different implementation methods that varied 
    in length and emphasis. Educators also have the flexibility of selecting 
    individual or groups of resources that suit their needs and time constraints, 
    such as using an entomologist's essay to supplement a lesson on spiders and 
    microhabitats, or creating their own three-week unit on plant identification 
    and biodiversity. </p>
  <p>We also examined existing National Center and Museum Web sites for content 
    modules that educators might find useful, if they could easily find them. 
    For example, we catalogued individual feature stories from <i>OLogy</i>, the 
    Museum's Web site for kids, which enables educators to discover them by keyword 
    searches or by activity type rather than clicking through the site itself. 
    <i>Science Bulletins</i>, the Museum's Web site of current science stories, 
    is similarly available. The curriculum materials in <i>Seminars on Science</i>, 
    our on-line professional development courses for science educators, cannot 
    be extracted from the course without losing context. However, supplementary 
    resources that were developed for these courses, such as scientist profiles 
    or interactive explanations, can be extracted and catalogued and made available 
    to a larger audience.</p>
  <h2>Creating new content</h2>
  <p><i>Resources for Learning </i>has had a fruitful influence on the ways in 
    which we produce new content. When we create new interactives for any project, 
    we make an effort to design them to be stand-alone; that is, to work and make 
    sense outside the context of their project of origin. This is usually not 
    at all difficult, and primarily requires paying attention to details, such 
    as not making references to specific project content within the interactive. 
    Moreover, <i>Resources for Learning </i>has influenced the interactives we 
    choose to produce. Since they now have potential for use in many different 
    contexts, we tend to favor interactives that have some perennial appeal and 
    utility. This also allows us to justify a larger commitment to designing 
    and producing such pieces, because their cost can be amortized over many more 
    end uses.</p>
  <p>Our framework also enables us to scale new content production to match available 
    resources. Before <i>Resources for Learning,</i> when a new hall or exhibit 
    opened, we would produce a new Web site, a complete beginning-to-end Web experience. 
    Now we can produce a range of stand-alone content modules - from teacher guides 
    and classroom activities to on-line interactives and essays - and the number 
    and scope of them is determined by the time and money we have to spend, rather 
    than by some preconception of how big the complete experience should be. 
    Moreover, we can launch a Special Collection tied to an exhibit with a small 
    set of resources, and then continue to add to it as time and money permit, 
    without disrupting or redesigning the initial collection.</p>
  <p>For example, in conjunction with the <i>Vietnam: Journeys of Body, Mind, 
    and Spirit</i> exhibition, we launched a Vietnam Special Collection that included 
    an educator's guide to the exhibit and four related extension activities for 
    classroom use. We continued the development of two additional resources - 
    an on-line activity that explores traditions in Vietnam, and an interactive 
    image gallery that investigates Vietnam's ethnic diversity. The image gallery 
    required extensive image research, content reviews, and technical development 
    of a new interactive template. The flexibility of <i>Resources for Learning 
    </i>enabled us to take the time necessary to develop high-quality resources 
    to enhance this Special Collection, while still meeting the deadline established 
    by the exhibition opening.</p>

  <h1> Conclusion</h1>
  <p>Our evaluation studies have encouraged us to think that <i>Resources for 
    Learning </i>is a valuable product for educators. The Web site has also received 
    recognition from the Codie Awards and <i>Learning</i> <i>Magazine</i>'s Teacher's 
    Choice Awards, and these awards are gratifying. But we believe that the project's 
    most important contribution is as a new model of how a museum can produce 
    and distribute educational materials on the Web.</p>
  <p>How can an informal learning institution maintain a consistent, productive 
    presence through the constant ebb and flow of financial resources, personnel, 
    and digital technology? <i>Resources for Learning </i>has demonstrated a 
    methodology for content development and distribution that can go with that 
    ebb and flow. By changing our focus from producing "feature-length" Web site 
    experiences to the creation of stand-alone supplementary content modules, 
    we address the needs of educators who already develop their own "feature-length" 
    experiences in the classroom or science center, but who can benefit from authoritative 
    supplemental content from a world-class museum. At the same time, we enable 
    our production group to scale their efforts according to the resources at 
    hand, and to produce materials for a framework that maintains a consistent 
    interface regardless of the scale of effort.</p>
  <p>As resources permit, we intend to expand and refine the interface framework 
    to respond to both the needs of our audience and the evolution of digital 
    technology. We have already improved our search engine once without touching 
    the core content database; and as new search technologies emerge, we feel 
    confident that we can incorporate those improvements without starting from 
    scratch. Now that the core framework is in place and has been proven robust, 
    we can experiment with more visually inviting interfaces that provide visitors 
    with greater exposure to the breadth of resources we offer.</p>
  <p>We intend to add new features, such as enabling visitors to collect resources 
    and create lesson plans and other kinds of compositions with them, and also 
    to share collections, compositions, and tips for using them with our educators' 
    community. We look forward to exploring additional partnerships with educational 
    publishers, as we have with Macmillan/McGraw-Hill, to produce customized collections 
    of resources to supplement textbooks and curricula. The scalable, modular 
    framework of our content collection provides a solid foundation to explore 
    new interfaces and new forms of business for the educational materials we 
    produce.</p>
