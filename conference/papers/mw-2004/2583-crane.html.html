       <p class="AbstractText">Burarra Gathering Online is Questacon's first 
        Web exhibition. The exhibition was based on the interactive, physical 
        exhibition <i>Burarra Gathering: Sharing Indigenous Knowledge</i>, which 
        was Questacon's first Indigenous-based exhibition. The two exhibitions 
        show some of the traditional technologies of the Burarra (&quot;bur-ah-da&quot;) 
        people of remote central north Arnhem Land, in Australia's Northern 
        Territory. Both Burarra exhibitions were developed in co-operation with, 
        and the approval of, the Burarra Elders. This paper will briefly outline 
        the development of the physical exhibition and examine in more detail 
        the on-line version. The <i>Burarra Gathering Online</i> development team 
        faced many challenges, including a limited budget, the logistics of having 
        to seek incremental approvals from Burarra Elders in remote communities 
        4&nbsp;000&nbsp;km away, and the usual technical issues these projects 
        involve. Evaluation of the finished products has shown them to be effective 
        in presenting Indigenous technologies in a contemporary context; they 
        have received praise from the Burarra people and many other organizations 
        around the world. The development processes and resulting exhibitions 
        have shown that a close partnership with an Indigenous community can lead 
        to insightful exhibitions that share Indigenous knowledge with the world.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>This paper will outline the development of the on-line 
        version of <i>Burarra Gathering: Sharing Indigenous Knowledge</i>. <i>Burarra 
        Gathering</i> is Questacon's first on-line exhibition, and it followed 
        in the footsteps of a museum floor exhibition of the same name. Both of 
        the <i>Burarra Gathering</i> exhibitions were made in partnership with 
        the Burarra community Elders.  The organization learned a lot from the 
        development of both exhibitions: in the first place, how to gain and build 
        the trust of a remote Indigenous community, and later, what it means to 
        build an on-line exhibition.</p>
      <p>Questacon has had a popular interactive museum Web 
        site since 1995, made up of lots of individual experiences and a virtual 
        tour. Questacon's on-line resources currently attract around 90&nbsp;000 
        visits per month from around the world, with about 75% of all visitors 
        coming from outside Australia.</p>
      <p>As this paper is being written, an external research 
        project is underway to compare the learning outcomes of the physical and 
        on-line versions of <i>Burarra Gathering</i>. It is hoped that the research 
        findings will be available at Museums and the Web 2004.</p>
      <h1><i>Burarra Gathering: </i> Physical Exhibition</h1>
      <h2>Recognizing Indigenous Technologies</h2>
      <p>The physical exhibition opened in February, 2002, and 
        marked a number of significant firsts for Questacon. <i>Burarra Gathering 
        </i>was Questacon's first Indigenous exhibition, and the first that 
        used no text to interpret the exhibits. The only text in the exhibition 
        was at the entry, where a map showed the location of the Burarra land 
        and a list of credits to thank the people who had assisted in its development 
        or been involved with the project. </p>
      <p>The main reason for having no text was that Questacon 
        did not want to put a Western 'spin' on the practices shown 
        in the exhibits. The intention was to let the Elders speak for themselves 
        in the exhibits. Audience observations showed that users took a while 
        to realize this &#8211; they looked for the instructions to find out what 
        to do. After a short time they had a go at the activities for themselves, 
        with the Elder telling them what to do. The exhibits are triggered by 
        motion sensors once a visitor approaches quite closely, and other sensors 
        are used to determine the kind of feedback to be given, be it encouraging: 
        'that's good,' or instructive: 'No, no! Faster, 
        faster!'</p>
      <p>In late 2000, Questacon's leadership team decided 
        to fund the development of a new exhibition with the aim (Questacon, 2000) 
        to 'recognise the significance of Indigenous technologies to 21<sup>st</sup> 
        century Australian culture' and 'to provide a medium for Indigenous 
        communities to disseminate cultural information to the wider community'.</p>
      <p>The exhibition development team called on the help 
        and expertise of Linda Cooper, who in the past had worked with many Indigenous 
        communities and the Investigator Science Centre in Adelaide. Linda had 
        previously worked with the Burarra people and suggested that they would 
        be good for Questacon to work with, as they are still living on their 
        own land and they have retained many of their traditional practices:  
        the region has seen fairly limited development, and their land is quite 
        small and does not range far from the coast. Linda felt that it would 
        be reasonably easy to identify a set of technologies based on the lifestyle 
        in this area. </p>
      <h2>Going Outback to Burarra</h2>
      <p>After being introduced to the community by Linda, members 
        of the development team made three trips to visit the Burarra people in 
        Arnhem Land during the 2001 dry season. The first of these trips was really 
        just an ice-breaker, but on subsequent visits the Elders opened up and 
        showed the visitors the traditional knowledge and technology that would 
        be used in the exhibition. The team gathered the video, audio and still 
        photographs they needed to build the museum floor exhibition. Unfortunately, 
        the team was not able to learn anything about the traditional practices 
        of the community's women and girls, so the exhibition only features 
        men. The logistics of these trips were tricky. The community is a seven 
        hour, 520&nbsp;km drive or one and half hour flight east of Darwin, which 
        itself is 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;km north of Questacon in Canberra. Additionally, 
        all visitors need to secure a travel permit to go to Maningrida, the nearest 
        large settlement (population 2&nbsp;600) with an airport. Permits are 
        issued by the Northern Land Council in Darwin and have to be signed and 
        approved by the community Elders. These permits are not issued as a matter 
        of routine. Even though our team had been invited, they still had delays 
        of a few days in Darwin waiting for their permits. These delays added 
        greatly to the cost of the trips</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="crane.fig1.gif" alt="Arnhem Land is in the North West of Australia" width="300" height="214"></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig. 1. Map of Arnhem Land</p>
      <h2>What's an Exhibit?</h2>
      <p>Some other problems were cultural in nature: the Elders 
        didn't know what a hands-on science centre was, let alone an exhibit 
        from such a centre. The team members took sketches and model mock-ups 
        of exhibits to try to get across a sense of what these things were. It 
        took some time to work through these problems and to develop a sense of 
        trust between the Elders and their visitors. The community had had bad 
        experiences with anthropologists and others in the past, and at first 
        they were wary of the Questacon team.</p>
      <h2>Building the Exhibition</h2>
      <p>The development team sought community approvals at 
        several stages in the exhibition's development, including the basic 
        concepts and topics, the exhibits' design, how the user would interact 
        with the exhibits, and the final exhibits both while they were being constructed 
        and after they were completed. This was done both in person on the later 
        trips and remotely via post, telephone and e-mail. </p>
      <p>Gaining incremental approval was seen as necessary 
        for two reasons; to give the Elders ample opportunity to shape the representation 
        of their knowledge, and to give Questacon a better chance of making changes 
        at lower cost. If the exhibits were finished and then rejected, much more 
        money would need to be spent to fix or replace them.</p>
      <p>The approval process impacted somewhat on the exhibition 
        timeline, but in the end the final exhibition was built and opened on 
        time for the 3<sup>rd</sup> Science Centre World Congress that Questacon 
        hosted in February 2002. The exhibition gallery looked as if it were a 
        part of Arnhem Land, with huge panoramic photographs lining the walls 
        and tree branches reaching overhead. </p>
      <p>The Burarra Gathering exhibition consists of five exhibits:</p>
      <h3>Seasonal Calendar</h3>
      <p>This is a round house where each of the quadrants shows 
        a scene typical of four different times of year. An Elder describes the 
        weather and activity in the community for each season.</p>
      <h3>Fish Trap</h3>
      <p>Catch a barramundi! You have to crouch and hide so 
        the fish will swim into the fish trap. You might also see a croc down 
        by the billabong.</p>
      <h3>Navigation</h3>
      <p>You have to steer an outboard motor dingy back home 
        to Yilan, at night, using the stars to navigate around a headland and 
        up a river. You might also notice how the waves under the boat change 
        as you round Cape Stewart and later travel up the Blyth River.</p>
      <h3>Making Fire</h3>
      <p>You have to use the rubbing stick to make a fire. Put 
        it in the hole in the bottom stick and turn it really fast.</p>
      <h3>Tracking</h3>
      <p>What animal tracks can you find in the tidal mud flats? 
      </p>

      <p class="caption">Fig. 2: Burarra Gathering in Questacon's 
        Gallery (image by Jim Spadaccini, Ideum)</p>
      <p>The finished exhibition was given a &#8220;10 out of 
        10&#8221; by Burarra Elder Peter Danaja when he visited Questacon a few 
        months later. This was very satisfying for the exhibition developers, 
        as the approvals and feedback from the community up until then had been 
        based on photographs, video and written materials like the scripts and 
        exhibit storyboards.</p>
      <p>And in 2003, students from the school in Maningrida 
        got a thrill to see the Elders from their community in the <i>Burarra 
        Gathering</i> exhibits, when they visited Questacon while in Canberra 
        on a school excursion.</p>
      <h1>Taking <i>Burarra Gathering</i> Online</h1>
      <p>When <i>Burarra Gathering</i> was first opened to the 
        public, I thought it would be a great opportunity to make an engaging 
        on-line companion exhibition, as the exhibits were simple and largely 
        featured video of the Burarra Elders. As the exhibits were largely one-on-one 
        experiences between the Elder and the user, I felt they would translate 
        well to the on-line environment. Unfortunately, at that time there was 
        no funding available for any on-line development of the exhibition. </p>
      <p>Later in the year Questacon's parent Government 
        Department was looking to fund a study that directly compared the learning 
        outcomes between the physical and on-line versions of a single exhibition. 
        At that time no such exhibition pair existed in the Department's 
        cultural institutions in Canberra, including the National Gallery of Australia, 
        the National Museum of Australia, Questacon, and ScreenSound &#8211; the 
        National Film and Sound Archive. Questacon's then-director Dr Annie 
        Ghisalberti had had an interest in on-line learning outcomes, so she volunteered 
        Questacon for the study, and committed to develop an on-line version of 
        the new <i>Burarra Gathering</i> exhibition. Questacon allocated A$100&nbsp;000 
        (US$50&nbsp;000 at that time) to the on-line production.</p>
      <p>The reasons for choosing <i>Burarra Gathering</i> for 
        on-line duplication were that it was new and that it had only five exhibits. 
        It was also thought that the Indigenous theme would be of interest to 
        a global audience. Annie's initial thinking had centered on the 
        development of five interactive (Shockwave or similar) on-line exhibits 
        that closely replicated the gallery experiences. In other words, that 
        the on-line exhibits would be simulations of the gallery simulations. 
        The first meetings of the on-line exhibition team convinced her to broaden 
        her thinking to allow the team the freedom to come up with an exhibition 
        that they felt best conveyed the message.</p>
      <h2>A Better Model</h2>
      <p>As this was the institution's first on-line exhibition, 
        the first task the team faced was to research what 'on-line exhibition' 
        might mean. The team searched the Internet for existing projects and also 
        drew on a Museums and the Web 2001 paper (Sumption, 2001). The team settled 
        on the electronic field trip mode, and used the Brookfield Zoo's 
        <i>In Search of the Ways of Knowing Trail</i> (Brookfield Zoo) as an example 
        when pitching their concept of an animated adventure to management. In 
        fact, Brookfield Zoo's Dr Keith Winston was very supportive of our 
        project, at both the initial stages and as it was nearing completion.</p>
      <p>The project team settled on a virtual trip or adventure 
        style because it offered the best opportunity to simulate the learning 
        style of the Burarra people, with an Elder demonstrating an activity and 
        then encouraging the 'students' to have a go themselves. This 
        is what happens in the physical <i>Burarra Gathering</i> exhibition, using 
        video on portrait&#8211;mounted plasma screens. As the on-line project 
        budget was not sufficient to return to Arnhem Land to shoot new video 
        for the Web exhibition, the team decided to instead use animated characters 
        to tell the story. To add a level of realism, it was then decided to place 
        those characters on 'real' backgrounds. All of the background 
        images that were used were photographs taken on previous trips to the 
        region.</p>
      <p>The physical exhibition has five exhibits that each 
        deal with a different sort of traditional knowledge or technology: fish 
        traps; animal tracking; making fire; navigation, and the Burarra seasonal 
        calendar. These were the only topics that were shared with the original 
        exhibition development team, and so were the only ones available for the 
        on-line exhibition. In any case, the online exhibition was being driven 
        by the research opportunity so it had to deal with similar material to 
        the physical exhibition.</p>
      <h2>Storyboarding</h2>
      <p>The original storyline had some more 'branches' 
        to the wet and dry season adventures than the finished exhibition has. 
        But essentially, the original sketches for the flow of the story developed 
        into the finished product. The intention was always to represent a busy 
        day, where the visitor is able to try out or observe some of the indigenous 
        technology along the way. While some of the experiences overlap between 
        the wet and dry season visits, these two parts of the adventure were designed 
        to be complementary, not just done in isolation from one another.</p>
      <p>The reason for splitting the adventure into wet and 
        dry season is that the Burarra people's seasonal calendar is itself 
        an exhibit in the physical exhibition, and we wanted to highlight it the 
        on-line version. Additionally, some of the technologies can only be used 
        at particular times of the year. For example, fish traps are only used 
        in the wet &#8211; the billabongs are empty in the dry!</p>
      <h2>Invitations and Permits</h2>
      <p>Aboriginal land in Australia is private land, and it 
        is against the law to visit without a permit. In many areas these permits 
        are not routinely issued to tourists just wanting to see the area - you 
        must be an invited guest. This is the case for the Burarra people's 
        land.</p>
      <p>The on-line exhibition development team struggled with 
        'inviting' people to Burarra when in reality they could not 
        go there. In fact, this proved to be so hard that the team decided to 
        leave it until we had written the adventure, to see if a solution presented 
        itself. In the end that is what happened, and at that stage we felt it 
        seemed obvious that Danaja would have invited his friend (the user) to 
        visit him. This is what happens in the initial stages of the on-line exhibition: 
        when you receive a letter from Danaja, choose which season you visit in 
        (wet or dry season), and apply for a permit to visit the Burarra people's 
        land.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><span class="caption">Fig.3: Burarra Gathering Visitation 
        Permit Applicati</span>on</p>
      <h2>Burarra Approvals</h2>
      <p>The biggest risk to the project was not obtaining the 
        final approval of the Burarra Elders, as by that time there would have 
        been no money available to substantially change the exhibition. Consequently, 
        we sought incremental approvals throughout the life of the project, involving 
        the community in the creative process. The on-line exhibition was not 
        put on-line until we had received the final signoff from the community.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="crane.fig4.jpg" alt="Older and Younger figures in a natural setting" width="319" height="241"></p>
      <p class=MsoCaption><span class="caption">Fig.4: Preliminary Website S</span>ketch</p>
      <p>We flew Peter Danaja down to Canberra for an intensive 
        two days, working through the adventure storyboards, and then the script, 
        word for word. While Peter was happy with the team's work, he made 
        many suggestions to improve the script. Peter also added in all of the 
        Burarra words that are heard in the dialogue. </p>
      <p>Peter made other suggestions to the storyline, including 
        adding some of the humorous interplay between the characters, and having 
        Wala-Wala forgetting his matches in the fire lighting sequence. The exhibition 
        team had carefully tried to avoid making him look foolish, but Peter thought 
        he would just as likely be forgetful!</p>
      <p>While he was in Canberra, we took the opportunity to 
        film Peter reading the script, performing the kinds of gestures that are 
        seen throughout the animation.</p>
      <h2>Aging Danaja</h2>
      <p>One of the more interesting approval stages was for 
        the character renderings. The drawings were both e-mailed and posted up 
        to Arnhem Land. While the Elders were happy with the general look of the 
        characters, they were uneasy with how young Danaja was. </p>
      <p>Danaja had been drawn to look about 12, the age of 
        the targeted audience. The problem was that a 12-year-old would not have 
        the knowledge that Danaja needed in the adventure. Once Danaja had been 
        made bigger and given more prominent facial features so that he looked 
        to be 15 or 16, the Elders were comfortable with him.</p>
      <p>The Elders also thought that Wala-Wala looked far too 
        neat &#8211; 'he's an old guy from the bush!' So we 
        made him look a bit scruffy!</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig. 6.  Final Approved Characters</p>
      <h2>Finding Voices</h2>
      <p>The Burarra language is considered to be endangered, 
        and is spoken by less than 600 people. The exhibition team was keen to 
        put some of the Burarra language onto the Web in the adventure and to 
        make the characters as real as possible.</p>
      <p>The development team was concerned about how to record 
        the voices of Burarra people for the soundtrack without being able to 
        afford to send a Director and/or Sound Operator all the way to Arnhem 
        Land. There was no recording studio available there anyway, and we also 
        wanted to video the voice actors so that the animators could get the lip-synching 
        right.</p>
      <p>We considered flying two Burarra people to Canberra 
        to do the recording, but again there really wasn't enough money 
        to do that. In the end we asked Peter Danaja if he thought local Canberran 
        (Ngunnawal) Indigenous actors could do it. Peter agreed, but said he would 
        like to train them on the pronunciation of the Burarra words. The coaching 
        was done by telephone, and the recording was made in a studio that was 
        generously donated by the National Museum of Australia. It was a very 
        long day, recording each line four times over. Peter was happy with the 
        final sound files, and that allowed us to proceed with lip-synching the 
        animation.</p>
      <h1>Refining Burarra</h1>
      <p>Just before the exhibition was launched, invaluable 
        user testing was done in the Usability Lab session at Museums on the Web 
        2003. Suggestions included changes to the placement of instructions in 
        the interactive adventure and also to the information on the introductory 
        page. The changes made for a much more intuitive experience, and stopped 
        people getting 'lost' as they moved through the activity. 
        I would also like to acknowledge the valuable suggestions made at that 
        time by Jim Spadaccini of Ideum.</p>
      <p>The development team also trialed the experience with 
        some school teachers and their students in Canberra prior to launch, and 
        again some useful suggestions were made and changes implemented.</p>
      <p>Many of the school's suggestions related to the 
        feedback given by Danaja and Wala-Wala in the interactive activities. 
        The feedback itself was fine, but the users were not noticing it when 
        it appeared on the side of the Web page. Once it was moved to centre stage 
        (where the subtitles appear), users saw it straight away.</p>
      <h1>Jumping Onto the Web</h1>
      <p>With all the improvements made and final approval received,<i> 
        Burarra Gathering</i> <i>Online</i> was launched on 22 May 2002. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="crane.fig7.jpg" alt="home page showing animated 16 year old character" width="400" height="288"></p>
      <p class=MsoCaption><span class="caption">Fig. 7. Burarra Gathering home</span>page 
        <a href="http://burarra.questacon.edu.au/" target="_blank">http://burarra.questacon.edu.au</a></p>
      <p>Usage peaked in July at 6&nbsp;500 visitors and has 
        settled back to around 3&nbsp;000 per month. Around half of the visitors 
        are from North America, and 15% are from Europe.</p>
      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <p>The first essential feedback was from Peter Danaja 
        and the other Burarra Elders when they approved the whole of the completed 
        project for release and linked to it from their community Web site.</p>
      <p>Questacon received international recognition soon 
        after the release of <i>Burarra Gathering: Sharing Indigenous Knowledge</i> 
        online. The Exploratorium awarded it a Ten Cool Sites Award for 'educational 
        excellence'; USA Today made it a 'Hot Site' for the 
        July 4 holiday; Yahooligans featured it; and there were articles in the 
        on-line versions of The Sydney Morning Herald (2003) and The Guardian 
        (2003).</p>
      <p>The most rewarding feedback was learning that the site 
        had been used in its first weeks in an education program that introduced 
        the Internet to school students in remote central desert Indigenous communities 
        centered on Alice Springs. Even though these students live about 2&nbsp;000&nbsp;km 
        away from Burarra and the coastline, they still saw the Burarra experience 
        as a reflection of their own culture. The development team saw this as 
        a special affirmation of a job well done. </p>
      <p>We received this special feedback by accident when 
        I interviewed an educator in Alice Springs on a totally different topic.</p>
      <p>The site has also been recognized as a valuable Indigenous 
        on-line resource by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission 
        (ATSIC) and other government and educational bodies in Australia, including 
        AMOL, EdNA and some of the various State school authorities.</p>
      <p>Recently the Akva natural science centre in Piteå in 
        northern Sweden approached Questacon and asked if they could display <i>Burarra 
        Gathering Online</i> on their museum floor. We were happy to let them 
        do this, and it will go ahead in 2004. Ulrika Nilsson, the Director of 
        Akva, made contact via the user feedback e-mail address on the <i>Burarra 
        Gathering</i> Web site.</p>

      <h1>Evaluation</h1>
      <p>The original impetus for the development of <i>Burarra 
        Gathering</i> <i>Online</i> was the evaluation of the learning outcomes 
        achieved by physical and on-line versions of the same exhibition. As this 
        article is written, that research project is underway, and it is hoped 
        that the research findings will be available by the time of the Museums 
        and the Web conference in March 2004.</p>
      <p>The main aim of the research project is to 'show 
        how online exhibitions can inspire, entertain and potentially change visitor 
        attitudes relative to onsite exhibitions'. It is hoped that the 
        report will be a useful tool used in deciding the allocation of money 
        for the mix of physical and on-line exhibitions for a number of Australia's 
        national cultural institutions.</p>
      <p>The research will include observations of visitors 
        in the <i>Burarra Gathering</i> gallery and people using the on-line version, 
        interviews with selected visitors and users, and focus groups of both 
        adults and children who have used both modes of the exhibition.</p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>The two <i>Burarra Gathering </i>exhibitions have shown 
        Questacon that indigenous knowledge can be represented in engaging exhibitions, 
        both physical and on-line. <i>Burarra Gathering</i> also allowed the Centre 
        to experiment with the development of on-line exhibitions, and Questacon 
        is very proud of the positive recognition <i>Burarra Gathering Online</i> 
        has received from around the world. </p>
      <p>Perhaps most important, the two exhibitions required 
        the nurturing of a close and trusting relationship with a remote aboriginal 
        community on the other side of the country. And while the production process 
        was delayed by gaining the various approvals from the community, we feel 
        that the end product justified the extra time and expense involved.</p>
      <p>It's exciting to know that Questacon will be 
        putting this new knowledge and expertise to use in the near future, with 
        a new project that will again allow some Indigenous communities to tell 
        their own stories on the Web. This will most likely be done with communities 
        in the Gulf of Carpentaria in Queensland. Hopefully we can let know about 
        that at next year's conference! </p>
