  <p class="PaperTitle">Memory and Territory: New Forms of Virtuality for the Museum</p>
  <p class="Author">Elisa Giaccardi, Fondazione Fitzcarraldo, Italy</p>
  <p class="URL"><a href="http://www.fitzcarraldo.it/" target="_blank">http://www.fitzcarraldo.it</a></p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
   <p class="AbstractText">The use of the term <i>virtual</i> is 
      commonly associated with the idea of an extension of reality. Similarly, the 
      expression <i>virtual museum</i> is usually adopted to mean a process of duplication 
      of a physical museum and its objects, enabled by information technologies. 
      Therefore, <i>virtual museum</i> has become a useful synonym for multimedia 
      products or Web sites capable of providing new and fresh experiences of a 
      specific museum and its heritage. However, in order to understand and explore 
      further opportunities, profound reflection is necessary. We need to question 
      and investigate the contemporary role of the museum, and then challenge this 
      by producing innovative visions, solutions, and technological experimentation. 
      In what ways do new technologies enhance the collective and relational nature 
      of the museum? What cultural role and significance can physical artifacts 
      assume in the digital age? Can a virtual museum promote the social dimension 
      of a new, digital creativity linked to actual cultural artifacts? This paper 
      aims to respond to these questions and to identify new forms of virtuality 
      for the museum, focusing on the ideas of territory, local community, and collective 
      memory. The presentation of some exemplary projects will contribute both to 
      the evolution of the idea of <i>virtual museum</i> and to the use of information 
      technologies. </p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>All museums are virtual, independent of information technologies. 
      Museums extract each object from an environment which, at the site 
      of origin, is deemed to hold some significance. The object is then transferred 
      to a new site, the museum, in which the relationships with 
      its original environment and time are recreated. In this sense museums are 
      virtual, since they collect pieces that work as a switch to &#8216;something else'. 
      They already represent, somehow, a <i>meta-place</i> (Luca dal Pozzolo, personal 
      communication).</p>
  <p>Cultural objects, <i>i.e.</i> the objects placed and transformed 
      within a museum, should also be considered as virtual. They present the ambiguity 
      of a tangible physical existence as a museum piece, but they are subject to 
      change according to the different perspectives from which they can be interpreted 
      and presented (Benedetti, 2002). They are "iridescent", and should be considered 
      as "representing a complex and multifaceted reality in which physical, cultural 
      and virtual reality interact and may acquire different functions and different 
      degrees of importance" (Benedetti, 2002, p. 56).</p>
  <p>Nowadays, by means of information technologies, we can empower 
      the interaction between these dimensions and attribute to them different functions 
      and degrees of importance according to the reality that we need to represent. 
      However, many people believe 
      that we can finally manage, thanks to information technologies, to have museums 
      that are fully <i>virtual</i>, with no further need for physical objects.</p>
  <p>The first applications of the concept of virtuality in the museum were based 
      on this approach. These forms of virtuality do not question the contemporary 
      nature of the museum, but simply enhance the virtual component that is inherent 
      in it. In this way they contribute to the development of new forms of learning 
      and knowledge construction, but fail to provide new ways to present objects 
      that have previously been unimaginable. Instead, the imaginative capability 
      of the designer should be directed at the creation of new technology which 
      activates emotional mechanisms; new methods of producing meaning that were 
      not possible before modern information technologies; new ways actualizing 
    &#8216;cultural objects' capable of triggering new relationships and engendering 
      new knowledge.</p>
  <p>As Eisenbeis (1999) points out, this is not only an opportunity, 
      but also a need. We are increasingly stimulated by information and 
      communication technologies, and we are witnessing an accelerating process 
      of cultural change in which the transformation of the structure and function 
      of museums will need design approaches and concepts capable of integrating 
      effectively their material and immaterial components.</p>
  <h1>A  <i>Virtual Museum</i>:  What Is It?</h1>
  <p>The term <i>virtual </i>is commonly associated with the 
      idea of an extension of reality. Similarly, the expression <i>virtual museum</i> 
      is usually adopted to mean a process of duplication of physical museum and 
      its objects, enabled by information technologies. Therefore, <i>virtual museum</i> 
      has become a useful synonym for multimedia products or Web sites capable of 
      providing new and fresh experiences of a specific museum and its heritage.</p>
  <h2>Duplication and extension of reality</h2>
  <p>One of the most common opportunities offered by information 
      technologies is provided by the possibility of reproducing our cultural artifacts 
      digitally. In addition to the exploitation of the associative capabilities 
      of hypertext and to the visual potential of multimedia languages, this allows 
      any kind of information to become readily available and easily consulted.</p>
  <p>The visual and interactive 
      features of information technologies have massively contributed to the growth 
      of knowledge and to new processes of learning based on more immediate and 
      intuitive forms of knowledge construction. </p>
  <h2>Recombination and personalization</h2>
  <p>Moreover, thanks to telematics, the opportunities 
      for interactive access to real museum objects have dramatically increased, 
      opening new paths to the elaboration of knowledge. Maximizing all the images 
      and the information available through the Web means transforming the museum 
      into a kind of mobile encyclopedia (Bertuglia et al., 1999). Rather than taking 
      the obligatory path the visitor is compelled to follow in a real museum, remote 
      visitors to a virtual museum are free to look for, combine and re-contextualize 
      the information they need according to their interests.</p>
  <h2>Interconnection</h2>
  <p>This revolution in accessibility enables the interconnection and horizontal 
      recombination of all the contents; <i>i.e.</i> the museum objects themselves. 
      Thus, the museum becomes a non-place where one can find things 
      that cannot be found in a real museum, and it does not look like any other 
      real museum or real place. It becomes possible, therefore, in a virtual museum 
      to rebuild collections scattered around the world, organize exhibitions that 
      last forever, produce restorations and reconstructions, and have access to 
      specialized information. The virtual museum 
      becomes a system of interconnections (De Kerckhove), a new meta-place, 
      allowing visitors to identify and locate resources over the Internet.</p>
  <h2>First forms of virtuality for the museum</h2>
  <p>Duplication and extension of reality, recombination and personalization, and interconnection are elementary applications of the concept of virtuality 
      to the museum, since they simply enhance the virtual component that is inherent 
      in the nature of museums, rather than empowering the interaction among their 
      different dimensions (physical, cultural <i>and</i> virtual). In summary, they can be described as follows: (a) 
      the opportunity of extending reality through the duplication of the museum 
      objects, <i>i.e.</i> new forms of accessibility and new ways of communication; 
      (b) the opportunity of maximizing and recombining information by following 
      personal paths, <i>i.e.</i> new forms of knowledge construction and personalization; 
      (c) the opportunity of interconnecting contents over the Internet, and consequently 
      museum objects themselves, <i>i.e.</i> new spaces for display and collection.</p>
  <h1>Towards An Evolution of the Idea of Virtual<i> 
      Museum</i></h1>
  <p>The opportunities the museum is given by information technologies require 
      questioning and investigation of the contemporary role of the museum, and 
      then a challenge to this role through the production of innovative visions, 
      solutions, and technological experimentation. We need to understand the current 
      educational role of the museum in the present day, and show how the museum 
      can strengthen today the roots of the community it belongs to. Paraphrasing Bertuglia (1999), how can conservation and production, 
      information and creativity, representation and real-life coexist in a virtual 
      museum? What society and community do they refer to? I would add: what is 
      the role of technology? What new approaches to the design of a <i>virtual 
      museum</i> can be developed?</p>
  <p>In order to understand and explore further opportunities for the virtual 
      museum, understanding of technology must be transformed and a new perspective 
      sought out. We must understand 
      not only what <i>we</i> <i>can</i> do with information technologies, but most 
      of all what <i>we</i> <i>want </i>to do with them.</p>
  <h2>The Modernist model</h2>
  <p>As Hooper-Greehill (2000) 
      points out, museums are Illuministic creatures, and Illuminist thought aimed 
      at a model of knowledge reliable at any time and any place. The Modernist 
      museum, conceptually inherited from private collections, had to be encyclopaedic 
      and work as a sort of universal archive. The interconnected form of virtual 
      museum that has been previously described can be considered the evolution 
      of this model, in its global form. The Modernist museum's model for knowledge 
      transmission saw communication as a linear process, transferring the information 
      from an authoritative source to an uninformed receiver. This communication 
      model is at the same time jeopardized and strengthened by information technologies. 
      However, a few have tried to redesign the role of the museum, leaving this 
      model behind.</p>
  <h2>The discovery of the audience</h2>
  <p>Following constructivist theories on learning and a communication model that 
      gives due status to the role of the public's interpretation, 
      new professional museum roles have been created, and different audiences have 
      been recognized. The voice of the people has been heard, and this has led 
      to multiple and differentiated narratives from the museum, replacing the earlier 
      Modernist meta-narrative. Besides those applications supporting more interactive 
      and personalized learning processes, the discovery of the audience and the relational approaches this discovery 
      has produced (Bodo, 2000) have influenced the virtual dimension of the museum.</p>
  <h2>New complexities</h2>
  <p>I would suggest some possible paths, 
      using a couple of examples, for the evolution of the concept of virtual museum 
      and the development of a relational form of virtuality. My proposal is not 
      aimed at developing a new communicative competence towards the audience, as 
      most of the current relational approaches to museum management seem to do 
      (Luca dal Pozzolo, personal communication). The complexity of a museum, made 
      of relationships that are outside and inside the museum itself (<i>e.g.</i> 
      in the community and the territory to which the community belongs), creates 
      an environment that can be exploited not only to improve communication, acting 
      in synergy with the context, but also to make the reality of the museum structurally 
      open and dynamic.</p>
  <h2>The role of technology and the way of design</h2>
  <p>Information technologies enable innovation in the way the museum creates 
      relationships in both the communicative and the epistemological elements. 
      Hence, we must consider not only how information technologies can be used, 
      but also how they can allow us to rethink the museum. These technologies do 
      more than translate for the museum; they must also contribute to its <i>making.</i> 
      That is to say, they must help 
      us to invent new models of museum, and support new design methods. The most 
      interesting question both for designers and decision-makers should be: how 
      can I design a museum today by means of information technologies?</p>
  <p>In keeping with this approach are two cases presented below, where the Web 
      is used not as an exclusive and self-sufficient technological domain, but 
      as "primarily a form of thought and practice based on the concept of weaving" 
      (Ueno, 1996). These cases draw attention to the ways information 
      technologies can enhance the collective and relational nature of the museum 
      as well as to the cultural role and significance that physical artifacts can 
      assume in the digital age. They can be described as local museums, aimed at 
      collecting, preserving, and activating the material and immaterial resources 
      of the territory, local community, and collective memory to which they refer. 
      As local museums, they can link to living cultural artifacts forms of digital 
      creativity, in a way an art museum could not (unless in relationship to new 
      modes of artistic creation).</p>
  <h1>Case #1: The MUVI project</h1>
  <p>The Virtual Museum of the Collective Memory of Lombardia 
      Region (MUVI) is an Italian project that uses both the Web and the radio (http://www.url.it/muvi/). 
      By promoting storytelling and personal accounts, MUVI collects images and 
      voices, and translates the local community into a kind of living database. 
      The act of collective storytelling forms the origins of the museum, whilst 
      new technologies are used to actualize it. MUVI utilizes the material and 
      emotional resources of the community as well as the digital and interactive 
      properties of new media, integrated with the "warm" communication features 
      of radio.</p>
  <p>The MUVI project aims at exploiting the narrative potential 
      of multimedia language, integrating different means of communication. According 
      to the authors of the project, there are three types of multimedia communication. 
      The first has to do with the hypertext structure, as it is for the CD-ROM. 
      The second joins digital and paper support. The third, explored by the designers 
      of MUVI, is less common. It springs from the second, and adds to it a factor 
      of great importance: the participation of the users of the communication to 
      the construction of the communication itself.</p>
  <h2>The local community as living heritage</h2>
  <p>MUVI uses both the Web and the radio, together. Through 
      the lever of personal memory and storytelling, it collects images and stories 
      related to historical events and the everyday life of Lombardia people, and 
      transform the local community in a kind of active heritage. Access 
      to this material is provided via a database on the Web, designed with particular 
      care to support those unfamiliar with such technology. 
      Since MUVI is a museum for a large cross-audience, it is particularly important 
      that both the database and the Web site can be explored without letting the 
      emotional factor be crushed by technical factors.</p>

  <h2>The affective dimension of photographic image</h2>
  <p>On the Web, photographic pictures are the main visual tool 
      used to preserve the territorial memory of the community. This decision 
      stems from understanding that photography has been the most efficient instrument, 
      for more than a century, to pin down the memory of facts and lives. Personal 
      archives are very rich, and belong to the hundred thousand families that currently 
      live, or have lived in the past, in the territory of Lombardia. The project aims at saving this treasure by digitalization, 
      and making the resources visible and accessible: photos, old postcards, posters, book covers, details from a page 
      of a local paper. The photographic material collected could not be exhibited 
      in a real museum. Thousands of images, often very small, are useless if put 
      in showcases or on vertical panels in a real building. Moreover, the graphic 
      structure of the site and the way to visit it are perfect to make the private 
      and affective dimension of photography emerge, even though pictures are displayed 
      in an album which is publicly shared and constantly growing.</p>

  <h2>The Roles of radio and storytelling</h2>
  <p>The radio is an essential part of the project. It stimulates 
      in the people the will to take part in the construction of collective memory. 
      Radio Popolare in Milan is a station that has always maintained a very close 
      and warm (as McLuhan would say) relationship with a broad audience, and works 
      as one of the main partners of the project. It broadcasts periodic programs 
      to pick up contributions from those who, having sent in their pictures, want 
      to tell the story behind them, and from those who, having seen the pictures 
      on the Web, want to add further details and tell, in turn, their stories.</p>

  <p class="caption">Fig. 3. Transcription of a phone call to Radio Popolare 
        in Milan</p>
  <p>With radio, memory becomes tangible not through images, but 
      voices. As the authors of the project argue, the loop produced by the integration 
      between the Web and the radio enhances territorial and cultural identities, 
      and at the same time contributes to developing the idea that it is possible 
      to live together despite such differences. It is a process that invites people 
      to learn about others, to exchange values, to share the pleasure of telling 
      their own stories, and to listen to those of others. In MUVI the safekeeping of a collective memory 
      begins with the sharing of a personal memory that interweaves family memories, 
      news, and history.</p>

  <h2>Social synergies and organizational support</h2>
  <p>The MUVI project also creates forms of collaboration between young digitally 
      expert people and elderly persons who are attracted by the possibility of 
      publishing their memories on the screen of a computer. As images are evocative 
      of memories for any member of the family, this happens naturally, but if in 
      the family there is no computer expert, MUVI provides a network of scanners 
      and volunteers that users can access to fill the technological gap.</p>
  <h2>Innovative aspects of the project</h2>
  <p>The use of a warm media like radio, combined 
      with the affective value of pictures, is the key to getting people actively 
      involved in the construction of the museum. People's memories and storytelling 
      are the actual cultural heritage which creates the museum and substantiates 
      the project, as a sort of living database. Information technologies allow 
      the actualization of such a museum, enabling the collection, preservation, 
      and display of the images and stories that are its objects. In this way, integrating 
      the communicative features of a mass medium (the radio) with a digital continuum 
      (the Web), the MUVI project can trigger emotional and motivational mechanisms 
      within the community and allow the museum to access both material and immaterial 
      resources. The construction of the museum promotes spontaneous participation, 
      and contributes to strengthen cultural identity and the sense of belonging 
      to an identifiable territory. Moreover, through the activation of the social 
      networks and generational synergies that support the construction of the museum, 
      the project sustains and promotes the oral dimension of processes of learning 
      and knowledge transmission within the community. In brief, the innovative 
      aspects of this project can be summarized as the following: (a) the local 
      community as the living heritage of a specific territory; (b) the audience 
      as the main actor in the construction of the museum (<i>i.e.</i> in the production 
      of cultural objects and meaning); (c) the convergence of the features of the 
      Web with those of the radio, as a successful multimedia strategy.</p>
  <h1>Case #2: The Nibelungen Museum in Worms</h1>
  <p>The Nibelungen Museum at Worms (<a href="http://www.nibelungen-museum.de/" target="_blank">http://www.nibelungen-museum.de</a>) 
          digitizes and collects a heritage which exists in different formats, 
          scattered all over the world. It can be considered a virtual museum 
          even though it is physically located, because it makes visible something 
          that is invisible: myth. Here the Web is used not as a technological 
          domain, but provocatively as a relational form of thought and practice 
        that can help designers to think of a new and more sophisticated virtuality.</p>
  <p>The Nibelungen Museum at Worms brings 
      together, digitally, what would be impossible to collect otherwise, <i>i.e.</i> 
      all the images, pictures and works that the myth of the Nibelungs produced 
      all over the world, now scattered in many different museums, archives and 
      libraries. In order to make this dispersed heritage visible, the museum operates 
      on an inverse process to that of the MUVI project, <i>virtualizing</i> the 
      collective heritage of the myth in a physical site, rather than <i>actualizing</i> 
      it in a digital continuum.</p>
  <h2><i>Virtual </i>as museum object: representing the 
      myth</h2>
  <p>At Worms the visitor meets not a multimedia installation which has been placed 
      in a pre-existing museum, but a museum as a project, designed both in its 
      real and virtual components. In fact, both the project and the building were 
      created at the request of the town of Worms between 1997 and 2001 by A+H (Olivier 
      Auber and Bernd Hoge).</p>
  <p>In the Nibelungen Museum there are no collections, no rarities, no famous 
      paintings or jewels. Nonetheless, there is a treasure. According to the legend 
      of the Nibelungs, a long time ago a local hero threw the most famous treasure 
      that the world had ever known into the river Rhine, next to the town of Worms. 
      The most important piece of this treasure is a ring, known to be a never-ending 
      source of gold, love and joy to whoever owns it, as long as it is not used 
      for personal power. Many artists - like Wagner, for instance - drew inspiration 
      from this theme, transforming it into a real epic, a kind of Odyssey of the 
      North.</p><p>But what is myth? It is a total phenomenon. There are no 
      external points of view that can describe it objectively (Auber &amp; Hoge, 
      2001). How is it possible to talk about myth, then? And, to talk of this myth 
      in particular? The Nibelungen Museum could not be a scientific museum. It 
      is a sort of creation in itself, which allows the virtual materialization 
      of the works inspired in the course of many centuries by the theme of the 
      Nibelungs.</p>
  <h2>Connecting the collective memory</h2>
  <p>In the building, the tour is guided by the voice of a narrator, no other 
      than the hypothetical author of the Nibelungenlied. The museum is divided 
      into three parts, and the first two are oriented by the voice of the narrator. 
      In the Tower of Sight the narrator explains, develops and criticizes the historical, 
      literary and artistic connections that have built the myth of the Nibelungs. 
      Through the architectural devices in the Tower, the visitor identifies the 
      main chapters of the literary work or the different stages in the building 
      of the myth. Then, in the Listening 
      Tower, the narrator presents the works that can be listened to there.</p>
  <p>The myth of the Nibelungs takes form in the images and pictures scattered 
      all over the world in museums, archives and libraries. All these images - 
      paintings, bas-reliefs, propaganda posters and stage pictures - convey part 
      of the influence of the myth. In the museum there are only a small percentage 
      of them, even though it houses thousands of images. Seeing these images one 
      by one, all together, would take days. But thanks to the narrator, it is possible 
      to catch the invisible movements that have brought them together through the 
      centuries.</p>
  <p>These images are stored and arranged in a sort of myth-machine in the Tower 
      of Sight, opened by the narrator in the Listening Tower, and finally floated 
      into an underground space, which is the third part of the Museum, the Treasure. 
      Here they gradually resurface from an idealized "bottom of the world", appearing 
      as bubbles of memory. Like the movements that disturb dreams, the navigation 
      tools of this installation can interfere with the movements of the images, 
      affecting from time to time their journey towards the surface. In the Treasure, 
      voices, sounds and music are as important as the images. Myth is the result 
      of the meeting between the uniqueness of observation and action, and therefore 
      like collective memory is always evolving. In the installation images, voices, 
      sounds and music are all created in real time by means of generative software 
      purposefully conceived for the project, and they follow the visitor's explorations 
      and urges.</p>
  <h2>Supporting myth through generative technologies</h2>
  <p>The Treasure Room is the third 
      and final stage of the museum. It is a cylindrical underground room, nine 
      metres in diameter, with an almost 360 degree screen that surrounds the viewers. 
      Visitors can see the town of Worms from below, its monuments and buildings, 
      as if the ground were transparent. This underground space is the imaginary 
      space of myth where images, sound and music are ceaselessly generated in real 
      time and take shape. Here the music and the voices of a vocal quartet are 
      evanescent and interactive, with no beginning and no end. It is the viewers' 
      movement in space, their interest in an object, that generates and combines 
      them on the basis of their position on the interface. In this generative context, 
      it is the relationship of the visitors to the room that allows each of them 
      to build a personal path, one that reflects a personal sense of time, memory 
      and listening.</p>
  <h2>Innovative aspects of the project</h2>
  <p>The Nibelungen Museum at Worms 
      supports the mechanisms that have created and produced the myth through the 
      centuries, and it regenerates them again and again. It gives form to a kind 
      of subconscious that symbolizes the &#8216;time wall', and in which the world finds 
      its place. The images, digitally collected in the museum, emerge as different 
      and continuous representations of the myth in the course of time (pictures, 
      paintings, films, operas&#8230;), attracted and repulsed by the three central elements 
      of myth (the ring, the magic word and the sword), that in the space of the 
      installation represent the navigation tools of the visitors. Connecting the 
      visible and the invisible, the town space and the poetic space of myth, modern 
      times and mythical eternity, the Nibelungen Museum at Worms explores a new 
      form of virtuality based on technology-enhanced processes of mythopoiesis.</p>

  <p>In brief, the innovative aspects of this 
      project can be summarized as the following: (a) the myth as museum object; 
      (b) the collection as a mere representation; and (c) fruition as creation 
      by means of technologies for the generation of virtual environments in real 
      time.</p>
  <h1>Conclusions</h1>
  <p>Enhancing the collective and relational nature of the museum, 
      information technologies can attribute to physical artifacts a new cultural 
      role and significance, and promote the social dimension of a new digital creativity 
      linked to actual cultural artifacts. The cases presented in this paper help 
      us to respond to questions about the contemporary role of the museum, and 
      to identify new forms of virtuality for the museum, producing innovative visions, 
      solutions, and technological experimentations.</p>
  <p>The need for a powerful framework for the understanding and developing of 
      new cultural strategies in a networked society deals with a general re-conceptualization 
      of our cultural institutions, our categories of the physical and virtual, 
      and their creative relationships. Through the analysis of concrete design 
      instances, significantly focused on the ideas of territory, 
      local community, and collective memory, the paper examines the notion 
      of <i>virtual museum</i> and promotes new creative strategies for its development, 
      rather than re-proposing technological versions of a Modernist model of museum.</p>
  <p>The insights produced by the projects presented in this paper can contribute 
      to conceptualizing the design of interactive environments and devices as a 
      methodology for cultural development. They promote the use of information 
      technologies as tools to strengthen the tie between cultural resources and 
      territory, and empower the active and constructive role of local communities, 
      their mutual relationship with institutional stakeholders, and their link 
      to cultural artifacts.</p>
