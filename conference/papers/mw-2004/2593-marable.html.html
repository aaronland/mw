    <p class="PaperTitle">Experience, Learning, and Research: Coordinating the Multiple 
      Roles of On-line Exhibitions</p>
    <p class="Author">Bart Marable, Terra Incognita, USA</p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
     <p class="AbstractText">On-line exhibitions are complex undertakings that serve 
      the needs of diverse audiences. Users range from general interest visitors 
      with little knowledge of the subject, to teachers looking for supporting materials 
      for classrooms, to amateur scholars using the site as a research tool. With 
      effective coordination, the same on-line exhibition can support these multiple 
      roles. Three elements are important for this coordination: layered content, 
      multiple points of entry, and connecting storylines. Layered content divides 
      the exhibition content into several distinct tiers. Multiple points of entry 
      give direct access to these distinct layers of content. And third, connecting 
      storylines allow visitors to follow a theme or topic between the tiers. On-line 
      exhibition organizers can use this multiple-tier approach to produce better-coordinated 
      on-line content that meets the ever-increasing expectations of ever-more sophisticated 
      audiences.</p>

    <p class="BlockQuote">"[I]t is possible to make many, if not most, exhibits 
      so that they can each individually be appreciated and enjoyed on a variety 
      of levels."</p>
    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Frank Oppenheimer, the Exploratorium (McLean, 2001)</p>
    <p>While early exhibit Web sites were marketing tools intended 
      merely to promote attendance of the "real" exhibit, in recent years exhibit 
      organizers have developed increased interest in and appreciation for the potential 
      of full-fledged on-line exhibitions. They are now seen as vitally important 
      tools not only for increasing awareness of the real-world exhibition, but 
      also for increasing the exhibit's reach and (in the case of temporary exhibitions) 
      its lifespan. And, in a growing number of cases, on-line-only exhibitions 
      are now being mounted, without a corresponding physical presence.</p>
    <p>Who visits these on-line exhibitions, and what are they 
      looking for? Like their real-world counterparts, on-line visitors come from 
      a very broad spectrum of society, and they come for a variety of reasons. 
      Some visitors come knowing very little about the exhibit's topic, while others 
      may consider themselves experts in the subject. Some like having the freedom 
      to pick and choose topics to explore, while others like having a clear path 
      to follow. Some visitors are visually oriented, while others like reading. 
      Some are looking for the answer to a specific question. Others are just looking 
      for an enjoyable experience. In other words, on-line exhibits attract visitors 
      from all different backgrounds, each with different interests and capabilities.</p>
    <p>With so many different audiences, on-line exhibit organizers 
      often struggle with the shape and approach of their on-line project. Should 
      it be an immersive learning experience like a physical exhibit, where visitors 
      explore themes and objects carefully selected and organized by the curators? 
      Or, at the other extreme, should it let the visitor play the part of curator, 
      empowering him to search for objects and draw his own conclusions? Should 
      it be organized by theme? By object? By time period?</p>
    <p>I believe that with effective coordination, the same on-line 
      exhibition can support multiple roles. In this paper, I will examine a model 
      for planning and designing on-line exhibitions that can meet the needs of 
      these diverse audiences. First I will explore the background and components 
      of this integrated exhibit model, explaining the reasons behind its development. 
      Then, I will examine three projects that have used this model, and deconstruct 
      the ways that the model has been applied in each on-line exhibit's content, 
      structure, and design.</p>
    <h1>The Integrated On-line Exhibit Model</h1>
    <p class="caption"><a href="marableFig1.html"><img src="marable_fig1.jpg" alt="diagram of the integreated model" width="400" height="320" border="0"></a></p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="Fig1"></a>Fig. 1: The Integrated On-line Exhibit Model</p>
    <p>The Integrated On-line Exhibit Model (Fig. 1) is the result 
      of our studio's work with numerous large-scale on-line museum exhibitions. 
      It has evolved both from our attempts to translate traditional exhibit design 
      techniques to this new medium, and from our discovery of methods unique to 
      the on-line environment. At the core of the model is the belief that on-line 
      exhibitions can harness the shape-shifting power of interactive media to take 
      multiple (yet coordinated) forms. The model has three important elements: 
      layered content, multiple points of entry, and connecting storylines. Layered 
      content divides the exhibition content into distinct tiers. Multiple points 
      of entry give access to these distinct layers of content. And third, connecting 
      storylines allow visitors to follow a theme or topic between the tiers.</p>
    <h2>Layered Content</h2>
    <p>The first element of the model is layered content. This 
      approach involves dividing the exhibition into multiple sections based on 
      several criteria: the needs of different visitors, content detail and organization, 
      the level of curatorial voice, and issues of content growth and management. 
      The number, format and approach of these levels will vary from project to 
      project, but there are some general conclusions that may be drawn.</p>
    <p>First, these layers fall along a format spectrum. At one 
      end of the spectrum, the site takes the form of an entertaining, immersive, 
      linear experience that is low on content but high on emotional engagement. 
      At the other end of the spectrum, the site becomes a powerful research application, 
      completely non-linear, structured by the visitor, and ever growing in its 
      content.</p>
    <p>Second, the same content may be used in more than one layer, 
      but its use might be very different in each one. For example, an artifact 
      might be used simultaneously in an orientation program, as a part of a thematic 
      exhibit, and as a record in a database. As a part of the orientation program, 
      it might build emotional interest in the story. In the thematic exhibit, it 
      might support a curatorial point. As a database record, it might be examined 
      as an individual object.</p>
    <p>In order for the model to work, the exhibit needs at least 
      two layers, and preferably three. Below, I will outline three typical levels, 
      moving along the format spectrum from "research application" to "immersive 
      experience".</p>
    <h3>Level one: Research</h3>
    <p>The first level, and the foundation of the model, is made 
      up of the sources of the exhibition - the historic artifacts, the scientific 
      specimens, the objects of art, as well as secondary sources such as books 
      and articles. These are the raw materials on which the intellectual framework 
      of the exhibit is built.</p>
    <p>In this level, the target audience is experts, those who 
      are familiar with the general topic. Scholars and higher-level students fall 
      within this group, but so do other enthusiasts, such as collectors or historical 
      re-enactors. This audience is typically goal-oriented in their visit, looking 
      for a specific object or group of objects. Here, the on-line exhibit becomes 
      much more powerful than the physical one. While space limitations and conservation 
      issues are limitations on real-world displays, on-line exhibits can provide 
      near-limitless repositories of object information in the virtual collections.</p>
    <p>The content in this level is intended to grow and change, 
      as new objects are added to the collection, new information is uncovered, 
      and new books are published. For this reason, the level's content is usually 
      stored in a database, and supported by content management tools for easy updates 
      by museum staff.</p>
    <p>The organization of content at the research level is completely 
      non-linear since the visitor can group and regroup items based on his own 
      criteria. The exhibit can provide tools to help the visitors find content 
      matching certain criteria, such as keyword searches or topical filters.</p>
    <h3>Level two: Exhibit</h3>
    <p>In the middle of the format spectrum, between research 
      application and immersive experience, the second level provides the majority 
      of the interpretive and educational content. It provides curatorial context 
      to the primary sources held in the research level. Aimed at a general audience, 
      the organization at the exhibit level is a mixture of linear and non-linear. 
      Here, visitors can choose among topics and themes selected by the exhibition 
      organizers. Like in real-world exhibitions, the arrangement and presentation 
      of content in these exhibits could range from simple text and graphic panels 
      to complex hands-on activities. While the content and design should be consistent 
      enough to maintain the identity of the exhibition, it should also be varied 
      enough to maintain visitor interest.</p>
    <h3>Level three: Experience</h3>
    <p>The third tier provides an emotionally engaging (and entertaining) 
      experience that brings to life the story of the exhibition for novice and 
      general audiences. This tier is the most mediated and narrative-driven of 
      the tiers, and usually takes the form of a story, with a clear beginning, 
      middle, and end. Here the goal is to spark the visitor's interest in the subject, 
      and to provide an intriguing orientation that will encourage deeper exploration. 
      Models such as cinema and theater provide possible approaches to compelling 
      experiences. Although this "old media" approach may seem to run counter to 
      the non-linear, user-controlled character of the Web, recent studies have 
      shown that using an entertaining, curated experience with links to additional 
      information can actually encourage deeper exploration (Vergo, 2001). This 
      finding is not so different from the ways that physical museums use orientation 
      films and introductory experiences. As British designers James Gardner and 
      Caroline Heller have written,</p>
    <p class="BlockQuote">Novelty, charm, ingenuity, movement, people doing things, 
      tricks and mystery, something really big and clever: these are the ingredients 
      of successful display. Attention once captured may be stimulated and directed 
      but it is a mistake to think you can ever start at a "higher level" and assume 
      the concentration of the most specialised public. (McLean, 2001)</p>
    <h2>Multiple Points of Entry</h2>
    <p>The second element of the model is multiple entry points. 
      Multiple points of entry give different audiences access to the layer of content 
      that best meets their needs. While a general interest visitor may find an 
      engaging interactive experience worthwhile, a teacher or scholar may wish 
      to jump directly to the type of content that most directly meets their respective 
      needs. Similarly, general audiences may not have enough knowledge of the topic 
      to navigate a powerful search tool, and would need help in putting objects 
      into context.</p>
    <h2>Connecting Storylines</h2>
    <p>Recognizing the inherent narrative-driven aspect of exhibitions, 
      the third element is connecting storylines. This method encourages visitors 
      to follow a theme or topic between the layers. Using this approach, general 
      interest visitors could follow such a connection from the experience (third 
      level) to an interpretive exhibit screen (second level) and even further to 
      the primary sources (first level). This path could just as easily move in 
      the other direction as well.</p>
    <h1>The Model in Action</h1>
    <p>The model is not a hard and fast outline of how to structure 
      an on-line exhibit, but is rather a guide. The unique characteristics of an 
      exhibit's content and themes will greatly influence its final format. To show 
      how the model can be modified, I will now describe three projects our studio 
      has produced using variations of the model.</p>
    <h2>Becoming Human</h2>
    <p class="caption"><a href="http://www.becominghuman.org/"><img src="marable_fig2.jpg" alt="Evidence ... the scientific quest begins with the fossil record ... " width="400" height="255" border="0"></a></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig. 2: Becoming Human. <a href="http://www.becominghuman.org/" target="_blank">http://www.becominghuman.org</a></p>
    <p>This interactive documentary experience (Fig. 2), developed 
      for the Institute of Human Origins, tells the story of our species, both where 
      we've come from and the unique traits that make us human. In <b>Becoming Human</b>, 
      the experience level took the form of a television-like documentary. This 
      original program uses animated still photographs, narration, music, and sound 
      effects, to deliver an experience similar to watching a PBS documentary. Donald 
      Johanson, the paleontologist who discovered the Lucy skeleton, narrates this 
      30 minute program, which is divided into smaller story segments. The exhibit 
      level is composed of over 40 topical exhibits that use text, photographs, 
      illustrations, animation, and audio interviews to explore the same themes 
      covered in the documentary, but in more detail. The research level has several 
      components, including 360&deg; skull rotations of our hominid ancestors and a 
      database-driven collection of vetted Web sites and articles.</p>
    <p>The site is broken down into four main sections <b>(Evidence</b>, 
      <b>Anatomy</b>, <b>Lineages</b>, and <b>Culture</b>), and from each of the 
      section menus there are entry points to all three levels. Most prominent is 
      the link to the section of the documentary for that topic. Beneath that, a 
      scrolling bar outlines the exhibits connected with the topic. And at the bottom 
      on the screen are links to the hominid profiles and references.</p>
    <p>While each level of Becoming Human works separately, our 
      aim from the outset was to encourage deep exploration of the subject. To do 
      that, we developed numerous points in the narrative that provide a bridge 
      between the layers. For example, as a visitor watches a documentary segment 
      about paleontological digs in Ethiopia, a small "bug" appears in the lower 
      portion of the screen inviting him to "learn more." Clicking this link pauses 
      the documentary, and takes the visitor to the exhibit level, where he can 
      learn about fossil digs and even take a stroll through a virtual dig site. 
      If he wants to learn even more, he can click the link in the reference section 
      to pull up a list of Web sites and articles related to paleontological digs. 
      His curiosity satisfied, the visitor can then return to the documentary to 
      continue his journey.</p>
    <h2>The Dynamic Earth</h2>

    <p>Based on the extensive Janet Annenberg Hooker Geology, 
      Gems, and Minerals Hall at the National Museum of Natural History, the Dynamic 
      Earth (Fig. 3) tells the story of our planet's origins and ongoing evolution. 
      Since the content was so diverse and because there was no central narrative, 
      the Dynamic Earth has only two levels: exhibit and research. Like Becoming 
      Human, the Dynamic Earth has dozens of hands-on exhibits in the exhibit level. 
      However, one of the more powerful features is the database-driven GeoGallery, 
      which allows visitors to find geological specimens based on specific criteria, 
      such as classification or geographic origin. These two layers are directly 
      connected, so that visitors can follow links from interpretive exhibits to 
      explore specimens in greater detail. This function also works in reverse. 
      For example, visitors can search for specimens in the GeoGallery and follow 
      links to related content in the exhibit level, to see the specimen in context.</p>
    <h2>Lewis &amp; Clark: The National Bicentennial Exhibition</h2>
    <p class="caption"><img src="marable_fig4.jpg" width="400" height="261" border="0"></p>
    <p class="caption">Fig. 4: Lewis &amp; Clark: The National Bicentennial 
        Exhibition. <a href="http://www.lewisandclarkexhibit.org/" target="_blank">http://www.lewisandclarkexhibit.org</a></p>
    <p>This Web site (Fig. 4) draws on seven years of research 
      into the artifacts of the Lewis and Clark expedition, presenting newly discovered 
      artifacts and original source material gathered from over 60 institutions 
      nationwide. Never before has such a wide and varied collection of Lewis and 
      Clark material been available to the public in such a carefully researched 
      and authenticated forum. But like the exhibition on which it is based, the 
      on-line exhibition asks new questions about a familiar story. Instead 
      of interpreting the journey of Lewis and Clark as an encounter with the natural 
      landscape, it focuses on the human landscape - the social and cultural geographies 
      that Lewis and Clark traversed. It portrays the crossing of cultural 
      divides as perilous and daunting as the continental divides the explorers 
      had to scale.</p>
    <p>In this site, the experience level took the form of an 
      interactive journey map in which visitors can explore the narrative of Lewis 
      and Clark's expedition. The visitor follows the same path as the explorers, 
      up the Missouri, across the Rocky Mountains, and to the Pacific Ocean. Along 
      the way, the visitor encounters artifacts, audio quotes, and an ever-changing 
      soundscape that blends sounds of the environment with traditional American 
      Indian music from the tribes encountered by Lewis and Clark.</p>
    <p>The exhibit level is based on ten provocative explorations 
      of Indian cultures, along such themes as gender, politics, trade, mapping, 
      and curing. Over a hundred interpretive exhibits combine text, photos, audio, 
      and video, to examine the cultural geography of American Indians and the Euro-American 
      world of Lewis and Clark.</p>
    <p>Finally, the reference level is a database-driven gallery 
      of over 300 artifacts used in the exhibition. Visitors can search by keyword 
      and limit their searches to specific criteria, such as material or maker. 
      Each of the records contains a high-resolution image of the artifact that 
      visitors can examine in extremely close detail.</p>
    <p>Numerous connections have been integrated into the exhibition 
      levels. For example, in the journey map experience, as visitors learn about 
      the tense stand-off between Lewis and Clark and the Teton Sioux, there is 
      a prominent connection to a related thematic exhibit about diplomacy.</p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>One of the inherent strengths of interactive media is its 
      ability to reshape itself in order to provide multiple perspectives on the 
      same subject. Applying this strength to on-line exhibitions gives organizers 
      the opportunity to use a single on-line exhibit to meet the needs of diverse 
      audiences. The Integrated On-line Exhibit Model is the summation of our studio's 
      work to date in the creation of a workable pattern for coordinating the multiple 
      roles of on-line exhibitions. The approach outlined in this paper is working 
      model, and we hope that it will continue to evolve as new techniques are discovered 
      and new ideas are implemented.</p>
