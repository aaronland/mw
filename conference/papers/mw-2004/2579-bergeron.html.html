        Approach</p>

       <p class="AbstractText">The Children's Museum of Boston launched its Web 
          site in 1997 primarily to establish a Web presence and offer basic visitor 
          information. The marketing manager oversaw the site, squeezing it in 
          to her already busy schedule. Then, in 2000, the Museum formed teams 
          to tackle work such as the Web site that needed Museum-wide input. This paper examines how having a team responsible for a Web site works 
          and how a Web site can prosper when it is cared for by a diverse group 
        of Museum employees.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Children's museums exist to provide children with experiences that 
          stimulate their curiosity and enhance their learning on many levels, 
          but in order to reach the children, we must first reach their parents.
		   The Children's Museum of Boston's Web site must serve the 
          dual purpose of making parents sure that a visit to our Museum will 
          be not only a valuable and fun experience for their children, but also 
          a relatively stress-free outing: information about how to get there 
          and where to park; where to change diapers; whether there's a 
          breastfeeding area; and what food options are available are just as 
          important as what exhibits and programs we have. And of course, new 
          parents tend to be young, in their twenties and early thirties, and 
          have grown up using the Web in college and work. They are likely to 
        be comfortable with and accustomed to finding answers on-line.</p>
      <p>Teachers and school groups are an integral part of the audience for 
          children's museums. The Children's Museum of Boston was founded by 
          teachers as a place for teachers to share resources and learn new techniques 
          and methods, as well as a place to bring their students. The site <a href="http://www.bostonkids.org/" target="_blank">www.BostonKids.org</a>        must reflect the importance of teachers and teaching to our Museum, 
        and should also provide a place for teachers to share resources and 
      learn.</p>
      <h1>Part I &#8211; www.BostonKids.org is Born! The Evolution&#8230;</h1>
      <p>In 1997, the Board, management staff, and IT department of The Children's 
          Museum decided that the time had come for the Museum to have a Web site. At that time the primary concern was to establish our name, BostonKids.org, 
        and to establish a presence on the Web with information for visitors. The Marketing and IT departments created the initial home page and support 
        pages through a volunteer effort at the Museum. From the very beginning, 
          the Museum planned the Web site to be both a marketing tool and a content-rich 
        resource, with three main content areas: parents, teachers, and kids.</p>
      <p>Quite soon after that initial effort, it became the responsibility 
          of the Marketing Manager to post and update information on the growing 
          Web site, in addition to her many other responsibilities. Due to her 
          heavy workload and the lack of staff participation, it was inevitable 
          that the site was often behind schedule with visitor information, had 
          broken links, outdated information, and an inconsistent look and feel. Meanwhile, other divisions within the Museum, notably the Teacher Center, 
        which received grants to develop Native American content for the Web 
        and its Kits program during this time, were working on their own particular 
        content areas. This state of affairs continued for some time, while 
          the Marketing Manager continued to urge the Museum to consider the Web 
          site as more that just a marketing tool; that it was, in fact, a Museum-wide 
        priority. </p>
      <p>Then, in 2000, the Museum did some reorganizing at the senior level 
          and Neil Gordon, formerly Chief Financial Officer, became Chief Operating 
          Officer, with one of his charges being to fully integrate the various 
          content areas of the Museum. He stepped in with the concept of Museum-wide 
          teams to manage Museum-wide products and priorities (See Part II), and 
          from that concept, Web Team was born. Web Team was created with people 
          from all 9 divisions in the Museum, and was told the goal was: <b>Fix 
        the Web Site. </b></p>
      <p>Web Team started right away, first assessing all the areas of weakness 
          in the site, and setting priorities and task lists to remedy the ailing 
          site. Web Team proposed a small budget to hire a part-time Web assistant 
          to maintain the Web pages, managed by the Graphic Arts Manager. The 
          Web Team also created a Web Request form in an effort to streamline 
          and manage the workflow and give all Museum divisions equal access to 
          the Web site. This worked for a short time, and the Web site grew and 
          improved. New areas of the Web site were created for the Arts Program 
          and Recycle Shop, Birthday Parties, and the School/Group Visits; without 
          the team's ability to focus on the Museum as a whole, these might 
          not have been created. But given the money dedicated to Web staff time 
          (enough for five hours per week), the staff turned over frequently, 
          tasks were left undone, and wishes left unfilled. This inspired Web 
        Team to undertake a full reassessment of Web production. </p>
      <p>The Web site then fell under the responsibility of the Graphic Arts 
          Manager for a short time until it was determined that the site production 
          would continue to be managed by the Graphic Arts Manager (who serves 
          as Web Team Leader), advised by Web Team, but produced by the Museum's 
          Graphic Designer, adding a day to her work schedule to accomplish this 
          task. In the meantime, Web Team spent nearly six months taking a look 
          at a completely re-organized Web site plan and architecture, in an effort 
          to convince the Museum that this is a Museum-wide effort that should 
          be financially supported. The production exists using this model at 
          present. In December of 2003, Web Team was presented with financial 
          support to re-design the Web site. Web Team is currently reviewing proposals 
        from design firms to create a bigger and better BostonKids.org.</p>
      <h1>Part II &#8211; Teams at the Museum</h1>
      <p>Structurally The Children's Museum is divided into 9 divisions 
          responsible for various functions within the Museum, each reporting 
          to a vice president, and each with its own budget and annual goals to 
          meet. Yet much of the work of the Museum, especially that which impacts 
          the visitors, depends on cross-communication among divisions with different 
          staff working together. Prior to the year 2000 and the introduction 
          of cross-divisional teams to the Museum, there was no formal mechanism 
          in place to facilitate such integrative work. So, early in 2001, Neil 
          Gordon, the recently appointed chief operating officer, created several 
          teams to be responsible for this cross-functional work. Charged with 
          integrating the various centers of operation at the Museum, Gordon felt 
          that teams were the best mechanism to focus on Museum-wide priorities 
        and include a global perspective on these issues.</p>
      <h2>Phase One</h2>
      <p>In this first phase of teams at The Children's Museum, which 
          lasted about one year and a half, teams were created where the product 
          of the team needed representation across the divisions. <a>Four </a>types 
          of teams were created, each reporting to one of four vice-presidents. 
          There were teams concerned with the <b>visitor experience</b>, who reported 
          to the Vice President of the Visitor Center; there were teams concerned 
          with the <b>staff culture</b> of the Museum who reported to the Vice 
          President of Human Resources; there were teams concerned with <b>resources</b> 
        who reported to the Vice President of Development; and there were teams 
        concerned with <b>long range planning</b> who reported to the Chief 
          Operating Officer. Staff members were assigned to teams by senior management, 
          and almost everybody participated except those whose jobs were primarily 
          on the Museum floor, or who worked less than 40 percent time, or who 
        worked at night or only on the weekends.  </p>
      <p>The Web Team was created at this time, under the auspices of Visitor 
          Services, and peopled with staff from every division. Brian Bergeron, 
          Graphic Arts Manager, was appointed team leader, and there were representatives 
          from the Teacher Center, Early Childhood Center, Membership, Development, 
          Marketing, the IT department, Human Resources, the Exhibits Department, 
          and the Visitor Center. The Team was charged with fixing the Web site, 
          which we took to mean taking a look at the Museum's entire Web 
          site, making any small changes we could now, and making recommendations 
          for larger changes as well. The team, like all other teams, was expected 
        to use or coordinate existing resources to accomplish its goals.</p>
      <p>It is important to realize that teams were never designed to take the 
          place of the divisions, the hierarchical management style under which 
          the Museum functions. The divisions within the Museum are content-based: 
          teachers, family visitors, exhibits, membership, fundraising, etc., 
          while the teams are about coordinating those different contents. Teams 
          are also not about replacing a job function, or accomplishing the work 
          of one job function, but rather are about accomplishing clear, doable, 
          shared tasks beyond the scope of an individual's job function 
        or a division's specific purpose. </p>
      <p>There was much confusion among the staff about how teams worked and 
          what purpose they served during this first phase of teams. Some teams 
          floundered, unclear of what they were exactly supposed to be doing, 
          while others accomplished a great deal; staff grumbled about having 
          to take on additional work when they were already working 110 percent, 
          yet a staff survey indicated great support for the concept of teams; 
          and it seemed that rather than facilitating communication among the 
          divisions, things only got muddier. Thus was born Phase Two of Teams 
        at The Children's Museum of Boston.</p>
      <h2>Phase Two</h2>
      <p>A consultant, an expert in team building and functioning, was called 
          in. After spending a few months talking to Senior Management, the teams 
          as a whole, and many individual team members, she recommended a large-scale 
          revamping of the teams and the team process. A small team of 9 people 
          representing most divisions and most levels of employment at the Museum, 
          and including the consultant (the Team Coordination Group), was formed 
          in the summer of 2002. This team took a look at how teams should work 
          and came up with a framework for the team process, a new way for teams 
          to report to Senior Management; it also reformed and reconstituted the 
          actual teams, retiring some, revising current working teams and creating 
        some new ones.</p>
      <p>This group met about six or seven times over a period of three months 
          and created a document called <i>The Team Framework</i> to be used by 
          teams to clarify roles and responsibilities. The Team Coordination 
          Group. felt that having a published framework was important because 
          staff members were looking for some definitions of roles and responsibilities 
          and just what teams meant to the Museum. In answer to the question 
        Why teams? the framework said:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Using teams to get things done also allows us to focus 
          on Museum-wide priorities and include a more global perspective in our 
          work, so that we are all more closely aligned with the Museum's 
          mission and goals. Teams enable The Museum to bring a more diverse set 
          of perspectives to bear on a problem, a program or a project. Additionally, 
          team work supports The Museum's values of empowerment and professional 
        development for staff members.</p>
      <p>A new role, that of Team Sponsor, was created to eliminate the prior 
          hierarchical structure of reporting to a vice president. Rather, each 
          team now has a leader, from the manager level at the Museum, and a sponsor, 
          a vice president. The Team Leader and the Sponsor work collaboratively 
          to shepherd the team's work and concerns through the Museum's 
          senior level. The results were unveiled on Halloween Day, 2002. The 
          new teams created have specific projects and goals; staff members were 
          allowed some choice over which teams they were assigned to serve on; 
        and there has been much more success in Phase Two.</p>
      <h1>Part III &#8211; Web Site Maintenance </h1>
      <p>Web site maintenance and management responsibility have been a constant 
          issue since the beginning of <a href="http://www.bostonkids.org/">www.BostonKids.org</a>. Whether under the supervision of the Marketing Manager, the Graphic 
        Arts Manager, or Web Team, the Web site has always been tacked on to 
        someone's job, not benefiting from having anyone's full attention. As a result, the site is currently uneven and inconsistent in its look 
        and feel. While the team has been very effective in broadening the 
          Web site to include more areas of the Museum and strengthen the depth 
          of our offerings, there are areas of the site that suffer from neglect. Web Team currently has no budget of its own, but depends instead on 
        other Museum departments to fund the Web projects. This puts emphasis 
          on new material rather than on updating the look of, or increasing the 
          depth of, content already in the site: long-standing material that doesn't 
        always have someone who 'owns' it and looks after it.</p>
      <p>To streamline the method for putting material on the Web, and to try 
          to provide coherent and consistent oversight of all the material, Web 
          Team has devised a process for putting up new content or revising old 
          content, and it all starts with a form. Any staff member who seeks to 
          post information must fill out this form, which requires the divisional 
          vice-president's signature. That ensures that there is divisional 
          support for, and knowledge of, the content so there are no nasty surprises 
          down the line. This form is necessary for both small tasks (updating 
          a calendar item or event posting) and large (creating a whole new section.) The request form provides an opportunity for the requestor and the Graphics 
        department to make sure that all pertinent information is in place for 
        the new addition; it also later serves as a reminder that material needs 
        to come down off the Web site as well.</p>
      <p>For small jobs, The Graphic Arts Manager assigns the Graphic Designer 
          the work and then the requestor is notified that the site has been updated. For new additions to the site, or a large-scale revamping of a section, 
        the ideas and designs are presented by the Graphic Designer and vetted 
        through Web Team for user testing, and then sent back to the originating 
        Division for approval. All content is always also reviewed by the External 
      Relations Department (PR/Marketing) for tone and consistency of message. </p>
      <p>Although this process works very well, it has only been in effect for 
          a year or two, and a few small bumps in the road are apparent. First, 
          several areas of the Web site are updated frequently, such as the events 
          calendar and the job listings, but they must still follow the same form-filling 
          out procedure each time. This is perceived as a hassle by staff. Second, 
          not everyone in the Museum is willing to fill out a form, or is willing 
          to do so in a timely manner, before the need for something to be on 
          the Web site is immediate; this creates emergencies for Web Team to 
          manage. And third, time-sensitive material, such as notices for teacher 
          professional development opportunities, doesn't always get removed at 
          the appropriate time, and may mislead or irritate the visitor looking 
        for current information.</p>
      <p>To address some of these bumps, Web Team is now beginning the process 
          of reviewing content management systems that would allow individual 
          staff members to add and edit content into pre-determined design templates. This way, content could be entered by staff members who would be following 
        guidelines pre-determined by the Design department. Then, it would 
          be sent to a control point in the External Relations department who 
          could review it and then post it. Of course, these management systems 
          have their own sets of complications, the biggest for the Museum being 
          cost to implement. But the hope is that providing a central automated 
          system for Web content would truly make the Web site an integral part 
        of the way the Museum does business with its many audiences.</p>
      <h1>Part IV - Growing the Web Site</h1>
      <p>Through the efforts of Web Team, BostonKids.org has grown enormously 
          in the past two years. It has become an important venue for the Museum 
          to distribute information and resources to its audiences. However, 
          with no budget solely dedicated to the Web site, each department or 
          division wishing to put content up must find the money to do so. In 
          that way it is like the other Museum departments that deliver products 
          such as teacher institutes and family programs: each product must be 
          fundraised for before it can be delivered. As Gordon, the Museum's 
          COO, put it, "Our ability to add content is tied directly to our 
          ability to raise money." But he went on to say that the Web must 
        be a part of future thinking and future grant proposals.</p>
      <p>One of the first large content pieces on BostonKids.org was <i>People 
          of the First Light,</i> a section of the site devoted to teaching about 
          and understanding the Wampanoag tribes of Mashpee and Aquinnah, in Massachusetts. The Museum has had a relationship for over thirty years with the two 
        Wampanoag tribes, creating exhibits as well as public programming together, 
        doing teacher professional development, and working with the collections. It was a natural progression to bring this very fruitful partnership 
        to the Web site. Through a generous grant from MCI WorldCom in 1998, 
          the Teacher Center and the Native American Advisory Board were able 
          to hire an outside Web developer and collaborate on the content, making 
          this section work for both the Native and Museum communities. This 
          section of the BostonKids.org serves as a model for current and future 
        educational content development on our site. </p>
      <p>The Museum is currently in the middle of a five-year grant from the 
          Howard Hughes Medical Institute for the Boston Waterfront Learning Project. 
          It is a multi-dimensional effort which is developing waterfront fieldwork 
          experiences and standards-based, interdisciplinary curriculum activities 
          for students in grades 3, 4, and 5 to promote environmental literacy 
          among students, educators, and families of the Commonwealth, focused 
          on the Boston Harbor and watershed. One aspect of this Project is to 
          create a Website that will disseminate curriculum and student work; 
          stimulate visitors to waterfront sites to collect, record, and compare 
          data and field notes; provide elementary students with a research tool 
          to enhance their waterfront learning; and disseminate information about 
          related resources. This Web site is expected to go live sometime in 
        2005. </p>
      <p>There are many plans to put more content for teachers on the Web site. 
          We are currently exploring ways of using the Web to bring the Museum 
          into classrooms digitally, much the way our kits bring the Museum and 
          Museum ways of learning into the classroom with real objects. Before 
          this fiscal year is over, we'll be posting some of our curricular 
          materials developed over the years, and we're exploring ways to 
      integrate our cultural collections with out teacher resources on-line. </p>
      <p>Other areas of the Museum are also in various stages of planning content 
          for BostonKids.org. The collections department is busy applying for 
          grants to make collections Web-accessible; the exhibits department is 
          planning a Web component for every new exhibit they design and build; 
          the marketing department is exploring new ways to communicate with our 
          visitors via the Web; and the Early Childhood and Visitor Centers are 
          hard at work making parent content that goes beyond directions and amenities 
          to real material about child development and learning as play. All 
          this is about generally extending and deepening the museum experience 
        both before and after the visit. </p>
      <p>When the Children's Museum of Boston instituted teams, it was actively 
          encouraging cross-fertilization among the divisions and providing a 
          forum for Museum staff to think about the Museum as a whole. Evaluation 
          of the team approach with a period of assessment and reflection by the 
          Museum, at both the senior level and the lower levels, confirmed that 
          the team approach is a good one. Web Team is an excellent example of 
          the worth of the team approach to our Museum. The team has not only 
          improved BostonKids.org but also created a constituency in the Museum 
          for seeing the Web site as a very important vehicle for promoting our 
        mission.</p>
