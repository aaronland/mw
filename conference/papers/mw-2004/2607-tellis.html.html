      <p class="PaperTitle">Multimedia Handhelds: One Device, Many Audiences</p>
      <p class="Author">Chris Tellis, Antenna Audio, USA</p> <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
       <p class="AbstractText">In 2004, the first fully featured, wireless handheld 
          programs will open at the J. Paul Getty Museum and at several 
          other institutions throughout the world.  New pilot programs are under 
          way at Tate Modern, Te Papa Tongarewa, The Royal Institute, and several 
          other sites in Europe, North America and Asia. In these and other locations, 
          the handheld installations are moving well beyond the traditional adult 
          tour and are being used for way finding, chat rooms, bookmarking, disabled 
          visitor access, and interactive family tours. Over the past 12 months 
          there has been a tremendous amount of progress that has moved the wireless 
          handheld platform from the theoretical realm into the practical for 
          museum guides.  Third generation user-interfaces are more intuitive, 
          battery issues have been resolved, and museum touring applications have 
          been tested and proven to be stable and effective. This paper looks 
          at the new applications for this platform and describes representative 
        handheld programs at five museums.</p>
      <p class="keywords">Keywords: Handhelds, Wireless, Audio Tours, PDA, 
        Multimedia, Sign Language</p>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>In previous papers over the past three years (Proctor and Tellis, 2003. Tellis and Proctor, 2002, Tellis, 2001) we have described 
          the evolution of the handheld platform and the transition from mobile 
          audio to mobile multimedia within the museum touring context.  Throughout 
          this period we have advocated a cautious approach to these next generation 
          touring devices and suggested a thorough examination of the capabilities 
          of the audio-only players, while the newer screen-based systems pass 
          through their teething pains and the technology catches up to the expectations 
        of the end user.</p>
      <p>The earlier PDAs tested in various prototype installations 
          were slow, bulky and delicate devices with insufficient processor power 
          to handle the demands of audio, still and moving image.   At the same 
          time, compact mp3 audio devices had become extraordinarily capable. 
          These players now have the capacity to hold up to 140 hours of content 
          and offer superb audio reproduction, random access and linear tours, 
          visitor tracking capabilities, automatic triggering, and the ability 
          to synch the audio track to films and videos in any language. Each year 
          approximately 35 million audio tours are distributed in museums, cultural 
        sites and attractions around the world.</p>
      <p>For many museum installations, audio devices will 
          continue to be the most appropriate mobile education accessory.  Many 
          museums will prefer the more minimal approach of audio-only interpretation 
          that focuses visitor attention upon the work of art and directs the 
          eye to the artwork, never to the device. Most current audio devices 
          also have integrated speakers allowing them to be used as wands, as 
          well as headset devices, whereas PDAs will always need a wire to a single 
          or stereo earpiece.  Finally there is the reassurance that comes with 
        veteran technology that ensures a consistent, seamless visitor experience.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, significant progress has been achieved 
          in PDA technology. Several prototype installations over the past three 
          years have taught us a great deal about the capabilities and limitations 
          of these devices.  Probably the most significant study was undertaken 
          at Tate Modern in the fall of 2002. As reported last year (<i>State 
          of the Art in Museum Handhelds in 2003</i>, Proctor and Tellis), the 
          Tate Modern Multimedia Tour Pilot ran from July through September of 
          2002.  Sponsored by Bloomberg, the 45-minute program focused on select 
        objects in the Still Life/Object/Real Life galleries.</p>
      <p>Our objective was to push the capabilities of the 
          player by combining all potential wireless, multimedia features into 
          one device. Visitors were able to experience audio, video, still images 
          and a variety of interactive applications via handheld iPAQs loaned 
        by Hewlett Packard.</p>
      <p>Since the primary purpose of the program was to evaluate 
          visitor response, each user was asked to fill out a questionnaire.  
        In total, 852 questionnaires were collected from both UK and international 
        visitors, with UK visitors representing slightly more than half the 
        user population (56%). In addition, the museum sourced independent evaluation 
        from the Susie Fisher Group. The results of the Fisher study, along 
        with observations by Antenna and Museum staff, are reported in detail 
        in our earlier paper..</p>
      <h1>Applying Results</h1>
      <p>The extensive testing at Tate and other sites has 
          resulted in vastly improved user-interfaces that follow the chronology 
          of the touring experience. Initial screens now reflect the information 
          requirements at precisely the distributions area, followed by menus 
          that cater to visitor needs as they navigate the galleries. In addition, 
          our experiments have revealed the level of content optimization required 
          to work within the current processor and transmission capabilities. 
          More recent programs reflect these upgrades, with dramatic increases 
        in visitor satisfaction.</p>
      <p>Any platform that is to make it to &#8216;prime time&#8217; 
        on the museum floor needs to reach the required intersection of capability, 
        reliability, availability and affordability.  Only in the past six months 
          have we seen the screen-based players cross this threshold.  In addition, 
          for a new technology to graduate into fully functional touring installations 
          it is necessary for the player to meet minimum standards of weight and 
          working life.  Visitors will not accept the transition from compact 
          mp3 players to multi-media devices if the players are excessively heavy 
          and unwieldy. Although fine for a pilot program, the iPAQ players used 
          at Tate Modern in the fall of 2002 were clearly not ready for widespread 
          visitor acceptance.  With removable wireless cards and bulky cases, 
          they were much too large and heavy to burden the visitor with for an 
          extended visit. Operating in a constant wireless mode, the players had 
          a battery life of only 1.5 hours, completely unacceptable for any permanent 
        collection installation.</p>
      <p>However, all this changed with the players released 
          in 2003.  Wireless capability was integrated into the basic design.  
        Processor speed and energy management increased to the required levels.</p>
      <p>This steep trajectory of change is both a blessing 
          and a curse. On the one hand, a little patience rewards the museum with 
          an enhanced set of features and reliability. On the other, there is 
          the potential for rapid obsolescence with a major investment. New generations 
          of players are typically released every six months.  Although the angle 
          of innovation is declining a bit, we currently advise museums of a strong 
        expectation any technological choice will be eclipsed in 24 to 30 months.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the current 
          capabilities of the wireless PDA platform represent the most exciting 
          development in museum education appliances in the past two decades. 
          As the PDA platform comes of age, we are seeing that comparisons to 
          audio tours are increasingly less valid.  Wireless, multimedia handhelds 
          are not really equivalent alternatives, but instead represent a new 
          generation museum appliance with multiple but different applications 
        and, often, different audiences as well.</p>
      <h1>Handhelds in 2004</h1>
      <p>In last year&#8217;s MW paper I mentioned that there 
          have been only two technological breakthroughs in the 35 years since 
          the first audio tours were introduced.  These were the compact cassette 
        and the transition from analog to digital audio.</p>
      <p>With wireless PDAs we are crossing three distinct 
          but complementary thresholds: wireless, multimedia and location-based 
        services.  Each of these developments opens up a wide range of services:</p>
      <h2>Wireless</h2>
      <p><span class="SubHeaderSmall">Memory:</span> The great 
          hurdle in audio tours has always been the trade off between audio quality, 
          capacity and expense. In the most fundamental transformation, wireless 
          eliminates this problem with the transition from memory-on-board to 
          centralized storage. Centralized content transmitted wirelessly removes 
          all limits to the capacity of the players. This is essential for the 
          memory-hungry multimedia applications.  In addition, updates and changes 
          need only be made in one centralized location, rather than uploading 
        to each player.</p>
      <p><span class="SubHeaderSmall">Interactive</span> Educational 
          Programs: Wireless allows two-way communication with centralized programs 
        or with teachers and museum educators.</p>
      <p><span class="SubHeaderSmall">Personalized Content 
          Delivery</span>: Because each player has a separate address, it is possible 
          to establish a separate identity for each player and create individualized 
        content streams for each user.</p>
      <p><span class="SubHeaderSmall">Bookmarking:</span> With 
          a constant connection to the server, the user can establish, at any 
          time, a link to any work in the tour and send these links to a  home 
          e-mail address.   Once at an outside computer, the visitor can activate 
          these links to pursue additional information on the areas previously  
        bookmarked.</p>
      <p><span class="SubHeaderSmall">Visitor Surveying</span>: 
          With a continuous connection to all the players in the museum, applications 
          can be installed on the central server to allow for visitor tracking 
          and downloading of survey questions. Survey results can be instantly 
          compiled and graphed with the composite results immediately available 
        to the user.</p>
      <p><span class="SubHeaderSmall">Paging Services and Alerts:</span> 
        A constant wireless link to each individual player allows for individual 
        and group messages to be transmitted at any time.</p>
      <p><span class="SubHeaderSmall">Communication &amp; Experience-Sharing 
          among Visitors</span>: Each player has the capability to send messages 
          to any of the other players on the wireless network. Although these 
          discussions need to be moderated, the capability exists for lively real 
        time dialogue among all the museum visitors.</p>
      <p><span class="SubHeaderSmall">Interface with Internet 
          and/or Intranet</span>: Although unfettered access to the Web is likely 
          to be restricted, specialized links to complementary Web sites will 
        allow additional, individual research to occur within the galleries.</p>
      <p><span class="SubHeaderSmall">Retail Promotions and 
          Wireless Commerce</span>: Inspired by the works around them, users can 
          peruse the museum shop and order or reserve products on demand while 
        still in the galleries.</p>
      <p><span class="SubHeaderSmall">Booking Services:</span> 
        Visitors can reserve a spot in a lecture, a seat in the dining room 
        or entry to an upcoming exhibition.</p>
      <h1>Multimedia </h1>
      <p>Multimedia represents the most exciting and controversial aspect of 
          screen-based players. Looking at this from the content side, while it 
          not hard to envision a screen-based experience to complement a science 
          museum or natural history museum, the introduction of handheld multimedia 
          devices into art museums is decidedly more controversial. Art museums 
          represent one of the few places that guarantee an encounter with exquisite, 
          original objects. They afford the visitor the opportunity to closely 
          observe the hand of the maker and the texture of the materials.  Art 
          museums are supremely focused on the importance of looking and seeing. 
          Should screen based players interfere with this process, they will never 
        find acceptance within the galleries.</p>
      <p>The challenge lies with the educator and the content provider to develop 
          experiences which augment the accessory role of the interpretive device.  
        For the most part the interpretation will still be primarily audio-only, 
        focusing on the artwork. When screen images are introduced, it is essential 
        that they seamlessly integrate into the overall message in a way that 
        does not break character with the interpretive experience. The way to 
        achieve this is by making the screen an interpretive detail that is 
        handled in the same way as a reference to a feature in the painting 
        or an adjacent image.  This means the screen component should be relatively 
          brief and should be bracketed by the instruction on when to look and 
          when to look away. At no time should visitors feel there might be something 
          happening on the screen that they are missing because they have not 
          been told. The visitors need to learn early in the touring experience 
          that there will be a consistent reference whenever a screen image is 
        available.</p>
      <p>Differences still exist about whether the screen should be left blank 
          or should contain a simple screen saver whenever there is nothing showing. 
          Our experience at the first Tate pilot indicated that blank screens 
          caused some visitors to assume their player had gone dead.  This led 
          to unacceptable screen-poking as the visitors attempted to resurrect 
          their players. Tate 2003 has a default screen with a colored background 
          image and a series of dots moving across the screen to indicate it is 
          still alive.  Still unresolved is whether even the most benign screen 
          can still cause a distraction. In both cases it is possible that the 
          screen viewing directives were simply not effective and consistent. 
        This is an area that will require additional study.</p>
      <p>For some museums, the issues of rights clearance and funding will slow 
          the arrival of images onto the players. There is no reason to display 
          images just because you have a screen. It is a simple matter for the 
          players to be used as audio-only devices, using touch screen keypads, 
          which duplicate the keypads found on audio players.  Museums which already 
          have extensive audio programs can instantly migrate to the new devices, 
          using the same numeric access codes currently in place, and still take 
          advantage of the wireless and location features. The Getty Museum, for 
          instance, is opening an extensive wireless handheld installation this 
          spring, with no interpretive images, but with full reliance on centralized 
        data storage and with elaborate bookmarking capabilities.</p>
      <p>PDA screens and the prospect of numerous miniature television sets 
          invading the galleries appall some museum professionals. But it would 
          be a mistake to simply dismiss this technology. Even in the most conservative 
          institution, it is still possible to envision situations where secondary 
          images can add interpretive value. The possibilities are too broad. 
          To ban screen-based images completely would be like banning all brochures 
          or conversation in the galleries. The goal of the educator should not 
          be to dismiss the medium, but to gain firm control and strike the balance 
          that best serves the needs of the individual institution. For example, 
          there is the opportunity to see the back of a sculpture or vase, or 
          to see an artist&#8217;s original studies, or relevant portions of a 
          collection that must stay out of view for conservation reasons. In the 
          21<sup>st</sup> Century, as more artists create in a variety pf mediums, 
          multimedia players have the potential to be significant exhibit accessories, 
          providing sound tracks or personal video created by the artist. Again, 
          pilot programs have been extraordinarily useful for provoking a dialogue 
          about which techniques enhance the experience and which components subvert 
        it.</p>
      <p>Even without images to enhance the educational purpose of tours, it 
          is inevitable that screen based players will find their way into museums 
          in order to assist visitors in other ways.  An obvious example is way-finding.  
        Independent of wireless or location services, it is still possible to 
        enter a gallery number into your player and locate your position on 
        a screen-based map. Wireless and positioning makes this even easier, 
        allowing visitor to press a single button to display their location 
        at any time. An additional function would allow visitors to locate any 
        work of art and display the most direct path to it from their immediate 
        location.</p>
      <p>Screens can also be employed to clearly display label text, liberating 
          the visitor from the need to move in close to the wall. If the museum&#8217;s 
          chosen font and lighting level is not accessible to certain visitors, 
          the screen text can be customized to whatever standard works for the 
        individual viewer.</p>
      <p>Screens also allow graphic user interfaces, which enable visitors to 
          simply tap an image or title of the artwork rather than enter a number 
        to gain access to the message.</p>
      <p>Screen-based systems can also provide remarkable solutions for special 
          audiences.  As mentioned earlier, visually impaired visitors can adjust 
          font size and contrast to enable them to more easily read label and 
          wall text. For hearing-impaired visitors, it is possible either to caption 
          videos or to provide full-featured sign language guides that translate 
          all the audio tracks into an accessible format.  A highly successful 
          sign language guide is already in place at Tate Modern, and we are currently 
        captioning all the in-gallery videos for the Spy Museum.</p>
      <h2>Location-Based Services</h2>
      <pindent>Location-based services (LBS) determine your 
          position within the galleries and provide a series of related enhancements. 
          It is not essential to have wireless capability, as positioning can 
          be determined by infrared triggers (IR) or radio tags (RFID). These 
          transmitters are usually attached to a wall and are picked up by the 
          player when entering the range. There are advantages and disadvantages 
          to both. Infrared requires line-of-site, but as a result can be focused 
          and is more accurate than radio. RF tags represent a more economical 
          way of tagging objects and do not require line-of-sight contact with 
          the PDA, but their range is very short (generally under 12 inches) and 
          can be impractical.
        
      <pindent>For occasional positioning, IR or RFID are 
          attractive options, allowing single point triggers for specific purposes.  
        For comprehensive positioning throughout the museum, the software based 
        positioning systems are more practical as they require less hardware 
        to cover large areas and have a higher degree of flexibility.  Essentially 
          these systems work through triangulation, using a minimum of three different 
          access points to establish the location. Software based systems also 
          make it easier to map irregular spaces.  Once the access points are 
          in place and communication, via a laptop, is established with the central 
          server, the installer simply walks the perimeter of the designated zone 
          and assigns it to a common location, be it a single gallery or entire 
          section of the museum.
        
      <pindent>Some of the applications available from LBS 
          include:
          <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li>
           
            Location-Specific Content Delivery:<b> </b>This is particularly useful 
            for downloading programs or restricting access to information relevant 
            to the visitor&#8217;s immediate surroundings.</li>
        <li>

            Way-finding<b>: </b>Discussed previously.</li>
        <li>
          
            Device tracking:<b> </b>LBS allows the museum to see the location 
            of all the devices at any given time.  If all players are clustered 
            in one location, a message can be sent to the users, suggesting another 
            area of interest.</li>
        <li>
          
            Security Alarms:<b> </b>If a player moves beyond the perimeter, LBS 
            can tell the player to active an alarm.</li>
        <li>
          
            Queue-monitoring:<b> </b> Again, the museum can use one central location 
            to scan when lines are getting long at any entrance within the museum</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Operations</h2>
      <p>To turn the corner from pilot programs into actual 
          installations, it has been necessary not only to achieve a working balance 
          between content and technology, but also to develop the accessories 
          necessary for tour distributions. These include long-life batteries, 
        charging systems and carrying cases.</p>
      <p>For the time being, we have settled on the Toshiba 
          line of players as the most reliable and feature-appropriate, using 
          first the e750 and now the e800 model.  For smaller and temporary installations, 
          it is possible to use the supplied battery which provides two to three 
          hours of use in a continuous wireless environment.  For the larger, 
          permanent collection installations, it will be necessary to add extended 
          life batteries, which provided eight to ten hours of continuous operation 
          in tests conducted over the summer.  Actual field applications may differ, 
        and we will be watching this closely as the projects open.</p>
      <p>In addition, we have worked with a number of different 
          casing options, testing fully reinforced cases, simple lanyards and 
          a position in between.  Each has its merits and uses.  The reinforced 
          cases offer enhanced protection and, if well designed, can accommodate 
          future PDA model variations, but risk being bulkier and more inconvenient 
          than necessary. A simple lanyard solution is elegant, but less protective 
          against accidental damage, and we found that visitors were fiddling 
          with some of the default settings.  The neoprene &#8216;shoe&#8217; 
        option will both provide sufficient protection and insulate the critical 
        buttons from the visitors, but may require more frequent maintenance 
        or replacement.</p>
      <p>For our first installations, we provided a 25-unit 
          charging suitcase to handle the 100-player installation. For the 500 
          player Getty installation, we are developing a 50 unit mobile charger 
        that will allow users to move players around the museum.</p>
      <h1>Current Programs</h1>
      <p>With the extraordinary potential for this medium, 
          it is reassuring to see that in 2004 we are now beginning to advance 
          from the pilot stage into fully functional wireless handheld installations 
          operating as the primary museum touring installation. At the same time, 
          several pilot programs are still underway at museums around the world.  
        The wireless handheld programs are vastly more complex than traditional 
        audio tours, and there is still a great deal to be learned.  But the 
          level of expertise, combined with progress in the technology, has now 
          reached a point where properly conceived systems and programs are ready 
        to be placed in the visitors&#8217; hands.</p>
      <p>In the following section I will briefly describe 
        three pilot programs and two installations that illustrate current applications.</p>
      <h1>Pilot Programs</h1>
      <h2>Tate Modern</h2>
      <p>This project is be covered in greater detail in 
          <a href="../wilson/wilson.html" target="_blank">Gillian Wilson&#8217;s paper, <i>Tate Modern Multimedia Tour Programme</i></a><i>, 
        </i>also part of Museums and the Web 2004.</p>
      <h2>Highlights Tour<i> </i></h2>
      <p>The 2003 pilot has several components, one of which 
          is a highlights tour, ostensibly created for 16-25 year olds, but available 
          to any interested museum visitor. As described previously, the pilot 
          program created for Tate Modern in the fall of 2002 was designed to 
          push the limits of the technology and content. The production style 
          was inconsistent and fragmented, with different approaches to each room. 
          The 2003 installation reflects several of the findings from the 2002 
          pilot and displays a consistent style more closely illustrating how 
          an actual permanent collection handheld installation might appear. The 
          content has also been optimized for the player capabilities in order 
        to increase reliability. </p>
      <h2>Sign Language Guide</h2>
      <p>Running in parallel with the Tate highlights tour 
          is a program for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.  The program should be 
          rightly considered a translation into British Sign Language (BSL) rather 
          than a special program.  BSL is the preferred language of 50,000&#8211;70,000 
        people in the UK and is more widely used than Welsh or Gaelic.</p>
      <p>The Sign Language Guide is a perfect example of the 
          expanded opportunities with multimedia guides. The response has been 
          nothing less than overwhelming.  At the debut of the program, John Wilson, 
          Arts Officer for SHAPE, the UK's disability arts organization, gave 
          a keynote speech in which he said the Sign Language Guide &#8220;&#8230;<i>would 
          bring access for the deaf in museums out of the dark ages and into a 
        golden age of interpretation</i>&quot;.</p>
      <p>The users that evening made the following comments: 
      </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote"><i>I've always been kind of interested in art but 
          never really bothered to go to museums - now I will if they have a BSL 
        guide.</i></p>
      <p class="BlockQuote"><i>I've seen Rothko many times before, but I never 
          understood what was going on in those paintings until now - my head 
        is so full of information and ideas, it's wonderful!</i></p>
      <h2>Royal Institution</h2>
      <p>For over 205 years, the Royal Institution has been the home of science 
          research and communication in Great Britain. The complexity of this 
          mission is reflected in the multi-faceted nature of the organization. 
          The Royal Institution&#8217;s Davy Faraday Research Laboratory has seen 
          14 of its resident scientists receive the Nobel Prize, and witnessed 
          the discovery of 10 of the chemical elements. Famous scientists such 
          as Humphry Davy, Michael Faraday, James Dewar and William and Lawrence 
          Bragg all based their innovative and groundbreaking work at the Royal 
          Institution, the discoveries of which still have an impact on our daily 
          lives. The Royal Institution also houses the Faraday Museum, recounting 
          the history and scientific work of Michael Faraday, the discoverer of 
          electro-magnetic induction, electro-magnetic rotations, the magneto-optical 
        effect, diamagnetism, field theory and more. </p>
      <p>With such a long and distinguished history, every nook and cranny of 
          the Royal Institution is filled with important objects and artworks 
          that tell the stories of scientific debate, making a stroll through 
          the Royal Institution&#8217;s halls an education in itself. But within 
          Britain, the Royal Institution is perhaps best known for its Christmas 
          lecture series. Broadcast from the Royal Institution&#8217;s historic 
          Faraday Lecture Theatre, the Christmas lectures have presented complex 
          scientific issues to children in an informative and entertaining manner 
          since the 1820s, and have become an annual tradition in British households. 
          Today, over 30,000 children visit the Royal Institution each year to 
          take part in the lavishly illustrated and interactive Young Person&#8217;s 
        Program</p>
      <p>This commitment to both fostering science research and communicating 
          it to a wide range of audiences - from children to Nobel prize winners 
          to the media and public in general - requires a sophisticated approach 
          to interpretation and education. The Royal Institution has therefore 
          undertaken the development of a &#8216;Science Navigator&#8217; multimedia 
          tour system and information resource for the Institution&#8217;s visitors. 
          The project is supported by the UK&#8217;s National Endowment for Science, 
          Technology and the Arts (NESTA), and will be piloted with the public 
          for three months from summer 2004 with a view to a more permanent installation 
          as part of the Royal Institution&#8217;s redevelopment and refurbishment 
        in 2006. </p>
      <p>Uniquely, the Science Navigator will customize the tour experience 
          according to both the visitors&#8217; locations in the collections, 
          and their personal profiles. Using wireless PDAs, the Science Navigator 
          will both recount the Royal Institution&#8217;s many stories in rich 
          multimedia, and provide visitors with interactive access to further 
          information based on their location and what they&#8217;ve already seen 
          and done in the building. The Royal Institution project therefore represents 
          the first time that both personalization technologies and location-based 
        services have been used in combination in a multimedia tour. </p>
      <p>The interactive multimedia content is designed for three distinct audiences: 
          primary school children, and secondary school students, as well as a 
          generalist adult audience. As a visitor uses the Science Navigator, 
          its personalization engine combines this basic profile information with 
          a dynamic record of what objects and information the visitor has experienced 
          so far. It also takes into account the visitor&#8217;s proximity to 
          other objects - both physical and conceptual. The Navigator can then 
          intelligently and proactively suggest the visitor&#8217;s next steps 
          in the tour, adapting the tour automatically to changes in the visitor&#8217;s 
        route or interests as required.</p>
      <p>True to the Royal Institution&#8217;s mission to break down the barriers 
          between science and society and inform people about how science affects 
          their daily lives, this cutting-edge technology itself is also an exhibit 
          and attraction at the Royal Institution, demonstrating the future of 
          mobile communications in a living, hands-on installation today. For 
          the rest of the museum community, the Royal Institution project represents 
          an exciting opportunity to explore some answers to the question: What 
          would you tell your visitors if you knew not only where they were, but 
          who they were, what they knew and what they&#8217;d done, in order to 
        help them with where they&#8217;re going? </p>
      <h2>Renwick Gallery</h2>
      <p>At the Renwick Gallery in the Smithsonian American 
          Art Museum, Claire Larkin has developed a small but exceptionally fine 
          program. This pilot program covers fourteen items in the permanent collection, 
          covering contemporary sculpture and glassware.  It is a classic example 
          of excellent work by an in-house team and deserves a look by anybody 
        interested in this medium.</p>
      <p>The tour is available on weekends and is provided 
          on an HP iPAQ 5450. The museum had twenty players donated by HP, which 
        are carried by the visitor in a simple, elegant blue case.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="tellis.fig1.w.jpg" alt="Player in a bright blue case with a long strap" width="400" height="533"></p>
      <p class="caption">Figure 1: Renwick Gallery &#8211; Player and Carrying 
        Case</p>
      <p>The technology has a few problems associated with 
          earlier generation players, such as short battery life and semi-reliable 
          roaming, but the content is excellent and illustrates several important 
        points about PDA tours.</p>
      <h3>Location Based Services</h3>
      <p>The positioning software was provided by Newberry 
          Networks and, after some initial problems, appears to be working well. 
          Upon entering each room, after a short delay, a menu appears listing 
          the names of and thumbnail images for three to four artworks in the 
          immediate vicinity.  Both the title and the image are essential for 
          locating the works of art. I found this version of the icon interface 
          preferable to those which just show the image. It is worth noting, however, 
          that all icon interfaces require the visitor to use the screen as the 
          primary reference for locating art works which have messages. The less 
          innovative but familiar access number interface has you looking at the 
          artworks to find the numbers and then turning to the player just once 
          to access the message. For some visitors this may be easier than comparing 
        two-dimensional thumbnail images to the actual object.</p>
      <h3>Message length</h3>
      <p>A few of the stops were only 18 or 20 seconds long, 
          and some visitors found them to be too short. By contrast, at the first 
          Tate pilot, the visitors felt the stops were too long.  The Renwick 
          Installation had the shortest messages I have ever encountered in a 
          museum tour. In my own assessment I felt 20 seconds was the minimum, 
          45 seconds the upper limit and 30 seconds about right. This is a major 
          deviation from our position 10 years ago when 90 seconds was assumed 
          to be the average length for an audio tour message.  Interestingly, 
          even though the 20-second messages seemed short, they were beautifully 
          composed and left me motivated to learn more. This is an intriguing 
          reaction against a backdrop of research which shows that visitors do 
          not take permanent collection tours because they feel the tour slows 
          them down. Visitors to the permanent collection feel they have a lot 
          of ground to cover.  The desire to see as much as possible overrides 
          the appeal of in-depth investigation. This is not the case in temporary 
          exhibitions which have pre-ordained limits and in which the visitors 
          knows they can linger without missing any of the important artworks.  
        What this suggests for permanent collection information architecture 
        is a brief introductory message, with additional layers available if 
        the visitor wants to invest more time.</p>
      <h3>Content </h3>
      <p>For each stop there were three to four messages: 
          a video with the artist talking about his or her work, a video showing 
          a scholar discussing the work, a text message and an audio message. 
          The artist videos were particularly appealing, mainly because Claire 
          and her team asked each one the same question, &#8220;Why did you become 
          an artist?&#8221;  It was a simple but brilliant method to gain subjective 
          personal insight into the underlying motivation behind the work.  It 
          strongly suggested a component to multimedia tours that would be universally 
        appealing to museum visitors.</p>
      <h2>Te Papa</h2>
      <p>On the opposite side of the globe is Te Papa Tongarewa, the national 
        museum of New Zealand located in Wellington.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="tellis.fig2.w.jpg" alt="View of the building across the water" width="400" height="249"></p>
      <p class="caption">Figure 2: Te Papa Tongarewa </p>
      <p>The Museum is six years old, and features an innovative combination 
          of new and traditional exhibits. It is an unusual institution in that 
          all disciplines are under one roof. Exhibits range from traditional 
          and contemporary fine art to decorative arts, New Zealand culture and 
          history, Polynesian culture and history, and natural sciences of the 
          South Pacific region.  Special emphasis is placed on the display and 
          description of Maori culture, and great sensitivity to Maori issues 
          pervades the entire Te Papa experience.  The balancing of Maori and 
          Pakeha (European) interests is an ongoing concern throughout the country, 
          dating back to the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, which gave sovereignty 
          to the Queen but confirmed rights of possession to the Maori over their 
        ancestral lands.</p>
      <p>The focus of the pilot is a permanent exhibition entitled <i>Made in 
          New Zealand</i>.  The exhibition features Pakeha and Maori works of 
          art and craft selected to help visitors understand the elements leading 
          to a particular New Zealand form of expression.  The exhibit takes you 
          through the entire history of the land, from the earliest Maori artifacts 
          through the arrival of Able Tasman and James Cook, the settlements, 
          rebellions, treaties, reconciliation, later immigration and on to current 
        issues and modern art.</p>
      <p>The handheld pilot has been funded by the Microsoft Innovation Center, 
          which provides grants to government and national institutions for innovative 
        uses of information technologies.</p>
      <p>What distinguishes the <i>Made in New Zealand</i> project from other 
          pilots is that the exhibition follows a defined chronology through a 
          series of narrow galleries.  From the outset it was clear that the exhibition 
          would support a linear tour, something not previously tested with handhelds 
          and in fact rarely pursued since digital players replaced walkmans. This 
          trend has not been completely satisfactory. In some exhibits, random 
          access has not served the educational objectives, as the break between 
          messages and the hunt for the next access number interrupts the flow 
          of the story. For the last eight years, linear tours have been out of 
          fashion. Traditional linear tours require the visitor to follow directions 
          guiding the listener on a set route through the exhibition.  Linear 
          tours were faulted for forcing each visitor to follow the same path 
          and same order. However handhelds introduce several characteristics 
          that lend themselves to linear tours, not the least of which is the 
          ability to display the destination object as you are navigating toward 
        it via the spoken directions.</p>
      <p>In addition, PDAs have the capability of supporting multiple learning 
          styles by allowing both linear tours and the opportunity to switch to 
        random access if so preferred.</p>
      <p>To ease the navigation along the tour, it was decided to auto trigger 
          several of the messages. Although the original plan was to radio-trigger, 
          the program has now switched to positioning software, due to difficulties 
        in controlling the RF signal.</p>
      <p>This project is still in development, with an opening anticipated in 
          the late spring. At this stage, the program consists of a tour that 
          has 24 stops distributed through eight rooms. In essence, you have a 
          series of automatically triggered, mini linear tours in each gallery; 
          they can be linked up to make one continuous experience.  As the visitor 
          approaches the exhibit and enters each room, a positioning trigger initiates 
          the message for the first stop in that room. This message then provides 
          a spoken direction and digital flag to play the following message, continuing 
          on through subsequent stops until the two to five messages in each gallery 
          have been played. This gives two to six minutes of total content per 
          gallery. At the end of each gallery sequence, a message will play to 
          suggest the visitor spend as much time as desired looking at these or 
          other objects in the gallery, and then move on to the next gallery when 
          ready. As soon as the visitor enters the next gallery, the automatic 
          trigger initiates the mini tour for this room, and the process repeats. 
          Under this format it is possible to cruise through the entire exhibit, 
          seamlessly handing off from one trigger to the next, without ever having 
          to touch the player. Even if you pause in each gallery to look at additional 
          objects, you still never have to touch the player unless you choose 
          to go to second levels. The tour simply restarts when you enter the 
          next room. The idea is to combine the educational value that comes from 
          a well produced broadcast story, which assembles interviews, images 
          and media affects in a cadenced, progressive, sequence to maximize interest, 
          with the anchoring and pilgrimage qualities associated with an encounter 
          with real objects. In essence the visitor inhabits a virtual video, 
          with the narrator scrolling user attention back and forth between object, 
          handheld and direction. The images on the handheld simply become additional 
        details slotted into the overall story.</p>
      <p>If the visitor wishes to accelerate through the galleries, the auto 
          triggers will override and synch up to the current location. If the 
          person wishes to back up, or proceed at random, there is a <i>navigation</i> 
        button on the screen that will bring up the map for the exhibit and 
        highlight the current room. Tapping this map will bring up a track list 
        with thumbnail images for the works in this gallery. The user can also 
        tap any other room on the map to see a list of those messages. Moving 
        backward through the galleries will blacklist the audio messages already 
        played, but the positioning software will still tell the map to highlight 
        the current room.  If the user manually accesses a message, t he tour 
        will restart and continue as before to the end of the gallery.</p>
      <p>Te Papa has a full time in-house evaluator who will be preparing questionnaires 
          and conducting exit interviews. In addition, there will be automatic 
          session monitoring via the server. All visitors will be asked to enter 
          their e-mail addresses, allowing a link between the exit interviews 
          and the session monitor, to see how their reported experiences compared 
          with the actual records. Along with the questions about interface and 
          retention, we anticipate visitors will also be asked to comment on the 
          isolating quality of the headsets. The script is still in development, 
          but it is anticipated that it will include content which specifically 
          encourages interaction with other members of their party to see if it 
        is possible to preempt this effect.</p>
      <h1>Installations</h1>
      <h2>Technology Museum</h2>
      <p>At the end of November 2003, the first fully operational 
          wireless handheld installation opened at a corporate museum.  The museum 
          celebrates the history and accomplishments of the parent company, a 
          major technology manufacturer located in northern California.  This 
          particular firm has an understandable policy requiring subcontractors 
        to keep their association anonymous.  </p>
      <p>The program consists of three one-hour tours: Manufacturing, 
        History and General Tour. All tours are provided in seven languages.</p>
      <p>All information is provided wirelessly. The gallery 
        space is fairly small, making the wireless coverage easy to achieve.</p>
      <p>The user interface allows visitors to access the 
          messages either via map icons or via access numbers and an on-screen 
          keypad.  In the initial weeks, most visitors were choosing to use the 
        on-screen keypad.</p>
      <h3>Initial Findings </h3>
      <p>The content contains a mix of narration, interactive 
          games, and audio and video interviews.  As we have seen in other installations, 
          audio is still the primary communications medium, with the other elements 
        playing a subsidiary role.</p>
      <p>Because the client intends to use the program for 
          off-site demonstration purposes, the writer was directed to remove on-site 
          references that refer specifically to the screen or the associated object.  
        This meant that the narration could not tell the visitor when and where 
        to look.  Although it was unavoidable at this site and less of an issue 
          for a science museum, we still feel that this double duty requirement 
        compromises the quality of the program within the exhibition space.</p>
      <p>Although the project was developed in less than three 
          months, this timeframe does not reflect the extraordinary effort involved 
          with multimedia production for this platform.  As one might assume, 
          these programs are exponentially more complex than audio tours.  A particular 
          issue is the unpredictable nature of discovering, auditioning and clearing 
          visual assets. Under a tight schedule where all the components have 
          to come together at a certain time, a delay in the visual components 
          can throw off all deadlines.  The response is to extend the planning 
          process to assemble all the visual elements and storyboard the production 
          before scriptwriting begins.  As the volume of handheld programs increases, 
          it will be essential for partner museums to supply a selection of cleared 
          visual assets at the beginning of the production kick-off and scheduling 
        process.</p>
      <p>Over the next several weeks we will be conducting 
          visitor surveys at this site and expect to be able to share the results 
        at the MW 2004 conference.</p>
      <h2>The Getty Museum</h2>
      <p>The most ambitious handheld project is now expected 
        to open in May 2004 at the J. Paul Getty Museum.</p>
      <p>For the past six years the Getty has had an audio 
          program with approximately 50 hours of permanent collection programming 
          in English and Spanish. Over the years the programming has remained 
          on Antenna&#8217;s CD-ROM player, the Gallery Guide&#8482;. This year 
          the entire program will be switched to wireless handhelds, using the 
          Toshiba e800 player.  When fully operational the installation will consist 
          of approximately 500 players, which the museum refers to collectively 
        as the <i>Getty Guide</i>.</p>
      <p>Although fully wireless, in the initial stages the 
          program will not have any images or video except for the various screens 
          required to navigate through the museum.  The visitor will also have 
          the opportunity to bookmark and access additional layers of information 
        via workstations linked to the Getty network and central servers.</p>
      <p>There is no overestimating the complexity of this 
          project, which has been delayed for several months while the back end 
          and network were completed and we sorted through several issues concerning 
          subsequent different generations of players. Unlike earlier projects, 
          which operated in limited spaces, the Getty Guide will traverse the 
          entire museum, roaming between multiple access points with hundreds 
          of players simultaneously connecting to the server.  Tests with the 
        first 100 players are  continuing through the month of February.</p>
      <p>More than any other museum, the Getty has put a great 
          deal of time, effort and resources into the handheld platform and a 
          digital network that links all information assets. Staff have extensively 
          researched both the technology and the visitor preferences to prepare 
        a system of information technologies and visitor service that is unparalleled.</p>
      <p>It is an extraordinary commitment that will have 
          a major impact on opening up this communications universe for other 
        institutions.</p>
      <h2>Museums and Archeological sites in Greece</h2>
      <p>Loosely related originally to the Olympic Games in 
          Athens, a potentially very significant development in multimedia interpretation 
          is quietly taking shape in Greece, part-financed by the European Union.  
        The Organization for the Development of Greek Culture (OPEP) has issued 
        a far-sighted and long-term tender for hand-held interpretation at 15 
        of the key museums and archeological sites in the country.  These include 
          the Acropolis, the stadium at Olympia, the Oracle of Delphi, the National 
          Archeological Museum in Athens, the Palace of Knossos, the newly discovered 
          Tombs of King Philip, father of Alexander the Great at Vergina, and 
        many others.</p>
      <p>The contract is likely to be the largest ever awarded 
          to an interpretation company, but it is unusual in at least one other 
          respect:  the tender documentation has stipulated that no less than 
          two-thirds of the players be multimedia devices, capable of playing 
          video, text and still images as well as audio, both for internal settings 
          like museums and challenging external sites.  The first sites will not 
          go live until the 2004 Olympic Games are safely in the history books, 
          but, taken as a group, they will represent the first wholesale and multi-site 
          installation of handheld multimedia devices, both indoors and out.  
        As such, they promise to become an important milestone in the development 
        and adoption of these technologies.</p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>With at least a dozen other handheld projects scheduled 
          to open this year, including an extensive installation at 15 Greek archeological 
          sites, 2004 will clearly be the breakout year for wireless multimedia 
          installations in museums.  Nevertheless, we are still at the early stage 
          of the platform&#8217;s life and adoption.  A tremendous amount is being 
          learned every day within a technological environment that is still rapidly 
          evolving. We often compare it to drinking from Niagara Falls. Even while 
          fully operational systems are now starting to open, it is critical that 
          the pilot programs continue to test, measure and learn from alternative 
          and innovative approaches and that there continue to be free sharing 
        of information among all those active in this sector.</p>
