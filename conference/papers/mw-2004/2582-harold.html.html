<p class="PaperTitle">Bringing Mars Home: the MarsQuest Online Project</p>

<p class="Author">James B. Harold and Paul B. Dusenbery, Space Science Institute, USA</p>

<p class='URL'><a href="http://www.spacescience.org/">http://www.spacescience.org/</a></p>
<p class="AbstractText">In October, 2000, the Space Science Institute of Boulder,
Colorado, launched MarsQuest: a 5000 square foot traveling exhibit on Mars and
Mars science. Two years later NSF and NASA gave their support to an associated
Web project called MarsQuest Online, a partnership between TERC, the Space
Science Institute, and JPL. The goal of the MarsQuest Online project was to
create a Web site that extended both the reach and scope of the traveling
exhibit. The program was premised on the idea that the effort expended on the
museum exhibit - the exhibit framework, interactive concepts, educational
goals, etc. - could be leveraged into a highly interactive on-line experience.</p>

<p class=AbstractText>While still in development, the site (<a
href="http://www.marsquestonline.org/" target="_blank">http://www.marsquestonline.org</a>) has
already been quite successful on a variety of fronts. It provides a wide
variety of activities, from 3D flyovers to drivable rovers, reflecting the
learning goals of the original exhibit. We've also found that selected
interactives, repackaged into a stand-alone kiosk piece, can be popular in
small venues (for instance, the local planetarium during the recent Mars
opposition). This paper will discuss the evolution of the project, our
successes (and challenges) in attempting to leverage from a physical
exhibition, and the ongoing evaluation program. The evaluation, which includes
interviews, database driven usage tracking, and log analysis, will test not
only the usability of the site, but also its effectiveness in meeting our
educational goals as compared to the original MarsQuest exhibit.</p>

<p class=AbstractText>Keywords: Mars, science, exhibits, on-line activities,

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>We are living in an extraordinary era of Mars exploration.
By the standards of planetary missions, a veritable flotilla of spacecraft has
been sent to Mars, and it is profoundly changing our understanding of the
planet. Nor is this exploration likely to end soon: over the next decade, the
U.S. and other nations will send increasingly sophisticated spacecraft to
explore Mars. </p>

<p>This ongoing exploration of Mars presents a tremendous
opportunity to engage and inform the public. In the fall of 2000, the Space
Science Institute (SSI) capitalized on this opportunity by launching MarsQuest,
a 5000 square foot traveling exhibit for museums and science centers.  Two
years later NSF and NASA gave their support to an associated Web project called
MarsQuest Online, a partnership between TERC, the Space Science Institute, and
JPL. The goal of the MarsQuest Online project was to create a Web site that
extended both the reach and scope of the traveling exhibit. The program was
premised in part on the idea that the effort expended on the museum exhibit -
the exhibit framework, interactive concepts, educational goals, etc - could be
leveraged into a successful, highly interactive on-line experience.</p>

<p>Now nearly complete, the MarsQuest Online Web site
consists of several distinct areas, each with a somewhat different target
audience and approach.  Here we focus on one of these areas: <b>Explore Mars</b>,
a section of the site modeled after the MarsQuest exhibit.  In this paper we
will introduce the original physical exhibit, and describe the evolution of the
project to create an on-line extension of it.  Finally, though summative
evaluation has not begun, we will discuss some preliminary results based on
data collected through the Web site.</p>

<h1>The MarsQuest Exhibit</h1>

<p>With major funding from the National Science Foundation
and NASA, the MarsQuest exhibit was designed to bring a new age of exploration
to the public by taking visitors to several important destinations on Mars.
Like sightseers in a national park on Earth, they see some of the wonders of
Mars, such as the solar system's largest volcano and a canyon as long as the
continental United States. Along the way, interactive exhibit components
introduce visitors to the methods that scientists use to explore Mars and
reveal some of what they have discovered.</p>

<p align=center class=caption style='text-align:center'>Figure 1: The canyons area of
the MarsQuest exhibit, showing several interactives as well as the Valles
Marineris mural.</p>

<p>The MarsQuest exhibit has two overarching themes: Mars
exploration, and comparisons between Earth and Mars. It is organized around five goals: </p>

<ul>
  <li>to present basic
    concepts about Mars' history, climate, and suitability for human exploration in
    an interactive, engaging context</li>
  <li>to teach Earth
    science by using Earth-Mars comparisons</li>
  <li>to increase
    understanding of science as a creative process of investigation</li>
 <li>to inspire interest
in scientific exploration by personalizing the use of science and emphasizing
the thrill of discovery</li>

<li>to develop a stimulating learning environment that reaches people
of diverse learning styles and backgrounds, especially those groups
traditionally underrepresented in science.</li>
</ul>

<p>The exhibit uses data from various NASA missions to
surround visitors with large-scale murals of the exhibit's destination sites on
Mars. This multi-media exhibit includes sixteen interactive components for
hands-on learning experiences; five computer stations where visitors navigate
through virtual presentations, manipulate computer models, or find information;
a video monitor that plays a brief animation of the formation of our solar
system; seven scale models depicting spacecraft and portions of Mars and Earth;
and the Mitsubishi Digital Imagination Theater, which presents a video of
high-definition images of Mars.</p>

<p>Examples of the interactive components include the <b>Hot
&amp; Cold Globes</b>, in which two copper hemispheres demonstrate the relative
sizes of Earth and Mars and the differences in their surface temperatures.
Visitors may touch the almost freezing Mars globe and compare it to Earth,
which is cool at the pole and warm along the equator.</p>

<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 2: The Hot &amp; Cold Globes interactive in the
MarsQuest exhibit. <br>
This is a good example of a successful museum interactive
probably not worth attempting to reproduce as an on-line experience. </p>

<p>At the Rover Test Bed, in order to drive a model rover
over simulated Martian terrain, visitors upload a series of commands to the
rover's computer. This is the same process that NASA scientists and engineers
used to drive the Sojourner rover on its exploration of the Pathfinder landing
site.</p>

<p>Thematically, the exhibit is structured around sites on
the planet.  Early on in the development process, it was decided to treat the
planet in the way you would a National Park.  Rather than discussing prospects
for colonization, for instance, we asked the question: <i>If you were a
tourist, where would you go?</i>  As a result, the exhibit was focused around
locations of compelling interest: Volcanoes, Canyons, and Rover Landing
Sites/Floodplains (at the time, the only rover mission was
Pathfinder/Sojourner, which landed in an ancient floodplain). The exhibit
components in each site expand on the dual themes of Earth-Mars comparisons and
Mars exploration.</p>

<p>MarsQuest fared well in its summative evaluation,
performed by Randi Korn and Associates (Korn, 2002).  Visitors moved more
slowly through MarsQuest than visitors in exhibits of a similar size.  In
interviews, visitors enjoyed the exhibit and were able to articulate at least part
of the exhibit's message.  They recalled specific facts about Mars, and
commented on Mars-Earth comparisons.</p>

<p>MarsQuest's initial tour was three years, during which it
visited 9 museums and science centers across the country.  In the fall of 2003,
the exhibit was pulled in for refurbishment. It began its second three-year
tour in late January of this year at The New Detroit Science Center, complete
with new interactives and a full-scale model of a MER rover. The exhibit now
also contains a kiosk with selected activities from MarsQuest Online, which
(besides advertising the site) will provide us with an opportunity to compare
usage of these pieces in different environments.</p>

<h1>Leveraging the Exhibit: MarsQuest Online</h1>

<p>The idea for the MarsQuest Online partnership developed
independently on two fronts.  SSI was pursuing support for a Web site based on
the exhibit, while TERC was pursuing support for an educational Web site on
Mars. Eventually TERC contacted SSI, and a joint proposal to the Division of
Elementary, Secondary and Informal Education of the National Science Foundation
was submitted, with TERC as the project lead.  TERC had also developed a
relationship with a group inside NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and
they formed the third partner of the project.  The Principal Investigator is
Dan Barstow (TERC); co-Investigator's are Paul Dusenbery (SSI), Paul Andres
(JPL) and Eric DeJong (JPL).  Chris Randall is the project director at TERC,
and James Harold is the project director at SSI.  The proposal was submitted to
NSF's Informal Division in part because of the connection with the exhibit, but
also because we were strongly advocating the Web as a potentially powerful
informal learning environment. This is a view that has been gaining momentum as
Web technologies allow more interactive and engaging experiences.  In fact, the
Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC) gave its year 2000 award
for innovation not to a physical exhibit, but to the Exploratorium's Web team
(ASTC, 2000)</p>

<p>The original proposal described a site with two major
areas: a <b>Virtual Exhibit</b>, containing short-duration activities, and an
area containing longer duration guided inquiries and investigations.  In the
Virtual Exhibit visitors were to pan through an image of the exhibit, clicking
on areas of interest.  This would lead them to various light on-line
activities, similar in content and complexity to those found in the exhibit. </p>

<p>The Investigations would be more complex activities that
tied to the Virtual Exhibit.  The hope was that people would be engaged by the
Exhibit, and then pursue more sophisticated questions through the <b>Investigations</b>. 
In this way we could not only serve audiences with different levels of
sophistication, but also move people from a novice to an intermediate or
advanced level of understanding.  </p>

<p>As is usually the case, the project evolved
significantly.  In the end, the Virtual Exhibit became <b>Explore Mars</b>,
still modeled after the exhibit, but using a different approach. The
Investigations became <b>Mars Mysteries</b>, activities that were less complex
than originally envisioned, though still more complex than the Explore Mars. 
Finally, a third major area was added to provide real-time access to imagery
from the new NASA rovers.  This piece includes a navigable, high-resolution
panorama that allows visitors to explore the rover findings in a visual context
(<a href="http://www.marsquestonline.org/mer/mer_viewer.php" target="_blank">http://www.marsquestonline.org/mer/mer_viewer.php</a>).</p>

<p>So in the end, the MarsQuest Online site consisted of
three major pieces: <b>Explore Mars</b> (modeled after the MarsQuest exhibit); <b>Mars
Mysteries</b> (more involved pieces that ask the visitor to solve puzzles); and
<b>Rover Images</b> (real-time data from the MER rovers).  Minor areas include
resource materials for teachers and the public.</p>

<p> <b><i>Figure

as the 'Quick Picks' shortcuts to particular activities (<a
href="http://www.marsquestonline.org/">http://www.marsquestonline.org</a>).</i></b></p>

<p>For the remainder of this paper we will focus on the <b>Explore
Mars</b> section.  Its intended connection with the MarsQuest exhibit created
unique challenges, as well as ultimately guiding the development process along
a particular path.</p>

<h1>Choosing an Audience</h1>

<p>The most frequently asked question by our advisory
committee, evaluators, and partners was, 'Who is your audience?'  While a
perfectly reasonable question, it led to some confusion and a great deal of
discussion.  Exhibits can be designed to target the population that typically
visits museums and science centers.  That population is well defined, and has
the added advantage that you can easily locate it for evaluation purposes.  The
Web, by contrast, contains a vastly more diverse audience.  Science center visitors
are certainly a part of that audience, but a relatively small part.  Visitors
to this site could be expected to cover a wide spectrum, from true 'Mars geeks'
at one end, to those who arrive at the site entirely by accident (one search
engine hit resulted from a request for '3D model of a fly', delivering the user
to our page containing 'Fly in 3D over models of Mars').  More questions then
arise. Do you intend to design for that larger audience?  Are you trying to
attract people with no prior interest in science?  Or are you catering to the
science choir: the people that will hover over their computers for the duration
of the next big space mission event? Do you simply build what you want, and
assume that somewhere on the Web, somebody will be interested ( given the
number of people on-line, this is probably true).</p>

<p>Ultimately, the development team decided to focus on the
center of this spectrum: the 'science attentive' audience.  This group is
comparable to the science center visitorship: they are people with a general,
if not obsessive, interest in science.  There were three basic reasons for this
decision:</p>

<ul class="listwithbullets">
  <li>The science attentive audience is a sensible middle ground for
    achieving our goals.  Focusing our efforts on those already deeply interested
    in Mars wouldn't be the best use of the funds of NSF, which seeks to increase
    the number of people familiar with science topics.  Conversely, focusing on
    those with no interest in science is a higher bar than we were willing to
    attempt.</li>
  <li>This audience has at least some overlap with the audience the
    exhibit was designed for.  Since our intent was to leverage as much as possible
    from the exhibit development, it made sense to target a similar audience for
    the Web site</li>
  <li>Operationally, it was the only way to accomplish our evaluation
  goals. If we chose this group, our evaluators could go to a local science
  center and recruit visitors to participate in the evaluation.  To cast a wider
  net would have made it prohibitively difficult to actually locate potential
  study candidates.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Design Approach</h1>

<p>The most significant change to the original Mars Tour
concept was to abandon the idea of using floor plans or panoramas of the
exhibit as an organizing structure.  By the time the project was funded we had
developed some experience with that approach through SSI's <b>Space Weather
Center</b> exhibit, a small (800 square foot) exhibit on the sun and sun-Earth
connections (Dusenbery, 2002).  For its Web presence we had built a navigable
QuickTime VR environment that allowed visitors to explore the exhibit, clicking
on text panels and videos when they found items of interest (<a
href="http://www.spacescience.org/SWOP/SWCV/1.html" target="_blank">http://www.spacescience.org/SWOP/SWCV/1.html</a>). 
What became clear was that Web site users who had never seen the exhibit (which
constitute the vast majority of visitors) did not particularly care about the
exhibit layout, nor was it an intuitive framework for them.  As a result, the
development team decided to develop the MarsQuest Online site in a way that did
not make explicit reference to the physical layout or structure of the exhibit.</p>

<p>We remained convinced, however, that the work that went
into developing the story, concepts, and learning goals for the exhibit could
be used in the Web site.  So, while abandoning the physical framework of the
exhibit, we adopted its conceptual framework, structuring the site around physical
features of Mars: Volcanoes, Canyons, Landing Sites, etc.  Ironically, the
summative evaluation of the MarsQuest Exhibit showed that people were largely
unaware of this framework: visitors moved to whatever exhibit component caught
their eye, without recognizing that they were in a 'Volcanoes' versus a
'Canyons' area.  Nevertheless, it is an excellent way to structure the content,
both as a governing concept during the design phase, and as a navigational tool
on the Web site.</p>

<p>A side benefit of abandoning a more literal treatment of
the exhibit is that we were not forced to adapt every component of the exhibit
for the Web site. We were free to chose components that worked well on the Web
(for instance, <b>Drive a Rover</b>), put aside components that are best as
physical interactives (<b>Hot and Cold Globes</b>), and, when inspiration
struck, create new on-line interactives that were consistent with the themes
and learning goals of the exhibit.  </p>

<p>In addition to the exhibit's thematic framework, we also
set out to borrow a design philosophy of the science exhibit world.  We
believed from the start that the Web has many similarities to a museum as an
informal learning environment: visitors to each are self-motivated but easily
distracted.  They have little investment in a given activity, and many
alternative activities they could pursue.  They may spend very little time with
a given component, and as a result learning goals must be achieved quickly.  We
therefore set out to design a site that contained a variety of focused, short
duration pieces that could achieve their learning goals with only one or two
minutes of use.  </p>

<h1>Technology Choice</h1>

<p>We had a high technical bar for what we wanted the various
site components to accomplish.  To meet the project goals the pieces would need
to be visually engaging, have various game-like qualities (real time
interaction, animation, 3D), handle high resolution imagery and dynamic
content, be scaleable, and minimize development time.  At the same time, the
site needed to be accessible to as many people as possible, minimizing the
number of necessary plug-ins, and providing for low-bandwidth solutions through
compression and streaming. </p>

<p>At the time we were choosing our approach, several
products would have provided us with 3D capability, but all required large
(3-5MB) plug-ins.  Macromedia Flash would satisfy most of the other
requirements, had a small plug-in, and was installed on a large number of
machines, but it couldn't provide us with 3D.  </p>

<p>In view of these factors, we ultimately decided on a
combination of Flash and Director/Shockwave.  Flash was used wherever possible
because of its small plug-in requirements.  When 3D was necessary, Shockwave
was used.  A significant advantage to this approach was that Shockwave could
import and interact with Flash movies.  We therefore designed all user
interfaces in Flash, and imported them into the Shockwave pieces.  This
provided a consistent GUI design across the <b>Explore Mars</b> area. It also
allowed us to make both the Flash and the Shockwave pieces scaleable: all
activities were programmed to open in standalone windows that could be
maximized to the user's screen size.  This was a particularly important
capability given the extensive use of Mars imagery.</p>

<p>Finally, rather than building a single Flash piece that
would comprise the entire site, we chose to build a more conventional HTML
framework and embed within it standalone interactives.  There was a variety of
reasons for this, including provision of a more intuitive navigation interface,
facilitation of search engine indexing, and flexibility for later modifications
and additions.</p>

<h1>Overview of the Interactives</h1>

<p><b>Explore Mars</b>, like <b>MarsQuest</b>, is organized
into several areas: <i>The Red Planet</i> (an introductory area), <i>Volcanoes,</i>
<i>Canyons</i>, <i>Rovers,</i> and <i>Floods</i>.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="harold.fig4.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: Come with us to Mars, The Red Planet, Volcanoes, Canyons, Rovers, Floods " width="400" height="278"></p>

<p class=MsoCaption> Figure 4: The Explore Mars home page, showing the
different areas.  As the buttons are moused over, descriptive text is
displayed.  This allowed us to provide some explanation without requiring
excessive screen real estate. <a href="http://www.marsquestonline.org/tour/welcome/" target="_blank">http://www.marsquestonline.org/tour/welcome/</a></p>

<p>Each area consists primarily of a collection of
interactive Flash or Shockwave pieces. There is some text content, as well as a
<i>Fast Facts</i> page and some animation, but in general, like the exhibit,
the emphasis is on interaction.  Some interactives are unique to an area;
others are used repeatedly with different data sets.  For instance, the <b>Fly
in 3D</b> piece uses the same engine to render different parts of Mars in
different parts of the site.  The use of external data sets to accomplish this
not only saves us coding time, but saves the users download time as well.  Once
a piece has been downloaded it will be locally cached, and if it is run again
in a different area, only the new data set will be downloaded. </p>

<p>Below we summarize the interactive pieces: where they are
used, and how they connect with the exhibit.  Programming and design were done
internally at SSI by James Harold, Tyson Brawley, and Evaldas Vidugiris.</p>

<p>Find the Feature:
Users are prompted to find features on <b>Mars on Earth</b> (e.g., the tallest
volcano) with a globe than they can spin.  This is a modified version of a
software piece from the exhibit <i>Virtual Planets</i>.  Area: 'The Red
Planet'.</p>

<p>Fly to Mars: Users are
challenged to find the right time to launch a probe from Earth to Mars.  There
is no equivalent in the exhibit.  Area: 'The Red Planet'.</p>

<p><b>How Big?</b>: 
Users can drop familiar Earth objects (school buses, Texas) onto Mars images in
order to gain a sense of scale.  There is no direct equivalent in the exhibit,
though many pieces in the exhibit stress scales.  Areas: all.</p>

<p><b>Earth or Mars?</b>:
Users are asked to identify whether an image is from Earth or from Mars. The
exhibit contains an equivalent piece using large graphics.  Area: 'The Red
Planet'.</p>

<p><b>Can you Find…</b>:
Visitors are asked to locate a thumbnail image inside a larger image of Martian
terrain. This has conceptual similarities to some exhibit pieces, but no direct
equivalent.  Areas: all.</p>

<p><b>Fly in 3D</b>:
Visitors can fly over different parts of Mars in 3D.  There is no direct
equivalent in the exhibit, although there was a 3D computer model of the
Pathfinder landing site.  Areas: all.</p>

<p><b>Drive a Rover</b>:
Visitors drive a virtual rover, uploading command sequences one day at a time. 
This piece was modeled after a drivable rover in the exhibit.  Area: 'Rovers'.</p>

<h1>Evaluation</h1>

<p>From the start, evaluation of the MarsQuest Online effort
was a central goal of the project. We weren't simply interested in usability
testing and log analysis, but in comparing museums and the Web as informal
learning environments. This is non-trivial: building a Web site that gets large
numbers of hits is one thing, but determining whether anyone is learning from
it is quite another.  Nor is it clear whether leveraging from a successful
exhibit should produce a successful Web site in the first place.  Are content
or activities that succeed in an exhibit necessarily successful on the Web? 
Can a Web site interactive be as engaging as an exhibit, or as effective in
helping visitors learn?  </p>

<p>This connection between exhibits and the Web was
sufficiently important to the project that we hired RK&amp;A, the same group
that had worked on the MarsQuest exhibit, as evaluators. It isn't the intent of
this paper to go into the evaluation process in any depth: that can be done
once the summative is complete.  In summary, however, we have to date performed
front end and formative evaluations on the project.  These helped to identify
the expectations of the users (the front end was conducted using visitors to
the MarsQuest exhibit: Korn, 2002), and to identify usability concerns in the
beta version of the site (Werner, 2003). </p>

<p>The program's summative evaluation will be conducted by
RK&amp;A in early 2004.  It will include analysis of the Web site logs and
usage data (see next section), as well as interviews with site visitors. The
interview portion will include site visitors who have seen the MarsQuest
Exhibit as well as visitors who have not.  In that way we hope to determine how
the exhibit and the Web site, together and separately, affect visitor's
attitudes and knowledge about Mars and Mars exploration.  </p>

<h1>Visitor Traffic and Behavior</h1>

<p>While summative results were not available in time for
this paper, we are able to present some preliminary statistics collected
through the Web site. </p>

<p>As this is written, interest in Mars is peaking due to the
various Mars missions in operation.  This is excellent news for the site, since
it brings enormous spikes in traffic (these are being handled by the gracious
mirroring efforts of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR)
and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), to whom we are extremely
grateful).  However, these kinds of traffic fluctuations make it difficult to
analyze the site's success.  Not only is the number of visits varying by a
factor of more than a hundred, but the behavior of the visitors is changing as
well.  We can see clear shifts in the popularity of the pieces (not
surprisingly, rovers are gaining ground), and increases in the amount of time
visitors spend on the site (number of pages viewed and the percentage who run
interactives).  That suggests that the interest level and/or type of visitor
have changed due to the popularity of NASA's rovers. This behavior is best
explored at a later date, when this traffic surge has ended, and may require
analyzing data from different time periods separately. Nevertheless, the data
we have to date are of interest, so we present here some preliminary
observations. </p>

<h2>Results from Site Logs</h2>

<p>The average number of pages per visit (including single
page visits) has historically been over 7, so the site is at least engaging
enough to encourage visitors to explore.  Interestingly, the number of pages
per visit has more than doubled (to 15 or more) since the first Mars rover
landed.  That may suggest that visitors to the site today are more interested
in Mars as a result of the rover press coverage, and correspondingly more
interested in spending time on the site.  </p>

<p>Since the interactive components are central to the site,
one measure of success is the percentage of individuals running those
interactives.  This number is a function of the referring site.  For visitors
following links from sites such as NASA or the SSI home page (who are
presumably most likely to be interested in this site's content), approximately
two-thirds run at least one interactive.  For referrers such as Google, who
will include many accidental visitors, this value drops to 35%. </p>

<p>As was mentioned, content popularity is evolving.  Prior
to the rover landings, the most popular interactive by a significant margin was
the <b>3D flyover</b>. More recently, the <b>Drive a Rover</b> interactive has
been gaining ground.  Thematically, the most popular area of <b>Explore Mars</b>
is easily <b>Volcanoes</b>.  This shouldn't be surprising: volcanoes are
familiar objects with exciting connotations.  It does suggest that users are
making deliberate choices based on the organizational structure of the site. 
This is supported by results from the formative evaluation in which the
evaluators reported that users were clearly reading the descriptions of the
areas and making choices accordingly.</p>

<h2>Results from Usage Data</h2>

<p>While log files can provide information about how users
move through HTML pages, they do not by default track movement within Flash and
Shockwave. Therefore, as part of the ongoing evaluation, we inserted code into
the interactive pieces to record usage information into a database.  This
typically includes start and stop times, various types of scoring information
(how many rocks were found, spacecraft launched, etc.), whether the <i>help</i>
button was pressed, and so on.  Since the refurbished version of the MarsQuest
exhibit includes a kiosk featuring several MarsQuest Online software
components, it will provide us with the interesting opportunity of collecting
data from both the exhibit and the Web, and compare usage in the two
environments.</p>

<p>Analysis of this usage data has not begun in earnest, but
we present here some preliminary results from the rover interactive. 
Historically this was the second most popular piece on the site (behind the 3D
flyovers), and it is now tied with the flyovers since the MER rovers went into
operation. </p>

<p>In this piece, users command a rover to investigate
various rocks.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="harold.fig5.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: Rover control screen with course plotted" width="400" height="302"></p>

<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 5: The Drive a Rover
interactive. </p>

<p> Users prepare sequences of commands for the rover, which
will execute one sequence per 'day'.  They have eight days to reach as many
rocks as they can.  The site and rocks are modeled after the Pathfinder/Sojourner
mission. When a rock is reached, an image of the real rock, as photographed by
Pathfinder, is displayed.</p>

<p> The piece is modeled after the Sojourner rover, and uses
imagery from that mission.  As with NASA, an entire day's command sequence (move
forwards or backwards, turn left or right) must be planned out in advance, and
only one sequence of commands can be sent per 'day'.  Users have 8 days to
reach as many rocks as possible.  The primary learning goal for the piece is a
simple one: for users to understand that rovers are not joysticked around the
surface like an RC car, but instead given sequences of commands that must then
be carried out without further human intervention.</p>

<h3>Time in Piece</h3>

<p>The chart shows how long in minutes users spent in the
Rover piece. </p>

<p class="caption"><img src="harold.fig6.jpg" alt="Chart: Number of Users by Time in Minutes " width="400" height="319"></p>

<p class=MsoCaption> Figure 6: Histogram of time spent using the Rover
activity.</p>

<p> The final bin is neglected in calculating averages, since
it likely includes users who left the interactive running after leaving their
computer. These times also exclude the initial screen, which doubles as an
introduction and loader, so download times are not included.  The data give an
average usage time of 2:20, with a median of approximately 1:30. 
Interestingly, this is similar to the usage times for computer interactives in
the MarsQuest exhibit at one of its two evaluation sites, which gave a mean
time of 2:48 and a median of 1:22 (MarsQuest summative evaluation).  Note that
there is also a substantial spread in the times, with one-third of visitors
spending more than 3 minutes with the piece.</p>

<h3>Activity in Piece</h3>

<p>There are 5 target rocks in the piece, and the user has 8
days to reach them.   Approximately one-third of users reached no rocks;
one-third reached only one.  No user reached all five. This last result isn't
surprising: reaching every rock is quite difficult, and only the concerted
efforts of a student programmer convinced us it was possible.  However, low
scores do not imply lack of interest. Only 15% of the users failed to complete
a single day, and over 40% completed all eight days.  So, while in one sense no
users win', two-thirds of the users demonstrate their ability to navigate by
reaching at least one rock, and over one-third of users continue to try until
the program stops them.  These results are encouraging in two respects: the
ability to reach even one rock suggests that we are meeting our primary
learning goal, and the persistence of the users suggests that the piece is
reasonably engaging. </p>

<h1>The Future</h1>

<p>At the time of this writing, the Spirit and Opportunity
rovers are much in the news, and are having a dramatic influence on the traffic
to the site.  For a brief time, the public at large will be aware of the latest
results in planetary exploration, and many will be taking part vicariously in
the exploration of Mars.  While the press covers the latest successes and
challenges of MER robots, opportunities exist to create lasting changes in the
public's understanding of Mars and how we explore it.  The success of the
MarsQuest Online site in contributing to this understanding will not be known
for some time: full evaluation of the site will not be complete until the
summative interviews have been conducted, the rover missions have ended, and
traffic to the site has stabilized.  In the meantime, we will continue making
refinements to individual pieces and the site as a whole, responding to
formative evaluation results, and adapting our content as Mars Express and the
Spirit and Opportunity rovers once again change the way we look at Mars.</p>
