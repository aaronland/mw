        <p class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</p>
        <p class="AbstractText">Scholarly researchers bring a unique set of expectations 
          to bear upon the building of databases in a university museum environment. 
          Their investigations on species distributions, biodiversity and climate 
          change, to name a few, require analysis of large sets of data. The creation 
          of on-line interfaces to collections databases, complete with sophisticated 
          Web-based tools, will empower researchers to convert raw data into new 
          scientific knowledge. The University of Alberta Museums has developed 
          an innovative Web interface to one of its museum databases, providing 
          researchers tools to facilitate, the generation of not only entomological 
          specimen data held in the database, but also dynamically generated seasonal 
          histograms, the ability to plot search results on a map, and the presentation 
          of knowledge summaries of entomological species.  This paper discusses 
          how the University of Alberta Museums, in conjunction with other departments 
          on campus, develops this type of enhanced Web interface to collections 
          databases.  This initiative will be explained within the context of 
          the University of Alberta Museums' unique decentralized administrative 
          model.  </p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Like many museums, the University of Alberta Museums, in Edmonton, 
          Canada, has developed Web interfaces to databases in order to broaden 
          access to collections.  However, because it is a university with a decentralized 
          museum system, the University of Alberta Museums faces unique challenges 
          in terms of its diverse collecting community and the specific teaching 
          and research needs of its faculty.  This paper will describe the administrative 
          model of the University of Alberta Museums and the role of a central 
          department, Museums and Collections Services, in developing collection 
          databases and Web interfaces as part of a comprehensive Virtual Museum. 
          It will also provide detailed technical information on the Web interface 
          to the E.H. Strickland Entomological Museum as an example of an interface 
          with enhanced features for research purposes.  Future directions for 
          digitization at the University of Alberta Museums will also be outlined 
          to indicate the potential of this 'little search engine'. 
        </p>
        <h1>The University of Alberta Museums Administrative Model</h1>
        <p>The University of Alberta is located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada Edmonton  
          is the province's capital city with a population of one million 
          people in the greater metropolitan area.  One of the largest universities 
          in Canada, the University of Alberta has a student enrolment of 36,000 
          students and a staff of 7,000.  Established in 1908, the University 
          of Alberta has collected artifacts and specimens for nearly 90 years 
          and now houses one of Canada's largest collections of approximately 
          18 million artifacts and specimens in both human history and natural 
          history.  Human history collections include art, classics, archaeology, 
          ethnography, anthropology, and clothing and textiles.  Natural history 
          collections include paleontology, both invertebrate and vertebrate, 
          mineralogy, meteorites, petrology, entomology, zoology and herbaria.  
        </p>
        <p>The collections of the University of Alberta Museums are distributed 
          throughout the University campus.  There is no one central building 
          housing museums.  Instead, it is a distributed system of 35 museums 
          and collections spread over 16 departments and four faculties.  Each 
          collection is housed within the academic unit that uses the collection 
          for teaching and research.  While each collection has a curator designated 
          by its respective department, curators are faculty members with teaching 
          and research responsibilities. Few collections have collections management 
          or technical staff.  </p>
        <p>The University of Alberta Museums system is a collaborative group orchestrated 
          through the efforts of:</p>
      <ul class="listwithbullets">
        <li>
          Museums 
            and Collections Services (MACS), a central academic support unit with 
            a small staff of nine people who provide expertise to individual collections 
            and on a campus-wide basis by developing policies, procedures and 
            programs for collections management and digitization, exhibitions, 
            educational programs, community outreach and administration; </li>
        <li>
          The 
            Collections Committee, a policy committee with elected representatives 
            from across campus; </li>
        <li>
          The 
            Curators Committee, with curators and collections representatives 
            from each of the 35 collections; and </li>
        <li>
          The 
            Friends of the University of Alberta Museums, a not-for-profit society 
            formed in 1984 to support the University of Alberta Museums.</li>
      </ul>
      
        <h1>Development of Foundation Databases</h1>
        <p>As part of its mandate, Museums and Collections Services provides a 
          coordinated approach to the computerization of collection artifacts 
          and specimens through the development of standardized procedures for 
          organizing collections and the implementation of centralized collections 
          management software.  In the area of digitization, Museums and Collections 
          Services, in conjunction with curators and collections staff, develops 
          and maintain foundation databases of collections data and develop Web 
          interfaces to those collections.</p>
        <p>Before the Web interfaces to collections can be examined, it is important 
          to review how the collections management system, in which the on-line 
          collections are housed, was developed.  The decentralized nature of 
          the collections impacted how the collections management system was implemented 
          and, later, the nature of the Web interfaces.   </p>
        <p>In the early 1990s, Museums and Collections Services led the implementation 
          of a coordinated centralized collections management software system.  
          Multi MIMSY was selected as the collections management system of choice, 
          following consultation with curators, collections staff and the University 
          of Alberta's Computing and Network Services. </p>
        <p>By 1994, two collections, the University of Alberta Art and Artifact 
          Collection and the University of Alberta Zoology Museum, began using 
          Multi MIMSY. Given the diverse nature of these collections, a decision 
          was made to create two separate instances of the database. As other 
          collections adopted the collections management system, this precedent 
          was followed, and each collection was allocated a new database instance. 
          A total of twenty-three collections, on sixteen database instances, 
          now use Multi MIMSY as their collections management system. The remaining 
          collections on campus either have their own collections software or 
          have not yet computerized their holdings.</p>
        <p>This approach to collections database development has been advantageous 
          in many ways. With only one collection to take into account, it has 
          been a relatively easy task to develop the generic system interface 
          to meet the specific needs of the collection. In terms of data integrity 
          and security, collections staff can only access their own collections 
          data, thereby eliminating the risk to other collections data. Furthermore, 
          as the relative number of records on each database is low, the systems 
          can perform at a consistently high level.</p>
        <p>There are also some disadvantages of maintaining multiple systems. 
          For example, each time an upgrade is required, the upgrade must be run 
          on each database, resulting in additional staff time and resources needed 
          for database management and maintenance. The development of multiple 
          versions of authorities, such as place names, is also a draw on the 
          limited time and resources of collections staff.  To address these issues, 
          in conjunction with curators, the possibility of amalgamating some databases 
          with similar needs is being explored.  It is anticipated that some collection 
          databases will be amalgamated, thus reducing the number of database 
          instances. Collections staff are also looking at ways to eliminate the 
          duplication of authorities through the sharing of resources.</p>
        <p>While Museums and Collections Services has successfully created numerous 
          database instances and collections data entry is proceeding on a regular 
          basis, there is still a significant quantity of collections information 
          awaiting on-line cataloguing.  Future goals are to greatly increase 
          the number of records in the database.  However, as is the case with 
          many museums, this goal is dependent on the availability of financial 
          resources.  </p>
        <p>While some collections at the University of Alberta Museums have sufficient 
          staff dedicated to on-line cataloguing, others do not.  Many collections 
          hire students or temporary staff to perform collections work.  It is 
          often not cost-effective to train these individuals to enter data directly 
          into the collections management system.  In order to circumnavigate 
          this issue, Museums and Collections Services has developed load utilities.  
          Temporary staff and volunteers can now easily create load files in a 
          spreadsheet application.  The load files are then run through the load 
          utility in order to populate the database.  This method is working well, 
          especially for loading specimen data into natural history collections.  
          For example, as a result of using the load utility, content in the E.H. 
          Strickland Entomological Museum more than doubled in 2003. Plans are 
          underway to adapt the load utility, where appropriate, to other instances 
          of the database.</p>
        <h1>Developing Web Interfaces</h1>
        <p>When computerization of collections at the University of Alberta began, 
          it was considered sufficient to provide access to the information using 
          the collections management system application.  It quickly became apparent, 
          however, that this method of retrieval was inadequate.  Curators, for 
          the most part, did not have the time to learn the querying skills required 
          to gain intellectual access to their collections.  Furthermore, providing 
          access to other scholars, researchers, and students was proving difficult.  
          Sets of data had to be assembled, vetted, and shipped in order to provide 
          access to the data held in the collections database.  A means to provide 
          simpler and broader access to collections data was required.  </p>
        <p>To fulfill this need, and as a result of the development of the internet, 
          Web interfaces to collections data were considered.  In collaboration 
          with selected collections, Museums and Collections Services began developing 
          Web interfaces to the databases.  As a result, the onus was no longer 
          on collections staff to provide access via the collections management 
          system.  The implementation of Web interfaces not only saved time spent 
          assembling data sets for researchers, but also made collections data 
          available to a much wider audience.  By broadening access to collections 
          data, Web interfaces also facilitated the University's goal to 
          share resources with the community and engage community users.  Broadened 
          access also served to demonstrate the richness of collections housed 
          at the University of Alberta Museums.  </p>
        <p>Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of the collections and the fact 
          that separate database instances were created for each collection, it 
          quickly became apparent that a Web interface would have to be developed 
          for each database instance.  These interfaces needed to be tailored 
          to the foundation databases from which the information was drawn and 
          also to the requirements of individual curators and the diverse audiences 
          of each Web interface.</p>
        <p>An example of a unique collection need was evident in the first Web 
          interface developed by Museums and Collections Services.  The interface 
          was to the Pathology Gross Teaching Collection of the Faculty of Medicine.  
          The Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology had a large pathology 
          collection, and professors in the department expressed interest in integrating 
          the collection with teaching. Due to the sensitivity of the collection, 
          it was necessary to password-protect the site in order to limit access 
          to medical students only.  The collection has since been incorporated 
          into WebCT (Web Course Tools) and is used extensively for teaching medical 
          students.</p>
        <p>In 2001, Museums and Collections Services launched the Virtual Museum 
          Web site <a href="http://www.museums.ualberta.ca/" target="_blank">http://www.museums.ualberta.ca</a>.  
          The Web site, of course, has many purposes, but one of its major objectives 
          is to provide access to the research collections of the University of 
          Alberta.  Since that time, Museums and Collections Services has developed 
          seven Web interfaces to diverse collections including, the University 
          of Alberta Art and Artifact Collection, the W.G. Hardy Collection of 
          Ancient Near Eastern and Classical Antiquities, and the Clothing and 
          Textiles Collection.  Natural history collections with Web interfaces 
          include the E.H. Strickland Entomological Museum, the Laboratory for 
          Vertebrate Paleontology, and the Mineralogy Museum.  A further Web interface 
          to the Ukrainian Folklore Archives is ready for launch.</p>
        <p>Throughout the early projects, the intention was to model the Web interface 
          on the functionality provided by the database. But over time, it became 
          obvious that the interface had become the primary tool for researching 
          collections data. Computational Web-based tools, such as data plotting, 
          demonstrated the powerful additional functionality that could be provided 
          through the Web interface. This shift in thinking has impacted the way 
          Multi MIMSY has been adapted to meet collection needs.  For example, 
          the Ukrainian Folklore Archives database was originally developed in 
          a complex way to allow searching on the anglicized version of a Ukrainian 
          name. Later, when a Web interface was being developed for the collection, 
          it became apparent that the search functionality at the database level 
          was unnecessary and created data entry difficulties. Although the data 
          was still drawn from the database, the search interface on the Web was 
          able to provide this functionality in a much simpler fashion.</p>
        <p>As Web interfaces have been developed, collections staff increasingly 
          see the potential of adding enhanced features. In one notable case, 
          the E.H. Strickland Entomological Museum envisioned providing current 
          species data as well as specimen data to those using the site. In order 
          to do this, a creative solution had to be found within the database 
          to allow for this functionality. This led to an adaptation of the Subject 
          Authority, a module where content and themes represented in the collection 
          are recorded, into a Species Authority. Specimen records of that particular 
          species were then linked to the Species Authority.  Using the same relationships 
          established in the database, users are now able to search on both species 
          and specimen data.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="rennick.fig1.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: Species Authority" width="400" height="288"></p>

        <p class="caption">Fig. 2: University of Alberta E.H. Strickland Entomological Museum<br>
        Interface Species Page</p>
        <p>As the interfaces are used in teaching, further demands have been made 
          on the collections management system. The Paleobotany Collection, for 
          example, uses the teaching collection in laboratory work. The data for 
          this collection has been entered into the system complete with images.  
          Paleobotany students needed to have a convenient way to review the content 
          of their labs.  In order to meet this need, a field was added to the 
          database indicating the lab to which the specimen belongs.  As a result, 
          students are able to obtain this information directly from the Web interface 
          when completing their lab assignments. </p>
        <p>In a similar vein, the University of Alberta Art and Artifact Collection 
          is currently reviewing subject access models for works of art in order 
          to provide researchers and students a thematically based tool for discovery.  
          It is anticipated that art history students will be able to drill down 
          through a hierarchically structured subject index to find works of art 
          based on their research themes. </p>
        <p>Museums and Collections Services has always worked with collections 
          to develop metadata, value and content standards. From the beginning, 
          Museums and Collections Services has employed the Canadian Heritage 
          Information Network (CHIN) metadata structure in the development of 
          databases. As distributed networks become more prominent, the data structure 
          for some of the natural history collections has been revisited in order 
          to comply with Darwin Core, a set of standards used for search and retrieval 
          of natural history collections.  (<a
href="http://tsadev.speciesanalyst.net/documentation/ow.asp?DarwinCoreV1" target="_blank">http://tsadev.speciesanalyst.net/documentation/ow.asp?DarwinCoreV1</a>)</p>
        <p>Furthermore, to ensure commonality between interfaces, efforts have 
          been made to ensure that data is treated in a similar manner and that 
          authorities are not developed completely independent of each other. 
          Plans are in place to further harmonize and share the authorities, as 
          appropriate, between collections.  </p>
        <p>In order to ensure interoperability with partner research networks, 
          Museums and Collections Services has recently converted a set of data 
          into the DiGIR (Distributed Generic Information Retrieval) protocol.  
          The University of Alberta Museums currently participates in two distributed 
          research networks.  It is a partner with the Canadian Biodiversity Information 
          Facility (CBIF) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).  
          As a result, data on the University of Alberta Museums Freshwater Invertebrate 
          Collection is being made available through the Species Analyst database.  
          The University of Alberta Museums also participates in the HerpNet project 
          based at the University of Kansas.  </p>
        <h1>Technical Infrastructure</h1>
        <p>The technical infrastructure used to develop Web interfaces has also 
          evolved over the past few years.  The first Web interface was built 
          using frames, ASP (Active Server Pages) as a scripting language, and 
          was hosted on an IIS (Internet information server) Web server.  The 
          drawbacks of using frame pages were soon realized as creating links 
          directly to case pages was very difficult, and navigating through the 
          site was complex.  As a result, subsequent Web interfaces developed 
          do not use frame pages.  </p>
        <p>ASP as the scripting language was eventually replaced by  PHP (Hypertext 
          Preprocessor).  PHP was chosen due to its speed.  In PHP modules, all 
          activity runs in the PHP memory space and, as there is no need to communicate 
          with objects in different processes, PHP code runs faster.  PHP supports 
          all major platforms (UNIX, Windows and mainframes), and features native 
          support for most popular databases. In addition, PHP was selected due 
          to its short learning curve, quick development time and high performance 
          (<a
href="http://www.php.net/" target="_blank">www.php.net</a>).  </p>
        <p>The Web interface of the E.H. Strickland Entomological Museum was developed 
          using PHP.   PHP is embedded into HTML pages and is executed by a Web 
          server for every user request.  The interface to the E.H. Strickland 
          Entomological Museum uses the Apache Web server. The Apache Web server 
          is platform independent, highly configurable, extensible and provides 
          a stable Web application environment without the constant worry of security 
          flaws and patches (<a href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_blank">www.apache.org</a>). 
          Digital collections information is stored within an Oracle 8i database 
          and OCI (Oracle Call Interface) is used within PHP to communicate information 
          from application to the database and vice versa.</p>
        <p>The E.H. Strickland Entomological Museum interface is able to generate 
          a histogram of the seasonal distribution of adult specimens within the 
          Entomological database. The histogram image is dynamically generated 
          by a Java application that retrieves specimen data and groups the data 
          by collection date. The histogram uses a blue bar to represent all specimens 
          collected within a specified date range and a red bar that excludes 
          specimens collected at the same date and location.</p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="rennick.fig3.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: Species Distribution as a bar graph"></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig. 3: University of Alberta E.H. Strickland Entomological 
          Museum Interface Histogram </p>
        <p>The histogram assists researchers to determine the seasonal occurrence 
          of a particular species. A histogram diagram can be created for specific 
          time range to display the occurrence of specimen and observation data 
          over time. Factors such as plant growth or predator population can influence 
          the specimen occurrences in a given date range. </p>
        <p>Another enhanced feature of the interface is the capability of plotting 
          geo-referenced collections data onto a two dimensional map. The client 
          side mapping application was developed using Java servlets that communicate 
          with ESRI's ArcGIS 4.01 mapping server in order to generate two-dimensional 
          maps. The ArcGIS 4.01 server is a Java application that requires a Java 
          capable Web server.  Therefore TomCat 4 is used as the Java enabled 
          Web server. The map server is set to generate a 10TM projection of Alberta.  
          For that reason, the geo-referenced collections data is converted into 
          10TM coordinates before it is plotted onto the map.  UTM (Universal 
          Transverse Mercator) divides the world into 60 numbered zones, both 
          north and south, separated by the equator.  Alberta falls between two 
          zones (UTM Zone 11 and UTM Zone 12).  Therefore, a decision was made 
          to use 10TM projection because 10TM projection runs from the 120<sup>th</sup> 
          degree of longitude to the 110<sup>th</sup> degree of longitude and 
          completely covers the Province of Alberta.</p>
        <p>Once specimen results are displayed, a user has the option of plotting 
          the specimens onto a map of Alberta. This allows the researcher a completely 
          new ability to explore spatial patterns in the biodiversity data right 
          from the start of the analysis process. As the maps are on-screen, they 
          can be manipulated to zoom in or out and pan around. Shading schemes 
          and classification methods can be changed, and data added or removed 
          at will. </p>
        <p class="caption"><img src="rennick.fig4.jpg" alt="Screen Shot: species distribution on a map of the province" width="400" height="272"></p>
        <p class="caption">Fig. 4: University of Alberta E.H. Strickland Entomological 
          Museum Interface Mapping Application </p>
        
        <p>A spatially-referenced specimen database provides researchers with 
          answers to questions such as: What species are present at this location? 
          What geographic features are common among the habitat of a certain species?  
          Plotting specimens on a map is useful, but the full potential of GIS 
          lies in its ability to integrate data from a variety of layers. At a 
          basic level, this merely involves combining layers on-screen to compare 
          patterns, but it also permits researchers to integrate data from a variety 
          of sources. For example, a researcher may want to compare human population 
          census data with geo-referenced specimen data to determine the impact 
          of human populations on a particular species.  Researchers could also 
          add other types of data, e.g. data on rivers, to provide information 
          about changes in water sources. As a result, rather than being a product 
          of finished research, the geo-referenced collections data becomes an 
          integral part of the research process (Gregory, 2002).</p>
        <p>Another important feature of the E.H. Strickland Entomological Museum 
          interface is the ability to integrate a time search with specimen locality 
          information. This form of temporal GIS can answer a variety of legitimate 
          research questions.  Are there changes to species locality information 
          -  i.e., has the species migrated within the last 50 years?  Has the 
          spatial distribution changed due to affects of human population or development 
          over time? What effects has the expansion of agriculture had on species 
          distribution?</p>
        <p>A word of caution regarding the use of GIS data: based on Museums and 
          Collections Services experience, accuracy of the data is only as good 
          as the original source.  Specimen data is often taken from historical 
          maps and, as the data on historical maps may not always be accurate, 
          the representation of features from these maps in the GIS may also contain 
          errors.  </p>
        <p>Recently, the Freshwater Invertebrate Collection was geo-referenced. 
          During this process, it was discovered that different Datums were used 
          depending on the time period the specimens were collected.  All specimens 
          collected before 1983 were geo-referenced using the NAD27 (North American 
          Datum 1927) geographic coordinate system,  whereas specimens collected 
          after 1983 were geo-referenced using the NAD83 (North American Datum 
          1983) geographic coordinate system.  As there are differences in the 
          two Datums, ranging from 200-300 feet in western North America to several 
          tens of feet in central and eastern North America, the specimens collected 
          prior to 1983 had to be converted to NAD83.  This resulted in extra 
          staff time to complete the project. This problem should be taken into 
          account when planning geo-referencing projects.</p>
        <h1>Evaluation of Web Interfaces</h1>
        <p>For Web interfaces launched since 2001, the process of developing a 
          new Web interface begins with Museums and Collections Services staff 
          working with curators of collections to evaluate the needs of a particular 
          digital collection and the audience deemed to be the primary users of 
          the interface.  The objectives of the interface are considered, with 
          accessibility to the digital collections being the prime motivator.  
          Initially, the team discusses search criteria, search fields and whether 
          enhanced search features are required.  </p>
        <p>Throughout the Web development stages of the interface, accessibility 
          testing is essential to determine how well the interface complies with 
          accessibility guidelines and how well it can be accessed by users with 
          varying browsers, operating systems and/or disability software. A text-based 
          editor is used for Web development of the interface.  In the development 
          process, W3C <i>quick tips to make accessible web sites</i> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips/</a>) 
          are exercised to make certain the interface is accessible. </p>
        <p>In the post development stage, a group evaluation process has been 
          used to evaluate Web interfaces. The process begins by selecting potential 
          users for a group interview. This interview identifies targeted visitors, 
          the site's objectives, key tasks, and measures of success. Using the 
          data from the interview, the group of users is then provided with tasks 
          they must accomplish using the searchable collection interface. Each 
          individual's performance is recorded and then they are compared.  
          This evaluation process will determine potential navigation and design 
          flaws and uncover areas of user confusion. After this evaluation, the 
          searchable interface is adjusted to address areas of concern.  </p>
        <p>In our experience, Web server log files can be used as an evaluation 
          tool.  Parsing the log file can determine which search features are 
          used most heavily, how users navigate through the site, and what search 
          terms are used.  For example, the collections team parsed the log files 
          for the University of Alberta's Clothing and Textiles Collection 
          and discovered that the advanced search page was rarely being used.  
          It was determined that the advanced search was too complicated and was 
          causing confusion.  As a result, the search form was simplified.  A 
          few months later, the Web server log files were parsed again and there 
          was a significant increase in the use of the simplified advanced search 
          form.</p>
        <p>Evaluation is an ongoing process.  As three years have passed since 
          the launch of the first Web interface, steps are underway to embark 
          on a thorough revision of the Virtual Museum Website.  It is recognized 
          that our evaluation processes are not rigorous enough and that further 
          evaluation of the Web interfaces needs to be incorporated into any future 
          plans for the Virtual Museum.</p>
        <h1>Future Directions for Web Interfaces</h1>
        <p>Providing access to the research collections of the University of Alberta 
          Museums is a high priority for Museums and Collections Services.  Future 
          goals include greatly increasing the number of records in the databases 
          and building additional Web interfaces to collections databases.</p>
        <p>To enhance the content in the foundation databases, Museums and Collections 
          Services, in collaboration with curators, plans to increase the number 
          of images and multimedia available through the Web interfaces.  According 
          to Kravchyna and Hastings in their article Informational Value of Museum 
          Web Sites (2002) (<a
href="http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue7_2/kravchyna/" target="_blank">http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue7_2/kravchyna/</a>, 
          visitors to virtual museums are looking for information about objects 
          in museum collections.  Kravchyna and Hastings' research found 
          that 63% of virtual visitors want to search museum collections and, 
          when they search, they expect to see digital images of collections (Kravchyna 
          and Hastings, 2002).  </p>
        <p>Goals for the future, following a needs assessment 
          process, could also include the development of Web-based applications 
          that will help professors enhance their courses by incorporating collections 
          data drawn directly from the foundation databases.  This would also 
          serve to increase the visibility of collections data on campus.  As 
          one means to achieve this goal, Museums and Collections Services has 
          begun investigating the use of Learning Objects-packets of information 
          - whether in the form of textual data or multimedia files - that can 
          be used in the development of course material. The feasibility of developing 
          a Web-based repository of Learning Objects could be considered. This 
          repository would be generated from the collections data and associated 
          multimedia files of all thirty-five University of Alberta Museum collections. 
          Although very much in its infancy, it is envisioned that the collections 
          databases would play an integral role in the production of quality on-line 
          learning resources which professors and other instructors could use 
          to enhance their courses.  The University of Alberta currently uses 
          WebCT (Web Course Tools), a set of tools for developing and delivering 
          interactive courses or course component over the Web.   Museums and 
          Collections Services hopes to work with a selected collection-based 
          discipline in the near future to more fully align database resources 
          with teaching initiatives using WebCT and available new technologies.</p>
        <p>In future, the University of Alberta Museums will continue to partner 
          with research institutes regionally, nationally and internationally.  
          The University of Alberta Museums is also exploring, along with other 
          partner institutions in Alberta, the possibility of building a regional 
          interoperable network of natural science databases and repositories. 
          This network would unite all collections data among regional participating 
          institutes and would improve collections based research by allowing 
          researchers the ability to access a huge pool of data.  If this project 
          proceeds, Museums and Collections Services will, in conjunction with 
          curators, build the technical infrastructure to facilitate the network. 
        </p>
        <p>The University of Alberta is one of the partners of WestGrid (<a href="http://www.westgrid.ca/" target="_blank">http://www.WestGrid.ca</a>), 
          a collaboration to provide high performance computing resources for 
          researchers.  Researchers at the University of Alberta will be able 
          to use WestGrid to analyse collections data.  For example, grid computing 
          would provide researchers with the ability to model and simulate the 
          effects of local or regional climate change on particular species of 
          plants and animals.  This would be an innovative way for collections 
          data to enhance research. </p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>The decentralized model of the University of Alberta Museums provides 
          challenges to Museums and Collections Services, but it also provides 
          benefits.  Curators come together to work strategically on issues that 
          affect the whole University of Alberta Museums community.  Our museum 
          model enables and facilitates communication across departments and faculties 
          and is an ideal medium for the University of Alberta to connect to and 
          engage the broader community. </p>
        <p>Digitization of collections at the University of Alberta Museums and 
          the building of Web interfaces to collections data further enable connections 
          to the community by making collections more accessible to communities 
          both on and off campus.  The progress of digitization has moved forward 
          significantly in the past few years.  An increased number of records 
          have been added to the collections management system.  Seven Web interfaces 
          to collections databases have been developed, and the goal is to create 
          eight more over the next two years.  These initiatives have paved the 
          way to increased and enhanced access to collections.  In future, Museums 
          and Collections Services will continue to work towards its goal of bringing 
          the wonders of research collections at the University of Alberta Museums 
          to the world.  </p>
