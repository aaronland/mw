  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>In this article the two DinoHunter applications - <i>DinoSim</i> and <i>DinoExplorer</i>, developed for the famous Senckenberg museum in Frankfurt, Germany - are 
    introduced. Both DinoHunter modules represent typical examples for digital 
    museum applications. Whilst DinoSim is realized as a touchscreen application 
    and enhances interactivity within a museum, DinoExplorer focuses on virtual 
    museums and provides an interactive learning environment enabling users to 
    dive into the world of dinosaurs. First we provide a brief overview of DinoHunter, 
    DinoSim and DinoExplorer as well as the underlying methods and concepts for 
    building edutainment environments and integrating information into DinoHunter 
    applications. Then the main part of this best-practice study describes DinoExplorer 
    and DinoSim in detail. Finally, a short evaluation section discusses major 
    results and obstacles/open issues concerning the DinoHunter project with the 
    Senckenberg museum.</p>
  <p><i>DinoHunter</i> includes various digital applications for both virtual 
    museums and actual museums. Underlying concepts and methods of the global 
    DinoHunter scenario were introduced by Sauer and G&ouml;&ouml;bel (Sauer 2003) at Museums 
    and Web, 2003. Within the concrete DinoHunter project with the Senckenberg 
    as described in this paper, museum visitors are introduced to the world of 
    dinosaurs. In contrast to movie or TV productions on dinosaours, both <i>DinoSim</i> 
    and <i>DinoExplore</i> are not focused on special effects, but based on the 
    scientific results of palaeontology research. Senckenberg represents one of 
    the most significant nature museums in Europe: it includes a society for nature 
    research with expertise in zoology, geology, paleontology and botany. Among 
    other exhibits the collection contains fossils and reptiles from primitive 
    times. The dinosaur exhibition is certainly one of the biggest attractions 
    of the museum. Skeletons of Tyrannosaurus Rex, Triceratops or Diplodocus give 
    impressions of these enormous and fascinating animals (Senckenberg 
    2003).</p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="SauerFig1.html"><a name="Fig1"></a><img src="goebel-sauer.fig1.jpg" alt="Skeleton of T-Rex" width="400" height="225" border="0"></a></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 1: Skeleton of Tyrannosaurus Rex 
    (T-Rex).</p>
  <h2>DinoSim</h2>
  <p>For its re-opening in November 2003, Senckenberg had a great 
    interest in improving the exhibition by integrating multimedia systems. In 
    addition to a general visitor information and navigation system, two kiosk 
    terminals around the most exciting exhibits (skeletons of T-Rex and 
    Diplodocus) are enhanced by the DinoSim application which provides a 3D real-time 
    simulation and animation of dinosaurs. The primary goal of <i>DinoSim </i>is 
    to visualize different science-related theories about appearance, movements 
    and behavior of dinosaurs. Visitors can freely navigate around the dinosaurs 
    within a 3D environment and can take pictures from their own view(point)s. 
    These pictures are sent by e-mail to the visitors' e-mail addresses, and users 
    can make use of the T-On-line Fotoservice to get T-shirts, cups or bags printed 
    with their individual dinosaurs. (T-Online International AG, an international 
    Internet service provider, sponsors the Senckenberg museum, specifically the 
    development of <i>the DinoSim</i> and <i>DinoExplorer </i>applications.)</p>
  <h2>DinoExplorer</h2>
  <p><i>DinoExplorer</i> represents a game-oriented application that is available 
    for download on the Senckenberg Web site. Within a rally-like searching game, 
    the user can explore the virtual Senckenberg and its exhibits with the task 
    of finding a particular animal (Leptictidium). To the degree the user succeeds 
    in finding the Leptictidium, further functionality is available on a (virtual) 
    PDA as mobile device. For example, users can choose different layers for the 
    skeleton, inner organs, muscles or possible appearances (color, structure) 
    of skins. Further on, the mutual breathing of dinosaurs is presented via 3D 
    animations.</p>
  <h2>DinoHunter Edutainment Environment</h2>
  <p><i>DinoHunter</i> provides integrated concepts for a wide range of interactive 
    museum (or any other edutainment) applications. The basic principle is to 
    combine computer graphics technology such as 3D Rendering, Virtual and Augmented 
    Reality or multimodal interfaces (speech recognition, video recognition, gestures, 
    etc.) with Interactive Storytelling approaches found in the field of film, 
    theater or fairy tales, and to further user interface and user interaction 
    concepts. With the support of mobile devices, location-based services and 
    paedagogic aspects (learning models and concepts), <i>DinoHunter</i> makes 
    the museum into an interactive learning and gaming environment.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig2"></a><a href="SauerFig2.html"><img src="goebel-sauer.fig2.jpg" alt="Dino_hunter Environment" width="400" height="216" border="0"></a></p>
  <p class="caption">Figure 2: Dino-Hunter Environment (Settings)</p>
  <p>The placement of <i>DinoHunter</i> takes into account the needs and knowledge 
    of various users and user groups involved in the multi-facetted domain of 
    museum applications (see figure 2): individual visitors, families or school 
    classes as visitor groups, museum educators, scientific, administrative or 
    marketing staff at the museum, or all the different user groups visiting virtual 
    museums using the museum's Web site.</p>
  <p>Apart from a comprehensive <i>DinoHunter</i> platform providing tools, methods 
    and concepts for all these different user groups, additional case studies 
    and pre-defined templates help:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Museum staff to select library data and artifacts and make them 
      available within digital museum applications.</li>
    <li>Administrative staff to monitor user behavior and success of 
      individual artifacts or exhibition parts, measuring the retention period of 
      visitors at special exhibits.</li>
    <li>Scientific staff to get visual feedback of their research providing 
      3D reconstructions of dinosaurs or visualizing appearance and behavior (such 
      as walking). This also includes a rapid prototype environment as part of the 
      authoring environment. </li>
    <li>Museum educators to enter digital media, didactic methods and 
      learning models or any hints leading the visitor to <i>the most important</i> artifact.</li>
    <li>Teachers to prepare (and post-process) the museum visit of a 
      school class.</li>
    <li>Kids/pupils to interact and communicate with each other or send 
      messages in order to solve a group-based task in a museum's rally or game. </li>
    <li>Marketing people to combine the content layer (artifacts, exhibits 
      and digital media, or even access to further repositories) with the museum's 
      shop or the Web site or event calendars. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Further details about underlying methods and concepts for 
    the complete <i>DinoHunter</i> framework and further application scenarios 
    such as <i>DinoTalk</i> (Chat with a dinosaur), <i>DinoPuzzle</i> (3D-Puzzle 
    based on Augmented Reality<i>), DinoMemo</i> (memory game) or <i>DinoTriple 
    </i>(2D-puzzle) are provided by Feix, G&ouml;bel and Sauer (see References). The 
    following section focuses on the two <i>DinoHunter</i> applications developed 
    for the Senckenberg museum<i>: DinoSim</i> and <i>DinoExplorer</i>. <i>DinoExplorer 
    </i>characterizes the idea of the basic <i>DinoHunter</i> concept - the visitors 
    in the museum with mobile-experience appliances.</p>
  <h2>Case Study</h2>
  <p><i>DinoSim</i> and <i>DinoExplorer</i> 
    were the first applications, in the wide range of DinoHunter scenarios, realised 
    and implemented for the Senckenberg museum in cooperation within T-Online 
    and Senckenberg. The following paragraphs describe technical details and interaction 
    aspects for both applications.</p>
  <h4>DinoSim at Senckenberg</h4>
  <p><i>DinoSim</i> is based on the results 
    of comprehensive research done by the palaeontologists at the Senckenberg 
    museum. These results and thoughts about the (probable) appearance and behavior 
    of the dinosaurs T-Rex and Diplodocus have been transferred to 3D models as 
    digital representations of the dinosaurs, with further animations, e.g. walking 
    movements. These models and animations are integrated into a 3D environment 
    and placed on kiosk-like terminals with touchscreen functionality in front 
    of the real skeletons within the largest Senckenberg hall.</p>
  <p  class="caption"><a href="SauerFig3.html"><img src="goebel-sauer.fig3.jpg" alt="DinoSim in the museum" border="0"></a>
  </p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig3"></a>Figure 3: DinoSim Application.</p>
  <p>The visitor can launch the <i>DinoSim</i> application from 
    the general visitor information and navigation system on the terminals. On 
    an introduction screen, the user finds an overview of the basic functionalities 
    represented by pictograms in order to improve usability of the system. As 
    the application runs on a touch screen terminal, it is very important to design 
    the buttons of a sufficient size, and with enough distance between them. The 
    sensitive area is larger than the size of the button, in order to facilitate 
    pushing the right one.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="SauerFig4.html"><img src="goebel-sauer.fig4.jpg" alt="DinoSim Navigation Icons" width="400" height="139" border="0"></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig4"></a>Figure 4: DinoSim Buttons and Orbit Navigation.</p>
  <p>Once the simulation has started, a navigation panel placed 
    at the bottom of the DinoSim screen (see figure 5) enables users to freely 
    navigate around the T-Rex or Diplodocus using so-called "orbit navigation". 
    Thus, as with computer games, the user moves around the object in invisible 
    circles by pressing the arrow keys. For changing the view on the dinosaur, 
    there are buttons to zoom in and zoom out or to get back to a default position 
    in case the user is 'lost in Dino/hyperspace'.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="SauerFig5.html"><img src="goebel-sauer.fig5.jpg" alt="DinoSim showing T-Rex" width="400" height="313" border="0"></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig5"></a>Figure 5: DinoSim with Navigation Panel.</p>
  <p>When the user has found a nice viewpoint, he might take 
    a picture, realised as a screenshot of this individual view to a dinosaur. 
    The screenshots are collected and shown to the user in a virtual photo gallery 
    (see figure 6). The user may e-mail the pictures, 
    or return to the application to take another picture. To avoid abuse, the quantity of photographs is limited to 2: each; 
    further photos replace the older one. When the user decides to send a picture, 
    he is prompted to type in an e-mail address. The system doesn't accept an 
    invalid address, but gives the user a chance to retype it. Following the known 
    principle of user interface design WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), 
    a screen with the final picture(s) and the e-mail address is displayed before 
    sending in order to confirm the information or allow the user to return to 
    the application.</p>
  <p>After sending an e-mail the DinoSim application is minimized 
    and the terminal system switches to the general information and navigation 
    system in order to avoid a "DinoSim only" phenomena.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="SauerFig6.html"><img src="goebel-sauer.fig6.jpg" alt="Virtual Photo Gallery" width="400" height="313" border="0"></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig6"></a>Figure 6: Virtual Photo Gallery</p>
  <p>In order to achieve a high level of usability, the system 
    provides the following interaction possibilities:</p>
  <p>1. Panel navigation with consistent functionalities such 
    as</p>
  <ul>
    <li>shutting down the application</li>
    <li>getting help access to additional information</li>
    <li>changing position and zooming </li>
    <li>taking a photograph.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>2. Context-sensitive navigation with situation-dependent 
    functionalities such as</p>
  <ul>
    <li>starting DinoSim</li>
    <li>sending photos via email</li>
    <li>going back to e-mail input, and </li>
    <li>going back to application to take another picture.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="caption"><a href="SauerFig7.html"><img src="goebel-sauer.fig7.jpg" alt="Snapshots of different Dinosaur views" width="400" height="272" border="0"></a></p>
  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig7"></a>Figure 7: DinoSim Snapshots</p>
  <p>From the technical point of view, both applications DinoSim 
    and DinoExplorer are realized using C++, OpenGL and Nvidias' programming environment 
    Cg (C for graphics), a complete programming environment for the fast creation 
    of effects and real-time cinematic quality experiences on multiple platforms. 
    By providing a new level of abstraction, Cg lets developers more directly 
    target OpenGL or DirectX without having to program to the graphics hardware 
    assembly language. We used small programs called shaders to create breathing 
    dinosaurs with hair and feathers, and to animate these animals. The shaders 
    are divided into two main categories: Pixel-shaders, changing the look of 
    each pixel; and vertex-shaders, changing the position and orientation of each 
    vertex in the mesh.</p>
  <h4>DinoExplorer Senckenberg</h4>
  <p><i>DinoExplorer</i> is available 
    for download on the Senckenberg Web site. The primary idea was to rebuild 
    the museum as a 3D model enabling users to navigate through the virtual museum, 
    especially in the phases <i>preparation for a museum</i> visit and <i>post-processing</i>. 
    For example, a teacher can view material in the virtual museum in advance 
    and can decide which artifacts a class will visit, or what information is 
    available, or whether appropriate information for courses in history or biology 
    is available. A little side-effect is that, for example, ill pupils who can't 
    join a museum's visit can download the application and actively participate 
    in discussions in the post-processing phase later on.</p>
  <p>In order to increase user acceptance, the pure rendering 
    technology of DinoExplorer is enhanced with game-oriented facilities in the 
    form of a searching game. Young visitors/users such as pupils or kids are 
    especially familiar with computer games, game engines or level concepts within 
    games. Hence, DinoExplorer is subdivided into two levels.</p>

  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig8"></a>Figure 8: DinoExplorer Introduction Screen.</p>
  <p>After downloading and installing the DinoExplorer appplication, 
    users enter level one of the virtual Senckenberg museum and can wander around 
    examining numerous artifacts. An introductory screen displayed on a virtual 
    mobile device (e.g. PDA, see figure 8) gives an overview of the available 
    functionality and explains the goal of the searching game. The challenge is 
    to find a particular animal (Leptictidium) within the virtual museum.</p>
  <p>Once the user succeeds in finding the Leptictidium, he can 
    take advantage of full functionality of the mobile device and enter level 
    2. Now inside the PDA screen the dinosaurs come to life: they get a skin texture 
    and start to breathe (astonishing for the user and a unique feature of DinoExplorer 
    not found in many other mobile museum applications). The user also can change 
    the view of the dinosaurs by pushing the function keys to reproduce different 
    approaches to dinosaur reconstruction. The exposed skeletons are outfitted 
    with different layers. Choices are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>F5: Display of textual information</li>
    <li>F6: Change of skin color</li>
    <li>F7: Change of skin structure</li>
    <li>F8: Functionality help, manual</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In conclusion, the visitor to the virtual museum will get 
    fascinating insights and views on the dinosaurs, better understand how dinosaurs 
    might have looked, and will be motivated to visit the real Senckenberg (again 
    and again).</p>
  <h4>Challenges</h4>
  <p>The following list summarizes the most challenging issues 
    of DinoExplorer from a technical point of view:</p>
  <h5>Modelling of 3D objects</h5>
  <p>Based on a floor plan, a 3D model as virtual Senckenberg museum has been 
    developed using 3DS (3D Studio Max) software. Within the next step, existing 
    artifacts and blackboards in the 'real' museum have been analysed and shot 
    and placed in the virtual museum, too. Whilst the use of blackboard shots 
    as textures in the 'virtual' has been uncritical, the transparency of artifacts 
    in the form of skeletons has caused some trouble in programming.</p>
  <h5>User Handling of the DinoExplorer</h5>
  <p>Similar to computer games, DinoExplorer operates with mouse and keyboard. 
    Corresponding to the two game levels described above the function keys F5-F7 
    are disabled in level 1 (searching the Leptictidium) and are switched on in 
    level 2 to provide full PDA functionality and to permit visualization of the 
    different dinosaur layers and breathing animation.</p>
  <h5>Collision Detection</h5>
  <p>Common collision detection technology is used to avoid 'walking into' a dinosaur, 
    a skeleton or a wall. Here, the most critical issue is the implementation 
    of collision-detection for stairs bridging different floors of the virtual 
    museum. We tested two principles, regarding collision detection of artifacts 
    (skeletons of dinosaurs). While using B-Boxes (bounding boxes) is not expensive 
    from the performance point of view, using bounding spheres is more realistic 
    but needs more computing power. We focus on a 2D level concept regarding collision-detection 
    of walls and take into account only the floor plan with about 100 polygons 
    for one floor in contrast to the full 3D model of the Senckenberg with approximately 
    10,000 polygons.</p>
  <h2>Possible Extensions</h2>

  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig9"></a>Figure 9: DinoExplorer  Level2.</p>
  <p>With regard to possible extensions of the current DinoExplorer 
    application and its maintainability, we provide a configuration file based 
    on XML technology, enabling developers to easily integrate further artifacts 
    and blackboards or to re-arrange placement of individual dinosaurs (corresponding 
    to re-arrangements in the 'real' museum).</p>

  <p class="caption"><a name="Fig10"></a>Figure 10: User Testing at the Re-Opening 
    Ceremony.</p>
  <h1>Evaluation</h1>
  <p>Before putting the DinoExplorer application on the Senckenberg 
    Web site and integrating the DinoSim application on the kiosk-like terminals, 
    we carried out a multi-phase user testing and evaluation process. Corresponding 
    to the iterative software engineering process, at the beginning we first 
    built prototypes showing the basic functionality and user interaction design 
    application workflows. Based on these demonstrators, we had some internal 
    user tests and intensive discussions with our project partners Senckenberg 
    museum (from the content-related and scientific point of view) and T-Online 
    (from marketing point of view, considering the integration of the foto service 
    facility within the DinoSim application). In parallel, we had several robustness 
    tests, especially of the DinoSim application, placed on terminals. Here, the 
    problem of overheating arose, causing blue screens after 3.5 hours. This problem 
    has been solved in collaboration with the hardware provider by the integration 
    of further ventilators into the tower system of the terminals.</p>
  <p>We then developed first application prototpyes which were 
    presented at the several re-opening ceremonies at the Senckenberg museum in 
    early November 2003. Here the fascinating point was that we didn't have to 
    ask visitors to test our applications or motivate them to answer some questions: 
    visitors both young and old were very interested in these digital museum applications 
    and explored them using the 'learning by doing' principle. Whilst DinoSim 
    has been evaluated very positively by all different user groups (independent 
    of age range), some elderly people had minor problems navigating in the virtual 
    Senckenberg museum in the DinoExplorer application. Young visitors were familiar 
    with computer games and 3D navigation spaces.</p>
  <p>All the results were collected (see figure 10) and integrated 
    into the final concepts for both applications, implemented at the end of December, 
    2003. Altogether the two applications have been implemented within 5 months, 
    with a development team of 3 persons.</p>
  <h2>User Centered Considerations</h2>
  <p>One major goal of this evaluation was to enhance the users' 
    experiences with the new learning environments. As a result, easy to use applications 
    and graphical user interfaces with high usability and user experience were 
    generated. In an iterative process derived from the visitors' personal reviews 
    and based on user-centered design methods, conditions and surroundings were 
    analysed, content was optimized and navigation principles were improved.</p>
  <p>For example, acoustical feedback is not subtle in noisy 
    surroundings like a museum. Accordingly, all feedback has to be realized optically. 
    Also the kiosk terminals and their monitors should be arranged marginally 
    lower or with adjustable angular motion, to take into consideration the shortness 
    of the children. But logistics decisions were made by responsible museum staff 
    for reasons of economy long before this project was started.</p>
  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>DinoHunter provides integrated concepts and implemented 
    tools and modules for museums applications or other scenarios within a wide 
    range of edutainment applications, e.g. theme parks, exhibitions, fairs. It 
    combines different digital presentation devices and technologies to expand 
    these spaces by providing learning environments. This paper describes a DinoHunter 
    project with the Senckenberg museum, one of the most famous museums of natural 
    history in Germany and Europe, wheree two DinoHunter modules/applications 
     DinoSim and DinoExplorer  were implemented. They exemplify the basic DinoHunter 
    concept of creating an integrated learning environment with digitalization 
    and annotation of archaeological artifacts for both on-site exhibitions and 
    virtual museums.</p>
  <p>While DinoExplorer is available for download at the Senckenberg 
    Web site, DinoSim is placed on terminal systems within the museum, enabling 
    visitors walking around the museum and viewing skeletons or reading labels 
    to also interactively explore the world of dinosaurs and learn about their 
    appearance, behaviour, movements, etc.</p>
  <p>A multi-phase user testing and evaluation process has shown 
    the great acceptance of these digital museum applications in various user 
    groups, e.g. young visitors, school classes, families or elderly people. Of 
    course the most valuable feedback for the project team always is the fascinated 
    glances of kids using the DinoSim and DinoExplorer applications.</p>
  <p>In the long run, we will try to provide mobile DinoHunter 
    applications, not only in virtual format such as the PDA emulation within 
    DinoExplorer, but also in the 'real'. Figure 11 shows a first demonstration 
    of this using VR/AR technology on a tableaut PC enhanced by appropriate tracking 
    technology and interaction methods. </p>
  <p>These application domains of freely navigating PDAs and 
    tracking mechanisms represent a hot topic in current research. Probably it 
    will take another couple of years before there are really robust applications 
    providing 3D models and animation (in real-time, analogue to DinoSim and DinoExplorer) 
    of dinosaurs on a PDA.</p>
