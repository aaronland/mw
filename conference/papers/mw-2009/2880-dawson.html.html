        <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
        <p class="AbstractText">On-line collection access is a mainstay of museum
    offerings on the Web. Museums offer a wide range of collections, including
    digitized representations of art, natural history, material culture, and
    historical archival photographs. Virtual access has become a vital means of
    both enabling collection access and facilitating outreach beyond the physical
    museum. But how much do we know of our audiences, and how do they make use of
    such collections? What are their motivations and behaviours? </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">The importance of evaluating on-line collection offerings
    has been noted in several recent studies. A clearer understanding of just how
    and why on-line collections are used is vital if we are to appropriately plan
    enhancements to collection access, such as visitor tagging, visitor contributed
    content, and other Web 2.0 features. </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">In examining the use of the CN Images of Canada Gallery,
    an on-line archival collection, this paper explores the practical application
    of analytical approaches that may be broadly applicable to on-line collections
    as a whole. Making use of common data sources, the case study creates a rounded
    picture of how a collection is actually used by visitors. The findings should
    be broadly usable as a basis of comparison with other collections and their
    use, as institutions prepare for the next iteration of their on-line offerings.</p>

	    <h2 class="PaperTitle">Introduction</h2>
	    <p>With the easy access to Web Analytics data, on-line
		    visitors are frequently reduced to a series of statistics: Web visits, page
		    views, conversions and the like. These readily-produced statistics are often used in place of a true understanding of visitors. But a
		    meaningful consideration of on-line visitors and audiences is not so straightforward.
		    Web site audiences are elusive &ndash; perhaps even mythical (Peacock &amp;
	      Brownbill, 2007). To understand them clearly takes thought and effort to work
	    through.</p>
	    <p>What is the story behind the statistics? Just who is it
		    that is using a given Web site feature, and why? What are their motivations? What
		    are they getting out of the experience? And what of the collections that
		    museums present on-line. Are these collection databases used information
		    resource? Are they edutainment for the curious browser? Are they something
	    else?</p>
	    <p>And what of the collections that museums present
		    on-line.&nbsp; &nbsp;Are these collection databases used
		    information resource?&nbsp; Are they
	    edutainment for the curious browser?&nbsp; Are they something else?</p>
	    <p>Where should the museum Web practitioner turn in attempting
	    to answer these questions?</p>
	    <p>The practice of visitor studies is well defined, factoring
		    in demographics, psychographics, environmental factors and the perspectives of
		    the individual (Soren, 1999). Evaluation in physical museums is similarly well
		    defined &ndash; a methodology that includes front-end, formative, summative
	    analysis (Soren, 1999; Bull, 1994). </p>
	    <p>However, for the Web the approaches are less clearly
		    defined. As Peacock and Brownbill have noted (2007), the approach toward Web
		    offerings seems a bit more ad-hoc. Different studies often draw on different
		    paradigms, such as audience and visitor studies, marketing, evaluation, and
		    usability analysis, but using them in isolation. Peacock and Brownbill advocate
		    a broader, systematic approach that factors four levels of analysis, spanning
	    market, user, interaction, and product.</p>
	    <p>In reviewing an existing Web offering, the present study
	    also attempts a broader view, focusing on three major questions:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>Motivations:
	        who uses the site and why?</li>
	      <li>Use:
	        how do they use the site?</li>
	      <li>Outcomes:
	        what is the result of their visit?</li>
        </ol>
	    <p>This study will look closely at the use of a specific
		    on-line collection of archival images. This effort is rooted in the goal of
		    making decisions on how to present such on-line product offerings more effectively
		    in the future. It is hoped that this study may also be a comparison point, both
	    with other collection offerings and with museum Web sites in general. </p>
	    <h2>Highlights from the Literature</h2>
	    <p>There is a significant body of literature on the
		    evaluation of Museum Web sites as a whole, exploring both quantitative and
		    qualitative approaches. For example, Peacock (2002) developed a framework of
		    assessing whether a Web site meets user needs, based on Web log-based metrics. Soren
		    and Lemelin (2004) added survey methods to Web log analysis, in looking at a
		    range of Museum Web sites. Kravchyna and Hastings (2002) focused on survey
		    methods to examine in detail the information needs and information-seeking
		    behaviours of Museum Web site visitors, considering museum Web sites as a
	    whole, including on-line collections and images.</p>
	    <p>There are also examples of thorough evaluation of on-line
		    exhibits; for example, Dalrymple, et. al. (2004) conduct front-end, formative and summative
	    analyses of a virtual exhibition.</p>
	    <p>Some studies have focused on the on-line collection. Fiona
		    Cameron (2003) discusses the evolution of on-line collections through multiple
		    generations. In considering the needs of on-line users, she develops a model to
		    categorize users into four broad user groups: curators, collection managers,
	    educators, and non-specialists.</p>
	    <p>Several more recent studies have closely examined the
		    potential benefits of folksonomies to facilitate the description and discovery
		    of on-line collections (for example, Trant et. al, 2007). One of these studies
		    has included an in-depth analysis of searches of art museum collections (Trant,
		    2006). Others have examined how folksonomies can enhance the findability and
	    browsability of on-line collections (Chan, 2007).</p>
	    <p>There is also consideration of the role that collections
		    play in learning. For example, Green et. al. (2007) examined various facets of how on-line collection
	    images can meet the needs of educators and users in higher education.</p>
	    <p>There are a variety of studies on the motivations behind
		    museum Web visits. Some, looking at museum Web sites in general, focus on
		    information-seeking behaviours of visitors (Kravchyna &amp; Hastings, 2002). Others
		    studies focus on the motivations behind education and informal learning in a
	    museum Web site context (for example, Haley Goldman &amp; Schaller, 2004).</p>
	    <p>Meanwhile, Paul Marty (2008), as part of an ongoing study,
		    has looked at the use of digital resources in the overall lives of visitors,
		    examining the changing needs and expectations of on-line visitors, the continuity
		    in their on-line and in-museum experiences, and the implications for museum
	    practitioners.</p>
	    <h2>Analytical Approach</h2>
	    <p>In examining the use of the CN Images of Canada Gallery,
		    our study has three primary thrusts: to explore motivations of visitors using
		    the site (who they are and why they came), the behaviour of these visitors
		    (what they do on the site), and the outcomes of their visit (what impact the
	    visit had on them).</p>
	    <p>To assess motivations, we use the concept of situated
		    identity as a key factor in determining visitor motivations. We draw on Falk&rsquo;s
		    (2006) categories of identity-based motivations: the <i>Explorer</i>, the <i>Facilitator</i>,
	    the <i>Professional/Hobbyist</i>, the <i>Experience Seeker</i>, and the <i>Spiritual Pilgrim</i>. </p>
	    <p>To assess behaviour, we make use of a variety of information
		    sources, from Web analytics data, to surveys, to transactions with users, to
	    look for clues as to how people used the site and what they were looking for.</p>
	    <p>To assess outcomes, we use qualitative sources to
		    illustrate the tangible impacts that the site has on visitors. We do this first
		    through the lens of situated identity categories, and then consider more
	    broadly the nature of on-line experiences.</p>
	    <p>This investigation has used a deductive approach (Packer, 2008), in that
		    we are applying existing theoretical frameworks from audience &amp; visitor
		    studies and museum evaluation to a Web context. It is important to note that
		    these frameworks have been developed in a physical museum context &ndash; we
		    want to recognize the cautions of other authors (Peacock &amp; Brownbill, 2007;
		    Ellenbogen, Falk &amp; Goldman, 2008) that models developed in the physical
		    museum may not necessarily apply to the Web. We hope to discover and illustrate
	    whether there is value in applying certain models to on-line situations. </p>
	    <h2>The CN Collection</h2>
	    <p>In 2000, Canadian National (CN) donated its Marketing
		    Division photographic collection to the Canada Science and Technology Museum
		    (CSTM). The collection is comprised of an estimated 750,000 images, with
	    additional material donated each year. </p>
	    <p>Though the bulk of the collection primarily dates between
		    1920 and 1950, some images are dated as early as the 1850s. The collection is a
	    visual resource documenting two valuable developments in Canadian history:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>The Crown Corporation &ndash; freight and
	        passenger trains, hotels and resorts, ferry services and ocean steamships,
	        telegraph and telecommunications;</li>
	      <li>Canada as an emerging Nation &ndash; development
	        of cities and towns, industries and trade, involvement in World War II, etc.</li>
        </ul>
	    <p>Images were taken to document history for the
		    corporation&rsquo;s magazine, as promotional material, and for staff morale, but the
		    unexpected result was a valuable visual history of the corporation and the
	    country.</p>
	    <p>The CN collection consists of negatives, prints, slides
		    and transparencies, both black and white and colour. Prints are located in
	    bound albums that can be taken apart to access the image. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="dawson.fig1.jpg" alt="figure 1" width="500" height="667" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 1: A portion of the CN Collection</p>
	    <p>They are also located on index cards, indexed by subject,
	    topic, location or name.</p>
	    <p>Negatives are stored in a temperature controlled fridge
		    and are separated by film type; nitrate, acetate, and
		    polyester. Envelopes can contain anywhere from one to twenty negatives. Each
		    image has a catalogue number assigned by CN. When it is catalogued by CSTM, a
		    new catalogue number is assigned, and the two are cross
        referenced.</p>
	    <p>Each image has a catalogue number assigned by CN.&nbsp; When it is catalogued by CSTM, a new
		    catalogue number is assigned, and the two are cross
        referenced.</p>
	    <p>The collection also contains logbooks &ndash; a detailed handwritten
		    and/or typed description of each image based on CN&rsquo;s catalogue number.&nbsp; &nbsp;The logbooks have been transcribed into an MS Word document,
		    making them a very valuable keyword searchable finding aid.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, these log books are not currently part of the Web
	    site.</p>
	    <p>Requests primarily come from Canada ,but have also come from all over world. Images are requested for textbooks, various
		    types of publications, Web sites, and exhibits. Requests range in nature from
		    an author writing a book to a coffee shop in Italy requesting images for their
		    caf&eacute;. There are reproduction and collection use fees associated with requesting
	    an image. </p>
	    <h3>The CN Images of Canada Gallery Web Site</h3>
	    <p>The CN Images of Canada Gallery, on-line since 2000, was a
		    founding component of the Images Canada consortium (<a href="../http://www.imagescanada.ca/">http://www.imagescanada.ca/</a>). &nbsp;The Web site was created with a
	    number of initial goals in mind:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>Provide wider public access to the CN photograph
	        collection</li>
	      <li>Help
	        ensure the long term preservation of the collection</li>
	      <li>Reinforce
	        perception of the Canada Science and Technology Museum Corporation (CSTMC) as a
	        clearing house for resources on the role of science &amp; technology in the
	        development of Canada</li>
	      <li>Entice
	        the public into asking for more</li>
	      <li>Offer
	        a gallery experience, a window onto the collection</li>
        </ol>
	    <p>Though design has not been significantly updated since its
		    launch, it remains the single most popular on-line offering of the Canada
		    Science and Technology Museum, with strong growth in visitation over the past
	    eight years (see figure 2). </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="dawson.fig2.500.JPG" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="254" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 2: CN Images of Canada Gallery Web visits, 2000 &#8211;
        2008</p>
	    <p>The museum has worked with several theories for the
		    gallery&rsquo;s popularity; such as, metadata constructs that support browsing and
		    search; an audience hunger for this unique and previously inaccessible
		    collection of rich archival photographs; and the broad relevance of this
		    diverse collection to audiences across Canada and internationally &ndash; for even
		    as simple a task as searching for old pictures of one&rsquo;s home town. But these
		    theories had not undergone a thorough summative analysis. Understanding user
		    motivation and behaviour is now critical, as the museum sets out to re-tool and
	    expand its on-line collection offerings. </p>
	    <h2>Sources of Data</h2>
	    <p>In assessing the CN Gallery, both quantitative and
		    qualitative sources of data were considered. Similar to other Web site
		    evaluation exercises (Peacock, 2002; Gilliland-Swetland, et al, 2004; Peacock
	      &amp; Brownbill, 2007), we are using a wide range of data sources. Table 1
	    summarizes the range of data sources used in this evaluation.</p>

	    <p class="caption">Table 1: Sources of data</p>
	    <p>It should be noted that the Web survey had a small sample
		    size (23 responses as of this writing); hence, any percentages are not
		    statistically valid representations of the overall use of the site. We also
		    expected self-selection bias with the survey, suspecting that a user who is
		    more engaged with the site would be more likely to fill out the survey.
		    However, an in-depth survey was chosen to try to obtain a richer level of
	    information than might otherwise be gathered in an interview or focus group.</p>
	    <p>Similarly, the photo requests, while far more numerous, are
		    subject to biases, as they are inclined to over-represent those with
		    motivations that require some form of follow-up with the museum (such as
		    researchers of various types). Hence, some motivations (such as general &nbsp;curiosity)
	    would be under-represented.</p>
	    <h2>Visitors and Their Motivations</h2>
	    <p>As we noted earlier, many of the motivations behind
		    on-line visits have focused on information-seeking behaviours, or on education
	    and informal learning. </p>
	    <p>We have used the concept of situated identity as a way of
		    exploring the motivations of visitors. Falk (2006) developed this model in the
		    context of a physical museum, and has applied it to a range of institutions
	    (Falk, 2006; Falk, Heimlich and Bronnenkant, 2008).</p>

	    <p class="caption">Table 2: Situated identity as a factor in motivation</p>
	    <p>Note that we have adjusted Falks&rsquo;s model for this
		    investigation, splitting his Professional/Hobbyist category into two. There are
	    a couple of primary reasons for doing so:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>With the experience from ongoing photo requests,
	        we were already aware of two major clusters: professionals (including
	        publishers, editors, professional authors, and museum professionals), and
	        hobbyists (amateur authors, model railroaders, and other subject matter
	        enthusiasts). We wanted to develop a clear picture of their distinctive motives
	        and needs.</li>
	      <li>We also wanted to consider differences driven by
	        intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation (Csikszentmihalyi &amp; Hermanson, 1994).
	        Not only do we expect hobbyists to be more intrinsically motivated, but we also
	        wanted to consider information-seeking behaviours such as self-motivated
	        research vs. assigned research.</li>
        </ul>
	    <p>We were conscious of the fact that Falk&rsquo;s model was
		    developed in exploring museum visits. As some writers have noted, &ldquo;Preliminary
		    research suggests that the motivations of visitors to museum Web sites differ
		    significantly from the motivations of visitors to physical museums&rdquo;
	      (Ellenbogen, Falk &amp; Goldman, 2008). To account for this, we also considered
		    some of the traditional information-seeking motivations for visiting museum Web
	    sites (listed in Table 4), and mapped them against the same set of data.</p>

	    <h3>Analysis of Motivations and Goals</h3>
	    <p>Using both survey responses and a selection of
		    correspondence from photo and information requests, we categorized a sample of
		    site users into both situated-identity categories and information-seeking
		    motivations. Multiple categories could apply (for example, a number of
		    hobbyists were also found to be spiritual pilgrims, exhibiting intimate, personal
	    connections to the subject matter).</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="dawson.fig3.JPG" alt="figure 3" width="497" height="301" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 3: Presence of identity-motivation categories and
	    information-seeking goals <br />
	    (percentage of sample, n=50)</p>
	    <p>Due to biases in the sources, we believe that the Explorer
		    (the curious and casual browser), while present in our results, is underrepresented.
		    We did not find any evidence of Experience Seekers - in this case, not
	    surprising.</p>
	    <p>The most unexpected finding is the prominence of spiritual
		    pilgrims within the sample. This suggests that not only is the site meeting
		    information needs of visitors, but that many are also making deep,
	    introspective connections with the collection.</p>
	    <p>There were strong correlations between some of the
		    situated identities and the information-seeking behaviours. For example, most
		    professionals were engaged in assigned research, while most hobbyists were
	    perusing self-motivated research.</p>
	    <p>We will look at specific examples of these motivations
	    when we explore impacts (below).</p>
	    <h3>A View on Visitors From Web Analytics</h3>
	    <p>To round out our view of visitors, Web analytics can help us
		    segment visitors on other dimensions. A broader range of information from Web
		    analytics is being used for a full summative evaluation of the CN Gallery site,
		    but for illustrative purposes, we provide a few examples. First, we first
		    consider where visitors are from. Table 4 shows the top countries, and Table 5
		    shows the top provinces from which visitors come, over an arbitrary three month period. The data is compared with that of the
	    main CSTM Web site, which is used for relative comparisons.</p>

		    as looking for the museum hours, should be very short, perhaps being a single
		    page view from a Google search. Across a large and multi-purpose site, much of
	    the story is hidden by averages.</p>

	    <h4>Off-site searching</h4>

	    <p>Subject-related searches were prominent in searches that
		    brought people to the site. Searches related to specific objects and places
		    were also significant. It is also interesting to note the number of searches
	    that alluded to the name of the museum or the name of the Web site.</p>
	    <h4>On-site searching</h4>
	    <p>Searches from the on-site search feature were also
		    categorized, including both the basic and advanced searches. The distribution
	    across categories is shown in figure 5.</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="dawson.fig5.jpg" alt="figure 5" width="500" height="379" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 5: On-site search terms by category (percentage)</p>
	    <p>Subject searches were the by far the most common, with more
		    than 60% of searches including a subject term. Somewhat surprisingly, searches
		    for specific objects were not as common in on-site searches. This suggests a
		    significant degree of browsing results based on subject terms, as opposed to
		    searching for something specific. (Not surprisingly, searches museum and Web site
	    name were not a factor in on-site searches.)</p>
	    <p>With the survey, we asked users about whether they used the
	    search feature, browsed, or did both (Table 8).</p>

	    <p>The responses largely correspond to the on-site search term

                </table>
	    <p class="captionTable">Table 10: (advanced search engine) (n=19)</p>
	    <p>Most respondents relied on the basic keyword search. Cross-tabulation
	    showed that researchers were most inclined to use the advanced search.</p>
	    <h3>Findings and interpretation</h3>
	    <p>The above data provides a wealth of information against
		    which we can assess how the site is being used, and judge whether the site is
	    successful in meeting its original goals. </p>
	    <h4>Searching vs. browsing</h4>
	    <p>Almost a decade ago, Jacob Nielson (2000) suggested
		    that &ldquo;slightly more than half of all users are search-dominant, about a
		    fifth of the users are link-dominant, and the rest exhibit mixed behavior.&rdquo; While
		    our survey sample does not have the statistical relevance to dispute this
	    claim, it is sufficient to raise some important observations.</p>
	    <p>As Table 8 indicated, roughly half of survey respondents
		    browsed, and half both browsed and searched. Only one respondent used just the
		    search form. Coupled with the responses on search strategies, this suggests
		    that browsing capabilities are very important for an on-line collection, even
		    for visitors who are inclined to make use of search mechanisms. Such browsing
		    features also provide more opportunity for serendipity and chance discovery
	    (Chan, 2007).</p>
	    <p>However, the design of the CN Gallery should also be
		    considered. The site was designed with a hierarchy of subject categories,
		    around which the core navigation was built. These categories form the backbone
		    for the navigation throughout the site. Katz &amp; Byrne (2003), in examining
		    the use of e-commerce sites, used the foraging theory concept of an
	      &ldquo;information scent,&rdquo; referring to &ldquo;the amount of remote information a user can
		    derive regarding the location of information based on the design or labeling of
		    the information structure.&rdquo; &ldquo;Category labels &hellip; on a site can be more or less
		    distinctive resulting in differing degrees of information scent.&rdquo; Further, they
		    found that the &ldquo;design and structure&rdquo; of &ldquo;particular sites play a critical role
		    in determining searching behavior.&rdquo; The prominence of the subject categories in
		    the CN Gallery may partly explain the tendency toward browsing seen in survey
	    respondents.</p>
	    <p>Usability issues are also another factor. Specific survey
		    comments also suggest that some users have difficulty finding the search
		    feature; this confirms design issues apparent from a visual inspection of the
	    site. </p>
	    <h4>Metaphor and Genre</h4>
	    <p>As mentioned in the goals for the Web site, a &ldquo;gallery&rdquo; was
		    chosen as the guiding metaphor. In the survey, we asked respondents about a
	    range of genres, each with its own conventions.</p>

      </tr>
                </table>
	    <p class="captionTable">Table 11: survey respondents&rsquo; sense of design
	    metaphor/genre (n=18)</p>
	    <p>Interestingly, no survey respondents chose the gallery
		    metaphor as best representing their experience, in spite of the original
		    conception of the site, and the word gallery appearing in the site name. While
		    we need to be cautious given the small sample size, some tentative observations
	    are worth noting.</p>
	    <p>Genre can have a powerful influence on how people engage with
		    an on-line resource. Establishing a clear genre can facilitate effective use by
		    conveying a set of expectations and conventions for interaction to users
		    (Dawson et al, 2008). A clear genre or paradigm (Cameron, 2003) is also
		    important for on-line collections. In fact, the database itself can be seen as
	    a distinct form of genre (Manovich, 2000). </p>
	    <p>These preliminary findings suggest that the CN Gallery site
		    may not be successful in meeting the goal of offering a &ldquo;gallery&rdquo; experience,
		    despite the term&rsquo;s being used in the name of the site. It also suggests that
		    with a collection of this nature, users have a strong sense of examining an
		    archive. It is worth further consideration as to whether the chosen genre is
	    supporting or working against the actual use of the site by visitors.</p>
	    <h3>Interest in user contributed content</h3>
	    <p>We also asked two survey questions to indicate whether there
	    was interest among visitors in user contributed content.</p>
	    
	      <table>
	        <tr>
	          <th><p class="TableHeader">Question</p></th>
          <th><p class="TableHeader">Yes<br />
            Count (%)</p></th>

          <td><p class="TableText">16 (94.1%)</p></td>
          <td><p class="TableText">1 (5.9%)</p></td>
        </tr>
	        <tr>
	          <td><p class="TableText">Would you be interested
	          in reading posts from other website visitors about a photo?</p></td>
          <td><p class="TableText">14 (93.3%)</p></td>
          <td><p class="TableText">1 (6.7%)</p></td>
        </tr>
          </table>
          <p class="captionTable">Table 12: Interest in user contributed</span> content (n=17, n=15)</p>
	    <p>Responses clearly indicate that there is interest. This is
		    further substantiated by the number of visitors that provided their own
		    information about images, via feedback forms, email, and their ongoing
		    interaction with the museum. Several such cases are illustrated among the
	    examples that follow.</p>
	    <h2>Outcomes and Impact on Visitors</h2>
	    <p>It is worth having a closer look at the outcomes of visitor
		    use of the site. Both the photo request correspondence and the survey provide
		    rich examples of the impacts that the collection has on different types of
		    visitors. We examine these impacts for each of the identity-motivation
	    categories that we saw demonstrated. </p>
	    <h3>Explorers</h3>
	    <p>We found that <i>explorers</i> were not usually looking for anything specific. Instead, we were able to
		    determine that most of them were casually browsing without any particular goal
		    in mind. They tended to be more interested in the enjoyment and pleasure of
		    just looking at images. They may also have been interested in learning from
	    their experience in the broader sense:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Neat to see some of the old pictures.</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Found good pictures and history. Discovered that there is
	    a lot on line that I must make time to explore.</p>
	    <h3>Facilitators</h3>
	    <p>We discovered that <i>facilitators</i> were often parents or teachers who were helping students, children, or other
		    family members do some research or complete a school project (e.g. the child&rsquo;s
	    assigned research)&quot;</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">My daughter is doing a report for school and would like to
	    use some of your photographs for her project.</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Most of it is easy to navigate and
	    I plan to share the site with my 10 year old son.</p>
	    <p>Some facilitators were designing educational experiences for
	    others:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">My husband and I are from the MS Gulf Coast and work with
		    youth in our city. We are hosting a retreat in a few months and have been
		    looking for images to utilize as illustrations in our teaching. I ran across
		    this picture in the gallery and it really caught my attention. We would like to
		    use the picture on a Tshirt which we will give to the
		    students. We will make no profit on these shirts. The theme of the weekend will
		    be about sowing seed and this beautiful picture will leave a striking
		    impression. Is it possible to use this in the printing of around 50 Tshirts to
		    be given to the students? We will make any reasonable acknowledgements
		    necessary. Please advise to the email address listed above. Thanks for your
	    time.</p>
	    <h3>Professionals</h3>
	    <p>The professionals that we identified included publishers,
		    authors/writers, historians and researchers. This was the largest group in our
		    sample. These individuals often requested permission to use a photograph in a
		    publication, book, journal or magazine. Other types of requests made by <i>professionals</i> included orders for
	    specific photos or information about a photograph or the content of a photograph.</p>
	    <p>A large number of interactions are straightforward requests
	    for permissions, from publishers, historians, and museum professionals:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I need rights info for using a couple of your photos in a
	    book that will be published this year.</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I am in the process of creating a non-profit website for
		    the CN Pensioners Association of Manitoba. We would like to use some of your
		    wonderful photos in our design. Would this be ok? We will have a links section,
	    and your site clearly defined in there for everyone to know where we got them from.</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">We have ordered (on May 22nd) this picture among others, to
		    be used in an exhibition at Exporail, the Canadian railway museum. We would
	    like to know if we can use it also for the press kit. Thanks !</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Hello, I am the Schenectady County and City Historian and
	    am writing a paper about hay barns. Is it possible to use the photo</p>

	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">The photographs on this site are great! I work at

	    <p>Some professionals were looking for specific information:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Might you know which Shuswap band this group may have
	    belonged to? Thank you...</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Wow, I am really excited as these items fall directly in
	    the subject matter of my project. Thank you! Thank you!</p>
	    <p>One interesting, albeit less common, thread was a number of
	    professionals from other fields that requested images for use in decor:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">What our intent is is to frame them and hang them inside a

	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is completing
		    some renovation work at their Richmond Hill, Ontario location. In an effort to

	    pictures to adorn our freshly painted walls.</p>
	    <h3>Hobbyists</h3>
	    <p>The examples of <i>hobbyist</i> that we identified included train or railway enthusiasts, amateur historians or
	    laypeople who had an avid interest in a given subject matter:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I am interested in learning more about photo number

	    <p>We also found examples of researchers (both professional and
		    amateur) who planned a visit to the museum based on their interactions with the
	    collection. The following examples are from hobbyist researchers:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I am researching the tourism industry in Muskoka Ontario

	    <h3>Spiritual Pilgrims</h3>
	    <p>A common thread that we found among the <i>Spiritual Pilgrims </i>is the connection that they often made between
		    personal or family history and some of the images they viewed on the Web site.
		    Many were touched or moved by certain images and the memories associated with
		    them. Although there is no Web 2.0 mechanism on the Web site to allow users to
		    provide content, some visitors use the request form or e-mail to provide
	    additional information about certain images.</p>
	    <p>Many spiritual pilgrims were engaged in self-motivated
	    research:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I saw [the Royal Train] in Hamilton in 1939 when it stopped
	    here for the Royal Visit when I was a young boy.</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">The prints are solely for a nostalgic purpose. My family

	    <h2>Satisfying On-Line Museum Experiences</h2>
	    <p>We have used situated identity to examine the motivations
		    behind visits to the CN Gallery Web site. We have also demonstrated the range
		    of impacts on visitors, across the field of motivational categories. With these
		    impact statements in mind, we would like to reflect a little more broadly on
	    the nature of the on-line museum experiences that visitors have.</p>
	    <p>The important role that museums play as places of learning
		    is clearly established and has been widely recognized over the past two decades
		    (for example, Falk &amp; Dierking, 2000; Hein, 1998; Hooper-Greenhill, 1994). Given
		    the significance of this role, it is understandable that, when considering
		    museum experiences, &ldquo;museum practitioners tended to focus on the education
		    experience&rdquo; (Pekarik, Doering &amp; Karns, 1999). This focus was part of the
	    broader changes taking place within museums: </p>
	    <p class="BlockQuote">The emphasis on learning experiences and growth in museum
		    visitorship comes at a time when the mission of museums has shifted from a
	    focus on collecting and preserving to one of educating the public. (<i>Ellenbogen, Falk &amp; Haley Goldman, 2008) </i></p>
	    <p>But some observers noted that a much wider range of
		    satisfying museum experiences is actually possible (Pekarik, Doering &amp;
        Karns, 1999; Packer 2008).</p>
	    <p>The same applies to museums on-line. The Web is often viewed
		    as an information resource. For example, Kravchyna and Hastings (2002) focused
		    on &ldquo;the kinds of information that users seek on museum Web sites.&rdquo; But on-line
	    experiences may also be more diverse. </p>
	    <p>Working with Pekarik, Doering &amp; Karns&rsquo; (1999) model for
		    museum experiences, Table 13 describes four dimensions of museum experience
	      &ndash; object, cognitive, introspective and social &ndash; and considers how
	    these may apply to on-line experiences around collections.</p>

	    <p class="caption">Table 13: Museum experiences reconsidered as Web
	    experiences</p>
	    <p>We consider each of these experiences in the context of an
	    on-line collection of archival images.</p>
	    <h3>Object experiences</h3>
	    <p>While Pekarik et. al. suggested that an aspect of object experiences was
		    seeing the &ldquo;real thing&rdquo; in a museum setting, we suggest that object experiences
		    also apply in an on-line context. In fact, for an on-line collection database,
		    one might logically presume that all experiences are to some degree object
	    experiences. </p>
	    <p>However, digitized collections may face a quandary regarding
		    authenticity, in that they are generally reproductions of actual objects. With
		    a collection of archival images, there is an added level of abstraction: is our
		    object the digital image, the original print or photograph, or the subject
	    portrayed within?</p>
	    <p>But in practical terms, this may not weigh significantly on
		    the Web visitor. Visitors show great interest in the images, regardless of the
		    media. Object experiences are still possible. However, this interest often goes
		    beyond an externally focused experience of a photograph as object on its own. &ldquo;Both
		    cognitive and emotive responses may result, some of which may remain unspoken&rdquo;
        (Hooper-Greenhill, 2000).</p>
	    <h3>Cognitive experiences</h3>
	    <p>Cognitive experiences encompass many of the information
		    seeking behaviours of both researchers and informal learners on the Web. Many
		    of the collection impacts we explored illustrated the acquisition of
	    information and knowledge, both assigned and self-motivated.</p>
	    <p>It is worth noting that cognitive experiences are
		    subjective: &ldquo;Different subjects interpret different objects in different ways.&rdquo; The &ldquo;meanings [made from objects] are plural rather than
		      singular&rdquo; (Hooper-Greenhill, 2000). Even the changing significance of
		    the CN Collection demonstrates this: images once taken for promotional purposes
		    now provide both a significant historical record, and provoke powerful personal
	    experiences.</p>
	    <h3>Introspective experiences</h3>
	    <p>Hooper-Greenhill (2000) has noted that &ldquo;objects enable reflection, and speculation.&rdquo; Objects may be encoded with
		    personal experiences, such that &ldquo;the object represents the memory, the
	    significance and the emotional power of those experiences.&rdquo; </p>
	    <p>This was clearly demonstrated through the experience of our
		    spiritual pilgrims. Our examples demonstrate the presence of
		    emotional/introspective experiences with an archival collection, and show that
	    these experiences can have significant and powerful impact.</p>
	    <h3>Social experiences</h3>
	    <p>The rise of social media demonstrates that social outcomes
		    on the Web are clearly valued. Objects can play a fundamental role in these experiences
		    by facilitating social interactions &ndash; museum objects as &ldquo;social objects&rdquo;
	      (Roberto, 2008). People share on-line objects, whether at a computer screen,
		    sharing links, tagging, posting, or reading others&rsquo; posts. On-line museum
	    objects can be the focus of such social interactions.</p>
	    <p>Objects in turn are shaped by those who
		    use them. Objects may be understood in the context of &ldquo;interpretive
		    communities,&rdquo; or &ldquo;communities of meaning-making, which establish frameworks of
		    intelligibility&rdquo; that shape the subjective interpretation of objects. Hooper-Greenhill
		    goes further, to explore examples where &ldquo;the use of the Web itself constituted
	    and constructed the community&rdquo; (2000).</p>
	    <h2>Implications for Product Offerings</h2>
	    <h3>Toward a summative analysis of the CN Gallery</h3>
	    <p>While a full summative analysis is being done outside the
		    scope of this paper, a few points are worth highlighting. First, several of the
	    original goals of the site have largely been met:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>The collection does reach a significant number
	        of Canadians across a broad geographic base</li>
	      <li>There is a significant number of requests from
	        the public related to the collection</li>
	      <li>The transactions and activity around the
	        collection have helped to put resources into the collection for its management
	        and care, and have helped to build a repository of high-resolution images for
	        future use.</li>
        </ul>
	    <p>The review has also identified a number of key issues. In
		    addition to a dated design, there are usability issues in terms of navigational
		    features (e.g. navigating search results), layout (e.g. ability to find search)
	    and Web accessibility.</p>
	    <p>It is also interesting to note that the design metaphor did
		    not resonate with survey respondents. An alternate design paradigm might
	    establish better conventions and better support visitor use.</p>
	    <p>There is also clear interest in exploring the collection
		    beyond the methods first conceived when the site was designed. For example,
		    some visitors expressed interest in alternate ways of looking at information,
		    such as a desire for indexes or finding aids. This could involve an adaptation
		    of the existing collection-finding aids that are not currently available or on-line,
		    or adding the ability to search graphically, such as via a map, or some other
		    alternate browsing approach. There is also clear interest in user-contributed
	    content.</p>
	    <p>A full consideration of user motivations, behaviour,
		    feedback, and experience could lead to a re-formulation of the goals for the
		    site. For example, emphasizing the importance of personal introspective
		    experiences, or the value of connecting Canadians to their national and
		    personal histories and to each other through the collection, could become
	    future goals for the &nbsp;presentation of this collection.</p>
	    <h2>General Implications for the Design of On-Line Experiences</h2>
	    <p>Thinking broadly about visitor motivations and experiences
		    should have significant, positive implications for design. We offer a few
	    concrete examples.</p>
	    <p>A clear sense of the situated identities and user
		    motivations that may be relevant in a given on-line experience should provide
		    for a better appreciation for visitor needs. It could, for example, be drawn
		    upon for the technique of crafting personas, often used in Web site information
	    architecture (Wodtke, 2003).</p>
	    <p>A more careful consideration of the range of experience can
		    help make sense of the wide range of design options available, and lead to
	    better decisions around features and designs. For example:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>A consideration of object experiences may allow
	        for more effective presentation of the digital object, with appropriate
	        resolution, or features such as zoom, rotate, etc.</li>
	      <li>A consideration of cognitive experience could
	        allow for the planning of information sufficient to provide context and support
	        learning. It may involve establishing an appropriate level of metadata, or
	        illustrating the connections between objects.</li>
	      <li>A consideration of introspective experiences may
	        allow people ways to explore objects based on introspective uses (such as
	        searching based on time or place, or looking at object on a map).</li>
	      <li>A consideration of social experiences may better
	        recognize the social uses of objects &ndash; i.e., that people will want to
	        share these objects (perhaps post them in social media sites), tag them, or
	        share stories about them.</li>
        </ul>
	    <p>These are just a few tangible suggestions. The point to
		    emphasize is that a full, rounded consideration of the visitor experience can
	    have real, tangible benefits in the design of a Web offering.</p>
	    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
	    <p>We have found that the CN Gallery has met many of its
		    original objectives, although there are a number of specific issues to address.
		    More significantly, for future directions, the objectives for the site could be
		    re-formulated, keeping in mind the broader impacts of the collection and a
		    fuller consideration of the overall visitor experience. This, along with a
		    clearer profile of users and their motivations, should inform any future
	    directions and possible re-design.</p>
	    <p>More broadly, we have demonstrated practical ways that we
		    can better understand our visitors and their motivations, behaviour and
		    experiences, so that these factors can be considered in the planning and design
		    of on-line experiences. As part of a viable business model, museums must be
		    clear about who they are serving: they must be able to
		    answer the question: &ldquo;who is your public and what are the specific needs they
	    have that you are uniquely trying to satisfy?&rdquo; (Falk &amp; Sheppard, 2006)</p>
