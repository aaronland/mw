        <p class="AbstractText">The Minnesota Historical Society launched the wiki
        Placeography.org in 2007 with simple goals: to gather the history of places, to
        share memories from those who experienced those places, and to foster an
        interest in historic preservation. Project members and trusted advisors agreed
        that a wiki would provide an ideal delivery mechanism. However, the MHS&rsquo;
        experience with a prior, major wiki project indicated that a new approach would
      be necessary to ensure the success of the project.</p>
      <p class="AbstractText">The authors describe and contrast the two wiki projects,
        assess the key lessons from the initial project, and describe how those
        findings shaped their approach to the development of Placeography. Foremost
        among the findings is that creating, fostering, and sustaining a community is
        essential to the success of a wiki. Key performance measurements - barometers of
        the success of the project - indicate that deliberate attention to building the
        community of content contributors through promotion, partnerships, and
      outreach, directly impacted the success of the project.</p>

     <h1 class="Author">Introduction</h1>
     <p>Creating, fostering, and sustaining a community is essential
        to the success of a wiki. There is tremendous competition for the time and
        contributions of content creators and editors. For new projects, collaborators
        must determine that the wiki has sustainability, adequate technical support,
        and the ability to reach their intended audience. They want to see why they
        would share their information or help build a new wiki. Some of the lessons of
        running a small business such as an independent coffee shop or book store are
        applicable here. Greeting and acknowledging the contributions of newcomers, providing
        individual assistance for those who need training in starting to add content,
        and providing a space for an organization to encourage visitation and
        engagement are essential activities to foster a relationship. This paper
        provides practical, executable strategies for launching a community-focused
        wiki. Several tactics for different community needs and different sized
      organizations are discussed.</p>
      <p>The Minnesota Historical Society&rsquo;s (MHS) journey into wiki
        communities began in 2006 when we hosted a roundtable discussion with other
        museums in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul area on ways to engage the public using technology
        tools in our upcoming MN150 exhibit. Their advice was that a wiki would be a
        terrific way to collect and disseminate history. After all, Wikipedia had shown
        there is an army of talented volunteers ready to collaborate, so perhaps its
        success would be applicable. However, those who had created public wikis cautioned
        us that our largest challenge would not be vandalism or slander, but simply
      non-use: few people would bother to contribute wiki content.</p>
      <p>Over the next two years, the MHS launched two wikis - the
        MN150 wiki (<a href="../http://www.mnhs.org/mn150wiki">http://www.mnhs.org/mn150wiki</a><a href="../http://www.mnhs.org/mn150wiki"></a>)
        and Placeography (<a href="../http://www.placeography.org/">http://www.placeography.org</a>) - and was faced with the
        challenge of how to make these wikis relevant to a community, to encourage
        collaboration, and to receive contributions. The two wikis demonstrate
        different collaboration techniques to building wiki communities, and the level
      of collaboration differs significantly. </p>
      <h2>MN150 Wiki</h2>
      <p><a name="nink" id="nink"></a>The MN150 wiki launched in October 2007, to
        coincide with the opening of the MN150 exhibit. This exhibit marks the
        sesquicentennial of Minnesota statehood by exploring the 150 most influential
        forces in the state's history - the people, places, events and things that
        caused change in Minnesota and beyond. The exhibit was curated by the public
        through an open nomination process which drew more than 2,700 nominations. Some
        topics, such as Bob Dylan, received multiple nominations. A committee of staff,
        community members and subject experts selected the final list of 150 topics,
        basing their choices on the compelling case made by the nominator as well as
        the potential for each topic to be developed into a successful exhibit
        component. Each topic is displayed in the exhibit with the winning nomination
      and some historical context. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.mnhs.org/mn150wiki"><img src="sherman_bakerFig1.png" alt="figure 1" width="500" height="329" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: The Home Page of MN150 Wiki
      <a href="../http://www.mnhs.org/mn150wiki">http://www.mnhs.org/mn150wiki</a></p>
      <p>The exhibit development team wanted a way to present <i>all</i> of the nominations, regardless of
        whether a nominated topic or the actual nomination was included in the exhibit.
        We wanted a way for nominators to find their nomination. We could have
        accomplished these goals with a printed list in the exhibit or a searchable
        database, but we chose a wiki because we wanted to explore how to make history
        collaborative, given that the entire nomination process had been a public
      collaboration. </p>
      <p>So we built the wiki using MediaWiki. Rather than trying to
        convert the 2,700 nominations into MediaWiki&rsquo;s MySQL database, we chose to hand
        enter each topic as a wiki article. Each topic/article shows all of the
        nominations, the curator's historical context, images, related resources, and a
        section for the public to share memories. Because we had just three months to
        complete this massive effort, we recruited volunteers to assist in the content
        entry. The wiki proved to be an excellent tool for volunteers collaborating
        with the wiki development team because we could track the editing history and
      have team discussions on the wiki talk pages. </p>
      <p>To make the wiki feel familiar to users, we designed the
        user interface so it resembles Wikipedia (<a href="../http://www.wikipedia.org/">http://www.wikipedia.org</a>). We placed
        two kiosks in the exhibit gallery, and the wiki was included in much of the promotion
      for the exhibit. We were ready for the public to collaborate. </p>
      <p>But the public hasn't collaborated in large numbers. With
        more than 400,000 page views, there are
        plenty of people browsing the site. They are viewing the list of the 150 topics
        as well as the list of all nominations; each of these pages has had more than 24,000
        visits. They are searching for the nomination they submitted, and they're
        flocking to the articles about Prince, Betty Crocker, Paul Bunyan, Bob Dylan and
        the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team. However, they are not contributing to the
        historical context or adding memories. A &quot;Create Your Own MN150 List&quot;
        feature was envisioned as being as a way for members of the public to
        participate because they could exhibit their choices or add topics. However, of
        the more than 150 registered users - we require registration to reduce
      vandalism - only 17 people created their own lists. </p>
      <p>Why was there minimal collaboration? One factor could be the
        difficulty of editing content. Although MediaWiki has an editing toolbar,
        knowledge of wiki markup language is required for sophisticated editing. This
        factor was confirmed in usability testing, so we built in pre-formatted
        templates and cheat sheets to assist new contributors. Another factor is that the
        wiki is not promoted unto itself, so that the primary way people find out about
        it is when they are in the exhibit gallery. Also, contributing to the
        historical context requires more thoughtful consideration than is conducive to
        an onsite experience. There has been some discussion with the Education group
        to create post-visit lesson plans that incorporate the wiki. Finally, a major
        factor is that once we launched the wiki, there were no resources assigned to
      promote or nurture it. </p>
      <p>While the MN150
        wiki satisfied the goal of presenting the submitted nominations with some historical
        context, it isn&rsquo;t enticing community collaboration. We learned from MN150 that adding
        content to wikis must be easy, the content should compel a community to act,
      and the community must be nurtured.</p>
      <h2>Placeography </h2>
      <p>During the time the
        MN150 Wiki was being planned and developed, we were developing Placeography, a wiki
      focused on house, building, and other place histories. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.placeography.org/"><img src="sherman_bakerFig2.png" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="329" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 2: The Home Page of Placeography <a
href="../http://www.placeography.org/">http://www.placeography.org</a></p>
      <h3>Background </h3>
      <p>The MHS offers popular classes teaching people how to
        research their home's history. We learned that house history is a passion with
        many people. This interest in house histories was reflected on other Web sites.
        For example, there were individual house blogs - people journaling about the
        progress of restoring their homes. Before the real estate bust there were many
        Realtors blogging on house histories in an effort to entice potential buyers. Many
        neighborhood and preservation organizations had Web sites with out-of-date postings concerning historic and
        threatened houses in their neighborhoods. There was even a Bungalow Club on-line.
        However, one thing was obvious: while there was a definite interest in house
        history, there was no comprehensive space for recording house and building
      histories on-line. </p>
      <p>Before creating our own wiki, we surveyed many existing sites.
        We discovered wikis focused on specific geographic communities, such as Davis
        Wiki (<a href="../http://www.daviswiki.org/">http://www.daviswiki.org</a>) and Bloomingpedia (<a
href="../http://www.bloomingpedia.org/wiki/Bloomington">http://www.bloomingpedia.org/wiki/Bloomington</a>),
        which focus on the cities of Davis, California, and Bloomington, Indiana,
        respectively. Archiplanet.org (<a href="../http://www.archiplanet.org/">http://www.archiplanet.org</a>), an active wiki with many of the
        contributions coming from architectural firms, appears to be&nbsp;more
        geared to the works of larger architectural firms and some major landmarks
        throughout the world. We also investigated Wikipedia, an extensive and impressive
        on-line encyclopedia familiar to the vast majority of people. There you can
        find historic properties in Saint Paul, Minnesota such as the James J. Hill
        House and the Saint Paul Cathedral. Wikipedia contributors (2009) define policies
        to determine whether content is suitable for inclusion. These buildings have
        been deemed notable enough to be included in Wikipedia. Wikipedia has further
        policies requiring verifiability and barring original research; while necessary
        for an encyclopedia, these are seen as too exclusive for our mission. Thus, adding
        an article for your ranch house or suburban rambler, or even extensive information
        detailing companies and workers that helped build the Saint Paul Cathedral, is
        more than likely to wind up on the digital cutting room floor. After exploring
        a variety of possibilities, we concluded that to meet our goals of creating a
        site for anyone to add the history of a &nbsp;house and for people to freely add memories of places of
      local and personal significance, our best option was to create a new wiki. </p>
      <p>For the new wiki, which we named Placeography - <i>to write about places</i>, we established several
        project goals. First, we wanted to provide a way for the public to share the
        history of a house, structure, or property with a personal connection to them. The
        MHS Library teaches house history classes. This wiki would give us a chance to see
        the results of our educational efforts and give class attendees an opportunity
        to share the results of their research. We also wanted to provide a way for the
        public, especially those not able to visit the library in person, to learn
        about the history of places in their communities of interest. Beyond the
        standard architectural and historical data about buildings, we were interested
        in gathering personal stories about buildings and places. Giving life to the
        phrase, &quot;if these walls
        could talk&quot;, we envisioned
        generations of families sharing stories of when they inhabited a house, each
      contribution building upon those that preceded it. </p>
      <p>Another important goal for the project was fostering
        interest in historic preservation, tying in with an institutional mission of
        the MHS and its State Historic Preservation Office. We saw Placeography as an
        opportunity to collaborate with public libraries, local historical societies, other
        museums, and historical preservation groups to promote awareness of the wiki
        and to train local communities about how to use the wiki. Placeography could
        provide added value to these partner organizations by providing them with local
        portals to the wiki. We saw Placeography as a vehicle to recognize buildings
        and structures important to individuals and communities which are significant
        but do not necessarily meet the formal criteria of the National Register of
        Historic Places (NRHP). Our final goal was to increase awareness of other MHS
        place-related on-line resources such as our photo and art collection, Minnesota
      Place Names, MHS's historic sites, and the NRHP database. </p>
      <h3>Building Placeography </h3>
      <p>We started meeting as a team in May 2007. The team included staff
        from the MHS Enterprise Technology Department (ET) and from the Library, giving
        us both technical expertise and historical research experience. Two interns
        have made important contributions, also. The ET staff built the technical
        infrastructure. Library team members worked on the content and user side, doing
        property research and working on pull-down menus, user help, rules of conduct,
      links to sources and house history tutorials. </p>
      <p>In the fall of 2007, Placeography went live. The initial site
        content came from a collaboration of a Minneapolis community theatre organization,
        a local private college, and MHS museum and ET staff. Their work produced an
        exhibit at the Minnesota History Center and Web content for Placeography. The Right
        on Lake Street project (<a href="../http://www.archiplanet.org/">http://www.mnhs.org/lakestreet</a>), rich with images and
        memories, showed us and others the possibilities of creating an on-line
      community history. </p>
      <p>The team was then able to begin adding entries and creating
        information to help users add content. Before launching the site publicly, we
        wanted to create a significant number of entries so that potential contributors
        and partners would see it as a viable entity and would have a variety of models
        for articles. Members of the Placeography team entered a number of properties
        and encouraged our friends and colleagues to contribute. Our first intern spent
        her summer doing research on over 75 properties. We officially launched in
        February 2008 with a press release. The press release resulted in an on-line
        news article and a live interview on a local talk radio station. Even before
        the release, a local television reporter had discovered the site and featured
      Placeography as a favorite Web site in a news broadcast and on the station&rsquo;s blog. </p>
      <h3>Growing the placeography community </h3>
      <p>When you create a wiki like Placeography and seed it with a
        number of entries, you can sit back and wonder: If we build it will they come? However,
        we learned from the MN150 Wiki that we couldn't just wait for contributors. We
        needed to go out and build a community and engage partners to help make
        Placeography a success. We started by contacting some individuals who had done
        extensive research that was not yet available on-line. For example, an active trade union member
        who has done extensive research on sites connected with Saint Paul labor history
        offered his information to Placeography, seeing it as an opportunity to create
        more access to information about labor history and interest in preserving
        buildings associated with labor. Seeking an on-line home and additional
        suggestions, the MHS book curator offered his compilation &quot;Pseudonymous
      Minnesota,&quot; the real models for fictional Minnesota places. </p>
      <p>We initiated our search for organizational partners with
        some local community, preservation, and historical organizations with whom we
        had worked previously in one way or another. Sometimes the groups we approached,
        thinking they would be great partners, turned us down or delayed responding to
        our invitations to meet. It proved most difficult to engage the first partners.
        We attended numerous meetings with individuals, volunteers, and board members. Once
        we had an agreement, we created a portal page for the organization. For some of
        our first partners, we did a lot of the entry of their material. It was a
        learning process for us as well as them. Developing relationships with
        committed partners required much initial time, footwork, and perseverance. The
        organizational partners are vital as they bring groups of students and volunteers
      who can be active participants, along with many members and supporters. </p>
      <p>The partnerships we have formed with colleges and
        universities have allowed college students to provide valuable additions to
        Placeography. When students
        have class assignments or seek internships, they are able to utilize their
        technical skills to quickly add new entries and content. We have worked with
        students primarily as interns or through classes. Some professors have assigned
        students the task of adding one or more entries to Placeography as part of
        their course requirements. We have had two successful collaborations with
        college students at the University of Minnesota, one with an architecture
        school class and the other with a public history class working with the Jewish
      Historical Society of the Upper Midwest. </p>
      <p>After meeting with historical and community organizations, we
        found it was clear their interest level was high but they had few resources. So
        the MHS is placing some of our volunteers with our partner organizations to
        assist them with content entry. We placed a volunteer with the Jewish Historical
        Society of the Upper Midwest to help create articles about Jewish synagogues
        throughout Minnesota, including those no longer standing or being used as
        synagogues. We placed a volunteer with the Preserve Minneapolis group, to help
        identify and enter historic properties in each of Minneapolis&rsquo; eighty-one
      official neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>Some of the most extensive entries and tours have come from
        our partners, who not only are part of the Placeography community but also
        represent a geographical or special interest community. For example, the
        Dayton's Bluff Community Council in inner-city Saint Paul has entered 45 places
        and offers both a walking tour and driving tour of the community. Some of the partners
        have been motivated by the recent housing foreclosure crisis, wanting to bring
        attention to threatened properties and hoping to gather interest and investment
        in their communities through potential new owners. Each partner gets a portal
        page on Placeography with information about the organization and links to all
      the properties listed. </p>
      <p>After we engaged a few partners, it was easier to attract
        others as they recognized the possibilities. Occasionally we observed an
        element of keeping up with the Joneses or the Jones Neighborhood Preservation
        Group. If that helped build a more robust Placeography, we accepted the natural
        attraction to success and competition. When we saw individuals and
        organizations with which we had no prior contact adding entries, linking
        podcasts to existing entries, and enhancing building entries with additional
        information and images, we were very pleased. Groups in Utah and Kentucky
        discovered Placeography and requested permission to add entries and even become
        partners. Here we were in Minnesota trying hard to sell the concept to our
        local organizations, while other groups many states away were discovering
        Placeography and asking to join. We encouraged our most active individual and
        organizational contributors by featuring their entries, tours, or projects on
      the Placeography home page. </p>
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>Four performance measurements were established in the
        Placeography project charter. The performance measurements and recent results
      are presented in the following table.</p>

      <p class="caption">Table 1: Placeography Performance Measurements</p>
      <p>In 2008,
        Placeography received 23,000 visits, three-fourths of which were new visits. At
        a 52% bounce rate, it appears that about half of the visitors found enough
      content of interest to stay and browse awhile.</p>
      <h2>Tools, Tenacity and Tactics To Create and Foster a Wiki Community </h2>
      <p>We used the 3T&rsquo;s approach
      - tools, tenacity and tactics - to create and foster the Placeography community.</p>
      <h3>Tools </h3>
      <h4>Wiki software</h4>
      <p>To facilitate our entr&eacute;e into the wiki community, we
        evaluated several open source software wikis and decided to use MediaWiki because
        of its rich set of features, security, flexibility and large community of
      support. </p>
      <h4><span class="Heading3Char">Forms based entry</span> </h4>
      <p>Taking a lesson from the MN150 wiki which requires
        contributors to use the MediaWiki editor tool or to know wiki markup language,
        we worked to make adding entries to Placeography as easy as possible by
        creating on-line forms so that potential contributors were not intimidated by
        having to learn a lot of html code. We found that many of the contributors and
        partners had passionate commitments to their communities but often displayed
        limited technical skills. By making Placeography more user friendly we were
        able to engage new users who could begin with adding material to the forms. Many
        of these users, as they became comfortable with using Placeography and saw the
        results of their work and possibilities for adding images and links, were
      motivated to learn how to do more on the site. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.placeography.org/index.php?title=Bartholomew_House%2C_6901_Lyndale_Avenue_South%2C_Richfield%2C_Minnesota&amp;action=edit"><img src="sherman_bakerFig3.png" alt="figure 3" width="500" height="349" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 3: Would you like to edit this? <a href="../http://www.placeography.org/index.php?title=Bartholomew_House%2C_6901_Lyndale_Avenue_South%2C_Richfield%2C_Minnesota&amp;action=edit">http://www.placeography.org/index.php?title=Bartholomew_House%2C_ 6901_Lyndale_Avenue_South%2C_Richfield%2C_Minnesota&amp;action=edit</a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.placeography.org/index.php?title=Bartholomew_House%2C_6901_Lyndale_Avenue_South%2C_Richfield%2C_Minnesota&amp;action=formedit"><img src="sherman_bakerFig4.png" alt="figure 4" width="500" height="349" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 4: Or this? <a href="../http://www.placeography.org/index.php?title=Bartholomew_House%2C_6901_Lyndale_Avenue_South%2C_Richfield%2C_Minnesota&amp;action=formedit">http://www.placeography.org/index.php?title=Bartholomew_House%2C_ 6901_Lyndale_Avenue_South%2C_Richfield%2C_Minnesota&amp;action=formedit</a></p>
      <p>Out-of-the-box, MediaWiki lacks forms-based entry. To create
        on-line forms we first applied the Semantic MediaWiki extension (<a href="../http://www.semantic_mediawiki.org/Semantic_MediaWiki">http://www.semantic_mediawiki.org/Semantic_MediaWiki</a>)
        which enables content to be recognized as data that can be queried, organized
        into lists, and made available for mashups. Second, we applied the Semantic
        Form extension (<a
href="../http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_Forms">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_Forms</a>).
        These extensions have simplified Placeography's functionality and lowered the
      barriers to users for content entry.</p>
      <h4><a name="dd2g" id="dd2g"></a>User interface </h4>
      <p>As with the MN150
        wiki, we chose a user interface that resembles Wikipedia&rsquo;s because most
        visitors are familiar with it. A familiar user interface enables contributors
      to instantly recognize Placeography as a wiki that they can edit. </p>
      <h4>Identity </h4>
      <p>The MN150 wiki
        was an overtly MHS project, tied in to an exhibit, so its URL includes
        mnhs.org. For Placeography we chose a URL that had its own brand, encouraging
        participation beyond Minnesota and letting Minnesotans see that it wasn't a
        site comprised solely of MHS-presented research, but a venue for user content
        creation and editing. As a presenting organization, MHS deliberately put its
        logo in the footer; however the site&rsquo;s appearance lacks any resemblance to
        other MHS Web sites. As a result, organizations in Minnesota, Kentucky and Utah
      have embraced Placeography for their content with their own portals. </p>
      <h4>Licensing</h4>
      <p>Like Wikipedia, Placeography operates under a GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), (<a href="../http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html</a>),
        which gives readers the rights to copy, redistribute and modify a work and
        requires all copies and derivatives to be available under the same license. We use
        GFDL so contributors will know their work benefits everyone; their work is part
        of a <i>community-created</i> Web site. In
        contrast, Archiplanet.org (<a
href="../http://www.archiplanet.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://www.archiplanet.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>) describes itself as &quot;community-constructed&quot;.
        Owned by Artifice, Inc., the publishers of <i>Architecture
          Week</i>, in reality it is <i>community-owned</i> per these published terms &quot;By contributing content here, in
        addition to retaining your creator's rights, you also grant non-exclusive
      rights to Artifice, Inc. to publish these contributions.&quot; </p>
      <h4>Policies</h4>
      <p>Like Wikipedia,
        the<b> </b>site encourages a neutral point
        of view. Other rules of conduct encourage contributors to cite sources, respect
        privacy of property owners, and follow copyright laws. When contributors upload
        images and other files, they are given a choice of licensing options that also
      help them properly credit the source.</p>
      <h3>Tenacity </h3>
      <h4>Leadership and passion </h4>
      <p>Two important factors
        of developing and running a wiki community are leadership and passion. It takes
        tenacity to maintain a high level of leadership and passion in a resource-constrained
        economy. Wiki expert Laurence Parry (Wikimania, 2006) said much of a wiki&rsquo;s
      success comes down to the founder&rsquo;s leadership.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">You must have belief in
        yourself - you must think that founding a wiki is the right thing to do, and you
        are the best person to be doing it. At the same time, you must believe that it is
        important (nay, essential) for others to contribute as well. After all, you would
      not be making a wiki if you thought others had nothing to offer! (Laurence Parry)</p>
      <p>Parry goes on to
        say, &quot;even if you&rsquo;re
        getting paid for it, you may find it hard to get sufficiently motivated, and if
        not you&rsquo;ll probably find you get bored and wish to leave before your task is
        complete. Passion about the topic is a good thing.&quot; The Placeography founding team, with
        interests and expertise in architectural history, house history, genealogy,
        community organizing and personal storytelling, is passionate about this
      endeavor. </p>
      <h4>Invite participation</h4>
      <p>As with all
        connections with Web site visitors, we try to build a relationship between the
        visitor and our site. That relationship starts with the first visit. Librarian
        and blogger David Lee King (2007)blogged about &quot;inviting
        participation&quot; through active and passive invitations. Passive invitations,
        which don&rsquo;t ask &quot;anyone
        specifically to do anything&quot; invite participation indirectly
        through good site design and customer service. While many of his suggestions
        are blog specific, the general spirit and idea of passive invitations can be
      applied to all social Web sites.</p>
      <h4>Passive invitations</h4>
      <h5>Site design</h5>
      <p>To passively
        invite participation, Placeography&rsquo;s home page allows visitors to quickly
        understand the purpose of the Web site and to browse some featured entries so
        they can &lsquo;kick the tires&rsquo; a bit before committing to contribute. Further, the
        featured entries show visitors the variety of history that can be shared.&nbsp; The featured entries change regularly
        to let visitors know the site is live and active. This is crucial to nurturing
        a wiki community because few people want to commit their efforts to a dead Web
      site.</p>
      <h5>Facilitate social relationships</h5>
      <p>Facilitating
        relationship between visitors is vital. MediaWiki has talk and topic discussion
        pages to give people a place to dialogue. Our pages with the most revisions
        have active talk pages. Placeography has taken this a step further by creating
        a template, placed on user pages, that allows users to find users with similar
        interests. This feature was created after a contributor who wanted to connect with
      others interested in preservation requested it.</p>
      <h5>Give organizations their space</h5>
      <p>We took the
        Wikipedia portal concept, which helps readers navigate their way through
        Wikipedia topic areas, and applied it as a way for organizations to create a
        presence on Placeography. Portals are used to provide information about the
        organization, and to organize their place entries. The portals enable
      organizations to promote two more Placeography features - tours and projects.</p>
      <h5>Badges</h5>
      <p>We re-purposed
        another Wikipedia concept, the user box, as badges that are applied to place entries
        so they can be linked together as tours or projects. Tours can be location-based
        as in a walking tour, or they can be interest-based as in a tour of the community&rsquo;s
        Top Ten Endangered Places.<a name="b%3A7_" id="b%3A7_"></a> In contrast to Tours, Projects
        are pages created by organizations that are task focused. They have been used
        to document the remaining farm houses in a suburban community, an
      archaeological dig, a class project, and displaying the places in a museum exhibit</p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.placeography.org/index.php/Saint_Paul_Gangster_History_Tour"><img src="sherman_bakerFig5.png" alt="figure 5" width="259" height="234" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 5: Examples of Placeography badges <a href="../http://www.placeography.org/index.php/Saint_Paul_Gangster_History_Tour">http://www.placeography.org/index.php/Saint_Paul_Gangster_History_Tour</a></p>
      <h4><span class="Heading4Char">Active
      invitations</span></h4>
      <p>King&rsquo;s suggestion
        for actively inviting participation is brilliantly simple, to just
        &quot;ask&quot;. To add a personal touch to our relationship with contributors,
      we actively offer support in a couple of ways.</p>
      <h5>Meet and greet</h5>
      <p>We closely
        monitor our <b>recent changes</b> page to
        see when a new user creates a new page or makes changes to an old one. We found
        that greeting new contributors as quickly as possible, thanking them for their
        contributions, and offering them help and support, results in a more committed
        contributor - someone who will continue to contribute and will spread good news.
        While we have a standard welcome message, we often personalize it to the person&rsquo;s
      contribution or interest. </p>
      <h5>Go to them</h5>
      <p>As mentioned
        above, to get organizations to join up the MHS, staff has taken an active outreach
        approach by actually driving to neighborhood events and board meetings to ask organizations
        to participate. While it takes time, we have found it to be the most effective
        at recruiting new contributions. Joe attended many meetings with staff,
        board members, and interested volunteers. In one case, he was placed last on
        the agenda of a lengthy and contentious community meeting. Key to the
        willingness of individuals and organizations to offer their information and
        work is trust that Placeography, in particular the individuals and organization
        behind it, will be good stewards of their work, preserving it and making it
      available to a larger audience. </p>
      <h3>Tactics </h3>
      <p>It takes active
        promotion to build an audience of wiki contributors. In addition to inviting
      participation to develop relationships, we used these promotional tactics. </p>
      <h4>Power of the network</h4>
      <p>In addition to
        linking Placeography on the MHS Web site, we ask our partner organizations to link
        to it. This shows the community is committed to Placeography and improves
        search engine rankings. When we see a Google alert for Placeography, usually
        from a blog posting, we thank the blogger for mentioning us. We use the viral
        marketing aspects of social networks, like Twitter and Facebook, because
        wikis are inherently Web 2.0/social Web and we see the growth potential for
      finding friends in these social networks.</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 6: Examples of Twitter Tweets</p>
      <h4>Print collateral</h4>
      <p>We invested in a professional
        printed piece to leave behind at conferences and meetings, and have it available
        at our museums and Library. It is important to be clear about what action you want
      the reader to take. Our rack card asks the reader to explore and contribute.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="sherman_bakerFig7.png" alt="figure 7" width="500" height="531" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 7: Placeography Brochure</p>
      <h4>Advertise</h4>
      <p>On-line
        advertising provides the best value for targeting specific audiences. The MHS is
        exploring the use of Facebook ads. A $50 investment yielded 276,000
        impressions, 120 clicks, at least 5 probable contributions and one contact from
      a historical society.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion </h2>
      <p>This has been our journey so far. Where
        we go from here is to continue to foster and grow the Placeography community. We're exploring ways to meet with and
        reward active partners, such as waiving fees for house history classes for people
        who submit several entries. We&rsquo;re working on ways to achieve our goal of having
        more entries for places outside the Twin Cities metro area, more tours and
        projects, and more partners documenting Twin Cities neighborhoods and
        communities not yet on Placeography. Though most of our efforts will
        concentrate on Minnesota, we&rsquo;ll continue to engage partnerships outside of our
      state.</p>
      <p>While it may be difficult to
        attend board meetings of community organizations in Greater Minnesota, we&rsquo;ll
        promote Placeography by attending conferences and using social media networks. We
        will recruit local libraries and local historical societies to foster
        Placeography in their communities. We'll continue to promote Placeography
        within our own organization, looking for partnership opportunities as MHS
      develops exhibits, tours, and projects involving students. </p>
      <p>Anyone can start a wiki. To <i>grow</i> a wiki community requires passion for the topic, learning from experience and
        from our partners, having resources to sustain the site, actively inviting
      participation, and nurturing committed contributors with a personal touch.</p>
