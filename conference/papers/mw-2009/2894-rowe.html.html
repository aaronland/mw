  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Many of New Zealand’s thirty-five major metropolitan and
    regional cultural institutions (approximately 15% of New Zealand’s museums)
    have well developed Web sites, but most of the country’s museums (approximately
    85%) are small and mainly volunteer run, and do not have the resources to set
    up a custom Web site. National Services Te Paerangi, a division of the Museum
    of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa), commenced a project in 2006 (first
    proposed in 2003) to redevelop the existing NZMuseums Web site
    (<a href="../http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/">http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz</a>) to provide better access to all of New Zealand’s
    heritage collections.</p>
  <p>For the initial launch, 50 museums had catalogued collection
    items, 90% of which were not previously available on the Web. The Web site also
    includes 'what's on' at museums, can be used as an on-line collection
    management system (CMS), and acts as a directory for finding museums throughout
    the country.</p>
  <p>What needs to be in place for small museums to successfully
    contribute to a national collections Web site? How can a portal for many museums
    be built with limited resources? What features would encourage re-use of the
    data for other projects? </p>
  <p>When the Web site was first proposed in 2003, the main goals
    were to make the existing on-line museum directory (which was by then more than
    six years old and suffering from a very tired design and lack of functionality)
    more dynamic, interactive and visually appealing; to provide small museums with
    the tools to document un-catalogued collections; to provide all museums with
    methods to contribute collection information to the Web site; and in general to
    provide a more engaging, interactive Web site from which the public could
    access collection information. The redevelopment would provide a focal point
    for all museums in New Zealand and would allow the hundreds of small museums to
    have a stronger supported presence on the Web; with the later advent of Web 2.0,
    it would also allow the end-user to communicate with the museums through
    comments and tagging, not featured as a potential benefit from the start.</p>
  <p>Challenges that existed included selling the concept to
    potential contributors; developing a process for museums with only basic
    knowledge of technology to provide content; supporting multiple existing
    collections management systems; training the participants; addressing data
    quality issues; and prioritising a long list of desirable functionality. It was
    also an imperative to consider what was necessary to give the Web site a strong
    foundation for the future.</p>
  <p>The redeveloped Web site for New Zealand’s 400 + museums was
    launched on 17 September 2008. Every museum has its own profile page on the Web
    site and each now can catalogue its collection for a global audience. After
    more than 10 months of active marketing to the sector, and the provision of
    several relevant training options, 50 museums had catalogued collection items
    ready for the launch: 90% of this content was not previously available on the
    Web.</p>
  <p>Still presently in its first phase, NZMuseums also includes <b>'what's on</b>' at museums, a directory for
    finding museums throughout the country, space for comments back to each museum;
    the site can also be used as an on-line collection management system (CMS).
    This paper sets out:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the project’s background</li>
    <li>how the problems encountered were addressed, </li>
    <li>the functionality that was included for the new Web site, and </li>
    <li>the future plans for the site.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The new Web site is the result of a collaboration between
    National Services Te Paerangi (NSTP) and Vernon Systems Ltd (VSL), the solution
    provider for the project.</p>
  <h2>Project History</h2>
  <p>National Services Te Paerangi (NSTP) is a division of the
    Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. NSTP exists because of the Te Papa Act
    1992 which states in Section 7 (i) that a function of the museum is “To
    co-operate with and assist other New Zealand museums in establishing a national
    service, and in providing appropriate support to other institutions and
    organisations holding objects or collections of national importance”. The aim
    of the national service has been to build the capacity of the museum sector and
    to keep museums sustainable. Since 2006 the NSTP mission has been:  “To
    strengthen the museum sector by providing practical and strategic help to
    museums and iwi throughout Aotearoa New Zealand”. This is accomplished through
    the delivery of training programmes, the New Zealand Museums Standards Scheme
    of best practice, strategic leadership, support, advice, on-site assistance for
    museum personnel, a programme of grants, internships, and development of a
    range of resources for the sector, including the Web site NZMuseums.</p>
  <p>In 2003, the then-Director of NSTP presented at the National
    Digital Forum (NDF) Conference (a yearly New Zealand based conference focusing
    on digitisation issues and projects in the Libraries, Archives and Museums
    sector of New Zealand, with some international contributions) a proposal for
    the redevelopment of the NZMuseums Web site.</p>
  <p>This proposal was based upon recommendations summarised in a
    report commissioned by NSTP titled “Museums Online: Finding Museums Everywhere”
    (2002). In that report, a survey commissioned in 2000 was summarised, having
    identified that “few museums have their resources in a state that they could
    contribute to an on-line collections database&hellip;large numbers are without their
    collections in digital formats” (Kenderdine, 2000). The concept proposed was
    for a re-designed version of what was at that time referred to as NZMoL – New
    Zealand Museums On Line, which was first developed in 1997/98 and which had
    been redeveloped in 2001 into a basic Web site that featured some enhanced
    search capabilities and enabled museums to update their own content; but it was
    still a very basic directory of New Zealand museums with a narrow range of
    information available about each individual museum.</p>
  <p>The aim by 2003 was to feature the collections of the
    museums of New Zealand on the site, in line with the work being carried out by
    other Web-based initiatives, such as Canada’s CHIN, Scotland’s SCRAN and
    Australia’s CAN collection-based Web sites. Rather than just a short
    introductory paragraph, the hours of opening, and icons denoting types of
    collections held (plus a link to the museum’s Web site if one existed), more
    would eventually be offered to a global audience on NZMuseums.</p>

  <p class="caption">Fig 2: A sample museum profile page from the old NZMuseums Web
    site</p>
  <p>At the time of the presentation on the re-development
    concept at the NDF Conference in 2003, two further surveys had been completed.
    In 2002, a survey of the sector (Revero Web Specialists, 2002) revealed that
    museums with no digital collection management system (CMS) represented
    approximately 85% of the sector; museums with a digital CMS that does not
    publish digital content to a Web site represented approximately 15% of the
    sector; and museums with a CMS that published digital content to a Web site
    represented less than 1% of the sector. This survey also highlighted that over
    one-third of respondents had neither a Web site nor on-site Internet access. By
    2004, more museums had added their new Web site links to NZMuseums, but those
    numbers remained in the minority.</p>
  <p>In 2003, NSTP commissioned a report (Revero Web Specialists,
    2003) to examine the potential of expanding the Web site to include the hosting
    of information on collections, recognising the barriers for museums to utilise
    the Internet without seeding, or central, support. NSTP also sought feedback
    from the sector in terms of its relevance and priority for museums. Of twenty-six
    responses received, a total of 77% indicated that the further development of
    the NZMuseums Web site should be accorded a medium or high priority for
    investment by NSTP and the sector. A total of 85% of respondents indicated that
    they would like to add either a selection or all the items held in their
    collections databases to the site. A total of 46% of respondents indicated that
    they anticipated being able to add material to the site within the next three
    years.</p>
  <p>Although a small percentage of responses was received in
    2003, over the next two years, through the face to face out-reach work of NSTP
    throughout the country, as well as presentations on the subject at several
    museum conferences, it became clear that personnel working in the voluntary and
    small museum portion of the museum sector were eager to be involved, but still
    openly expressed a lack of comprehension of what could be done and lack of
    knowledge of how to be involved in such a project, with little comprehension of
    exactly what this project would mean for them in the long term. However, once
    they learned  more about the proposal, most were eager to somehow be involved, with
    support from NSTP.</p>
  <h2>What Defines A Small Museum In New Zealand?</h2>
  <p>Several benchmarks could be used, including staff levels,
    the proportion of volunteers to paid staff, and annual budgets, to indicate
    what a small museum is in New Zealand. The New Zealand Tourism Research
    Institute (NZTRI) at the Auckland University of Technology conducted a Web
    survey of museum staffing and funding (NZTRI, 2008). Of the 426 New Zealand
    museums invited to participate, 123 returned information on staffing levels. Of
    these, 80% had five or fewer full-time employees.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="rowe.fig3.jpg" alt="figure 3" width="495" height="319" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 3: Staffing levels in New Zealand museums</p>
  <p>With so many of the potential contributors to NZMuseums
    being small museums, it was important to identify problems facing them for the
    project. The NZMuseums solution provider (which was co-incidentally beginning
    work on a similar concept before answering the NSTP RFP) organised independent
    focus groups in February 2006 in three regions of the country. These were
    attended by representatives of 15 small to medium museums, as well as people
    working in the museum service industry. Each focus group took part in three
    hours of discussions.</p>
  <p>Several themes emerged:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Most of the museums depended upon volunteers, with nine
      institutions having more volunteers than paid staff. “When you’ve got
      volunteers working for you, they will change, so there is always someone new
      coming in &hellip; in a small museum it has to be easy otherwise a) they [the
      volunteers] get daunted &hellip; b) they change” (focus group attendee).</li>
    <li>The time and resources likely to be needed to undertake data
      entry and digitisation projects were a key concern. Small museums had little or
      no IT infrastructure and did not usually have the expertise to buy and maintain
      their own PCs. Support and training for the project was essential to small
      museums.</li>
    <li>Many of the smaller museums are located in remote areas of New
      Zealand. While the Government has been investing in Internet access, there are
      still many areas where connection is limited to dial-up.</li>
    <li>Many had reservations over providing public access to their
      collections on the Internet. Fears included possible copyright infringement, a
      reduction in physical visitor numbers, an increased risk of theft by the public
      as the holdings of the museum became more visible, and inappropriate comments
      or tags being added to records. “We still want them to come to the museum. We
      don’t just want them to sit at home and look at it on their screen” (focus
      group attendee).</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What Did The Museums Ask For?</h2>
  <p>As an outcome of the surveys, focus work and discussions
    with the sector, it was clear that museums wanted a site that would be simple,
    easy to contribute to - and one that did not require too much staff training.
    They were looking for training and ongoing support from NSTP regardless of the
    chosen solution. They also expected that the Web site would cater for key
    object information - what it is, where it is, where it came from (provenance,
    acquisition, field collection), and that any costs would be kept down, if the
    solution was not going to be completely free.</p>
  <h2>Benefits Of The Redevelopment Of NZMuseums</h2>
  <p>During 2004, on the basis of sector support for such a Web
    site, staff at Te Papa (a museum that is funded by central government) made a
    capital bid to government for funds to redevelop the Web site. This bid was for
    the complete re-design and build of the Web site, to be managed by Te Papa
    staff but designed and built by a contracted solution provider. In
    consideration of this bid, and to assist in marketing the concept to the
    sector, a list of benefits of the Web site upgrade to the museum sector was
    identified: it would</p>
  <ul>
    <li>reduce barriers to digitisation/achieving a Web presence (because
      in many cases without a collaborative approach, the barriers would have been
      insurmountable)</li>
    <li>provide a unified approach across the sector in line with best
      practice, global standards, and a long-term view of museum development</li>
    <li>eliminate duplication of effort: this site could also act as an on-line
      CMS</li>
    <li>become a simple entry point into simple digital collection
      management, in particular for small museums</li>
    <li>introduce great efficiencies to current collection management
      practices (often non-existent) and service levels for smaller museums</li>
    <li>provide greater promotion and visibility for museums, their
      collection information and taonga (treasures), nationally and internationally</li>
    <li>enable the placement of collections on-line at minimal cost and
      with very little expertise required</li>
    <li>give access to new on-line exhibition space to complement ‘bricks
      and mortar’ operations</li>
    <li>offer the opportunity to share ideas and resources across the
      sector and within regions. Building on the collaborative nature of the Web site
      will encourage information sharing between participants on Web design, metadata
      and image standards</li>
    <li>open up participation in wider sector and national level
      initiatives, thereby benefiting from collaboration between museums, libraries,
      archives, and other related organisations</li>
    <li>support the centralised coordination of approach, implementation,
      support and training through National Services Te Paerangi without losing the
      individuality of each museum’s unique collection.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Benefits to visitors to the site were identified as: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the provision of a single entry point for obtaining information
      on, and searching of, New Zealand museum collections</li>
    <li>enhanced access to collections held in New Zealand museums &ndash;
      ‘unlocking the treasures’</li>
    <li>increased self-service for information requests, and as a result,
      more focused research enquiries made to museums</li>
    <li>available previews of  museum collections prior to onsite visit</li>
    <li>new opportunities to incorporate material into arts education – nationally
      and internationally.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additionally, there were many significant benefits for
    National Services Te Paerangi, some of them identified as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>opportunity to provide direction and support to the sector in
      relation to a major strategic issue facing the sector, that of how to maximise
      the opportunities presented by the on-line environment for a sector that has
      limited expertise and resources for the on-line world</li>
    <li>opportunity to facilitate solution requirements and
      implementation that reflect the requirements of the widest range of institution
      types in terms of an on-line collections information facility</li>
    <li>facilitation of museums’ participation in sector and national
      level initiatives such as Matapihi, that many organisations would not otherwise
      be able to access</li>
    <li>greater opportunity to connect New Zealand museums with similar
      initiatives internationally</li>
    <li>promotion of the uptake of a common standards based-approach to
      collection management and digitisation</li>
    <li>centralised co-ordination and collaboration, necessary in
      projects of this scale</li>
    <li>enhancement of the image and credibility of the sector as a whole,
      bringing it into line with developments in library management</li>
    <li>enhancement of the offerings provided by the New Zealand Museums Web
      site, with focus marketing expenditure and efforts on one Web site address</li>
    <li>reduction of the likelihood of disparate solutions being adopted
      by individual museums, thereby potentially reducing the opportunities for on-line
      collaboration.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>National Level Initiatives: Matapihi, the New Zealand Digital Content
    Strategy, Digital Strategy 2.0 and Digital New Zealand</h2>
  <p>As noted in the section of benefits listed above, one
    benefit identified by this redevelopment was the opportunity for museums (small
    museums in particular) to participate in New Zealand’s wider sector and
    national level initiatives.</p>
  <p>Museums with no other access to the Web for their
    collections would be able to participate in Matapihi through the redeveloped
    NZMuseums. Matapihi is an initiative of the National Library of New Zealand and
    was launched in September 2004. Matapihi is described as a window on to the on-line
    collections of a number of cultural organisations. It lets you search across
    the digital collections of different New Zealand organisations from one Web
    site. By clicking on thumbnails, the user is referred to a larger version of
    the item on the Web site of the contributing organisation. Access to contribute
    to Matapihi is only enabled if a museum has collection items on its own Web
    site. (<a href="../http://www.matapihi.org.nz/">http://www.matapihi.org.nz/</a>)</p>
  <p>The re-development of NZMuseums would also bring the sector
    into line with the intended outcomes of the NZ Digital Content Strategy (also
    an initiative led by the National Library), which was launched in 2007 and
    aimed to make digital content more accessible to New Zealanders; by charting “a
    course for a content rich digital New Zealand where New Zealanders are actively
    engaged in creating, discovering, sharing, using content in a digital form”. 
    The Digital Content Strategy is a key initiative of the Government’s Digital
    Strategy.
    (<a href="../http://www.natlib.govt.nz/about-us/current-initiatives/nz-digital-content-strategy">http://www.natlib.govt.nz/about-us/current-initiatives/nz-digital-content-strategy</a>)</p>
  <p>The Digital Strategy is about all New Zealanders working
    together to make New Zealand a leader in the digital world and to create a
    prosperous, sustainable and vibrant society - smarter through digital. The
    Digital Strategy 2.0 was released on Thursday, 28 August, 2008, and is a
    response to the changes and challenges of a rapidly evolving digital world. Its
    purpose is to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>provide a national vision, supported by outcomes and goals for
      New Zealand’s digital development;</li>
    <li>highlight opportunities and challenges in the digital world; </li>
    <li>provide a call to action for all stakeholders to rise to the
      challenges and opportunities presented by the digital world; </li>
    <li>articulate clearly the government’s role in digital development </li>
    <li>outline the key actions through which government will fulfill its
      role in supporting digital development. (<a href="../http://www.digitalstrategy.govt.nz/">http://www.digitalstrategy.govt.nz/</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Digital New Zealand, a collaborative initiative funded by
    the New Zealand government and led by the National Library, was launched in
    December 2008, and aims to make New Zealand content easy to find, share and
    use. This includes content from government departments, publicly funded
    organisations, the private sector, and community groups. DigitalNZ will test
    new ways to create digital content, collect and share existing digital content,
    and build smart, freely available search and discovery tools. On the Web site,
    people can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>play with tools and experiences powered by DigitalNZ content</li>
    <li>find out about adding their digital content to DigitalNZ</li>
    <li>get advice on digital content creation and protection </li>
    <li>use the DigitalNZ API to access digital content to use in their
      own work.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>DigitalNZ grew out of the Digital Content Strategy (2007).
    It is designed to contribute directly to meeting the challenges identified in
    the areas of access and discovery, sharing and using, and managing and
    preserving digital content. (<a href="../http://www.digitalnz.org/">http://www.digitalnz.org/</a>).</p>
  <h2>Pilot Phase</h2>
  <p>Initially, once the project gained momentum in 2006/07, a
    pilot phase was considered, and museums were sought to take part. However, due
    to the length of time required to train and ready the sector and to produce the
    solution, (Vernon Systems Ltd (VSL), the solution provider, came on board in
    the first half of 2007), the pilot phase was waived in favour of concentrating
    on training and upskilling the sector across the board, to ready as many
    museums as possible for the launch in 2008.</p>
  <h2>What Do Small Museums Need In Order To Contribute to a National Web site?</h2>
  <h3>Promotion, outreach and training</h3>
  <p>From the beginning of 2006 onwards, NSTP maintained a
    concerted effort to promote the Web site re-development to the sector. At the
    Museums Aotearoa (MA) (the membership organisation for museums in New Zealand)
    Conference in early 2006 and 2008, presentations were given on the project, and
    in 2008 a short presentation on photography for the Web was provided after the
    presentation. The re-development was also presented on at the NDF Conference in
    2006 and 2007, and finally as a completed product in 2008.</p>
  <p>Regular e-alerts and e-newsletters were sent to the sector
    from NSTP as promotional tools for the redevelopment, as well as regular
    updates and information outlining the steps that should be taken to prepare
    material for the Web.</p>
  <p>Because stories and contextualisation (interpretation) of
    the collections to be featured were considered to be a significant feature on
    the new Web site (rather than having images of objects standing on their own),
    1-2 page information resources such as the 7-step plan Planning for digitisation
    – Putting a process in place to prepare your collection information for the new
    NZMuseums Web site  were placed on the NSTP Web site for the sector to refer
    to.
    (<a href="../http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/26E69400-38F2-4300-9B93-EBCDEF387648/0/Planningfordigitisationguide.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/26E69400-38F2-4300-9B93-EBCDEF387648/0/Planningfordigitisationguide.pdf</a>)</p>
  <p>The solution providers, Vernon Systems Ltd, were contracted
    to the project by mid 2007, and previously in late 2006 NSTP had employed new
    staff to work in the field as Museum Development Officers (MDO). During 2007
    and into 2008, the main task of the MDOs was to promote the concept of the
    re-development of NZMuseums to the smaller museums sector in particular, and to
    ensure that this sector was preparing objects and associated information for
    the future site.</p>
  <p>Thus, from the end of 2006 onwards, the new NSTP positions
    of Museum Development Officer were promoting the redevelopment to museums
    throughout the country, face-to-face, and encouraging the initial preparation
    of a minimum of 20 items for placement on the site. Many museums did not
    understand exactly what to do, or what they were doing it for, until they were
    shown screen-shots of mock-ups of the future site; these helped them to
    understand the concept, particularly how their images would be placed on-line
    and the associated information that should be provided.</p>
  <h3>On-line support</h3>
  <p>In line with the observation that the sector did not have
    full comprehension of the project and how to take part in it, an on-line forum
    was established by VSL in early 2008. This provided a simple way for the
    solution providers to answer the more technical questions coming from the
    sector, most of which could not be answered by NSTP staff who only had the
    conceptual know-how rather than the technical know-how
    (<a href="../http://forum.ehive.com/">http://forum.ehive.com</a>).</p>
  <h3>Overcoming other barriers</h3>
  <p>It was recognised very early on that there were several real
    barriers to involvement of the sector in the project. First, many small museums
    still did not have the knowledge required to confidently and correctly document
    their collection; thus many were attempting simply to number items for the Web
    site project. Clearly there was still considerable need for training on
    collection documentation. Therefore a nationwide programme of workshops on
    collection documentation, presented by collection managers from regional
    museums for the sector, was provided by NSTP.</p>
  <p>The second barrier to involvement was the perceived
    difficulty and lack of technical know-how required to photograph or scan museum
    collections for the Web. In order to manage this issue, NSTP staff first
    engaged in the relevant training themselves, arranging for and attending
    workshops on Digitisation, Scanning for the Web and Photography for the Web.
    Following closely, workshops on Collection Documentation, Digitisation, and
    Photography for the Web were provided for the sector throughout the country, to
    ensure skills and confidence rose while personnel were preparing collections
    for the new Web site. All training was provided regionally to groups of
    personnel from small museums in a geographical region. Discussions and
    vocalisation of concerns were encouraged at these regional groups, so that
    museums would work together on preparing material to go on-line and simultaneously
    share issues and ideas.</p>
  <p>During this time, in the lead-up to the site launch, museums
    had a deadline to prepare their material for the site. A manual uploading tool,
    in the form of a collection documentation spreadsheet, was created by the
    solution provider, and tested first by a small group of small museums’
    personnel. This was necessary initially because the on-line tool, eHive, was
    being built alongside the new NZMuseums site, and would not be ready in time to
    upload items to NZMuseums by its launch date in September 2008, (eHive, the on-line
    tool, was finally launched in December, 2008).</p>
  <p>Another major factor that had to be considered was the need
    to keep costs for involvement to a minimum, especially in light of the lack of
    financial resources available to the small museum sector.</p>
  <p>However, due to the nature of the arrangement between NSTP
    and VSL, which was that this project would be developed and then managed by a
    commercial provider rather than Te Papa staff, there was a requirement to cover
    costs incurred for administration and storage of data by VSL.  VSL came up with
    various competitive pricing options, which still allowed for a free option for
    those who wished to hold a minimum amount of information on-line (200 items)
    and not pay to use it as a full CMS. Various pricings were made available for
    numbers of collection items, and as an incentive, NSTP initially offered a
    grant to cover a free first year of licensing for any small mainly voluntary
    museum to put up to 1000 items on-line. Since launching, storage costs have dropped,
    thus allowing for the license to now cover storage of up to 2000 images. To
    date, there has been slow uptake of this offer, and many museums have chosen
    the free, up to 200 images, option.</p>
  <h2>Web site Overview</h2>
  <p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/"><img src="rowe.fig4.jpg" alt="figure 4" width="500" height="480" /></a></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 4: Home page of NZMuseums Web site
    <a href="../http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/">http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz</a></p>
  <p>VSL worked with a local Web site development company to
    finalise the overall structure for the site. Initial wireframes were laid out
    with the proposed sections. National Services Te Paerangi then conducted paper-based
    user testing on the wireframes with a small group of testers representing the
    age groups and backgrounds of potential users of the Web site: high school
    children, museum professionals and casual visitors, including the elderly.</p>
  <p>The key areas of the site are listed below.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Home page</b> – prominent
      search box, automatically generated list of the latest museum items posted, the
      latest new, blog and museum spotlight articles added</li>
    <li><b>Find museum</b> –
      directory of all New Zealand museums, including options to search by museum
      name, region or collection type</li>
    <li><b>Search</b> – more detailed
      search options to find museums, objects or events with generated lists of
      popular and recent searches</li>
    <li><b>Explore</b> – browse museums
      or objects by tags and objects by collection type</li>
    <li><b>News</b> – articles
      relating to the museum sector, including a feature on a different museum every
      two weeks</li>
    <li><b>About us</b> – a
      background about the Web site and its administrators</li>
    <li><b>Contact us</b> – contact
      information, including a free phone number to National Services Te Paerangi for
      assistance with the project.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each museum has its own profile page with a random sample of
    images of the collection and the museum. The object detail page gives the option
    for users to add tags or comments.</p>
  <h2>Content Sharing</h2>
  <p class="caption"><img src="rowe.fig5.jpg" alt="figure 5" width="500" height="330" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 5: Overview of how the NZMuseums and eHive Web sites
    fit together</p>
  <p>Each contributor has a personal account in the eHive
    collections management system through which to  assess all personal content,
    which may include records not published, and additional fields of private
    information the public cannot see, such as valuations and acquisition details. Users
    access their accounts via a secure login. Each museum can catalogue any number
    of objects, each of which can have one or more images linked to it. Images are
    resized into several smaller derivative sizes for use on the Web.</p>
  <p>NZMuseums exists as a community within eHive. Museums that
    have been approved to join the community (specifically, museums within New
    Zealand) are allowed to mark any number of object records as being part of the
    NZMuseums community. For NZMuseums members, their public objects are marked by
    default as also being part of the NZMuseums community, but they are able to
    change this default or remove any single object from just NZMuseums. Each
    object record additionally has a flag to indicate if it is publicly viewable.</p>
  <p>NSTP saw two advantages of having NZMuseums as a community
    within eHive. There were economies of scale with the solution as the cost was
    spread outside of New Zealand, and contributors had additional exposure for
    their collections through the eHive Web site.</p>
  <p>The NZMuseums Web site has its own branding and connects to
    eHive using an application programmable interface (API). The museums that
    belong to the community then appear in the <b>Find
    museum</b> directory of the NZMuseums Web site. Objects that are marked as
    being in the NZMuseums community are available within the <b>Search and Explore</b> sections of the NZMuseums Web site.</p>
  <h2>Technology</h2>
  <p>The project is built on well established affordable
    technology, including the LAMP solution stack (Linux operating system, Apache
    Web Server, MySQL database, PHP Web pages)
    (<a href="../http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)</a>) and Apache Lucene text
    indexing (<a href="../http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/">http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/</a>).</p>
  <p>When images are uploaded by the contributors, the Image
    Magick toolkit (<a href="../http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php</a>) is used to create
    several sizes of original image in JPEG format for Web use.</p>
  <p>The NZMuseums Web site is built on top of the Joomla content
    management system (<a href="../http://www.joomla.org/">http://www.joomla.org/</a>). This provides National Services Te
    Paerangi with on-line tools to add news articles and edit predominantly static
    areas of the site, such as <b>About us</b> and <b>Contact us.</b></p>
  <p>Vernon Systems is responsible for the technical
    administration of the NZMuseums Web site.  This is hosted on two identical
    servers for load balancing and redundancy. These servers reside in the United
    States as the costs for hosting in New Zealand are currently significantly
    higher than in the USA.</p>
  <h2>Support of Standards</h2>
  <p>There were several standards considered important for this
    project: the New Zealand Museums Standards Scheme, Spectrum museum data
    standard, Dublin Core metadata standard, and OAI-PHM data harvesting protocol.</p>
  <p>The New Zealand Museums Standards Scheme involves a self
    review and peer review. All museums that want to improve their practice as
    caretakers of New Zealand’s heritage are encouraged to participate in this
    voluntary scheme. It is founded on research into overseas standards schemes and
    consultation with the New Zealand museum sector. One of the aims of the
    Standards Scheme is to encourage all New Zealand museums to achieve accepted
    standards in managing their collections (Museum of New Zealand Te Papa
    Tongarewa, 2007). For the NZMuseums project, we looked at what cataloguing data
    could be captured to assist museums with meeting the standards described in the
    scheme, particularly the Care of Collections and Taonga module. The UK
    Collections Trust standard for collections management, Spectrum, was also
    consulted before we finalised the list of cataloguing fields
    (<a href="../http://www.mda.org.uk/stand">http://www.mda.org.uk/stand</a>).</p>
  <p>We also needed to assess how the NZMuseums Web site would
    fit in with the portal site for New Zealand libraries, archives and museums &ndash;
    Matapihi (<a href="../http://www.matapihi.org.nz/">http://www.matapihi.org.nz</a>). Matapihi currently has images from the
    collections of 17 larger New Zealand institutions. The contribution process
    works by sending the administrators, National Digital Library, an XML file with
    records in Dublin Core metadata format. Images for the site only exist on the
    contributing institution’s own Web server, with the Matapihi search result
    pages serving the image content from the external Web servers of the many
    contributors. NZMuseums provides an opportunity for smaller museums to be part
    of Matapihi as they now have images on a live Web site. VSL is now developing
    the remaining requirement to support Matapihi: the export from NZMuseums of
    selected content to Dublin Core based XML. In the cataloguing screens the
    Dublin Core Type field was set to be required so that all cataloguing records
    have the correct resource type indicated (e.g. still image, physical object,
    text, moving image).</p>
  <p>There are also digital projects in New Zealand which rely on
    the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting. This protocol
    allows for the periodic harvesting of data for use in another application or Web
    site. Support for this was not included in the first phase of the NZMuseums
    project but has been scheduled for later in 2009.</p>
  <h2>Problems and Solutions</h2>
  <h3>Communication</h3>
  <p>The National Services Te Paerangi section of the Te Papa Web
    site was used to log progress and store documents available to contributors.
    The bi-monthly National Services e-mail based newsletter goes to most museums
    in the country and includes information about training, project progress and
    related events. A wiki-based Help site and a support forum were established to
    streamline answering help questions.</p>
  <h3>Getting the content in</h3>
  <p>What content would be in the site at the launch date? Was it
    acceptable to have no content at launch, but then to encourage contributors to
    use the new on-line tools? It was decided that it was essential to get as much
    content as possible collected for the Web site ready for the launch date, and
    VSL needed to find a way to do this. With development of the on-line tools only
    just beginning, it was necessary to find an interim approach. VSL had to
    support multiple original data sources, including paper catalogue cards,
    spreadsheets and existing collections management systems from several different
    vendors.</p>
  <p>They settled on using an Excel spreadsheet specific to the project’s
    needs. This provided a stepping stone between the existing systems and the
    project’s collection management system; it provided a way for sites without
    existing electronic data to catalogue their records. The spreadsheet performed
    basic validation and supported a relational structure with acquisition source,
    maker, storage location and place information split into separate sheets.
    Dropdown fields ensured consistent content for fields such as Dublin Core
    Resource Type, and the separate sheet for person information was used to format
    person names in a consistent way. Images were referenced by folder path and
    filename. <b>Help</b> and <b>example</b> records were included in the
    spreadsheet, and a short document was supplied with the spreadsheet outlining
    how it worked and giving advice on the organisation of image files.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="rowe.fig6.jpg" alt="figure 6" width="500" height="283" /></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 6: Excel spreadsheet for initial contributions to
    NZMuseums prior to the Web site launch</p>
  <p>Completed spreadsheets with images were sent to the project
    team for import into the developing system. A Visual Basic function generated
    an XML file containing all of the data in each spreadsheet. A function for the Web
    site was built that imported the XML data and automatically created image
    derivatives (copies) in several standardised smaller formats for use in various
    sections of the Web site.</p>
  <p>Some of the museums with existing systems exported data into
    spreadsheet format and then cut and pasted columns from their spreadsheet into
    the project spreadsheet, with a project spreadsheet providing a stepping stone
    between the original CMS data structure and the NZMuseums data structure.</p>
  <p>The process worked well, but most of the contributors needed
    some advice along the way. In hindsight, this could have been streamlined with
    earlier introduction of a Web-based wiki or forum as the focal point for
    answering questions about what to do.</p>
  <p>Once the Web site launched, data entry directly into the
    collection management system became an alternative method for getting content
    in. Museums can create pick lists based on their own terminology. VSL also
    negotiated rights to include the Taonga Māori Thesaurus as a built-in classification
    system. This is widely used in New Zealand for classifying Māori treasures and
    supports the use of Te Reo Māori (the Māori language) in classifications.</p>
  <h3>Addressing institutional fears</h3>
  <p>Several of the contributors had reservations about opening
    up their data for the public to add tags and comments. The use of public
    tagging at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney to aid content discovery (Chan,
    2008) helped to provide a precedent that contributors could relate to. We added
    an option for contributors to disable public tagging and comments on their own
    records, but so far all contributors have kept these options enabled.</p>
  <p>Image theft was also a concern. Contributors are able to
    watermark images prior to sending them to the project team. Public access was
    also limited to only the derivates used on the Web pages and not to the
    original images. We are investigating using Creative Commons as a way of
    providing a set of standard rights that contributors can assign to individual
    records to make it clearer how subsets of content can be re-used.</p>
  <p>Another fear was that putting content on-line would either
    reduce physical visitor numbers or result in a quantity of enquiries that could
    not be dealt with. The counter argument was that the on-line presence provided
    a way to engage a wider, more diverse audience, including those for whom a
    physical visit would be impossible. The site helps to make the collection more
    accessible to researchers and acts as an advertisement for the institution
    through the media of the Web. The Web site also provides a place for each
    museum to more publicly state what its policy is on loans and enquiries, and it
    encourages the museums to build better processes and policies around these.</p>
  <h3>Resource and training issues</h3>
  <p>For some of the museums, this project provided the incentive
    to catalogue a part of their collection for the first time. To assist with
    this, as previously stated, National Services Te Paerangi provides a programme
    of digitisation and photography workshops, and this programme was initiated as
    part of this project. Contributors felt they want to get things right and
    provide actual and full detail about the objects they were cataloguing. Some
    undertook considerable research during the cataloguing project. They were asked
    for a minimum of 20 items per contributing museum, and this apparently small
    request provided quite a challenge for some.</p>
  <p>Many of the smaller voluntary museums are still without
    computers or a fast Internet connection, if they have an Internet connection at
    all. To help reach more of these museums we have plans to print paper-based
    forms to match the data entry screens. These could then be entered at a
    regional hub meeting. The South Otago region in the South Island includes many
    museums without Internet connections, and a group of these museums is helping
    with the development of the paper-based forms.</p>
  <p>VSL is also considering an off-line module (a
    database-driven replacement to the original spreadsheet) that would allow
    contributors to do basic cataloguing off-line, maintain their own local
    repository for their collection records, and then periodically upload this to
    the Web-based collections management system.</p>
  <h2>Example Contributors</h2>
  <p>Raglan Museum and Taranaki Aviation Transport and Technology
    Museum (TATATM), both in the North Island of New Zealand, are typical examples
    of many of the contributors to the site. </p>
  <p>Roslyn Miles, Administrator, Raglan Museum, wrote about her
    experience with the project:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">The Raglan Museum is a small museum which holds the
    collections of a small seaside town in the Waikato area of New Zealand. Staffed
    by volunteers and 1 part-time employee on project work, the museum is only open
    to the public for a few hours over the weekends.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">The history of this area is vast and spans from early Maori
    civilization through to Missionary and Settler activity from the 1830’s and
    beyond. You can read more about this history on our NZMuseums homepage.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/index.php?option=com_nstp&amp;task=showAccountDetail&amp;accountIdSet=3015"><img src="rowe.fig7.jpg" alt="figure 7" width="500" height="562" border="0" /></a></p>
  <p class="caption">Fig 7: Raglan Museum home page on NZMuseums

  <p class="BlockQuote">[The project] tied in with our current objective of
    digitising and cataloguing all of our artefacts into museum software
    PastPerfect 4.0. In theory, it was going to be easy as pie. In reality, it
    proved to be a bit of a nightmare, as I was only just getting started on our
    digitising journey and we simply didn’t have the information needed to complete
    the excel spreadsheet fields which were required. I found myself wishing Te
    Papa had announced this new Web site in a years’ time, and by then I would have
    researched the artefacts and would be ready to roll with the project.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">On the other hand, by using the NZMuseums Web site as
    motivation, we narrowed our selection down to 100 artefacts, took the digital
    photographs, and researched what we could in the time available. It was
    difficult to foresee how the information would look on-line, but thanks to the
    patience and guidance of the people of the project team we were able to
    complete the project within the deadline.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Overall we have found the NZMuseums Web site to be very
    useful, and a great way to display our collections to a much wider audience.
    Local people have shown more interest since having seen their museum on the
    Internet, and tourists are able to access it ahead of their stay in our seaside
    town. Researchers interested in topics specific to our area also find it
    useful. I particularly like the interactive nature of it as I have had people
    query the objects, and this can lead to a deeper understanding of an artefact,
    or a recognition of its worth, or an ancestral connection.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Now, over time, we will be able to add further artefacts,
    and this will more completely tell the stories of Raglan/Whaingaroa area and
    its people.</p>
  <p>TATATM is run solely by volunteers with a working group of
    about 10 people, mostly retirees. Trevor Creagh, representing TATATM, made
    these comments:</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">When I first heard about the NZMuseums proposed Web site my
    immediate reaction was, the existing museum records are not sufficiently
    accurate, what information does the museum have that would be useful on such a Web
    site and how can suitable photographs be provided?</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">I missed an earlier seminar about digitisation so almost
    gave the idea away. I admit that it was only regular emails from NSTP that
    prompted me to enthuse other members that TATATM should make some attempt to be
    one of the museums with some information for the launch of the proposed Web
    site. NSTP asked for a minimum of 20 items so we stuck with that number.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">Obstacles for TATATM included building a white hardboard
    backdrop for photographing objects and creating an object numbering system as
    no existing system was in use.</p>
  <p class="BlockQuote">It is easy to take a photograph but then to add the other
    information is the time consuming part. The first few items chosen were unique
    to TATATM, designed and manufactured locally. These ‘ice breakers’ whetted the
    appetite and research and / or stories about each item gained momentum. The
    learning curve was more vertical than steep. Those involved with the research
    are justly proud of the achievement.</p>
  <p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.nzmuseums.co.nz/index.php?option=com_nstp&amp;task=dofindAllAccountRecords&amp;searchAccountId=3328"><img src="rowe.fig8.jpg" alt="figure 8" width="450" height="366" /></a></p>

  <p class="BlockQuote">It is not easy to measure the success of being included in
    such a Web site; there is no ‘yardstick’ to compare with. The museum has, since
    the Web site launch, had an increase in visitor numbers. This could be by
    chance or good fortune, it may be some years before the true result is known.
    Having completed 20 items TATATM is targeting a further 30 for 2009. It is not
    just 30 pictures; they will include information that advises Internet users
    that TATATM has amongst its collection items that place the museum on a ‘must
    visit’ list while in Taranaki.</p>
  <p>Both of these examples highlight the need for regular
    communication with the contributors and the need to set achievable goals for
    the volume of data and images that volunteer-run museums are expected to
    provide to such a project.</p>
  <h2>Usage Of The Redeveloped Site</h2>
  <p>The redeveloped NZMuseums Web site launched in September
    2008. Access to the collections management system for contributors to add further
    content was launched in December 2008.</p>
  <p>Currently 385 Museum have profile pages on the site giving
    the main details about their institution: where they are, how to contact them,
    a summary of their collections and a selection of general images of the museum
    building and/or its galleries. Of these, 53 have so far uploaded or entered on to
    the Web site, catalogue records and associated images. Contributors were
    encouraged to always include an image of the object, and as a result 99% of the
    object records have at least one associated image, and 4% have two or more
    images.</p>
  <p>The larger museums in New Zealand all have existing
    collections management systems, and most have selections of their collection
    available on-line. This has made it much easier for these museums to contribute
    to NZMuseums and is reflected by the proportion of larger museums on the site.
    Of the 53 current contributors, 33 can be classed as small museums. </p>
  <p>In the project planning, National Services Te Paerangi aimed
    to get 20 museums on board for the launch. The end result is higher than
    anticipated, so it is wonderful to have 33 small museums already represented,
    with more joining the NZMuseums community every month. The most important
    factor in this success has been the ongoing communication with the sector, both
    through the central coordination of Te Papa’s National Services Te Paerangi,
    and through ongoing technical support to contributors from VSL, the solution
    provider.</p>
  <p>Around 500 tags have so far been added to the initial 2,600
    records. There have been no inappropriate tags added, and this has been very
    encouraging. Comments have helped discover more information about some of the
    objects, particularly past provenance of local history items.</p>
  <p>In the first three months the site had 13,000 visits with
    100,000 page views. All pages are discoverable by search engines, and this is
    continuing to drive visitors to the site. Anecdotal evidence from many of the
    contributors points to museum visitors discovering museums they were not aware
    of through the new site, and that physical visitor numbers in turn are up.</p>
  <h2>Future Plans</h2>
  <p>There were many ideas in the project plans for what could be
    done with the data. It was decided to concentrate first on the minimum set of
    features that were required for the initial launch and then add additional
    features gradually after this.</p>
  <p>The main planned extensions to the Web site are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>build Virtual Exhibitions – allow museums or the general public
      to group objects from many collections in a virtual exhibition</li>
    <li>catalogue Sites – record details about historic, archaeological
      and specimen collection sites</li>
    <li>plot Museum locations on Google Maps</li>
    <li>integrate with the NZLive Web site for event information
      (exhibitions, public programmes, lectures)</li>
    <li>provide RSS feeds for subsets of collection items by institution,
      object type or date added</li>
    <li>write a story – Provide an area for broader narratives that link
      to the specific records and images within the Web site</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>What do small museums need to contribute to a national Web
    site project?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Give ample warning about the project and keep in touch through
      updates on a regular basis via electronic and face-to-face means</li>
    <li>Set realistic goals. The minimum contribution of 20 catalogue
      records and images was already a challenging start for many of the volunteer-run
      museums</li>
    <li>Keep things simple. The Excel spreadsheet for the data provided
      an entry point for museums with little computer knowledge and no fast Internet
      connection</li>
    <li>Keep costs down. Offering free entry was essential for some of
      the contributors</li>
    </ul>
  <p>What builds a strong foundation for the site?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encourage public involvement. The data available is already being
      enriched by enlarging the audience, helping others to discover it, and
      increasing the custodians’ knowledge of what they hold.</li>
    <li>Provide functionality to support the reuse of data in other
      projects. Work still needs to be done on support for OAI-PHM harvesting of
      Dublin Core metadata and the use of Creative Commons to allow the data to be
      automatically reused in other New Zealand digital projects.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For the first time there is a national portal to collections
    held by the many small museums around New Zealand. The content can be organised
    into sets that break out of traditional museum boundaries. The foundations are
    in place for a site that will continue to grow despite a limited budget for
    both National Services Te Paerangi and the museum sector.</p>
