		<h4 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h4>
		<p class="AbstractText">An increasingly broad cross-section of museums have
        created channels on YouTube, posting videos that range from marketing messages
        to educational content to special events and the creations of museum visitors
        themselves. The Science Centre began a pilot project of creating and posting
        science communication videos to YouTube in October, 2006. It now has 18
        separate channels on YouTube alone and more than 1300 subscribers. But we have a
        nagging question: how can on-line video spark physical visits and deeper
        engagements at, and with, our science centre? YouTube itself suggested an
        answer in the spontaneous emergence of large-scale in-person gatherings of site
        users called meetups in 2007. We decided to host a
        2008 Meetup at the Toronto Science Centre. This paper
        explores what we observed at the event, analyzes the video content produced by
        participants and its potential impact on the Science Centre&rsquo;s profile and
        mission, and suggests opportunities for collaboration between a network of
      museums and their YouTube audiences through a next generation of meetups.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>If you&rsquo;re pondering new audiences for science centers,
        there&rsquo;s nothing like watching a guy with a green face and a black cape dancing
        next to a ferrofluid piano exhibit to expand your
      thinking.</p>
      <p>On YouTube, the man in the cape is a video blogger from
        Pennsylvania who hosts something called &ldquo;The Mo Show.&rdquo; But at the opening night
        party for the 888TorontoMeetup (888) at the Ontario Science Centre (OSC), Toronto,
        he became the physical embodiment (and quite an embodiment it was) of a virtual
      community.</p>

      <p>When we first began uploading to YouTube in 2006, our
        objective was to explore opportunities for engaging people with science and
        technology in an emerging social media space where millions were creating,
        sharing and responding to each other&rsquo;s work. From a single video-sharing site,
        our experiment has grown to uploading videos to 19 different sites &ndash; from Atom
        Uploads, to Exposure CBC, to Yahoo! Canada Video &ndash; and more than 5 million
      views of more than 340 OSC-produced videos.</p>
      <p>The idea for meetups came from
        YouTube itself. Significant meetups have been held so
      far in cities from San Francisco to New York, to Atlanta, to Chicago.</p>
      <p>The meetup we held at the Science
        Centre on August 8, 2008 (the 888 Toronto Meetup) drew
        participants from as far afield as Australia, Argentina, the UK and the US, but
        also drew a large, and youthful, local contingent. To our knowledge it was the
        first meetup held at and organized by a science
      museum, and the largest to date, with more than 460 participants. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Some 460 YouTubers &ndash; from as far
        away as Argentina, Australia, and the United Kingdom, and as nearby as the
        couple from two blocks over who&rsquo;d never visited the OSC before &ndash; attended on
        August 8, 2008. Previous research (Alexander et al., 2008) strongly suggests
        that having a video-content presence on YouTube is not enough on its own to
        drive traffic, physical or virtual, to a museum. And there&rsquo;s convincing
        evidence (Bernstein, 2008) to suggest that visitor-created content can be more
        compelling, and fit better with the dynamic of the YouTube community, than
        content produced by the museum alone. Our experience of &nbsp;888 resonates with these
        findings, and suggests that it&rsquo;s worth exploring further meetups &ndash; and meetup collaborations among museums &ndash; to engage
      new audiences in new ways.</p>
      <h2>Why a Meetup?</h2>
      <p>When the OSC began posting videos on YouTube in October
        2006, our idea was to explore opportunities for engaging people with science in
        an emerging on-line space where millions were creating, sharing, and responding
        to each other&rsquo;s work. Since then, the influence of that emerging online space on
        both on-line culture and the world beyond the Web has only grown more profound.
        An increasing portion of the 10 hours of video uploaded every minute of every
        day to YouTube is focused on &ldquo;unfiltered&rdquo; news and politics (Grove, 2008), producing
        a double-echo chamber of Web-produced content getting aired on mainstream TV
        and fleeting mainstream TV moments getting an extended life through
        redistribution on on-line channels &ndash; with activists everywhere recognizing
        citizen-produced, Web-distributed video as the ultimate testimony (Naim, 2007). Educators are increasingly looking to
        YouTube&rsquo;s potential as both a tool for publicizing research and an on-line
        video archive with thousands of hours of footage for use in lectures (Micolich, 2008).&nbsp; Little wonder that YouTube has evolved beyond its origins as a video
        hosting and sharing site to become a bona fide search tool (Helft,
        2009). In November 2008, the 146 million Americans who watched videos on-line conducted
        nearly 2.8 billion searches on YouTube, about 200 million more than on Yahoo &ndash;
        long ranked the No. 2 search engine after Google. &nbsp;Americans viewed 34% more on-line videos in November 2008
      compared to a year ago (www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?press=2660).</p>
      <p>For our part, we&rsquo;ve amassed more than 5 million views of
        OSC-produced videos on 19 different video-sharing sites, with YouTube owning
      the lion&rsquo;s share of our video traffic. </p>
      <p>But we&rsquo;ve had nagging questions.</p>
      <p>How could all this on-line activity drive physical visits
        and deeper engagements at, and with, our science center? How could we become a
        catalyst and partner in the rapidly-evolving social media activities of our
      publics?</p>
      <p>YouTube itself suggested an answer in the spontaneous
        emergence of user gatherings in 2007. Meetups held in
        cities from San Francisco to New York to Atlanta to Chicago inspired audiovisual
        designer Kathy Nicholaichuk &ndash; who as &ldquo;videochick770&rdquo;
      is the chief YouTube persona of the OSC &ndash; to create a meetup channel around which a community quickly coalesced. (<a href="../http://ca.youtube.com/888torontomeetup">http://ca.youtube.com/888torontomeetup</a>).</p>
      <p>The personal relationships formed between videochick770 and other YouTubers from around the world were key to making
        888 happen. The group used Web 2.0 tools such as Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr
        to collectively communicate about and assist in organizing 888, before, during
        and after the event. A Stickam feed during the
        kick-off party streamed live video, enabling others from around the world who
        couldn&rsquo;t attend to talk to the YouTubers on our
        floor. Within the OSC, the branding issues inherent in investing the Centre&rsquo;s
        identity in individual staffers who might leave or not fully represent
        institutional goals are the subject of serious debate. But to quote Shelley
      Bernstein of the Brooklyn Museum:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">This idea of getting to know the
        person who is administering the Museum&rsquo;s page is critical when representing an
        institution on a social networking site. It is fundamental to being part of a
      community, rather than operating for the sake of marketing or public relations.</p>
      <p>Yet with all the personal relationships and shared community
        effort, hosting 888 wasn&rsquo;t simple or cheap. We calculated the cost to pull it
        all together &ndash; including staff time in the months before the event working with
        the YouTube community &ndash; at more than $43,000 CAD, or about $95 per attendee. The
        effort required coordination across the Science Centre: from the hiring of a DJ
        and paid-duty police officers to check bags at the meetup kick-off party, to media promotion, audio-visual support and hosts to interact
        with and do science demos for meetup participants. So
      we&rsquo;ve been asking ourselves a few questions.</p>

      <h2>Who Came and What Did They Do?</h2>
      <p>Half the 132 attendees we surveyed at the kick-off party were
        under 19, and most were local. (We suspect the total proportion of
        international visitors, and visitors older than 19, was higher than shown in
        the survey, with many skipping the official evening kick-off party to get
        together in smaller groups.) More than a third of those surveyed had never
        visited the OSC, and about two-thirds came with friends or family. YouTube
        itself, along with word-of-mouth, was the overwhelmingly dominant source of information
      about the event for participants.</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 5: Sources of information about the 888MeetUp for
      participants </p>
      <p>We estimate at least 1,000 videos were produced around the
        event (<a href="../http://ca.youtube.com/user/888archive">http://ca.youtube.com/user/888archive</a>),
        which featured performances by famous and not-so-famous YouTubers,
        along with a free run of our exhibit floor for those who pre-registered. We
        analyzed 100 videos in detail: 70 were &ldquo;social,&rdquo; featuring purely personal
        interactions and reflections of participants, and 29 were &ldquo;marketing/promotional,&rdquo;
        prominently featuring the OSC and its offerings. One video &ndash; a nine-minute
        meditation on culture, community, and technology selected for YouTube&rsquo;s
        &ldquo;education&rdquo; category &ndash; fit a remaining category we called &ldquo;science
      communication.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="Vonappen.fig6.jpg" alt="figure 6" width="445" height="301" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 6: Classification of 888MeetUp participant-produced
      video content </p>
      <p>Clearly, meetup participants were
        first and foremost interested <i>in each
          other</i>. The OSC was the context, not the star. Videos that showcased the meetup-as-party/science center-as-party-place positioned us
        as a cool place for young adults to hang out, and that&rsquo;s an audience we&rsquo;d like
        to grow. How does that image fit with our core audiences? (In our case, that&rsquo;s families
        with kids.) Savvy on-line visitors may be able to distinguish between the
        different contexts of different audiences, but that&rsquo;s still a question any
      science center, museum or art gallery considering holding a meetup should ask &ndash; and given YouTube&rsquo;s ubiquitous reach, a meetup could be considered no matter where you are. </p>
      <h2>What&rsquo;s the Impact? </h2>
      <p>We estimate print, radio, and TV coverage of the 888 event
        reached a potential audience of more than 2.3 million. Does this constitute
        cheap marketing? The question is more complex than it might first appear.
        Viewed through the marketing metric of&nbsp; CPM (cost per thousand impressions), the meetup was <i>not</i> cost effective &ndash; in fact, the
        OSC could have purchased advertising inserts in a Toronto commuter newspaper
        for around half the CPM we &ldquo;paid&rdquo; in staff costs and other support for the coverage
        we gained of the event. And while YouTube video views of the event will
        continue to increase over time, growing in hard-to-predict ways based on video
        responses created after the fact, that traffic is not &ldquo;geo-targeted&rdquo;. From an
        attendance/revenue perspective, a family in north Toronto has a higher value for
      us than an 18-year-old in Taipei checking us out on-line.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, we know the youth
        audience attracted by 888 is not attracted by our traditional advertising or
        offerings. What&rsquo;s the &ldquo;right&rdquo; price for a science center to pay to
        attract, and potentially retain, a new teen or 20-something visitor? The
      question remains open.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the 100 videos we analyzed had drawn more than
        880,000 views and 13,800 comments within a few weeks of 888. Feedback from
        participants themselves was overwhelmingly positive - a few said it changed
      their lives forever. &nbsp;</p>

      <p>Further, we&rsquo;ve observed that newbie YouTubers,
        especially teens, rapidly develop video skills as they look for better ways to
        create and communicate. They explore technology and they innovate. Those are
        exactly the kind of skills, attitudes, and behaviors we&rsquo;re trying to grow in
      our visitors. </p>
      <p>Young, social media-savvy visitors are future movers and
        shakers who will lead and support science centers, museums and galleries (or
        not, depending on our perceived relevance). We want to engage this group &ndash; being
      a meeting place is a start. </p>

      <h2>What&rsquo;s Next? </h2>
      <p>Perhaps the most frequently asked question at 888 was: what
        about 999? The desire for continued connection between the participants was,
        and is, palpable. But we don&rsquo;t think a simple sequel in Toronto would cut it &ndash;
        for participants, or for the OSC. With the novelty factor of simply hosting a meetup past, we believe future meetups should take us into new territory. We&rsquo;re examining ways to attract young YouTubers to participate in ongoing Friday night programs
        for teens at the OSC. And we&rsquo;re exploring the idea of collectively creating the
        first globally networked meetup, hosted at multiple locations
        and institutions. (You can join the conversation at: <a
href="../http://ca.youtube.com/user/999globalevent">http://ca.youtube.com/user/999globalevent</a>.)
        Those who participate will be heeding the call for the risk-taking &ldquo;suck it and
        see&rdquo; attitude towards Web 2.0 called for by Gail Durbin of the Victoria and
        Albert Museum (Durbin, 2008), supported by the learning theories cited by David
        Greenfield of Loyola Marymount University (Greenfield, 2008) in which
      communities of learners create narratives to assist their learning: </p>
      <p>Empowering individuals to create
        and share their narratives fosters a greater involvement in museums by the
        global community and can only assist us as museum professionals to continue
      creatively to do our work.</p>
      <p>Finally, YouTubers form one on-line
        community that offers a physical fit for museums, but they&rsquo;re by no means the only
        one. Who are your local alpha bloggers? What on-line hobby groups fit your
        exhibit offerings? Does your town have a critical mass of artists or
        photographers who&rsquo;d find it intriguing to blur the lines between art, technology,
        and science at an informal meetup event &ndash; with an
      associated wiki and Flickr group?</p>
      <p>Museum consultant Nina Simon, who followed the development
        of 888 on-line, nails this concept in a recent blog post titled &ldquo;New Models for
        Community Partnerships: Museums Hosting Meetups&rdquo; (<a href="../http://www.museumtwo.blogspot.com/">http://www.museumtwo.blogspot.com</a>),
      and in the spirit of valuing the virtual, she&rsquo;ll get the last word:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">&nbsp;People who engage deeply in any online community,
        whether a bulletin board or social networking site, want to meet in person. Right now, they are primarily meeting in commercial spaces &ndash; restaurants and
        bars &ndash; which benefit from their business and their buzz. If museums get
        involved in these online-offline partnerships, we can bring new audiences
        through our doors, familiarize them with museum-going in a comfortable way, and reap the benefits of their online musings about their
      real-life experiences.</p>
