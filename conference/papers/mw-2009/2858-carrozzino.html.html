      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The widening availability of Internet access and the
        associated increase in bandwidth are not only making the Web accessible to more
        people, but also making possible the development of large multimedia datas set
        once available only through physical media like DVDs. In parallel, people are
        becoming more confident in the use of hypertext and hypermedia concepts as
        introduced by Web Browsers. The browsing paradigm has not changed much in
        recent years, apart from the adoption of tabbed browsing to follow in parallel different
        topics of interest, and the use of mouse gestures, which anyway is still not
      common and effective</p>
      <p>Information related to Cultural Heritage is complex both in
        terms of structure of relationships among the various entities, and in terms of
        the underlying media. Its access is therefore often made difficult by the
        limitations of the means, and may often require an intense browsing of the
      hypermedia. </p>
      <p>A possible alternative is to present the same information in
        an immersive way, allowing the user to navigate in the information using the
        paradigm of virtual environments. The focus of this work lies in the use of immersive systems for content
          fruition, using the Information Landscapes metaphor of visualization, which is
          based on the abstract presentation of information in three-dimensional space.
          The aim of this type of virtual environment is to place the users directly
          inside the information and to allow them to navigate around in order to improve
          their understanding and learning processes. A typical Information Landscape
          maps semantic relationships among data into spatial relationships. Although the
          classical hyperlink metaphor can still be used, the presence of a well designed
          spatial organization allows users to access information also by means of free
          or semi-guided navigation. Until a few years ago, this would have relegated the
          use of ILs to a niche audience. However, the spread of videogames and on-line
          virtual worlds like Second Life has brought 3D interaction metaphors closer to
          the general public which, nowadays, is mature enough to use this kind of
      interface also to access information.</p>
      <h2>Related Work</h2>
      <p>
      The design of a Virtual Heritage system is based on
      concepts similar to the creation of a real Virtual Museum with the addition of
      increased flexibility provided by virtual space and by the introduction of
      interactivity. If the VE is the virtual representation of an actually existing
      environment, it is sufficient to digitize it using techniques based on
      photography or 3D scanning. However, it may happen that the physical object is
      no longer present, or only partially existing, or, in any case, that it is impossible
      to digitally acquire it. In this case it is necessary to make very accurate
      surveys in order to collect the data needed for the manual modeling of the
      environment. &nbsp;Nevertheless, as Virtual
      Reality is not necessarily anchored to the physical reality, it can make use of
      3D environments that are &nbsp;completely synthetic. In this case the VE is a completely
      self-sufficient original environment which can be either realistic or even
      totally abstract.      </p>
      <p>
      Whatever the choice, the Virtual Environment must
      be designed around a metaphor of visualization, navigation and interaction of
      the environment itself. In the context of abstract Virtual Environment, there
      are various types of metaphors, and many of them have been adopted from the
      area of scientific visualization, with the objective of addressing the problem of
      displaying large informative spaces (Andrews, 1995). Several metaphors can be
      found in literature, like the Perspective Wall (Mackinlay, 1991),
      the Web Book (Card, 1996) or the Cone Trees (Card, 1991). Other approaches have
      investigated the presentation of standard 2D Web pages projected into 3D space,
      like WebVRI (Barsoum, 2008).      </p>
      <p>
      The metaphor of Information Landscapes (Small,
      1996; Sparacino, 2000) allows integrating information-based environments, like
      the ones used in scientific visualization, with the immersive features of
      Virtual Environments. In the context of Information Landscapes, the content is
      presented and adapted using concepts borrowed from typography 0and
      immersive systems.      </p>
      <p>
      The term &ldquo;Information Landscape&rdquo; was coined by
      Muriel Cooper (1994), founder of the Visible Language Workshop within the MIT
      Media Laboratory. It describes a Virtual Environment where text information is
      wrapped onto surfaces placed in a 3D space and which the user can navigate
      while keeping full perception of the context. The first notable feature
      distinguishing Information Landscapes from conventional VEs is that in an IL
      the most important virtual entities are the text surfaces, which constitute
      also the portions of the virtual space that the user is enabled to interact
      with. Unlike a conventional VE, whose constituting objects may represent a more
      or less realistic replica of real objects, in an IL, the main elements are
      groups of text placed in the space.      </p>
      <p>
      David Small (1996) used the metaphor of <i>constellation</i> in order to indicate the
      visual effect generated by one of the possible bunches of text represented in
      an IL, observed by a natural distance at the beginning of the navigation.      </p>
      <p>
      It is possible to exploit the impressive graphical
      performances of modern computer architectures in order to manage even huge
      amount of information and present in an easy and friendly way the entire
      structure of the body of the text, allowing users to immediately identify the
      parts they are interested in. This produces a real visual interaction with the
      text being represented, with the added value of the perception of its spatial
      location within the whole context of the body of the text, opportunely placed
      in the 3D world. In an IL, the user can move from one surface to another,
      choosing free, not previously defined trajectories, or following pre-defined
      paths designed by the IL author. When moving close to a surface, the user can
      read the related text and, at the same time, call additional notes or
      information linked to other surfaces.      </p>
      <p>
      The main features of an Information Landscape are:      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the three-dimensional text layout</li>
        <li>the possibility of correlating and linking other
          text sections, either depending on the user interest, or in an automated way</li>
        <li>the process of interaction between users and the
          landscape</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of these features must be designed, managed and aimed to
        ensure the high emotional involvement of the user, to keep the time needed to
        search and extract information into reasonable limits, and, finally, to involve
        the user in a pleasant experience, from both an aesthetic and a functional
      perspective.</p>
      <h2>Designing Information
      Landscapes</h2>
      <p>
      One of the strengths of this type of system comes also
      from the possibility of semi-automatically building the environment from semantic
      information extracted from data (Ruffaldi, 2004; Gutierrez, 2005). However,
      there is a strong design component that needs to be addressed directly by the IL
      author who has the job of identifying the appropriate information layout, depending
      on the topic and on the message that has to be delivered.      </p>
      <p>
      The design of an Information Landscape starts from the
      selection of the general layout of the landscape itself. This means that the
      designer should define not only how the information is presented and placed in
      the virtual environment, but also which interaction paradigm is adopted for the
      navigation and the content fruition.      </p>
      <h3>Layout</h3>
      <p>
        The spatial layout describes how the logic
        structure of the information is mapped into a spatial representation. Each
        layout defines how the information is displayed and, in particular, it defines
        a logical coordinate system that is mapped into the spatial coordinate system.
        In addition, every layout describes the type of interaction associated with the
        entities and the boundaries for the visualization of the contained elements.      </p>
        <p>
        Among the possible ones, we identified these main
        layouts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          
  Page &ndash; the standard page display  </li>
        <li>
          
Map &ndash; entities placed over a planar map</li>
        <li>
          
Sphere &ndash; information is mapped over a sphere</li>
        <li>
          </p>
          
Hierarchical Map &ndash; multi level map</li>
        <li>
          
Solar System &ndash; information&nbsp; is placed in orbits</li>
        <li>
          
Hyperbolic Space &ndash; hyperbolic mapping of
        entities</li>
        <li>Corridor &ndash; information&nbsp; placed over walls of a corridor</li>
        <li>
        
Sequential &ndash; sequence of planes</p>
       </li>
        <li>Cubic &ndash; hierarchies of cubes        </li>
        <li>
         
Free &ndash; standard 3D space</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="caption">Fig 1: The Cubic and the Corridor layouts</p>
      <h3>Links</h3>
      <p>The placement and styling of information is only one aspect
        of the landscape design. Another element is the design of the connections. The
        proposed metaphor for Information Landscapes is based on the extension of the
        hyperlink concept: the link is visually displayed, and it corresponds not only
        to a logical connection to a topic, but more specifically also to a physical navigation
        to a specific topic. Thus, the link is not just a point to point entity, but
        more a road passing by various intermediate points. The role of the designer is
        to define this link as a defined trajectory into the conceptual space of the
        system, helping the user to navigate the system or showing a pathway in the
      information.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="Carrozzino.Fig2.jpg" alt="figure 2" width="388" height="305" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 2: Example of predefined links</p>
      <h3>Interaction</h3>
      <p>In literature, there is a great deal of research about
        navigation metaphors in a 3D space. In the specific case of ILs, we identified four
        main approaches: free space navigation, focus navigation, reading navigation,
        and link navigation. The basic movement is based on the fly metaphor which
        makes use of common devices likes mice, Space Mice, or joysticks. The focus
        navigation consists of a zoom operation, over any entity in the space, which
        moves the viewpoint towards the selected entity and places it at a specified reading
        distance. The reading navigation is important in this system because the user must
        actively act towards the text (there is no scroll bar or similar) in the same
        way as we read a poster. This type of navigation is obtained by dragging the
        text, with the effect of moving the viewpoint parallel to the text orientation.
        The last navigation mode is based on the previously exposed concept of links.
        When the user moves the mouse (or, in immersive setups, the selection tool) over
        an entity with links, the links are shown and can be activated. When a link is
        activated, the user automatically moves along the link path with the same
        orientation of the link curve. The navigation can be stopped in any moment
      before arriving at a destination.</p>
      <h2>The IL Engine</h2>
      <p>Originally created as a stand-alone application, the IL
        engine is currently executable also inside an XVR environment. XVR (Carrozzino,
        2005) is a technological framework developed to manage advanced multimedia and
        virtual reality interactive applications which can be experienced, with minimal
        configuration changes, both in complex immersive installations and inside
      standard Web pages.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="Carrozzino.Fig3.jpg" alt="figure 3" width="400" height="404" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 3: Web-based Information Landscapes</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="Carrozzino.Fig4.jpg" alt="figure 4" width="400" height="308" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 4: Immersive Information Landscapes</p>
      <p>
      The IL engine allows the presentation of large
      amounts of text, displayed over flat surfaces and custom shapes. The IL Engine
      is internally implemented using a customized scene graph that has been
      optimized for textual content, in particular based on the computation of the
      boundaries of different elements. Text is rendering using texture mapping
      techniques, taking advantage of Unicode cached rendering by the Open Source
      FreeType library. More sophisticated algorithms based on shaders or vector
      textures (Qin, 2006 and Loop, 2005) do exist, but they come at a cost in terms
      of the flexibility of the rendering system. In addition, texture mapping is the
      most flexible technique, adaptable to different conditions, and it is also applicable
      in the case of animated or editable text, as in Kinetic Typography (Lee, 2002).      </p>
      <p>
      The selection of elements is obtained using a color
      selection approach: every visible object is assigned a color which can be fetched
      from the framebuffer. This solution is effective for the selection of links
      that have complex curved shapes. In any case, the standard ray selection
      approach is available because of the bounding box-based scene graph adopted in
      the whole engine.      </p>
      <h3>Encoding Information Landscapes</h3>
      <p>
      The proposed IL Engine uses as the basis for the
      construction of the landscape an XML language called ILX (Information Landscape
      Xml) that has been designed for creating hierarchical and connected islands of textual
      elements, augmented with images, 3D models and links. This is a natural choice
      for the creation of 3D content on the Web,and while the best way for the
      fruition of the ILX is inside the IL Engine, it is possible to generate a
      simplified version using X3D or even simpler 2D representation.      </p>
      <p>
      The ILX has various elements for describing the
      content and some specific ones for the automatic generation of layouts,
      implementing the spatial layout concepts presented above. Also, the concept of
      links is supported in the form of multipoint links with timing associated to
      each segment of navigation.      </p>
      <h3>Authoring Tools</h3>
      <p>The IL Editor allows creating and
        managing spatial data entities similarly to what is possible by using 3D
        modeling applications, although keeping a strong orientation towards managing
      peculiar data structures like ILs&rsquo; ones. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="Carrozzino.Fig5.jpg" alt="figure 5" width="400" height="279" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 5: The IL Editor</p>
      <p>Its main features are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>page and site management, and creation from
          scratch: the designer can visually create complex spaces without any
          requirement of programming skills;</li>
        <li>support to editing in place: the designer can
          edit as well as modify the properties of the scene elements using the WYSIWYG
          paradigm.</li>
        <li>3D objects support: in order to allow the
          designer to include solid models in the scene, it is possible to load 3D models
          created with external editors. Once the model is inserted, it can be scaled,
          positioned and oriented everywhere in the environment.</li>
        <li>level of detail support: additional maps and
          controls allow the designer to take care of the perspective by means of level
          of detail features. The description of each site/page can be freely altered
          according to a set of configurable parameters. </li>
        <li>interactive text formatting: text can be
          modified interactively by applying common attributes to text, like color, fonts
          and animations</li>
        <li>automatic file organization: the editor
          automatically keeps track of the design space and organizes it into files which
          comply with standard languages and are compatible with the WWW architecture</li>
        <li>support to streams and links: all information
          paths (defined as streams) can be edited and checked in a graphical fashion
          before storing and activating them into a data space. Links can be represented
          with visual lines in the space, and all the relative properties can be altered
          from the editor.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A preview mode is available to
      allow in-place checking of the IL structure and to debug the scenes&rsquo; behavior.</p>

      <h2>Case Studies</h2>
      <p>In this section
        we present a selected set of case studies which illustrate the potentialities
        of such a means to distribute knowledge over the Web. The case studies are
        related to novel ways to present textual information such as that contained in
        books (The Little Prince and Dante&rsquo;s Inferno), more complex information such as
        that related to art collections (Lucca Graphic Arts), and even semi-abstract
        virtual environment where layers of 2D and 3D data concur to describe
        structured multimedia, even multimodal information (The Galileo Museum of
        Science). These case studies are discussed on the basis of design (such as the
        level of abstraction of the landscape, the spatial layout, the presence of
        multimedia elements), usability (such as the ease of information retrieval, navigation
      etc.), and educational considerations.</p>
      <h3>Dante&rsquo;s Inferno</h3>
      <p>
      The
      Inferno Information Landscape (<a
href="../http://percro.sssup.it/~pit/IL/DivinaCommedia.htm">http://percro.sssup.it/~pit/IL/DivinaCommedia.htm</a>) is constructed by representing
          each canto of the poem on the surface of a set of concentric cylinders with
          decreasing radius proceeding from top to bottom, creating a spatial structure
          which reflects the ideal structure of hell itself, as Dante has conceived it;
          i.e., that of a cone pointing into the ground and made up of circles.      </p>
      <p>
      The
        navigation inside the landscape can either be free, with the user moving inside
        a cylinder freely reading each part of the text, or can be defined, with the user

      target.      </p>

        commonly arouses a noticeable emotional involvement, particularly when
        experienced in immersive installations like CAVE-like systems or HMDs. However,
        users commonly report that it is not easy to reach a desired &ldquo;zone&rdquo; of the poem.
        We are planning some usability improvements which should make use of maps and
        search tools in order to assist user movements and information retrieval
      operations.</p>
      <h3>Lucca Graphics Arts</h3>
      <p>
      This
        Information Landscape system is applied in the case of the graphics arts
        collections based in Lucca (Tuscany, Italy). This is the first attempt at
        building a meaningful system of valorisation and communication of this specific
        heritage which exemplifies all the medium-small collections (largely diffused
        in Italy) of hidden heritage; i.e., not currently exposed to the general public,
      but scattered among several different cultural institutions.      </p>
      <p>
      It is possible to access this application also through
      the Web site (<a href="../http://www.humnet.unipi.it/~vneri/">http://www.humnet.unipi.it/~vneri/</a>) of
      Lucca Graphic Arts, a thematic portal conceived in order to show an innovative
      and complementary approach to the art. Its peculiarity &ndash; compared with other similar
      Web systems &ndash; consists specifically in its multilevel approach, since different
      classes of users are taken into account, from students to specialists. For each
      category of users, historical, artistic and technical information is provided
      in forms and with means which vary in relation to the different skills.      </p>
      <p>
      The convenience of the proposed IL-based system
      lies in the possibility of organizing information based on the relevance of the
      content. Information is provided by means of an &lsquo;alternative&rsquo; channel
      complementing traditional channels, as it can be accessed using a visual
      language well suited to convey visual signs like drawings and prints. Artworks
      and related documents can be accessed much more effectively with an interactive
      approach.      </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="Carrozzino.Fig8.jpg" alt="figure 8" /> </p>
      <p class="caption">
      Fig 8: The
      Lucca Graphics Arts IL      </p>
      <p>Different paths are enabled for each reference
        target, offering different perspectives (popular, educational or scientific), depending
        on the cultural background of the user. The user is free to explore the 3D
        space, to choose one of the aforementioned paths, and to examine thoroughly
        some specific content. When approaching a particular piece of artwork, the user
        can see the details of the graphic sign, a point of view which is commonly unavailable
        even when directly viewing the asset. Both texts and images can be selected and
        visualized with higher definition, with the possibility of putting into the background
        the rest of the information environment.      </p>
      <p>
      In terms of layout concept, this Information Landscape
      is structured as a high level Free layout in which the thematic areas have been
      placed. Each area is a Cubic layout that contains one specific type of
      information in every face. Each face is made of a Page layout showing the
      content in a planar way. In the case of faces containing paintings or other
      artwork, the details are presented on the back of the face using a Corridor
      layout. &nbsp;This IL constitutes the
      basis of an educational course, conceived for students of primary and secondary
      schools, which will take place in Lucca in Summer 2009. A demo of this IL is
      available at <a href="../http://percro.sssup.it/~pit/IL/CubiSpace.htm">http://percro.sssup.it/~pit/IL/CubiSpace.htm</a>.      </p>
      <h3>GALILEO GALILEI&rsquo;S LIFE </h3>
      <p>
      This Information Landscape, developed in the
        framework of the European Project Pencil, illustrates the life of Galileo
        Galilei under four different aspects: <b>time</b>, <b>space</b>, <b>people</b> and <b>instruments</b>.
        The overall structure of his life is represented in the three-dimensional space
        using the metaphore of platforms connected by staircases. The Information
        Landscape approach is grounded on the sharing of the space between different
        aspects of the concepts, transforming conceptual links into physical visible
        links. This space is supported by a database that stores entities,
        representations and relationships, allowing for a flexible reorganization of
      the space, depending on the content.      </p>
      <p>
      Each aspect of Galileo&rsquo;s life is represented by an
        entity in the space, and it is associated with a detailed description provided
      by an overlaid Web page.      </p>
      <p>
      The biography section (Time) collects the most significant moments of
        Galileo&rsquo;s life. These moments are represented as cards arranged in a
        semi-circular shape. Selecting a card causes an overlaid window to appear,
        showing varied information related to the selected period. The People section
        contains the most important persons in the life of Galileo, people who
        interacted and collaborated with him. Their portraits are placed on a dedicated
      platform, and can be selected to retrieve related information.      </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="Carrozzino.Fig9.jpg" alt="figure 9" width="400" height="302" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 9: The Galileo IL</p>
      <p>
      The same goes for the Places section, while a
        particular case is the Instruments section, where it is possible also to interactively
        explore the three-dimensional representation of some of the tools that Galileo designed,
      built or used.      </p>
      <p>
      As a matter of fact, this environment can be considered a mixture,
        somewhere between an Information Landscape and a Virtual Environment, and
        represents an interesting example of fusion of the two media. The presence of a
        number of 3D objects, in fact, would suggest considering this as an abstract
        VE; however, the presence of an information-oriented layout, of mainly
        bidimensional elements, and of predefined structured navigation paths, in the
        form of streams, brings it back into the class of multimedia ILs. This IL is
      available at <a href="../http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/pencil/ita/indice.html">http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/pencil/ita/indice.html</a>.      </p>
      <h2>Conclusions and Future
      Work</h2>
      <p>
      Until
        not too many years ago, the main obstacles to the spreading of such
        technologies were the poor graphics performance of home computers and the lack
        of broad band. Now, thanks to the massive diffusion of video games and Internet
        services, both aspects are no longer considered significant bottlenecks.
        However, great care should be taken in order to make these tools actually
        usable and accelerate the transition from nice visual gadgets to useful
      instruments.      </p>
      <p>
      In
      particular, we identified three main issues which require additional effort:      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>authoring</li>
        <li>navigation</li>
        <li>information retrieval.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      As
        appears evident from the presented case studies, each IL needs to be carefully
        designed and authored to fulfil the previously mentioned requirements, in
        particular to produce a pleasant and functional experience. So far, the whole
        process is almost completely manual. Although manual interventions are without
        doubt needed, as the IL design process requires some kinds of artistic skills
        that can only with difficult be mechanized, automated procedures able to assist
        the designer&rsquo;s work are more than advisable in order to reduce the authoring
      time that often represents a non-negligible share of the entire workflow.      </p>
      <p>
      Therefore
        we are setting up procedures to import different types of texts (from books to Web
        sites) and to produce a first rough layout of the IL and of its structures,
        which the designer can subsequently refine. An ongoing example is related to
        Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies, obtained from freely available XML files: in this case,
        each tragedy is placed in a plane parallel to other planes, each one hosting
        the text of other tragedies. The text of a single work is placed on parallel
        vertical columns, each one representing a single act. In its turn, a scene of
        an act is represented as a block inside a column, distanced from the others,
      and so on.      </p>
      <p>
      As
        far as the navigation is concerned, we are planning to enlarge the base of
        supported interfaces to touch devices and to other interfaces nowadays commonly
        available, such as the WiiMote. More natural and accurate interaction metaphors
        are under investigation to make use of additional GUI elements (such as IL
      maps) to ease the navigation task.      </p>
      <p>
      Finally,
        more specific procedures related to information retrieval are under development.
        They will exploit the multi-modal capabilities of virtual environments by using
        different sensorial cues (visual highlights, tactile feedback, audio messages)
        in order to assist users in finding the information relevant for their queries,
        either explicitly formulated or automatically extracted from their previous
        behaviour. These cues should be able to enhance the perception of the relevance
        of the results, so as to increase immersion in the environment and to make more
        effective use of this technology for purposes that go beyond the mere pleasure of
      the virtual experience.      </p>
