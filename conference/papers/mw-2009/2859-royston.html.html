		 participative session with a focus on some key issues, including how to get the
		 best out of your partnership, gaining consensus and agreement for content and
		 technology, approaches to Web 2.0, working with third party suppliers, and
		 providing a legacy for sustainability. These issues have applicability to
		 anyone managing a digital project in the cultural sector, whether it is one

	  <h2>Background</h2>
	  <p>The National Museums Online Learning Project (NMOLP) is a three-year
		  government sponsored partnership project involving nine UK national museums:
		  British Museum, Imperial War Museum, National Portrait Gallery, Natural History
		  Museum, Royal Armouries, Sir John Soane&rsquo;s Museum, Tate, The Wallace Collection
		  and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The partners are working together to get
		  their Web sites better used, engage new audiences, and transform the way they
		  think about and use existing digital collections. The project launches in February
	  2009.</p>
	  <p>The project involves the development of a range of
		  innovative on-line resources across the nine Web sites for pupils, teachers and
		  lifelong learners. These resources include a large-scale on-line community
		  called Creative Spaces; school-based resources to promote critical thinking
		  called WebQuests; and a federated search linking the nine collections together
	  for the first time. </p>
	  <p>This is the first time that UK national museums have
		  worked together on a public-facing project. Therefore, in order for the project
		  to be successful, participating institutions have had to work in new and
		  innovative ways &ndash; both inter-departmentally and intra-departmentally, sharing
		  knowledge and expertise as well as risks and successes. This unique project
		  required the participating national museums to work together in a truly
	  collaborative and creative way.</p>
	  <p>The core project team consisted of a full-time project
		  manager (myself), a part-time technical manager, and a part-time administrator.
		  In addition, there were six part-time content writers based across the partner
	  museums writing content for WebQuests.</p>
	  <p>Each of the partner museums had project representatives
	  covering both sets of resources and technical requirements. </p>
	  <p>Below I have highlighted some of the key challenges I
		  encountered and my approach to finding solutions. These challenges will be
	  explored in the workshop and supported by practical examples.</p>
	  <h2>Key Challenges</h2>
	  <h3>The Partnership</h3>
	  <p>NMOLP is a both a technical and an educational project. The
		  participating institutions range from very large with in-house technical
		  capability and large educational departments, to very small with limited or no in-house
		  technical capability and small educational teams. At the beginning of the
		  project, I discovered that expectations about what the project would deliver
		  for each institution, and the resources and capacity needed varied greatly
	  across the partnership.</p>
	  <p>It quickly became clear to me that in order for the
		  project to be successful, the partners and project team needed to develop a
		  shared vision for the project and an understanding of what the partnership
		  could achieve together. We worked collaboratively to establish a set of
		  principles, with clear aims and objectives, setting out how the partnership
		  will work together, and what the partnership could deliver that the partners
		  could not do on their own. This work enabled the partners to explore some of
		  their similarities and differences, strengths and weaknesses across the
		  partnership, how they could support each other, and what the barriers to
	  success might be &ndash; institutionally, departmentally, and personally. </p>
	  <p>This process was extremely helpful in terms of enabling me
		  to understand how I could manage the project more effectively, and where I
		  could get specialist support or help from representatives in the partnership;
		  for example, technical support or e-learning expertise. We re-visited how the
		  partnership was working a year after the initial work was undertaken. It
		  enabled us to see whether we were still on track with our aims and objectives
		  and how the partnership was working. At the end of the project when we were
		  developing a legacy strategy, we looked again at the partnership (see legacy
	  section below) and whether the partners had achieved the goals for the project.</p>
	  <h3>Communication</h3>
	  <p>With so many stakeholders and people working virtually, it
		  was critical to set up good, clear lines of communication and processes. Our
		  principal method of communication was via Basecamp. All project representatives
		  were required to use Basecamp, and all project documentation, milestones,
		  meetings and messaging were communicated via this tool. Basecamp enabled me to
		  more easily manage the decision-making process, make individual people
		  accountable, and set deadlines. It also provided both the partners and the
		  project team with a way of tracking discussions and decisions over the lifetime
	  of the project.</p>
	  <p>It was also important to meet face-to-face with partners
		  to keep them informed of progress and to keep momentum going. <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> This was not always easy to organise and was time-consuming, but it did ensure
		   that partners were engaged and involved in the project development and
 decision-making. </span></p>
	  <p>Basecamp will continue to be used post-launch by the
		  partners. It will act as a central communication point and also as a space to
		  provide discussion and support for any content and technical issues that the
	  partners may have.</p>
	  <h3>Scoping the resources</h3>
	  <p>Working from the original implementation plan, it was
		  important to spend time with the partners scoping out and exploring ideas about
		  what we were going to develop. Ensuring that the partners were actively
		  involved in this process meant that they had a better understanding of the
		  project and the work involved and also helped to embed what we were doing into
	  their individual institutions &ndash; helping with sustainability post-launch. </p>
	  <p>The project team ran different workshops throughout the
		  lifetime of the project - with educators discussing the development of the two
		  learning resources, and with technical managers discussing all technical
		  issues. All relevant project representatives were asked to attend these
		  workshops, and for most partners there was good and consistent attendance
	  throughout the project.</p>
	  <p>The workshops also helped to develop a greater sense of
		  partnership working, enabling discussions to happen across institutions where that
		  would not normally happen. For example, education managers were able to talk
		  about how we negotiate differences and similarities in educational approaches. And
		  technical managers openly discussed technical issues and requirements and shared
		  information about their technical infrastructure with each other. It has helped
		  to open up the possibility of future collaboration and genuine partnership
	  working around further development of this resource or future projects.</p>
	  <h2>Compromises</h2>
	  <p>As we worked through the scoping process and started to
		  develop concepts, build prototypes and work iteratively, some more challenging
		  partnership and management issues started to emerge. These had to be tackled in
		  order for the project to keep moving forward. Below are just a couple of
	  examples &ndash; more will be discussed in the workshop.</p>
	  <h3>Copyright</h3>
	  <p>One of the main challenges we encountered was around
		  copyright. We have not created a central Web site or portal: all content is
		  shared across the nine partner Web sites, including a cross-collection <b>search</b>.
		  The <b>search</b> in particular is integral to the two applications and requires at the very
		  least thumbnails to be displayed in the search results from across the
		  collections. In effect, this means that collection items from partners will be
		  displayed on each other&rsquo;s Web sites. The sharing of objects across the partner Web
		  sites is critical to the success of the resources. For some partners, copyright
	  was not a big issue, but for others, it was extremely problematic. </p>
	  <p>In order to find a workable solution, we asked a digital
		  copyright expert to help us draft an agreement that all partners could sign up
		  to. She developed a copyright impact analysis which we invited all partners to
		  comment on and discuss. This process showed the copyright officers in the
		  museums that we were taking copyright seriously and also enabled partners to
		  take a considered approach to the issue and share their concerns with each
		  other. Their response to the document enabled me to see what the limits were in
		  terms of what we could achieve with the collections, and in turn this informed
	  the development of the resources.</p>
	  <p>From that document, we also developed a <b>terms and conditions</b> for users. We had to make certain compromises, such as only including objects
		  in the search that have no copyright restrictions, and only allowing thumbnails
		  to be displayed in the search and in Creative Spaces where objects from across
		  the collections can be added to notebooks and groups. Users need to go to where
		  the image is hosted to see a larger version. This is not an ideal solution from
		  a user perspective, as we would have liked users to be able to engage with
		  larger images within the applications, but it is a solution that works and has
		  enabled us to move forward. The project has provided a practical example to the
		  participating institutions of where technology can open many exciting
		  possibilities around their objects, but copyright restrictions and
		  organisational issues currently make it impossible to practically implement
		  them. The hope is that digital copyright will continue to be discussed by these
		  institutions in future projects, and they will find solutions that enable users
		  to have the richest and most engaging on-line experience possible with the
	  incredible collections available to them.</p>
	  <h3>Working with third-party suppliers</h3>
	  <p>This project had the complexity of having to work with
		  third-party suppliers who are contracted to individual museums and carry out
		  their technical development work or manage their collections. From a project
		  management point of view, the museum&rsquo;s third-party suppliers were at times
		  problematic to work with as their primary responsibility, quite rightly, was to
		  their client &ndash; the museum, and not this project. This did at times impact on
		  the schedule as we were reliant on them to carry out certain aspects of work
		  and they were not always well informed about the project, the scope of work
		  required, or timescales. In situations like this, it was imperative for us to
		  have the museum&rsquo;s technical manager involved and to have that person convey to
		  the supplier a clear understanding of the wider impact on the project if work were
	  not completed in the timescales required.</p>
	  <h2>Approaches to Web 2.0</h2>
	  <p>One of the main aims of the project is to enable users to
		  engage with the on-line collections in creative and participatory ways. We
		  wanted users to be able to search across the collections and use objects they
		  find, as well as their own work, to create and share content and develop
	  communities of interest inspired by the collections. </p>
	  <p>We did some focus group work with users and built a small
		  prototype to test out some concepts. Informed by the user groups, we decided
		  the best way for users to really benefit from the partnership was to build an
		  on-line community. Once we had made that decision, we then had to really
		  examine what it would mean for each institution to have user-generated content
		  on its site. This included not just the practical resource issues and
		  moderation implications, but also identifying who the audiences might be for
		  this resource, how to engage them, how to build and sustain the on-line
		  community, and the museum&rsquo;s own role in that process. There was the added
		  element of some partners, such as the Victoria and Albert Museum and Tate, already
		  having some experience of Web 2.0; whilst for others this was the first time
	  they had engaged with it. </p>
	  <p>Working in a partnership has been extremely helpful when
		  developing this particular resource. We were able to really explore who the
		  different audiences might be and how a community might function and benefit
		  from having access to such a diverse range of collections. We discussed
		  moderation and how it would be handled across the partnership. We have looked
		  at community management and its value in helping to develop this service, and the
		  partners have had to look at how they can integrate new ways of working into
		  their existing practices. The project has enabled staff in the partner museums
		  to share their ideas, hopes and fears around servicing an on-line community,
		  and this communication will become more important as the service beds in and becomes
		  more widely used. Built-in metrics to the application will also enable the
		  museums to quickly see activity on their own site as well as across the
		  partnership and be able to respond more rapidly to user interactions. This
		  element of the project has been helped by a sense of shared success and shared
	  risk amongst the partners.</p>
	  <h2>Legacy</h2>
	  <p>In a project of this size and scope, it is important to
		  develop a legacy strategy that includes sustainability and evaluation, as well
		  as sharing of experiences and learning with the wider sector. This project has
		  been designed to be sustainable once it launches, without a central project
		  team in place. Each partner will be responsible for maintaining its own content,
		  and partners can communicate any content or technical issues via Basecamp and
		  in face-to-face meetings &ndash; processes have been put into place before the
	   &lsquo;official&rsquo; end of the project to ensure that this communication happens in as
		  efficient and supportive a way as possible. Technical SLAs are also in place to
		  support the partners with the applications and to service any issues that may
		  arise. A project evaluation will happen six to nine months after the launch to
	  allow the project to bed in and become more widely used.</p>
	  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
	  <p>NMOLP has been a unique management experience. It has been
		  an incredibly complex project to manage due to the scope of the resources
		  created, the number of stakeholders involved, and the need for institutional
		  collaboration on a new scale.There have been many positives and much learning
		  for the participating museums on how to work both across museums and
		  inter-departmentally. As the project director, I have had to draw on and
		  develop many strategies to ensure its success. It required a combination of
		  using tried and tested project management methodologies as well as developing
		  great diplomacy skills and tact. It&rsquo;s about understanding how to be a project
		  leader and hold a vision for the project, and how to utilise the people in your
		  partnership to best effect. It&rsquo;s about negotiation and compromise and gaining
		  consensus to keep the project moving forward. My experience has not been easy, but
	  it is immensely rewarding when it all comes together.</p>
