        <p class="AbstractText">At SFMOMA, an interpretive goals process has been
    instituted to bring together curators, educators, educational technologists and
    other concerned parties to design the interpretive &ldquo;menu&rdquo; for exhibitions once
    they are put on the schedule. The result is a transition from the old model of
    &ldquo;technology as remediation&rdquo; &ndash; in which kiosks were placed at the end of an
    exhibition (or on another floor altogether) while visitors were often left
    clueless before the art itself &ndash; to a mix of analog and digital resources,
    designed and dosed to meet visitor needs as they arise. The result may be a net
    decrease in technological interventions, but arguably a more effective use of
    technology when it is deployed. Three case studies illustrate the range of
    responses to this process, and the development of technology solutions at a
    variety of scales and budgets, with varying degrees of success. Results of
    recent evaluations of mobile tours, both cell phone and multimedia-based, are
    included, as well as indications for future directions stemming from this
    action research.</p>

    <h2>I. Interpretation in the Service Of&hellip;</h2>
      <p>Contemporary art is the cult of the expert. </p>
      <p>Such is the refrain of museum-goers who enter the galleries
          of our &lsquo;must-see buildings&rsquo; only to be confronted by truncated torsos
          half-covered with hair, small square paintings on which dates have been
          impeccably lettered against a black field, and blond paper cutouts that hover
          at the threshold of perception, blending almost invisibly with the wall to
          which they&rsquo;ve been adhered. It is a lament so often heard it has become clich&eacute;.
      But could it be that it&rsquo;s true?</p>
      <p>The case can be argued both ways, but let&rsquo;s assume that &ndash; as
          with die-hard sports fans who have a better time at the stadium than newbies
          unfamiliar with the players and the game &ndash; knowing what&rsquo;s at stake in an
          artwork or exhibition, and who the actors are, tends to lead to a more
      engrossing experience. </p>
      <p>That said, our halls are public secular temples, visited by
          crowds far more numerous than the cognoscenti, so the question perennially
          arises: what are we doing for the uninitiated? How are we ensuring their
          experience will be as satisfying, as stimulating, and arguably, as intuitive as
          a sports fan&rsquo;s? This paper focuses on recent experiences at the San Francisco
          Museum of Modern Art, where the team formerly known as Interactive Educational Technologies
          (hereafter IET) &ndash; which began life as a largely autonomous (some would say &ldquo;rogue&rdquo;)
          unit within the museum&rsquo;s structure &ndash; became part of the newly-established
          Interpretation arm of Education. Shortly thereafter, a cross-department
          Interpretive Goals process was introduced and brought curators, editors,
          educators and a deputy director together to examine potential problems of
          understanding and to brainstorm potential interpretive solutions for each new
          exhibition as it was put on the schedule. In the process, all staff members
          concerned were obliged to think and program outside their traditional training
          and role-set. The paper treats both changing organizational dynamics and<i> </i>museum-wide adoption of new
      technologies in the service of visitor experience. </p>
      <h3>Background </h3>
      <p>In January 2005, Dominic Willsdon was appointed The Leanne
        &amp; George Roberts Curator of Education &amp; Public Programs at SFMOMA.
          Willsdon, who had previously run public programs at Tate Modern in London,
          arrived with a background in aesthetics, philosophy, and museum practice. He
          looked at the SFMOMA Education Department&rsquo;s internal structure and correctly
          identified the Interactive Educational Technologies (IET) team as a high-functioning albeit somewhat guerilla force inside the
          museum. What would happen if he harnessed that independence and talent and
          merged it with a model he was more familiar with from the U.K. in general, and
          Tate in particular, where Interpretation was &ldquo;at the heart of the Gallery&rsquo;s
          mission&rdquo;? (Wilson, 2004) From this thinking, the Interpretation team was
          formed. Peter Samis, an associate curator and&nbsp; Program Manager, Interactive
          Educational Technologies, became the Associate Curator of Interpretation,
          overseeing not only the IET group but also the newly created role of Manager of
          Gallery Interpretation (now Manager of Interpretation). While the IET team
          continues to focus on developing digital publication projects treating the
          permanent collection and selected special exhibitions, the Manager of
          Interpretation engages with&nbsp; the deployment of both analog and digital
          interpretive tools, and touches upon every single exhibition the Museum
          organizes &ndash; upwards of 20-30 per year &ndash; to represent visitor needs in the
      formative design process.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, the Interpretation team was not left solely to
          its own resources to chart this new terrain. There were high-level advocates
          in-house, including Deputy Director Ruth Berson, who returned from an
          international meeting in Rome with an Interpretive Goals questionnaire
          developed by a peer institution in southern California &ndash; the Getty &ndash; and
          permission to adapt it for our use (SFMOMA Education Department, 2007). The
          form offered a structure for organizing our thinking and practice as a group.
          In cross-departmental meetings initially convened by Berson, and later by
          Education, curators presented and discussed prospective exhibitions with
          colleagues from Education and Publications, sometimes augmented by staff from
          Public Relations and Visitor Services. The eight questions on the form
      included: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Please list one to three main ideas visitors
            will take away from viewing the exhibition. What objects or didactic components
        of the exhibition will help them learn this?</li>
      <li>Describe the rationale
        and originality of the project. Is the exhibition bringing new scholarship to
        the field, exposing an under-recognized subject, etc.? Why is this exhibition
        important now at SFMOMA?</li>
      <li>Please note other interpretive, multi-media
        components that should be considered (audio tour, in-gallery videos,
        interactive feature, blogs, etc.). Are you aware of existing media created by
        other organizations on this topic? (<i>SFMOMA
        Education Department 2007)</i></li>
    </ul>
      <p>The inclusion of multimedia at the heart of official
          discussions about every exhibition the museum presents could itself be seen as
          a great step forward. But the first question, reductive as it was, proved the
          most powerful: &ldquo;List one to three main ideas you want visitors to take away&hellip;.&rdquo; Astounding
          as that simple query was, the idea of putting an exhibition&rsquo;s meanings out on
          the table not as a fait accompli but as a topic of cross-department
          conversation and assessment, in consort with the second question &ndash; &ldquo;Why here
          why now?&rdquo; &ndash; easily trumped any priority IET members may have placed on using
          new technologies as interpretive tools.&nbsp; For it implied an open-ended approach that respects the visitor as an
          equal partner in the meaning-making experience of the exhibition, rather than
          the traditional top-down interpretation by fiat that has so often characterized
          art museum exhibitions. Now interpretation could clearly be seen as a
          collaboration: on the one hand, between participating departments, of course,
      but on the other hand, between the museum and its visitors. </p>
      <p>And so a member of the Interpretation team was pressed into
          service revising &ndash; or co-writing &ndash; analog gallery texts and extended object
          labels, along with our colleagues the editors in Publications, who in all
          fairness had been representing visitor interests within the limits of the texts
          offered to them for quite some time. You could say that in this new model, the
          commando spirit of IET&nbsp; has been subsumed by institutional priorities &ndash; but in order to
          say that, you would have to commit to the (ironically, now old fashioned<i>)</i> notion that made technology itself a
          god, ignoring all evidence that would argue otherwise. As recently as 2008, a
          survey of SFMOMA visitors shows that between 78-90% of visitors read wall
          texts, while a far smaller number<b> </b>consult
          computer kiosks or use audio tours in their multiple and ever-evolving formats
      (Samis, 2007; Discovery Communications, 2008).</p>
      <p>This does not mean that in the process we abandoned hope for
          the special power educational technologies can bring to bear on the museum
          experience. It does mean, however, that we have taken seriously our talk of
          meeting our visitors where they are &ndash; a process that, as we&rsquo;ll demonstrate in
          this paper, includes honoring, rather than discounting, the magnetic pull of
          time-honored museum-visiting habits &ndash; even if it means a net decrease in the
          presence of interactive educational technologies on the gallery floor.&nbsp; In parallel, and with varying degrees
          of success, we are experimenting with smarter and more intuitive ways of dosing
          technological mediation, and analyzing factors that might reshape visitor
          expectations and lead to greater adoption of such solutions. We address our
      research and development on that front later in this paper. </p>
      <h2>II. Case Studies: Three Exhibitions</h2>
      <p>For the purposes of this conference, we outline the
          challenges and solutions proposed in the interpretive goals process for each of
          three exhibitions, but only analyze the success and/or shortcomings of the
          technology-based strategies. The exhibitions discussed are &ldquo;Frida Kahlo&rdquo;
        (June&ndash;September 2008), presented by the Painting &amp; Sculpture department,
        &ldquo;246 and Counting&rdquo; (July 2008&ndash;January 2009),<b> </b>organized by the Architecture &amp; Design department, and &ldquo;The Art
      of Participation&rdquo; (November 2008&ndash;February 2009), organized by the Media Arts department. </p>
      <h3>Frida Kahlo</h3>
      <p>A retrospective of Frida Kahlo&rsquo;s paintings organized by the
          Walker Art Center in association with SFMOMA presented both the greatest
          opportunity and, perhaps, the most minimal need: opportunity because there was
          ample funding and the Museum was expecting an abundance of visitors; minimal
          need because Kahlo&rsquo;s work and persona have become so iconic &ndash; have so much
          Visual Velcro (Samis, 2008) &ndash; that people would most likely leave satisfied
          even in the absence of&nbsp; an overarching interpretive campaign. Kahlo has been the subject
          of a Hollywood film starring Salma Hayek, and countless biographies, and is
          adored by fans across the social spectrum, so many
          visitors were likely to be armed with cues or hooks with which to approach her
          work. That said, the museum was surcharging for entry to the exhibition, and it
          was important to meet the expectation of added value. Furthermore, &ldquo;Frida Kahlo&rdquo;<i> </i>offered a unique opportunity to reach
          out to new audiences &ndash; particularly the Bay Area&rsquo;s Latino community &ndash; and a
      local foundation offered its support toward these efforts. </p>
      <p>As a result of Interpretive Goals meetings, a menu of
      multi-lingual resources was developed: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Exhibition and gallery-level wall texts in
        English and Spanish</li>
      <li>Bi-lingual full-color brochure with extended
        label information for a selection of works.</li>
      <li>Two educational galleries: one to emphasize
        Kahlo&rsquo;s local connections (covering Kahlo and her husband Diego Rivera&rsquo;s visits
        to San Francisco from 1930&ndash;1941); another to surface the story of Kahlo&rsquo;s
        rediscovery in the 1970s and &lsquo;80s &ndash; a phenomenon in which local Latino artists
        and gay rights activities played a major role &ndash; and her creative legacy, as
        expressed by contemporary artists locally, nationally, and internationally&nbsp; ( Fig. &nbsp;1, Fig. 2).</li>
      <li>Bi-lingual Web site (<a
href="../http://www.sfmoma.org/exhibitions/310">http://www.sfmoma.org/exhibitions/310</a>)
        and interactive feature available on kiosks in the final gallery&rsquo;s &ldquo;Learning
        Lounge&rdquo; </li>
      <li>Daily film screenings in the Koret Visitor
        Education Center</li>
      <li>Docent-led public tours</li>
      <li>Public lectures, performances, and film
        programs.</li>
      <li>Family Activity Guide focused on Kahlo&rsquo;s
        painting &ldquo;Frieda and Diego Rivera&rdquo; (1931)</li>
      <li>Podcast incorporating a variety of commentaries
        and visitor reactions </li>
      <li>A heavily promoted handheld multimedia tour
        developed in collaboration with Antenna Audio and the Walker (in English,
        Spanish, and French as well, to cater to the summertime tourist influx)</li>
    </ul>

      Kahlo.</p>
      <h3>246 and Counting</h3>
      <p>&ldquo;246 and Counting&rdquo; was an effort by curator Henry Urbach to
          re-invent the permanent collection exhibition. Rather than the more standard
          curatorial approach in which a small set of objects is selected and
          correspondences are evoked between them, Urbach (aided by Assistant Curator
          Joseph Becker) focused on the process by which a collection is built. The
          design of the gallery space paid homage to the model of &lsquo;open storage&rsquo;: all the
          objects acquired since Urbach&rsquo;s arrival were arrayed on gray carpeted platforms
          according to the order in which they had been entered the collection (Fig. 3). This
          all-inclusive, chronological sequencing quite literally laid bare the vagaries
          of collection-building and exposed the ever-evolving
      definition of contemporary architecture and design. </p>
      <p>That said, aside from a single introductory wall text
          explaining the exhibition&rsquo;s premise, situated slightly outside the galleries,
          the actual exhibition space was devoid of explanatory texts and even basic object
          information. Instead, visitors were invited to take large format laminated
          cards listing all the objects on view, keyed to numbers on small Lucite cubes
          placed next to each object. A supplementary layer of content, revealing the
          back-stories behind specific objects and the processes by which the museum had
          acquired them through the voices of curators, registrars, and even the Museum&rsquo;s
          director, was reserved for delivery over the airwaves &ndash; literally &ndash; through a
      cell phone tour (<a

      Art.</p>
      <h3>The Art of Participation</h3>
      <p>In contrast, the third exhibition was thematically
          organized, ambitiously scaled, and pervasive: elements of the show were
          presented on four different floors of the museum. Organized by Media Arts curator
          Rudolf Frieling and titled &ldquo;The Art of Participation: 1950 to Now&rdquo;, it traced
          the genealogy of what we now think of as Web 2.0 principles back to artists who
          put viewer participation and co-production at the center of their creative
          practice, beginning with John Cage and the Fluxus artists of the Fifties and
          Sixties and continuing through to today. The exhibition included both analog
          and digital components; among the latter were Lynn Hershman Leeson&rsquo;s virtual
          archive located in Second Life, &ldquo;Life2&rdquo;
        (<a href="../http://slurl.com/secondlife/NEWare/128/128/0">http://slurl.com/secondlife/NEWare/128/128/0</a>), c&nbsp;a&nbsp;l&nbsp;c and Johannes Gees &ldquo;communimage&rdquo;
        (<a href="../http://www.communimage.net/">http://www.communimage.net</a>/), a weekly e-Bay auction in which people could bid
        for the right to intervene personally and alter the &ldquo;1<sup>st</sup> Public
          White Cube&rdquo; (<a href="../http://www.publicwhitecube.com/">http://www.publicwhitecube.com</a>),
          and MTAA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Automatic for the People: ( )&rdquo; (<a href="../http://www.mtaa.net/vote">http://www.mtaa.net/vote</a>), in which visitors and on-line voters
          determined through a set of weekly polls the parameters of a performance on the
      exhibition&rsquo;s closing weekend. </p>
      <p>In the galleries, performances &ndash; both scheduled and
          spontaneous &ndash; included a daily rendition of John Cage&rsquo;s <i>4&rsquo;33&rdquo;</i> at a grand piano (with keyboard closed and reopened between
          each of the three movements), spontaneous &ldquo;1-Minute Sculptures&rdquo; inspired by
          Erwin Wurm&rsquo;s props and instructions, and visitors failing to communicate in
          spite of their best intentions due to the time lag in Matthias Gommel&rsquo;s
        &ldquo;Delayed&rdquo; (2002) (Fig. 4).&nbsp; Furthermore, visitors could have their portraits taken in a makeshift
          photo studio that had been assembled on the third floor landing (Jochen Gerz&rsquo;s
        &ldquo;The Gift&rdquo;), and gather on Thursday evenings to enact Tom Marioni&rsquo;s thirty-year
          running performance piece, &ldquo;The Act of Drinking Beer with Friends Is the
      Highest Form of Art&rdquo; (commonly referred as&nbsp; <i>FREE</i><i> BEER </i>salons). </p>
      <p>In other words, the exhibition was something of a
          free-for-all and spectacle, but not without historic and philosophic grounding.
          How to convey that background to visitors, who were at times presented only
          with dry artifacts of important past performances, and at others asked to
          engage in a spontaneous action with little regard for historical or social
          context? Finally, how to indicate to visitors the variety of locations and
          options available to them on the day of their visit to the museum, and
      throughout the exhibition&rsquo;s three-month run?</p>
      <p>A variety of analog and digital solutions were assayed,
          including an on-site brochure (functioning primarily as a navigational tool), a
          hybrid educational and exhibition space called &ldquo;D-Space&rdquo; (a transformation of
          the existing Koret Visitor Education Center), a comprehensive <a
href="../http://www.sfmoma.org/aop">exhibition
            Web site</a>, an active presence on the museum&rsquo;s blog Open Space (<a
href="../http://blog.sfmoma.org/">http://blog.sfmoma.org</a>) and once
          again, a cell phone audio tour. This last doubled as a set of audio stops that
          could be played on-line (<a href="../http://www.sfmoma.org/aop">http://www.sfmoma.org/aop</a>.

      to the museum. </p>

      <h2>III. Evaluation: What Did We Learn?</h2>
      <p>In each of these exhibitions, new technology interventions
          were programmed early as part of the collaborative, inter-departmental
          Interpretive Goals process, and designed to fill a particular function in the
          menu of visitor experience. Did they succeed? Through a mix of on-site
          evaluation and data gathered via user logs, we can begin to answer this
      question. </p>
      <p>In the first case, the Frida Kahlo exhibition, two
      evaluations were conducted: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A set of 41 in-depth exit interviews based on a
            questionnaire designed by Randi Korn &amp; Associates led to a qualitative
            assessment and summative summary report of the contribution of interpretive
            resources to overall visitor experience (Randi Korn &amp; Associates, 2008;
        Samis, 2009).</li>
      <li>A more ambitiously-scaled survey of 443 visitors providing statistics on the Kahlo multimedia tour was conducted
        by the in-house Corporate Intelligence Group at Discovery Communications, Inc.
        (the corporate parent of Antenna Audio). This study tracked preferences for
        various types of analog and digital interpretive resources among 224 users and
        219 non-users of the multimedia tour&nbsp; (Discovery Communications, 2008).</li>
    </ul>
      <p>The in-depth exit interviews following the Randi Korn
          protocol revealed that each resource had its partisans. That said, &ldquo;[Some]
          interviewees said the multimodal approach enlivened the exhibition&rsquo;s content
      and that they appreciated accessing information at varying levels of depth.&rdquo; </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I liked all of the resources
        &ndash; I mean, of the &ndash; the ones that we&rsquo;ve spoken of.&nbsp; The multimedia tour, I thought it was excellent. The brochure
          complemented it well and the wall text was a nice introduction to whichever room
          you were in. &nbsp;Um, and I think that they
        &ndash; they definitely enhanced the overall experience because I think her work is so
          packed full of symbolism that you might not otherwise notice; you might not otherwise,
          I don&rsquo;t know, take note of or understand, for that matter. &nbsp;I think it really enhances the overall experience
          when you get to hear the background and hear some of the -the analysis and the meanings
      that it provides for you through the resources. ( Respondent #36)</p>
      <p>The dataset of the Randi Korn study was insufficient to
          determine whether the phenomenon noted in the 2007 Matthew Barney exhibition &ndash; where
          the more interpretive resources used, the more meaningful visitors found the
      exhibition, and their museum experience &ndash; applied here as well (Samis, 2007). </p>
      <p>The Discovery study was more granular. Among the insights it
      afforded: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>While 90% of non-guide users cite wall text as
            their preferred way to get information, for 81% of audio guide users wall text
        takes a back seat to listening (Table 1).</li>
    </ul>
      <p class="caption"><a name="table1" id="table1"></a><a href="samis-table1.html"><img src="samis_Table1.Samis.thumbnail.png" alt="Table 1" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="samis-table1.html">Table 1: Preferred sources of information when visiting a
          museum<br />
      (Discovery Communications, 2008)</a></p>
      <p>While many visitors both listen and read, one interviewed in
      the Randi Korn study expressed this preference as follows: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t get into read[ing] anything so [the
          multimedia tour] was going to help me to learn a few things.&nbsp; I also didn&rsquo;t have the patience to read
      the walls, so I thought maybe&hellip; the same information would get spoken to me.</p>
      <p>Visitors most highly value listening to the artist&rsquo;s own
          voice, followed by curators and critics, then public figures and celebrities,
      and lastly the voices of other visitors (Table 2).</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="table2" id="table2"></a><a href="samis-table2.html"><img src="samis_Table2.Samis.thumbnail.png" alt="table2" width="500" height="376" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="samis-table2.html">Table 2: Viewpoints of interest (Discovery Communications,
      2008)</a> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visitors raved about the ability to tap on their
            PDA screen to &ldquo;point&rdquo; at details of an artwork for audio analysis (Fig. 5).
            This &ldquo;Touch-and-Listen&rdquo; feature provides a more granular, interactive audio
            experience in which tapping the handheld screen stands in for pointing at the
        work, and fosters a feeling of dialogical interaction.</li>
    </ul>
      <p class="caption"><img src="samis_Fig5.png" alt="figure 5" width="500" height="667" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 5: Visitor using the Touch-and-Listen feature of the

      <p class="caption"><a name="table3" id="table3"></a><a href="samis-table3.html"><img src="samis_Table3.Samis.thumbnail.png" alt="table 3" width="500" height="376" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="samis-table3.html">Table 3: Preferred multimedia guide features &nbsp;(Discovery Communications, 2008)</a></p>
      <p>In fact, visitors valued this capacity more than videos of
          or about the artist, which always rate highly in visitor preferences (Table 3).
          This finding is not altogether surprising: people are coming to see the
          artworks, after all, and one of the ways a multimedia tour can improve on
          traditional audio tours is to be less long-winded and more specific, responding
      to the visitor&rsquo;s increments of curiosity. </p>
      <p>Written feedback culled from the Antenna Audio Visitor
      Comment Log corroborated visitors&rsquo; enthusiasm for this feature:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>Best audio guide I have taken. I loved touching the screen
      on the details.</em></p>
      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>Loved it! Especially the video segments and that you could
      touch on highlighted bits of the paintings for a detailed explanation.</em></p>
      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>Very nice. One
      of the better audio tours. Favorite one so far. Really liked how you can select different parts of a painting. (Moses) </em></p>
      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>Tour really improved my understanding. Particularly liked
      highlighting sections of picture and historical info. </em></p>
      <p class="BlockQuote"><em>I would like to tap on every work of art. </em></p>
      <h3>Platform preference</h3>
      <p>Much discussion in the museum field has centered lately over
          whether visitors would prefer to use their own devices rather than devices
          supplied by the Museum. It seems that many museums, at least, long for a time
          when they can forego the cost of maintaining either an expensive leasing
          arrangement with an outside provider or their own fleet of devices in a
      constantly evolving hardware environment (Tate, 2008). </p>
      <p>For the moment, it seems that visitors do not yet share this
          view of an ideal, visitor-supplied, platform-agnostic future. For most of them,
          purpose-built, museum-lent or leased devices still seem to fill the bill just
      fine (Tables 4 and 5).</p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="table4" id="table4"></a><a href="samis-table4.html"><img src="samis_Table4.Samis.thumbnail.png" alt="table 4" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="samis-table4.html">Table 4: Guide platform preference: Museum device or
      personal mobile phone (Discovery Communications, 2008)</a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="table5" id="tablee5"></a><a href="samis-table5.html"><img src="samis_Table5.Samis.thumbnail.png" alt="table 5" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="samis-table5.html">Table 5: Guide platform preference: Museum device or
      personal iPod/mp3 device (Discovery Communications, 2008)</a></p>
      <p>So while museums go out of their way to furnish cell phone
          tours and downloadable podcasts, the majority of visitors solidly prefer a
          museum-provided device. And who can blame them? Cell phone reception varies,
          the audio can be poor, and foreign visitors must pay outrageous international
          roaming charges. Furthermore, barring the aid of a headset, users are asked to
          hold devices to their ears for extended periods &ndash; &nbsp;physically taxing for some.
          Podcasts, while offering superior sound quality, require pre-visit planning
          (&ldquo;Oops, I&rsquo;m already here!&rdquo;). Finally, Wi-fi networks are temperamental,
          especially in crowd situations. Until these obstacles are removed, pre-loaded
          devices &ndash; even at a cost &ndash; will correspond to the premium cultural experience
      museums are expected to provide. </p>
      <p>These insights would have stood us in good stead when we
          were preparing the educational technology strategies for the two other shows
          under discussion: &ldquo;246 and Counting&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Art of Participation<i>.</i>&rdquo; In both cases, the museum opted for
          cell phone tours (supplemented in the case of &ldquo;The Art of Participation&rdquo; by a
          podcast feed) as a relatively inexpensive way to deliver quality content to our
          visitors&rsquo; ears. Yet one can always ask, if a cell phone tour broadcasts in a
      museum and nobody listens, is it still there?</p>
      <p>Indeed, the statistics reveal an underwhelming cell-phone
          tour take-up rate. During the six-month run of &ldquo;246 and Counting&rdquo;<i> </i>(July 8, 2008 &ndash; January 5, 2009), the
          museum&rsquo;s Guide By Cell line received a grand total of 3,510 calls &ndash; an average
          of only 19 inbound calls per day. The authors suspect that in large part, these
          low numbers are a consequence of the near-invisibility of the Guide by Cell
          stop information. The lack of space alone &ndash; by the final rotation, 336 design
          objects were densely arrayed in a single gallery &ndash; had precluded the use of
          standard object labels. As a consequence, object information was relegated to a
          set of large-format laminated cards distributed in holders at the entrance and
          exit of the exhibition. On these cards, the objects treated on the cell phone
      audio tour were numbered in red &ndash; but not everybody carried the cards. </p>
      <p>By contrast, the presence of cell phone stops in &ldquo;The Art of
          Participation&rdquo; was clearly indicated directly on the relevant object labels
          (Figure 6). A paragraph of relevant instruction, along with phone number, was
          printed alongside the introductory wall text and listed in the takeaway
          brochure. We were confident that the increased visibility of tour information
          would result in a higher take-up rate among exhibition visitors. The
          statistics, however, told a different story. While reaching a marginally larger
          percentage of overall visitors to the museum, the Participation<i> </i>tour ultimately failed to meet
          expectations. During the three month run of &ldquo;The Art
          of Participation&rdquo;<i> </i>exhibition, a total
          of 2,118 calls accessed the twenty-four stop tour on via the museum&rsquo;s Guide By
          Cell line &ndash; a dismal 22 inbound calls per day, representing a negligible
      percentage of average daily visitorship. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="samis_Fig6.png" alt="figure 6" width="500" height="488" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 6: Sample object label, with cell phone tour stop, from
      The Art of Participation&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Interestingly, the number of visitors who opted to access
          the same content on mp3 devices, rather than cell phones, was nine times higher.
          Over the same three-month period, there were 18,613 downloads of &ldquo;The Art of
          Participation&rdquo; tour stops. Whether those users actually made use of the content
          at home or in the galleries cannot be known from statistics alone. Yet these numbers
          seem to indicate a preference for the higher quality audio and level of comfort
          (headphones) offered by the podcast version, even at the cost of &nbsp;time and
          pre-planning. For this constituency, the just-in-time convenience of using a free
      cell phone tour was not a compelling sell. </p>
      <p>While low usage numbers may be taken to indicate an
          ignorance of the cell phone tour option, a questionnaire administered to
          visitors near the end of &ldquo;The Art of Participation&rdquo; exhibition actually
          surfaced an active antipathy to using cell phone technology for
          interpretation.&nbsp; Among 145 visitors
          surveyed, only 9 said they had opted to use any cell phone tour stops at all,
          while 37 agreed with the phrase, &ldquo;I had no interest in using cell phone tour technology&rdquo;
        (SFMOMA Education Department, 2009). While sample numbers are not high enough
        to be statistically significant, they do seem to indicate a trend that we had
        not anticipated. It would be desirable to see further research at other venues
      on this point.</p>
      <h2>IV. Halo Effect and The Question Of Universal Access </h2>
      <p>Users of the &ldquo;Frida Kahlo&rdquo; multimedia tour, on the other
      hand, were so euphoric that they made the following bold statements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fully 92% of multimedia tour users interviewed
            indicated that they would be either &ldquo;very likely&rdquo; (71%) or &ldquo;somewhat likely&rdquo;
          (21%) to take &ldquo;a tour like this,&rdquo; if it were offered, of SFMOMA&rsquo;s permanent
        collection.</li>
      <li>Even more implausibly, fully 93% stated they
        would be very or somewhat likely to take a tour like this for an exhibition by
        an artist with whom they are less familiar. </li>
    </ul>
      <p class="caption"><a name="table6" id="table6"></a><a href="samis-table6.html"><img src="samis_Table6.Samis.thumbnail.png" alt="table 6" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="samis-table6.html">Table 6: Multimedia tour conversion for permanent
          collection exhibitions &amp; less well known artists
      (Discovery Communications, 2008)</a></p>
      <p>That is what could be called a mega-Halo Effect. Past
          experience at SFMOMA and other museums indicates that traditional permanent
          collection audio tours typically net a mere 3-5% of visitors; similarly,
          exhibitions of artists without major name recognition typically net far lower
          take-up rates than specially ticketed blockbusters. So these numbers may be
          taken as an indication of the enthusiasm visitors felt for the way in which the
          tour had enhanced their experience of the Kahlo exhibition. In fact, as
          demonstrated in Table 7, visitors who had taken the tour were fully 25% more
          likely to rate their overall experience at SFMOMA as &ldquo;very satisfying&rdquo; than
      non-guide users. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="table7" id="table7"></a><a href="samis-table7.html"><img src="samis_Table7.Samis.thumbnail.png" alt="table 7" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="samis-table7.html">Table 7: Satisfaction levels with museum experience among
      multimedia tour users &amp; non-users (Discovery Communications, 2008)</a></p>
      <p>Comments in the Antenna Visitor Comment Log trended in the
          same direction: &ldquo;We WANT more information on every piece of art&rdquo; or, alluding
      to the touch-and-listen feature: &ldquo;I would like to tap on every work of art.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>So, even taking these prognostications of astronomical tour
          take-up rates with a grain of salt, how do we harness the enthusiasm visitors
          felt for multimedia interpretation and channel it into improved visitor
      experience of the (often challenging) art on view? </p>
      <p>The problem is, at the very least, two-fold: one of
          production and another of perception. Merely making a high-quality multimedia
          tour about the permanent collection will not automatically mean visitors with
          years (or decades) of museum-going experience will change their habitrails and
          flock to it, no matter what they say in their elation after seeing a single
          exhibition. Inevitably, old patterns will re-assert themselves as they re-enter
      the building lobby six months hence, or in two years. </p>
      <p>So even as the Kahlo evaluation provides a great vote of
          confidence in the virtues educational technology can bring to bear, and its
          vital role in the interpretive mix &ndash; as opposed to usage rates and opinions
          regarding cell phone offerings, for example &ndash; any campaign to develop a
          comprehensive multimedia tour of the permanent collection, or of special
          exhibitions featuring lesser known artists, must be accompanied by a
          museum-wide strategy to promote these new resources. Marketing a new experience
          plays an essential part in any solution, lest the efforts and resources
          expended come to naught. And price is part of marketing &ndash; although by no means
      the only variable at play.</p>
      <p>In fact, three major New York museums &ndash; the Museum of Modern
          Art, the Whitney, and the Guggenheim &ndash; have recently adopted a Universal Access
          policy, offering audio tours free of charge to every visitor who comes in.
          Indeed, take-up rates have soared from the 3-4% typical when PC tours are
          offered for a fee to between 20&ndash;61%, depending on the museum and the other
      exhibitions on view (Bodinson, 2009; Potts, 2009; Krantz, 2009).&nbsp; </p>
      <p>(In the case of MoMA, the universal access policy coincided
          with a rise in the admission price to $20, corresponding with the opening of a
          new building. Present ticket prices at the Guggenheim and Whitney are $18 and
      $15, respectively.) </p>
      <h2>V. Closing Reflections &ndash; Without Saying &ldquo;One Size Fits All&rdquo;</h2>
      <p>So what have we learned? While visitors continue to
          gravitate to the analog resources (especially wall texts) first, a significant
          percentage enthusiastically embraced the Frida Kahlo multimedia tour and said
          they would be eager to transfer that behavior to both permanent collection
          exhibitions and shows featuring artists who are less well known to them. On the
          other hand, tours distributed primarily by cell phone technology failed to meet
          expectations and play the role they had been allocated in interpretive
          planning.&nbsp; The information we had
          hoped to convey at little or no cost to a wider audience through their use fell
      largely on fallow ground. </p>
      <p>Visitors apparently are not as eager to use their own
          devices as museums might wish; rather, they appear to desire a high fidelity,
          immersive experience that focuses their attention on the specifics of the works
          in front of them. In this light, the parsing out of audio messages through a
      touch-and-listen interface is a winner.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>However, before we drink the Kool-Aid and believe that just
          because we build a mobile multimedia tour, visitors will take it, museums would
          do well to remember the notoriously low take-up rates for paid permanent
          collection audio tours &ndash; even at bastions of high culture like the Louvre and
          the Metropolitan. With that in mind, so-called universal access &ndash; offering
          devices free of charge to all visitors &ndash; seems to be the way of the future. (Of
      course, visitors are always free not to avail themselves of the offer.)</p>
      <p>One might ask: in proposing such a multimedia tour, are we
          imposing a fundamental change on the quality of most museum-goers&rsquo;
      experience? One that de-privileges direct perception? </p>
      <p>No.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">One that presumes people&rsquo;s direct perception can be
      supported and encouraged?</p>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">What, then, are the top three takeaways from the
          Interpretive Goals process &ndash; in which the particular challenges of each
          exhibition are collaboratively considered, and the solutions developed then
      evaluated whenever possible? </p>
      <ol>
        <li>One
            is that it is only through concerted planning and collaboration across all
            departments of the museum that visitor experience can be addressed, nurtured,
        and improved. </li>
      <li>A
        second is that if the institution is going to delegate significant aspects of
        the interpretive load to new technology devices, then it becomes imperative
        that those devices be made as effortlessly available to users as the wall texts
        and artworks. </li>
      <li>Finally,
        although it is not explored in this paper, our findings indicate the need for a
        flexible authoring and publishing platform for mobile devices, to which we can
        publish quality multimedia content casually, on an as-needed basis, with full
        confidence that it will reach our visitors when they need and value it most. </li>
    </ol>
      <p>But that is the subject for another paper!</p>
