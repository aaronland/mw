    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Maybe you&rsquo;re supposed to overhaul your institution&rsquo;s Web
	    site. Or maybe you&rsquo;ve been directed to visualize and implement new on-line
	    initiatives. Other than knowing your stakeholders&rsquo; wish lists and extensive
	    ideas for Web site content and features &ndash; from blogs to on-line collections &ndash; you
	    don&rsquo;t have a clear plan of action. You don&rsquo;t even have a defense strategy for
	    why or why not to invest in some of their requests. How, then, can your team
	    drive decision-making? How can you get features implemented based on rational
	    reasons, while balancing institutional goals and audience needs &ndash; all without
      going over budget? </p>
    <p>This mini-workshop will focus on an often-overlooked core
	    Web site activity: the Feature Prioritization Workshop. You will be introduced
	    to prioritization techniques and tools, how and when to use them, methods for
	    navigating the myriad needs and wants of stakeholders, and some approaches for
	    achieving compromise. You will learn to balance &ldquo;requirements&rdquo; with &ldquo;desires&rdquo;
      by using concrete proof points and a convincing defense. </p>
    <p>And you will also learn about building a phased roadmap
	    that will accommodate the immediate needs of your organization at launch, yet
      will provide a plan for future iterations and builds. </p>
    <h2>A Little Background</h2>
    <p>I work at a user-centered design agency in San Francisco
	    called Hot Studio. We&rsquo;ve been around for more than 10 years, and throughout
	    this time have had the pleasure of working on hundreds of Web sites for many
	    clients, both large and small, non-profit to Fortune 500. Sometimes we do
	    complete redesigns, sometimes we do brand new sites, and sometimes we focus on
	    redesigning parts of existing sites. In all cases, we rely heavily on our
	    clients to be subject matter experts: for example, people working at a bank
      will know far more about financials than we will. </p>
    <p>Our area of expertise, other than in actual design methods
	    and principles, is in uncovering our clients&rsquo; audiences&rsquo; motivations and
	    desires. We do this through extensive research, be it new research that we
	    conduct ourselves, or existing research our clients provide for us. Usually it
	    is a combination of both. During this process we uncover plenty of ideas of
	    what the Website should do, and what content it should have on it, ideas that
	    come from stakeholders and from users. On a parallel track, we are informing
	    and sharing the ideas with the project engineers so they are aware of what
	    items we recommend should be built, and how we&rsquo;re thinking about designing
      them.</p>
    <p>More often than not, stakeholder requirements and
	    requests, user needs, and technical parameters are not in synch.  We usually
	    uncover far too many potential features and content items that can be created
	    within the project timeframe, or the budget doesn&rsquo;t support the entire list, or
	    there isn&rsquo;t enough staff to do the work. This is where prioritizing becomes
	    required to move forward with the project. It is also a great method to gain
      consensus with stakeholders.</p>
    <h2>What is a Feature? And Where Does Content Fit?</h2>
    <p>A feature in the world of software can be defined as &ldquo;a
	    capability.&rdquo; In the world of Web sites, we tend to think of features as tools,
	    components, widgets, or some other self-contained interactive thing where a
	    user can do something. A video is a feature. RSS feeds are features. An
	    interactive flash marketing campaign is a feature. A comment input field is a
      feature.</p>
    <p>What about something bigger and more complicated, like
	    site search and results? And aren&rsquo;t the results content rather than a feature?
      And what about requirements?</p>
    <p>Again, in the world of software, engineers got it right
	    when deconstructing something big into its discreet parts, and prioritizing
	    based on the parts, not just the single multi-faceted feature. Complicated
	    features are often referred to as feature-sets, and broken out into separate
	    sub-features. For example, in order to build <b>search</b>, it&rsquo;s not only about
	    the end-user interface and the supporting back end. It&rsquo;s about metadata, SEO,
	    content types, the amount and type of information to show in results, what
	    order the results should be displayed in, whether the results can be sorted or
	    filtered, if the user can save the results or even the initial search
      criteria&hellip;it can go on and on. </p>
    <p>Looking at this search example, it gets pretty tricky to
	    distinguish between what is defined as a &ldquo;feature&rdquo; and what is defined as
  &ldquo;content,&rdquo; while somehow including requirements in all of this. We actually
	    don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary on Web sites, especially functional sites, to make
	    distinctions among these in order to prioritize them. Actually, by including
  &ldquo;content&rdquo; when prioritizing, we make sure that all bases are covered when
	    determining if the necessary resources exist. Who is going to WRITE this stuff,
      let alone build it?</p>
    <h2>What is Feature Prioritization?</h2>
    <p>Simply stated, it&rsquo;s a method for balancing multiple inputs
	    from multiple groups, elevating the useful and important, and pushing back
	    irrelevant or perhaps overly complicated ideas. Prioritizing features and
	    content can be tackled in a variety of ways, but first and foremost, it is not
	    a scientific method. Think about it as ranking features and content, and then
	    sorting the features and content from highest ranked to lowest ranked. Those
      ranked highest should be considered in scope for your Web site. </p>
    <p>When prioritizing features and content, it&rsquo;s common to end
	    up with some parts of a complex feature-set (search) being highly ranked, and
	    some parts ranking lower. The higher ranked parts can still be considered for
      launch while lower ranked parts can be added in later in a phased project plan.</p>
    <p>Simple, right?</p>
    <h2>Why Do It in a Workshop?</h2>
    <p>It isn&rsquo;t really that simple. It&rsquo;s a simple method to
	    grasp, to rally around and use internally, but the process of ranking can be
	    tricky. The most important component of the workshop is to invite the right
      people.</p>
    <p>Representatives of an institution (stakeholders),
	    representatives of the institution&rsquo;s technical environment, and representatives
	    of the institution&rsquo;s users (usually these are your design or Web team) need to
	    be involved. When Hot conducts these workshops with our clients, we always play
	    the role of the user.  These three representatives need to rank each of the
	    features and content from their perspective. Will it benefit the institution?
	    How easy or hard is it to build (or how long will it take)? Does your audience
	    really care about it? Getting the right people in the same room discussing each
	    feature from these respective views, while time-consuming, is invaluable for
      achieving consensus with a collective understanding of constraints.</p>
    <p>In many cases the engineering team will need further
	    discussion and more detailed definition to be able to scope features. We always
	    expect to spend more time with the representatives to explain design ideas, and
	    we take care to compromise. We need to understand the constraints of the Web
	    site back-end, and quite often we can&rsquo;t make extreme (let alone subtle) changes
      to some core functionality. </p>
    <h2>Why Involve the Audience Point of View?</h2>
    <p>Cultural institutions have fairly demanding audiences.
	    They have high expectations. One of the many challenges is to create in-person
	    programs and experiences that go beyond audience expectations, that surprise
	    them and perhaps even transform them. In these cases, we must make decisions
	    that may be influenced by audience feedback but certainly isn&rsquo;t always dictated
      by them.</p>
    <p>When it comes to an institution&rsquo;s Web site, how far should
	    we translate the in-person experience to this on-line medium? What are the
	    basic necessities that the audience needs from the Web site, what can enrich
	    their on-line visit, and what would go beyond their expectations? Again, in
	    some cases we may not choose to heed direct feedback found through research,
	    but in many cases, the audience knows what they need from the Web site better
      than we do. </p>
    <p>Inviting this third point of view into the mix, balancing
	    the institution&rsquo;s point of view and the technical point of view, often brings
      clarity to internal conflicting priorities. </p>
    <p>Consider the following questions: </p>
    <ol class="listwithnumbers">
      <li>Is the feature or content solving the audience&rsquo;s problem? </li>
      <li>Is it adding value?</li>
      <li>Is it making something easier to use or do? </li>
      <li>Is it enhancing their relationship to the institution?</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>When Should It be Done?</h2>
    <p>From Hot&rsquo;s perspective, a feature prioritization workshop
	    takes place after some design thinking has taken place. Note that I&rsquo;ve said
      design THINKING, not design commitment. </p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ve already conducted research, and we have an
	    understanding of institutional requirements and vision, user needs, and the
	    technical landscape. We&rsquo;ve begun planning how the site will be organized, drawn
	    out the tasks that people need to be able to do, and how some pages might be
      structured.  We have begun sketching out some functionality. </p>
    <p>We have not begun applying any visual design. In fact, we
	    haven&rsquo;t even begun to finalize any aspect of the design. This is pre-design,
	    the strategy phase, where we&rsquo;re coming up with the big ideas that can solve the
      problems that our research has surfaced.</p>
    <p>So why conduct the workshop at this point, and not when
	    we&rsquo;re doing the actual design? Because by the time we&rsquo;ve begun designing, we&rsquo;ve
	    committed to the way the site is structured, how the content is organized, and
	    how the features work; but we may not have understood the technical
	    ramifications involved in building the site this way. Or we may not know that
	    one of the pages we&rsquo;ve focused on is far less important to the institution than
	    a different page. Or that simply because in our research the target audiences
	    seemed really excited about a particular feature, we find out later that it
	    doesn&rsquo;t align to institutional goals. It can be very difficult to back-track at
      this point.</p>
    <p>Remember: Web sites aren&rsquo;t cookie-cutter, features are
	    never generic, <i>and content is never final</i>.
	    As we go through strategy, we will find that we need to add components or
	    functionality, or that some new content needs to be written, or that what we
	    thought was easy to build isn&rsquo;t. Defining features and content before designing
	    them is of utmost importance. What we think may be simple at first can end up
	    becoming complex as we think through how someone might use it, and it&rsquo;s vital
      to keep the team informed of evolving ideas.</p>
    <p>A feature prioritization workshop is a collaborative
	    method of bringing everyone up to date, and involving them in the
      decision-making process. </p>
    <h2>What is the Outcome?</h2>
    <p>Each feature in your list will have a different ranking by
	    the institution, by the user, and by technology. A simple ranking method is as
      follows: </p>
    <ol class="listwithnumbers">
      <li>Institutional importance: 5=high, 1=low</li>
      <li>Audience importance: 5=high, 1=low</li>
      <li>Technical implementation: 5=simple, 1=difficult</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A feature might be ranked the following way:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Feature name<p></p></th>
        <th>Institutional rank<p></p></th>
        <th>User rank<p></p></th>
        <th>Technical rank<p></p></th>
        <th>Average<p></p></th></tr>
      <tr>
        <td ><p align="center">Buy tickets online</p></td>
        <td><p align="center">4</p></td>
        <td><p align="center">5</p></td>
        <td><p align="center">2</p></td>
        <td><p>(4+5+2) / 3= 3.66</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
    <p>After ranking and sorting the results, the highest ranked
	    features and content will float to the top of the list, some will move to the
	    middle, and some will be ranked fairly low. In a perfect world, the highest
	    ranked items can be what you focus on for your site launch, the middle tier
	    gets moved to phase two, and the bottom ranked items get moved to the future or
      even get cut altogether.</p>
    <p>While I would like to suggest it&rsquo;s this straightforward
	    (again, sorry), there are two common and important considerations that can
      affect this tidy outcome: </p>
    <ul class="listwithbullets">
      <li>stakeholders reemerge </li>
      <li>future resources need to be considered (staffing, maintenance, additional
        technical systems&hellip;). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the end, it&rsquo;s really up to the institution whether a
	    feature is implemented or not, regardless of how it is ranked overall. The
	    institution may override the low technical ranking and require that the new
	    site include on-line ticket purchasing; in which case the team needs to figure
      out how to keep it in scope.</p>
    <p>Additionally, an on-line ticketing system may have never
	    been considered when budgeting for your Website design project. So while it may
	    be ranked as important and valuable, the cost is deemed prohibitive for launch,
	    so it gets pushed to phase two after the institution receives additional
      funding.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>One of those most valuable aspects of a feature
	    prioritization workshop is the involvement of key decision-makers, in the same
	    room, setting priorities in a group environment.  While it can be time
	    consuming, often requiring further meetings and discussion, in the end we
	    emerge with consensus and a plan of action. Compromise and tradeoffs are
      inevitable, but the right people are making hard choices as a group.</p>
    <p>Timing is important. Doing this workshop after the design
      thinking and before design commitment offers two key benefits:</p>
    <ul class="listwithbullets">
      <li>We will already have a sense of how we want the site to be
	      organized, how some of the big ideas play out, and what the key interactions
	      will be. All can help participants understand how features might work and what
	      content may need to be created &ndash; knowledge that can only benefit the ranking
	      process.</li>
      <li>We haven&rsquo;t committed to detailed design. So if we find out that
	      an idea is too complicated or deemed unnecessary, we haven&rsquo;t yet invested a lot
	      of time and resources into an idea that ends up being excluded from the project
	      plan.</li>
</ul>
    <p>In the end, all of this work is worth the effort. It will
	    pay off in the long run &ndash; especially since all of the decisions are now
	    defendable: the whole team is in alignment about priorities, and this means the
      Web site design will ultimately reflect these priorities.</p>
