    <p class="AbstractText">In this paper we identify the
		    art historical reasons for seeking to develop a
		    3-D, interactive, walk-through computer model for one of the greatest works of
		    the Italian Early Renaissance. We
		    further describe how the problem was solved and how it was made available to
	    the public at large on-line.</p>

    <h2>Looking at the Frescoes: Historical Background</h2>
    <p>St. Francis of Assisi came to Arezzo in the early years of
		    the 13th century where he found a city torn with internal strife. With one of
		    his many miracles, Francis brought peace to the community and blessed it with
		    the vision of a great golden cross spreading its arms across the sky. As a
		    result, his friars were allowed to congregate in a small community outside the
		    walls and preach their message of love and salvation. By the early fifteenth
		    century, the Franciscan Friary had moved into town where it built an imposing
		    church dedicated to its founder. The apse end, rebuilt after a fire, was
		    awaiting decoration. It was the custom in such establishments &ndash; always in need
		    of financial support &ndash; to lease out space within the buildings to families to
		    use as burial grounds. This privilege brought the friars monetary contributions
		    for upkeep and/or enhancements of paintings, sculpture, and other church
		    furnishings. The chapels on either side of the main apse had already been
		    painted in the late 14th century, but the chancel itself, the Cappella
		    Maggiore, which had been leased to the local Bacci family, was still without
      decoration.</p>
    <p>After complaints from the friars in the 1440s, the Bacci
		    sons sold a vineyard and other real estate to acquire the cash to begin paying
		    for a campaign of fresco painting. As was usual, the administrators of the
		    church, the Franciscans, were the ones who chose the appropriate subject
		    matter, in this case, a subject dear to St. Francis&rsquo;s devotion, the Legend of
		    the True Cross. The apocryphal narrative was set on the three vertical walls of
		    the chapel, with paintings on the triumphal arch and the vault creating a
		    scheme of redemption under the authority of Papal Rome. Bicci di Lorenzo, an
		    aging artist from Florence, was hired. He and his workshop started at the top
		    (frescos are always painted from the top down because of dripping), completing
		    a scene of the Last Judgement high up on the entrance arch, and the four
		    Evangelists on the webs of the ribbed vault. Apparently during this operation,
		    in 1452 Bicci di Lorenzo grew ill and returned to Florence where he died. Members
		    of his shop continued the work for a short while, painting most of the
		    decorations of the ribs and other structural members and at the least, two
		    standing figures of the four Fathers of the Church that are just below the
		    vault. Then they too left Arezzo. Only after this sequence of events was Piero
      della Francesca called in to complete the project.</p>
    <p>Ever since the early 20<sup>th</sup> century when European
		    artists took Piero as their favorite, he has had the reputation as the one
		    Renaissance painter whose calm, forceful, and supremely imposing figures could
		    be enjoyed by everyone without regards for their religious content. His high-toned colors, his geometrically perfect forms and spaces,
		    his mesmerizing light flows and volumetric shadows satisfied the current visual
		    hunger for simplicity, purity, and strength. In this vein, one critic even
		    called him &ldquo;the first Cubist&rdquo;. In the 15th century, however, it was a different
		    matter. Piero&rsquo;s work, like that of almost all mid-15th century artists, served
		    a religious purpose. As a result, there is no separation between what he
		    represented and the way he represented it, between his form and his content. Moreover,
		    while he was recognized as a maestro of painting, he was also honored as a
		    great mathematician. The three important treatises he wrote (on algebra,
		    geometry, and perspective for painters) are acknowledged as among the most
		    important of his time. These interests are reflected in his paintings and may,
      to some extent, explain his appeal to the modern eye.</p>
    <p>In spite of his current fame, it is somewhat surprising to
		    find that there are no documents recording his Arezzo commission. We do not
		    know when Piero was engaged (only that it was after 1452). We do not know what
		    he was told to do (only that it was to paint the Legend of the True Cross, a
		    subject used in many other Franciscan churches). We do not know who or how many
		    men worked under him (although at least the name of one assistant, Giovanni di
		    Piamonte, is known from other sources). And we do not know when he finished the
		    job; we know only that in 1466 the frescoes were referred to in the past tense,
		    and so we may assume that they were complete. Thus all the information we have
		    comes the frescoes themselves. And they are some of the most challenging
      paintings of the Early Renaissance.</p>

    <h2>The Legend and its Disposition</h2>
    <p>One of the most demanding aspects of the cycle is
  the way Piero arranged the scenes on the walls. Although the story of the Cross
  is of longue dur&eacute; - a compilation of medieval legends beginning in the time of
  Genesis and progressing to the 7th century A.D. - it follows a simple
  chronological sequence. One might expect such a narrative told visually to
  &quot;read&quot; like pages in a book;  that is, to start on the left at the
  top; move from left to right, and proceed down the walls, tier after tier. Piero
  chose not to tell the story in this manner, but to rearrange the sequence in a
  dramatic way. He placed his Genesis scenes not on the left, but on the right
  wall at the top and made them read &quot;backwards&quot; from right to left. He
  put the next episodes on the second tier and reversed the order to read left to
  right. He then had the story jump to the second tier of the right side of the
  altar wall and progress diagonally down to the lowest tier on the left side,
  and so on. Figure 2 shows how the &quot;Narrative Sequence&quot; continues in
  this &quot;irregular fashion,&quot; ending, not at the bottom but at the top
  tier of the left wall!</p>
<p>The legacy of Piero's
  &quot;rearranged&quot; chronology has two parts: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Jumping around the space reminds one of the
    chaotic rhythms of a medieval romance, the Roman de la Rose, for example. Such
    stories, which apparently St. Francis loved when he was a boy, are full of
    adventure, with stalwart knights and ladies fair, and always a moral overtone
    and religious goal. Their structures are full of surprising stops and starts,
    changes of direction, and what the modern mind considers to be irrational time
    changes. The Legend of the True Cross, as it developed, came out of this very
    tradition, and Piero did not want his viewers to forget this fact.</li>
  <li> At the same time, Piero&rsquo;s arrangement makes the
    story take on another character, one that is abstract in nature and serious in
    implication. The two lunettes at the top of the side walls match, showing the
    beginning and the end of the story, each centered in the wood of the cross. The
    second tiers match; they express the power of royal women who are divinely
    inspired to recognize the holy wood. On the altar wall, scenes on either side
    of the window match: the top tiers show Old Testament prophets who foresaw the
    coming of Christianity and the story of the cross; the second tiers represent a
    form of comic relief with serious undertones. They are genre scenes of every day
    that allude to Christ&rsquo;s passion and the Eucharist. The bottom tiers also match.
    Both are scenes of annunciation: one of the birth of Christ, the other the
    birth of Christianity. The bottom tiers on the side walls match. They are
    scenes of battle: one is a bloodless victory over fellow Romans at the sign of
    the cross, and the other is a bloody battle for victory over the blasphemous
    infidels. Figure 3 shows this &quot;Thematic Balance.&quot; The effect of this
    new arrangement creates the symmetry and balance, the gravity and dignity
    required by Aristotle and Horace for creating epic poetry. By dint of his
    re-organized disposition, Piero achieved what might be called the first modern
    epic.</li>

    <h2>Our Project</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst">We have just presented the fresco cycle's
  &quot;pattern(s) of disposition&quot; in the traditional manner; that is, with
		    diagrams. This technique is helpful but lifeless and entirely antiquated. Our
		    goal was to find a way to modernize the whole procedure. To do so, we created
		    an Interactive Computer Model that is now available on-line, free of charge, so
		    that the viewer can move through the space of the chapel to follow the
		    sequence(s) as Piero conceived them. Remember, he never had a chance to see the
		    frescoes in this manner. While he was working, the chapel was full of
		    scaffolding, and he would have had no way to step back for a general view. And
		    even Piero couldn't fly. At the same time the Model provides high-resolution
		    images of all the paintings, scanned from photographs taken after the recent
	    restoration campaign, some of which were carried out in 1:1 proportions.</p>

    <h1>Brief History of  the Project</h1>
    <p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst">In our quest to improve the viewing of large-scale
		    fresco paintings in monumental buildings - studying the paintings and keeping
		    their context - the first fifteen years were carried out at Princeton
		    University. Working with Kirk D. Alexander and members of his staff at
		    Princeton University&rsquo;s then new Computer Center, by 1992 we had developed a
		    computer model in which it was possible to navigate throughout the chapel,
		    follow the patterns of disposition, and study the paintings in detail. We
		    attached audio commentary for each scene, giving both art historical and technical
		    information. The equipment at that point was the Silicon Graphics VGX IRIS
		    workstation and early versions of Oracle and Traveler. By 1995, we used this
	    equipment for an art history seminar in a classroom with 24 workstations.</p>
    <p>As time went on, with new technical developments
		    it became possible to run the model from a CD and show it on a normal PC, and
		    finally on a LapTop. This improvement made it easier to display the Model and
		    use it for lectures and classes in &ldquo;smart&rdquo; classrooms that were developing in
		    increasing numbers. In 1999 I made arrangements with the Superintendent of the
		    Ministry of Fine Arts in Arezzo whereby new photographs taken by Alessandro
		    Benci, official photographer of the Ministry, could be mapped into the Model in
		    exchange for permission for the Ministry to show the Model for its own
		    purposes. The arrangement was made with the understanding that each entity
		    would acknowledge the contribution of the other at each showing. The Ministry
		    mounted the Model in two workstations in the church of San Francesco in Arezzo
		    for use by visitors after they had been through the church and had seen the
      frescoed chapel itself.</p>
    <p>Although this achievement was very gratifying, we
		    still felt that the number of viewers was too restricted, limited to individual
		    lectures and travel to Arezzo. The first step in our search for a broader
		    public was to achieve independence. In 2000, Princeton University relinquished
		    all copyright claims on the Model and the Arezzo Ministry gave free use of the
		    photographs for non-profit purposes. Lavin, Alexander, and Benci became the
  &ldquo;authors&rdquo; of the Model, responsible for its use and its dissemination.</p>
    <p>Our final goal was realized in August of 2008. After
		    all these many years of work, the Piero cycle of the True Cross is on the Web,
		    available to the public with all its bells and whistles. By good luck Kirk, at
		    the 2007 conference of Museums and the Web (Archives &amp; Museum Informatics)
		    in San Francisco, CA, met two member of the Scuola Superiore Sant&rsquo;Anna in Pisa,
		    Italy: Franco Tecchia and Marcello Carrozzino. In conversations with them, he
		    discovered that they work precisely in the field of 3-D virtual reality and in
		    mounting cultural heritage material on the Web. Kirk solicited their help and
      after various meetings, they enthusiastically joined our project. </p>
    <p>To mount the model on the Web, Marcello obtained
		    the use of the XVR ActiveX plug-in from its parent company, VRMEDIA s.r.l, and
		    he constructed many important new enhancements. XVR is a technology that was
		    created for the development of Web-enabled virtual reality (VR) applications
		    (Carrozzino et al, 2005). In recent years it had evolved into all-round systems
		    software for interactive applications. Supporting a wide range of VR devices
		    and using a state-of-the-art graphics engine for the real-time visualization of
		    complex three-dimensional models, XVR enables the function of applications
      ranging from simple 3D Web presentations to advanced off-line VR installations. </p>
    <p>As opposed to VRML products, which are based on a
		    simple declarative language, XVR-driven applications use a dedicated scripting
		    language whose concepts and commands are specifically targeted at VR. As a
		    result, in the on-line version of the Model, interaction with the viewer is
      more flexible, responsive, and visually effective.</p>
    <p>When connecting to the Piero model URL, the
		    browser downloads the XVR plug-in; this happens only once. Subsequently, the
		    application data are downloaded and stored in a local cache, in order to speed
		    future connections. The application also allows for free navigation throughout
		    the model and provides a graphic user interface (GUI) which is embedded in the
		    3D window and implemented within XVR for user interaction. An interesting side
		    effect is that XVR is also able to drive immersive instalations. As a result,
		    with minimal configuration changes, the application may be experienced on
      stereoscopic devices like Head Mounted Display, CAVE-like systems, and so on.</p>

    <p class="caption"><a href="lavin-fig6.html">Fig 6: Immersive navigation of the model</a></p>
    <p>At this time, the
	    application is fully available on the Internet Explorer browser at <a href="../http://projects.ias.edu/pierotruecross" target="_blank">http://projects.ias.edu/pierotruecross</a>.</p>
    <p>There is a separate
		    page containing all the high-resolution still images that is open to users with
	    all browsers.</p>
    <p class="caption"><a name="fig7" id="fig7"></a><a href="lavin-fig7.html"><img src="lavin.Fig7-w.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="500" height="403" /></a></p>
    <p class="caption"><a href="lavin-fig7.html">Fig 7: Splayed view of Chapel; high resolution images
      available with double click</a></p>
    <p>Placing the Model on the Web required forfeiting a
		    certain amount of resolution in the 3D-model. But at the same time, the
		    embedded high resolution images, now accompanied by further historical
		    material, are better than ever since they can be manipulated with the ZoomIt
		    program that brings detailed viewing to an ever higher level of quality. The
		    Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ, is generously hosting the site. At
		    the moment, the audio commentary is available in English. We hope, in the near
		    future, to have a mirror site with commentary in Italian, hosted on Marcello&rsquo;s
	    side of the Atlantic Ocean to speed the download for our European visitors.</p>
