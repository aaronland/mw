        <p class="AbstractText">In this paper, we address what mechanisms are at play
		    when using on-line maps in a museum context to trigger and expand visitors&rsquo;
	      involvement with an exhibition and its content. Our analysis is based on a
		    comparison of two case studies carried out at Media Lab Helsinki in close
		    cooperation with two museums in Finland: one with Kiasma, the museum of contemporary
		    art in Helsinki, and the other with Design Museum Helsinki. Both made use of Open
		    Source software (Urban Mediator and ImaNote) allowing users to leave comments
		    in text or audio-visual format. These comments are visualized through the map
	    components of the systems. </p>
	    <p class="AbstractText">To get maximum value from user participation, museums

	    <h2>1. Community-Generated Content in the Museum </h2>
	    <p>Motivating the creation of visitor-generated content in museums
		    and galleries is a new tendency. In the context of museums, User-Generated
		    content (UGC) has also been referred to as <i>visitor authored content</i> (Simon, 2007), <i>visitor response </i>(McLean
	      &amp; Pollock, 2007) and <i>visitor
		      contributed content</i> (Fisher et al., 2008). Wakkary has highlighted the
		    importance of including the voice of scientists working in the museum because
		    their localized knowledge offers another view of the artifacts displayed
		    (Wakkary, 2005). Kevin Walker has also observed the benefit of a system that
		    links &ldquo;curatorial and user-generated content&rdquo; (Walker, 2008, pp 114). As design-researchers
		    working outside the museum context, we have witnessed this transition towards UGC,
		    specifically the role that new media and exhibition designers have in
		    motivating collaborations within the museum community that lead to this sort of
	    production. </p>
	    <p>We propose to use the term &ldquo;community-generated content&rdquo;
	      instead, because it is the way to break open the visitors/staff dichotomy. Community-generated
		    content is used here to refer to content produced by visitors, staff (including
		    guards, guides, curators, educators, marketing specialists, cleaning personnel,
	    volunteers), as well as external researchers, artists or designers. </p>
	    <p>In a previous project, we used an on-line map as an
		    interface where comments about the works in an exhibition could be gathered,
		    and this proved successful. Visitors could identify the artwork that they
		    wished to comment on and place their comment on the map (Salgado &amp;
	      D&iacute;az-Kommonen, 2006). In this paper, we analyze two additional case studies
		    where the museum community was able to annotate and comment using on-line maps.
		    The first case involved the use of the Urban Mediator (UM) software in the
		    context of an exhibition at Kiasma, the museum of contemporary art in Helsinki.
		    Urban Mediator offers the possibility to put comments on a city map, in this
		    case the map of Helsinki. The second case entailed the use of the ImaNote
		    software at the Design Museum in Helsinki. Through ImaNote, it is possible to
	    comment on a compiled image made out of the objects planned to be in the exhibition. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="Salgado.fig1-w.jpg" alt="figure 1" width="500" height="640" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 1: Urban Mediator
	    Helsinki and The Secret Life of Objects  </p>
	    <h2>2. Presentation of the Case Studies</h2>
	    <p>The two case studies were developed at Media Lab Helsinki in
		    cooperation with the two museums. Both
		      bring into play the use of Open Source software. Both softwares, Urban Mediator
		      (<a href="../http://mlab.taik.fi/urbanmediator/">http://mlab.taik.fi/urbanmediator/</a>) and ImaNote (<a href="../http://taik.fi/imanote/">http://taik.fi/imanote/</a>),
		    enable users to leave comments in text or audio-visual format related to the
		    themes or the artifacts in the exhibition. These comments are visualized
	    through the map components of the systems.</p>
	    <p>The work was led by two different teams, each with a
		    different research agenda. The proposed strategies for collaboration between design-researchers
		    from Media Lab and the museum staff were also different in each case. Whereas
		    ImaNote was designed with the museum context in mind, UM was not, and hence its
		    use here was more experimental. Moreover, the time and commitment to the
		    project varied in each case. The ImaNote project at the Design Museum lasted
		    for several months (from October 2007 to June 2008) and demanded more time and
	    dedication than the Urban Mediator project at Kiasma (see Table 1). </p>
	    <p>Regardless of the differences in agendas and strategies, we
		    chose to approach these two cases jointly in this paper precisely because of
		    the important concerns they bring out with regard to designing digitally
	    mediated participation in museums.</p>

	    <p class="caption">Table 1: Comparison of ImaNote and Urban Mediator</p>
	    <h3>2.1 Urban Mediator in Kiasma</h3>
	    <p>Urban Mediator was developed by the Arki research group as one
		    of the activities carried out by the EU-funded ICING research project
		    (Innovative Cities for the Next Generation, 2006-2008). Urban Mediator is a server-based
		    software that provides a way for communities to mediate local location-based
		    discussions, activities, and information. Urban Mediator uses a map-portrayal
		    service as a means to represent location-based information and complements that
		    information with a set of tools designed to allow users to process, share and
		    organize it. Urban Mediator functions can also be embedded in Web sites using
		    various Urban Mediator Web widgets. Since June 2008, UM has been available as
		    an Open Source software package. Several Urban Mediators have been set up and
		    are available on-line for public use, including UM Helsinki (<a
href="../http://um.uiah.fi/hel">http://um.uiah.fi/hel</a>), which was
	    used in the Kiasma case.</p>
	    <p>In developing UM, the goal was to experiment with solutions
		    that would permit city administrations and citizens to share location-based
		    information. The efforts were therefore focused on possibilities for city-citizen
		    information sharing, and many of the study cases dealt with participatory
		    projects defined in collaboration with planners from city administrations in Helsinki
		    (Saad-Sulonen &amp; Suzi, 2007; Botero &amp; Saad-Sulonen, 2008; Saad-Sulonen &amp; Botero, 2008). </p>
	    <p>The UM was in use in Spring 2008 in various projects
		    engaging the general public (Saad-Sulonen &amp; Botero, 2008). The Kiasma staff
		    learned about UM and decided to see whether it could be used as a tool for public
		    intervention in the upcoming exhibition <b>Fluid
		      Street</b>. Along with the art exhibited at the Museum,
		    they were going to organize a series of walks in the city, inviting the public
		    to take part in documenting various aspects of the city, such as art and
		    artistic expression in the streets, and nature in the city. These walks were to
		    be led by artists or experts, and the idea was for participants to document
		    (with digital photos) or take notes and then place these on the map of Helsinki,
		    available via UM, on a computer set up for that purpose in Kiasma. Moreover,
		    anyone could also use UM on-line. For the UM designers, this case was
		    interesting as it made it possible to test UM in a different context from urban
	    planning, this time in the context of public participation in museums.</p>
	    <p>In order to introduce the Urban Mediator software as a tool
		    for this project, a co-design session was organized for the designers and some
		    of the museum staff. Paper and pen prototypes of the software were used for
		    exploring the key features and the customizable elements. Since the Kiasma Web master
		    was at that session, it was easy to decide how the Urban Mediator Web widgets
		    would be included on the Kiasma Web site, enabling the site&rsquo;s visitors to interact
		    directly with the Urban Mediator topic created for the exhibition. Except for
		    two short meetings and e-mail exchanges, after that initial session there was
	    not much more collaboration between Mlab and Kiasma teams. </p>
	    <p>This project did not elicit many contributions from museum
		    visitors, tour participants or Web site visitors. The main reason might have
		    been the lack of active collaborations in designing ways for inviting people to
		    contribute. The reasons for this limited success will be further discussed in
	    the following sections. </p>
	    <h3>2.2 ImaNote in the Design Museum</h3>
	    <p>The System of Representation Research Group (<a
href="../http://sysrep.uiah.fi/">http://sysrep.uiah.fi</a>) has been
		    working on the development of ImaNote, an image map notebook annotation tool (<a
href="../http://imanote.uiah.fi/">http://imanote.uiah.fi</a>). As a type
		    of social software, ImaNote is a Web-based multi-user tool that allows users to display a high-resolution image or a collection of images on-line
		      and add annotations and links to those images. It is possible to make annotations
		      related to a certain point or area in the image. Using RSS (Really Simple
		      Syndication), users can keep track of the annotations added to the image or
		      make links to share the image with others. ImaNote is
		        an Open Source and Free Software released under the GNU General Public Licence
		        (GPL). It is a Zope product, written in Python. Zope (<a href="../http://www.zope.org/">http://www.zope.org</a>)
        and ImaNote run on almost all operating systems. </p>
	    <p>ImaNote was initially
		    created to share cultural heritage content connected to two cartographic
		    specimens: Carta Marina, and Map of Mexico 1550. Its development was a
		    collaborative effort involving the Systems of Representation and the Learning
		    Environments research groups of the Media Lab at the University of Art and
	    Design, Helsinki. </p>
	    <p>&ldquo;The Secret Life of
		    Objects&rdquo; was the name of the project in which ImaNote was used in the
		    Design Museum to gather user-generated content. In 2005, the first trial in
		    which ImaNote was implemented according to the same logic took place in
		    Kunsthall, Helsinki (Salgado &amp; D&iacute;az-Kommonen,
        2006).</p>
	    <p>In the context of this project, the Design Museum in
		    Helsinki offered two events and four workshops to the public. Additionally, through
		    one seminar and several meetings the Museum staff and the Media Lab team framed
		    and developed the project. Initially, the interactive map was presented and
		    tested at a stand in the exhibition of the Museum&rsquo;s permanent collection, which
	    has been housed in the basement showroom for the past six years. </p>
	    <p>The material collected during these initial experiments
		    served as the basis for engaging the Museum&rsquo;s staff. The initiative to develop
		    an exhibition in which an interactive map of comments played a principal role
		    came from the staff. Indeed, the new exhibition took part of its name from our
	    project: &ldquo;The Secret Life of Objects, an Interactive Map of Finnish Design.&rdquo; </p>
	    <p>A stand displaying the map was part of the exhibition that
		    featured the Museum&rsquo;s permanent collection (now out of the basement) held from March
		    18<sup>th</sup> to June 1<sup>st</sup>, 2008. For the opening, the map was
		    furnished with prepared materials (videos, pictures, music, poems, historical
		    information, etc.) collected at workshops and over the course of the weekend
		    when a prototype was tested. Co-designing this exhibition and the prior workshops
		    with the Museum&rsquo;s education team provided a means to develop this prepared
		    material and, thus, to influence the digital comments left by casual visitors
		    (Salgado et al., 2008). Nobody encouraged visitors&rsquo; participation during the
		    exhibition, and the exhibition itself was not supervised. Nonetheless, around
		    one hundred comments were collected through the stand. Most of these comments
		    were printed during the course of the exhibition and displayed near the objects
	    they discussed. </p>
	    <p>Staff members, including guards and guides, left comments on
		    the map and used it as part of the exhibition&rsquo;s guided tours. As way to enrich
		    the discussion, we also tried to include comments by external designers whose pieces
		    were on exhibition in the Design Museum even when these designers were not part
	    of the Museum&rsquo;s staff. </p>

	    the gallery through stands, PDAs, iPods, mobile phones or embedded technology.</p>
	    <p>In the cases we describe in this paper, visitors could leave
		    and access the comments from a stand at the exhibition or on-line. In the
		    project at the Design Museum, text comments left on the map by the Museum
		    community were printed and displayed throughout the exhibition. Visitors were
		    allowed to leave open comments related to the exhibitions in question, and
		    there were no limitations regarding the length of comments. We propose that
		    there is a qualitative difference between this type of comment and other
	    text-based interventions such as tagging and voting. </p>
	    <p>Visitor-created content can have a creative quality. For
		    example, in The Art of Storytelling exhibition at the Delaware Art Museum,
		    visitors personally engaged the artworks through their own narratives (Fisher
		    et al., 2008). Creative comments involving emotion, poetry, memory and bodily
		    sensations were also collected in relation to the exhibition Take Your Time: Olafur
		    Eliasson, at SFMOMA (Samis, 2008). In the case of our project at the Design
		    Museum, visitors created not only comments in the form of text (poetry,
		    opinion, short story) but also improvisational music based on the objects in
		    the exhibition. Our strategy geared towards eventual visitors was to use
		    comments that had been previously created at the workshops. Such comments
		    included improvisational music and poetry, and they served to trigger new
	    digital comments from visitors (Salgado et al., 2008). </p>
	    <h2>4. Navigating Community-Generated Content</h2>
	    <p>The use of on-line maps for gathering and displaying rich
		    media information is a concrete possibility in the context of museums; these
		    maps offer a means to display both visitor and staff comments non-linearly.
		    This non-linear navigation allows multiple access points for browsing the
		    content and, thus, enhances the interplay between parallel dialogues and
		    perspectives related to the exhibition content. Both Urban Mediator and ImaNote
	    permit this type of navigation. </p>
	    <p>At the Design Museum the objects were points for discussion;
		    visitors placed their comments and, with them, a rectangle or square on the
		    map. Thus, the conversation had many threads, all based on the objects
		    exhibited. At Kiasma, participants in the walking tours or on-line visitors
		    needed to create the object under discussion, for example by taking a picture or
		    commenting on a location. The participants had two themes to choose from, &lsquo;nature
		    traces&rsquo; and &lsquo;art and graffiti,&rsquo; which were also the themes of the two series of
	    walks.</p>
	    <p>The non-linearity of the discussion - as opposed, for
		    example, to a Web log, where comments appear chronologically one after the
		    other - allows for random exploration without clear hierarchies, and this was
		    just what we wanted. In keeping with the multiplicity of voices and art/design
		    works exhibited, this tool allowed us to open several discussion threads at the
		    same time. In our opinion, the map as interface provides a democratic forum for
		    displaying community-generated content. Museum staff and visitors&rsquo; comments
		    were displayed in parallel. Nevertheless, in the case of the Design Museum, we
		    formulated a distinction between comments by creating an image with several
		    places to locate comments. This made it possible to identify, for example,
		    comments made by the staff about the design history of the objects displayed
	    and comments collected during workshops. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="Salgado.fig2-w.jpg" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="500" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 2: Screen for Eernauts comments </p>
	    <p>Comments generated over the course of the exhibit opened up
		    the delicate question of ownership. Who preserves and has the right to use the
		    digital comments collected during the exhibition? In these particular cases,
		    the comments are housed at the Media Lab servers, and the museum has not made
		    any attempt to get a copy, or to save them as digital documentation. Should
		    this be interpreted as a lack of interest in community-generated content
	    related to the exhibition? </p>
	    <p>At our stand at the Design Museum, we put up a sign stating
		    that the exhibition was part of a research project and the material gathered
		    was going to be used towards that research. Nobody contacted us to ask for
		    further details about this, though. We asked for special permission when
		    publishing pictures of participants in the workshops. Generally, though, it
		    seems that people are eager to contribute their opinions and feelings and are
	    not overly concerned with how their contribution will later be used. </p>
	    <p>Many members of the museum staff left personal comments on
		    the interactive map, but - with the exception of one guide - they did not
		    identify themselves. Although most of the comments were personal stories, they
		    were not signed by their authors. This seems to suggest that, in this context,
		    authorship is not a relevant issue. In the future, if participatory practices
		    such as those described here are implemented in every exhibition and the number
		    of contribution increases, the issue of authorship could become important to
	    the community. </p>
	    <p>In the case of Kiasma, the Museum staff and designer
		    provided the first pictures and comments as a way to populate the themed topics
		    on Urban Mediator. Some of the Museum staff used their full names, others only
		    their initials. However, the initial number of contributions was not large, and
		    no one took the role of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; or &ldquo;guardian&rdquo; of the collections of information;
	    therefore, there was no one actively encouraging others to contribute. </p>
	    <p>Furthermore, the experts who guided the walks were not
		    deeply involved with this project either. They were quickly shown how to use
		    the software, but they did not end up providing material to populate the UM
	    topics related to the walks they were leading. </p>
	    <h2>5. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Leave Me Alone!&rdquo; Said the Software</h2>
	    <p>While in this article we concentrate on the possibilities offered
		    by these two annotations tools for displaying community-generated content, we also
		    believe that in the museum context a key issue is not only how to design friendly
		    software, but also how to integrate it into the exhibition design, the Website,
		    and the museum&rsquo;s practices. Only by conceiving these elements as part of a
		    single ecology is it possible to effect design geared towards the holistic
	    visit experience. </p>
	    <p>One of the topics we highlight is the need for dialogue
		    between the on-site and on-line components of the exhibition. The on-site
		    experience; that is, the experience within the physical context of the museum, can
		    introduce museum visitors to the on-line extension of an exhibition. As well,
	    the on-line experience can attract on-line visitors to the galleries. </p>
	    <h3>5.1 Integration with exhibition design</h3>
	    <p>In user studies conducted at the Design Museum, we realized
		    that the stand was mainly understood as a point of information. Its
		    participative and innovative characteristics went largely unnoticed because
		    desktop configurations are widely used at information points in museums.
		    Therefore, we printed an oversize sign clearly stating the use of the
		    stand: &ldquo;Interactive map. Find videos, music, opinions. Leave
		      your comment.&rdquo; Although this led to a certain increase in participation, it is
		      clear that in order to better communicate the participative characteristics of
        the stand, the design needs to emphasize its participative qualities. </p>
	    <p>Other communication materials at the exhibition were flyers,
		    a letter, a booklet, visitors&rsquo; comments, and a sign with the credits for the
		    exhibition participants. Flyers gave the visitors information about the
		    project, the URL of the Web log, and a reminder to visit the map on-line after
		    the visit. Signed by the objects, the letter asked visitors to leave stories,
		    memories and opinions that connected them with the objects in the exhibition.
		    The staff wrote the booklet explaining the objects at the exhibition. Visitors&rsquo;
	      comments were printed and placed throughout the Museum, near the exhibited
		    objects. Nonetheless, the small number of comments left during the first month
		    of the exhibition made it clear that the exhibition concept was not properly
		    perceived. When we printed most of the comments collected, their presence was
	    perceived and, in many cases, appreciated. </p>
	    <p>Integration with the exhibition design was less successful
		    at Kiasma. The exhibition, the walk tours and the on-line interaction possibilities
		    had not been sufficiently interwoven. The exhibition was big (it included all
		    the Museum premise&rsquo;s floors). The tours were simply an extra activity offered
		    by the Museum for those interested in participating, and the on-line map was
		    seen as an extension of the tours. The initial idea of the head of the Museum&rsquo;s
		    education department was that, after each tour, the participants would add
		    their impressions or documentations to the on-line map. The museum had also
		    placed a big paper map on a wall where people could place sticky notes with
		    comments. There was no clear connection between the paper map and the on-line
		    map; indeed, the map of the city shown in each was different (the on-line map
		    was the official map from the City of Helsinki; the one on the wall a stylized
		    version of another map). Both the big paper map and the computer stand were in
		    the same space, but there was no visual connection between them or any written
		    explanation indicating that they served a common purpose. It was easier for
		    visitors and tour participants to write comments on the sticky notes and paste
		    them on the wall map than to use the on-line map. Nonetheless, many of the
		    messages written on the sticky notes had no relation whatsoever with the theme
		    of the exhibition or the mapping exercise. Moreover, the setting of the computer stand was not inviting, and there were no
		      explanatory texts or diagrams next to it except a sign saying, &ldquo;Report your
        observations from the walk tours &ndash; <a href="../http://um.uiah.fi/hel">http://um.uiah.fi/hel</a> (Urban Mediator Helsinki)&rdquo;. </p>
	    <h3>5.2 Integration with the museum Web site</h3>
	    <p>Though some members of the staff could add minor changes,
		    the Design Museum outsources its Web site design. During the time of the
		    exhibition, it was possible to access the interactive map through a link from
	    their homepage.</p>
	    <p>The visibility of the link was an issue since an on-line
		    visitor would need to scroll the page to get to it. Although we cannot prove
		    it, we believe that most of the visitors trying to reach the map were first
		    visitors to the exhibition. We believe that better integration with the Web site,
		    not just in terms of the link, would have enhanced the collaboration between
	    on-line and on-site resources. </p>
	    <p>One of the main features of Urban Mediator is the
		    possibility to create Web widgets that can be embedded into any Web site,
		    making it possible for users to use the tool&rsquo;s functions directly from the Web site.
		    As Kiasma has only one Web master to edit its Web site and to embed the widgets
		    as needed, and because this person was on sick leave at that time, the Web
		    pages were never finished. Some required widgets were left missing from the
		    Kiasma pages, and others were not placed on the site in a clear fashion. It was
		    therefore difficult to understand how the widgets should be used. Moreover,
		    instructions had not been added to pages. Finally, because the pages were not
		    ready, they could not be shown on the computer located in Kiasma. The page
		    showing on the computer screen was, therefore, the homepage of UM Helsinki,
		    making it more difficult for the visitors to understand what to do (this main
		    page displays other topics concerning UM Helsinki, like a traffic safety public
		    participation project). While the widget idea has been successfully tested in
		    other cases (Botero &amp; Saad-Sulonen, 2008; Saad-Sulonen &amp; Botero,
		    2008), it requires the full collaboration of those responsible for a museum Web
	    site.</p>
	    <h3>5.3 Integration with museum&rsquo;s practices</h3>
	    <p>With the software used in these projects, it is possible to
		    add links to external resources and to browse for images to add to a comment.
		    We encouraged visitors to leave comments in an array of formats, not only text
	    but also audiovisual data. </p>
	    <p>In the case of the Design Museum, we used the audiovisual
		    material created as part of the project to encourage creative audiovisual
		    comments. Since the Museum guides collaborated so fully with the project, they
		    explained the possibilities for contributions on-line and on-site in their
		    guided tours. These guides were part of our project from the very beginning;
		    they conducted workshops at the Museum and added comments to the map,
		    encouraging visitors to do the same. Since working at a small museum often
		    entails performing multiple tasks, the guides also worked at the Museum&rsquo;s
		    information desk and as guards. Guides communicated the possibilities of the
		    participative piece to teachers who came with their students, for example, or
		    to casual visitors to the museum. This type of collaboration with different
		    members of the staff is crucial to external researchers who often have little
	    direct contact with everyday visitors. </p>
	    <p>In the case of Kiasma, the designers made little effort to
		    involve the &lsquo;ground staff&rsquo; such as guides and guards. This could have been
		    important because they are the ones that can, during their rounds, pass by the
		    space where the computer is located and offer assistance. Moreover, the
		    collaboration between the designers and the experts invited to lead the walks
		    in the city was not fully developed. There was no clear strategy decided on how
		    participants in the walks should be guided to contribute to the UM map, even
		    though the walks did end in the space where the computer was situated. As a
		    result, participants in the walks were not active in providing what should have
		    constituted the base material on UM, which in turn, might have triggered more
	    interest from Web site visitors and prompted them to contribute. </p>
	    <p>We believe that integrating community-generated content
		    projects with other museum practices such as publications and marketing
	    campaigns would also benefit participation. </p>
	    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
	    <p>It is not enough to present a tool and place it in the
		    museum space. Particularly in the case of Kiasma, the shortcomings of the use
		    of UM point to the need for a holistic approach to designing participation in
	    museums.</p>
	    <p>Our strategies/recommendations for engaging the museum
		    community in commenting on exhibitions and using on-line maps stress the need
	    for: </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Integration of resources and practices: pooling digital and
	        analog methods</li>
	      <li>Time and dedication for including museum staff members and
	        external contributors</li>
	      <li>Special invitations for groups of key contributors</li>
	      <li>Prepared materials for triggering creative digital comments</li>
        </ul>
	    <p>On the basis of these experiences, we suggest the need to
		    closely examine the strategies used to motivate participation on the part of
		    visitors, staff and external collaborators. Adequate strategies are key to making
		    these projects into real participative experiences. In this paper, we have
		    discussed lessons learned from both unsuccessful approaches and more successful
		    ones. Long-term collaboration could benefit the mutual understanding of all the
		    actors involved in the museum ecology: visitors, external researchers and
		    museum staff. Finally, we highlight the need to plan a coherent network of
		    participatory activities, one that integrates on-line tools into the holistic museum
	    experience. </p>
