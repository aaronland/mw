	    <h2 class="PaperTitle">Introduction</h2>
	    <p>Over the last decades, museums spent a noticeable amount
		    of effort to shift their focus from an exclusively object-centered approach to
		    a visitor-centered approach (Galani, 2005). Apart
		    from preserving and exhibiting their collections, museums attach more and more
		    importance to improving the visitor's overall experience of the presentation.
		    One of the strategies applied to improve the visitor's experience, is the
		    introduction of (interactive) mobile guides. These are used not only in various
		    sorts of museums (history, arts, science, open-air, gardens and zoos ...), but also in the cultural tourist sector. The
		    popularity and acceptance of handheld guides as tools to enrich the experience
		    have increased significantly over the last couple of years. The strengths of
		    this technology are clear: it allows the dynamic presentation of information
		    without interfering with the physical space, it provides the opportunity to
		    access a wide range of interactive media (audio, video, text, photo, games ...)
		    and it enables visitors to browse information at their own pace and according
		    to their own interests. The applicability and effect of this kind of technology
		    however remain hard to assess, as well for museums as for cultural tourist
		    sites. The range of possibilities that can be implemented with this technology
		    makes it also difficult to predict what the best use is. Furthermore, every
		    museum or cultural tourist site has its own specific context according to which
		    mobile guide implementation should be tailored. Content presentation
		    (narrative, thematic ...), location (indoor or outdoor,
		    proximity of the objects ...), scale (duration of an average visit, extent of
		    the museum or site), target groups... all are components of the complex
	    context that constitutes a visit or tour. </p>
	    <p>To meet the difficulties that museums or cultural tourist
		    sites encounter when preparing and developing their mobile guides, we propose
		    in this paper a generic though flexible software framework for their development. This framework supports three core services that contribute
		    to the overall visitor experience in accordance with the context of the visit:
		    personalization, communication and location-detection. On top of the software
		    framework, several mobile guides can be developed. The communication service
		    accounts for an important but still too often neglected aspect of museum visits;
		    namely the social aspect. Since a museum visit is predominantly a social
		    activity, the overall experience is strongly influenced by the social dynamics
		    at work among visitors. Our mobile guide offers solutions to support and even
	    stimulate interaction and communication between visitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	    <p>In the ARCHIE project, we used the software framework to
		    develop &ndash; among other things &ndash; a mobile museum game for youngsters visiting a
		    museum during a school trip. We present this museum game as a case study of the
		    usage of our mobile guide framework for the design of context-specific
		    educational mobile games for school groups. Large-scale evaluations have shown
		    the potential power of our approach to both enhance the motivation and increase
		    the attractiveness of museum learning and heritage education for this target
		    group. Based on our experiences in designing and evaluating the mobile game, we
		    propose a set of basic guidelines that steer the realization of educational
		    mobile games for youngsters. These guidelines are applicable for both museums
	    and the cultural tourist sector. </p>
	    <h2>Evolution in the Usage of Mobile Guides</h2>
	    <p>Over the years we have seen a clear evolution in the way
		    mobile guides are used within a museum or cultural tourist context. At first,
		    most mobile guides only offered additional information that was linked to the
		    presented objects, monuments and other artifacts, much like the audio guides
		    you can still find today. The important difference now is that mobile guides
		    can also present (interactive) multimedia data to the visitor. In the evolution
		    this medium has gone through, &nbsp;we identified the following three categories of mobile
		    guides, based on &nbsp;literature
	    research on this topic and existing practices in mobile guides.</p>
	    <p>The first kind of mobile guide that goes clearly beyond
		    the scope of traditional audio guides is the adaptive guide. These guides allow
		    the user interface and content to be adapted to the context-of-use. One of the
		    first attempts to develop adaptive guides was the Cyberguide project (Abowd et al., 1997). The PEACH project (Graziola et al., 2005) focused on content adaptation based
		    on the user's location, interests and the history of interaction between the
		    user and the system. In a later phase, several mobile guide implementations
		    acknowledged the importance of narrative interfaces that allow the user to get
		    immersed better in the stories told by the exhibits. Imagine, for example, a
		    virtual character telling his story with a particular connection to the
		    physical environment or objects the story is about, thus focusing the attention
		    of the visitor on that physical environment.&nbsp; Lim and Aylett (2007) present a mobile guide in which the
		    story presentation is adapted, based on the user's interests and opinions. In Riedl and Young (2006), the authors present a graph-based
		    structure to describe how several &rdquo;story parts'' can be dynamically composed to
	    form one integrated story for the visitor. </p>
	    <p>While early mobile museum guides only targeted the
		    individual visitor and thus neglected the social aspects of a visit, in the
		    last few years several ways of supporting interaction and collaboration were
		    explored. The Sotto Voce project (Woodruff et al., 2001) introduces an
		    'eavesdropping' system that allows visitor-pairs to synchronize their audio
		    tracks with one another. Another approach is to explore collaborative visiting
		    through a combination of a PDA-based physical visit, a virtual visit and a Web-based
	    visit (Brown et al., 2003). A next generation of mobile guides uses collaborative
		    games to improve the museum visit and stimulate interaction. In the Cicero
		    project (Laurillau &amp; Patern&ograve;,
		    2004), visitors collect clues to solve a puzzle, shared with various
		    co-visitors. The CoCicero project (Dini, Patern&ograve; &amp; Santoro,
		    2007) enhances the cooperation phase of Cicero by allowing the mobile device to
		    exploit a stationary large display that can be seen and discussed by an entire
		    team of visitors. The 'Mystery in the Museum' game, however, takes
		    collaborative learning up to the next level: players not only contribute to a
		    shared puzzle, but also are actually stimulated to exchange and discuss
	    information (Cabrera et al., 2005).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	    <p>The work we present in this paper contributes to the
		    aforementioned evolution in the usage of mobile guides. The ARCHIE museum game
		    prototype, developed in cooperation with the Gallo-Roman museum of Tongeren (Province of Limburg), considers social
		    interaction and collaboration between pupils to be the basic principle of the
		    museum experience. Instead of aiming for a tool that offers the entire museum
		    content to the visitor - be it by means of an adaptive system or not - we focus
		    on conveying the key stories of the museum content through interaction:
		    interaction between visitors, but also interaction with the museum environment
		    and interaction with the mobile guide. How these interactions can be supported
		    and stimulated by mobile guides built on our software framework is described in
	    the following section. </p>
	    <h2>A Framework for Context-Aware Mobile Guides</h2>
	    <p>When asked about their motivation to visit a museum, most
		    people indicate learning as the primary reason (Falk &amp; Dierking,
		    2000; PGRM, 2005). In their model of learning in a museum, Falk and Dierking take the context of the learning experience into
		    account. According to this contextual model, the interactions and experiences
		    visitors have in a museum are all influenced by three interweaving contexts:
		    the personal context, the socio-cultural context and the physical context (Fig.
		    1). Depending on the way these three contexts are shaped for a certain visitor,
		    learning becomes a unique process for that visitor. The main objective of the
		    museum is then to provide the optimal conditions to stimulate this learning
	    process. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="schroyen.fig1-thumbnail.jpg" alt="figure 1" width="500" height="254" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig. 1: Contextual model of learning as proposed by Falk
        &amp; Dierking (2000)</p>
	    <p>We believe this model offers a basis to adequately assess
		    the usage of mobile guides in any given museum or cultural tourist site. The
		    software framework we created for the ARCHIE project was inspired by the three
		    interweaving contexts of the Falk and Dierking model:
		    the framework translates and connects support for each of the three contexts
		    into one unified framework. An overview of this framework is shown in Fig. 2.
		    It consists of a set of three core services on top of which an arbitrary
		    interface can be deployed. We describe below how each of the three contexts can
		    be supported by a mobile guide and which solutions are provided by our software
	    framework. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="schroyen.fig2-thumbnail.jpg" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="338" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig. 2: ARCHIE framework overview</p>
	    <h3>The personal context&nbsp; </h3>
	    <p>Mobile guides offer the opportunity to tailor the
		    presentation to the personal context of the visitors. Depending on their
		    knowledge and abilities or preferences and interests, it is possible to adapt
		    the interface and the presented content. Even visitors themselves can be put in
		    charge of the offered content and activities: they can steer the presentation
		    towards their personal learning style and interests. The museum or cultural
		    tourist site remains in control, however, about the extent to which its content
	    is adaptable.</p>
	    <p>Another possibility using mobile guides is to tune the
		    design and content to a specific target group. Experienced visitors who
		    particularly seek in-depth information through a museum or cultural tourist
		    visit benefit from a mobile guide that allows digging deeper and deeper into
		    the presented content. Youngsters, on the other hand, are more likely to prefer
		    an (inter)active mobile game in which they  can
		    autonomously explore the environment to a traditional guided tour.&nbsp; The strategy of tuning design and
		    content to the target group can clearly pay off to make museum visits more
		    attractive, especially for visitor groups that are traditionally difficult to
	    win over, like youngsters.</p>
	    <p>In the software framework we developed, we support several
		    types of personalization. On the highest level, multiple graphical user
		    interfaces are provided, all with &nbsp;access to the same content but providing different
		    presentations, and different in the way the visitors interact with them. The
		    interface we developed for youngsters visiting a museum on a field trip offers
		    a collaborative and interactive game that stimulates children to explore both
		    the mobile guide and the museum environment. The interface oriented towards
		    adults, who are generally less inclined to engage in playful learning, focuses
		    on information delivery in various ways. This means a more fine-grained
		    personalization is implemented in the interface for adults. According to their
		    profile, both the presentation style and the content that is offered during the
		    visit can differ. The interface can be designed in such a way that no content
		    is excluded from either; the focus on which content is presented first can
		    differ, however. Since it is not practical to have visitors fill in a survey
		    before starting the actual visit to obtain their &nbsp;profiles, our system starts out
	    with a specific, typifying profile which is adapted gradually during the visit.</p>
	    <h3>The physical context</h3>
	    <p>The physical context refers to the design and architecture
		    of the environment, such as orientation, construction, and lay-out of the
		    exhibit and the display of the objects and artifacts. The visitors&acute; learning is
		    influenced by their sense of orientation, safety, control over and insight in
		    the spatial exposition. The potential surplus value of mobile guides to support
		    the physical context is clear and has been widely discussed in literature.
		    Visitors have their guides always within their reach, and their freedom of
		    movement is maintained. Localization technologies on mobile guides allow a
		    clear match between the content on display in the environment and the content
		    shown by the mobile guide. As a result, visitors can be triggered to
	    attentively examine the exposition in a new way. </p>
	    <p>Our software framework considers the physical context in
		    two different ways. First, we use localization technologies to detect objects,
		    monuments and other artifacts that are in the vicinity of the visitor. When the
		    visitor approaches an object or area of interest, a notification is sent via
		    the mobile device, and the appropriate presentation is &nbsp;loaded. Another application of
		    localization is tracking the trails followed by the visitors to learn in what areas
	    they wander around for a long time.</p>
	    <p>Second, we explicitly acknowledge the various possible
		    interactions of the visitors with the mobile guide and the physical
		    environment. These interactions provide a basis for the design of the
		    presentations on the mobile device. For example, the information presented by
		    the mobile device depends on the location of the visitors and what can be
		    perceived in the physical world, but also on the location of fellow visitors.
	    In this way, interaction between companions is stimulated. </p>
	    <h3>The socio-cultural context</h3>
	    <p>The socio-cultural context accounts for the socio-cultural
		    mediation and facilitation of learning during a visit. Companions want to share
		    their experiences with each other and discuss their impressions. These
		    conversations between visitors not only are inevitable, but also contribute
		    greatly to the learning experience. Morrissey (2002) even argues that social
		    interaction not only promotes, but also is a prerequisite for intellectual,
		    social, personal and cultural development. Although we believe mobile guides
		    can be designed to support social interaction and communication, most existing
	    mobile guides tend to isolate visitors from their companions. </p>
	    <p>We specifically designed our mobile guide framework not just
		    to support, but even to stimulate social interaction.
		    We implemented a server application that keeps track of the different groups of
		    visitors. During the visit, the system allows visitors to communicate with
	    other visitors in the same group in two different ways:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li><span class="listwithbullets" style='font-family:Symbol;
'><span style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'></span></span>a direct communication style that is voice-based
	      and uses Voice-over-IP (VOIP), a sort of walkie-talkie system;</li>
      <li><span class="listwithbullets" style='font-family:Symbol;
'><span style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'></span></span>an indirect communication style that consists of
        the exchange between mobile guides of other types of data related to the
        content and interface. </li>
          </ul>
	    <p>It remains however a challenge to develop concepts and
		    content for mobile guides that are tailored to a specific target group, that
		    are location-aware and that stimulate conversation, discussion and
		    collaboration. In the following section we describe how we tried to address
		    this challenge in the design of an educational mobile museum game for
	    youngsters on a field trip.&nbsp; </p>
	    <h2>Case Study: the ARCHIE Museum Game</h2>
	    <p>One of the prototypes we developed during the ARCHIE
		    project is a museum game, built on top of the mobile guide framework described
		    above. The target group of this educational mobile game consists of
		    schoolchildren, aged 12 to 14, on a field trip. The Provincial Gallo-Roman
		    museum conducted an extensive survey in 2005 (PGRM, 2005) to find out about the
		    interests of their (potential) visitors and to determine in which way they want
		    to learn about the museum collection. According to this survey, youngsters are
		    highly interested in games and interactive media. We decided to use these
		    interests in order to enrich their museum visit. Our main goal was to develop a
		    mobile museum game that focuses on conveying the key messages of the museum
		    narrative and that provided a fun and interactive museum experience. To obtain
		    this goal, we chose to develop several independent games which each focus on a
		    specific key chapter of the museum narrative. These seemingly independent games
		    are tied together by the overall museum story, which covers the history of
		    people living in the local region from Neanderthal times up to the fall of the
		    Roman Empire. We developed and evaluated three prototype games played in teams
		    of three to four youngsters: a farming game, a trading game and a Roman game (Fig.
	    3). </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="schroyen.fig3-thumbnail.jpg" alt="figure 3" width="500" height="202" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig. 3: Screenshots of the prototype games: the trading
	    game (left), the farming game (middle) and the Roman game (right)</p>
	    <p>The museum game is actually an interface that makes use of
		    several core services of the mobile guide framework. Personalization is
		    supported on the level of both the target group and the individual. First, the
		    museum game is explicitly developed for the target group of youngsters on a
		    school trip. The game concept, interactions, graphical design and content are
		    all closely tuned to this target group by means of our user-centered design
		    approach. Second, each player gets to adapt his or her own personal avatar
	    which accompanies him or her throughout the entire museum game. </p>
	    <p>The localization service is used to determine when each
		    game has to be started; namely when all team members are near the physical
		    presentation of the corresponding museum narrative. Matching the content of the
		    mobile guide to the museum presentation on game-level instead of object-level
		    allows youngsters to autonomously explore the museum environment in search of
		    certain artifacts on display or even for detailed characteristics of these artifacts
	    (Fig. 4). </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="schroyen.fig4-thumbnail.jpg" alt="figure 4" width="500" height="202" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig. 4: Interaction with the museum </p>
	    <p>The communication service makes it possible for team members
		    to interact with each other in various ways, depending on the game logic and
		    the corresponding museum content. When team members are stimulated to split up to
		    each fulfill a specific task, they can communicate directly with each other via
		    the walkie-talkie system to negotiate about the appropriate solutions for their
		    tasks and/or to help each other solve questions. Indirect communication is
		    carried out by the exchange of game-related data between PDA's that stimulate
		    for instance face-to-face communication and transfer of information,
	    problem-solving strategies and division of tasks (Fig. 5). </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="schroyen.fig5-thumbnail.jpg" alt="figure 5" width="500" height="232" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig. 5: Youngsters are stimulated to exchange information</p>
	    <p>To assess the museum game, we organized extensive
		    evaluations with the target group. The main goal was to test the usability of
		    the prototypes and to check whether the games obtained the desired results.
		    Does the museum game indeed provoke social interaction and interaction with the
		    museum environment? Do youngsters learn about the key messages of the museum
		    narrative by playing the games? Since the target museum was closed to the
		    public, due to current expansion activities, we were unable to test our
		    prototypes in the museum. Therefore we visited several secondary schools in the
		    province of Limburg to organize user tests in a simulated museum environment: posters
		    of museum objects and &ndash; if on hand &ndash; some replicas that convey museum content
		    were displayed. Three prototypes have been tested, one at a time: the trading
		    game (tested by 68 pupils), the farming game (tested by 92 pupils), and the
		    Roman game (tested by 137 pupils). We intended to reach a wide range of the
		    envisioned target group and thus tested a mix of pupils from general as well as
		    technical and vocational secondary education. All participants were between 12
	    and 16 years old (Fig. 6).</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="schroyen.fig6-thumbnail.jpg" alt="figure 6" width="500" height="366" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig. 6: User tests</p>
	    <p>The school groups were divided into teams of 3-4 players,
		    and every player received a PDA. During the test, the players were observed and
		    the user interactions on the PDA were logged to analyze the course of the game.
		    After the game, the pupils were asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding
		    computer usage, usability and playability of the game, learning results and
		    motivation. Although over 75% of the pupils declared that they had never used a
		    PDA before, the same amount said it was (very) easy to use. All functionalities
		    of the game interface, for example using the walkie-talkie system or scrolling
		    through the game landscape, were gradually picked up by trial and error and by
	    discussing them with their peers. This indicates the high learnability of our mobile game.</p>
	    <p>The observations proved that our goals concerning
		    interaction were reached. There was generally a good balance between looking at
		    the screen and looking at the simulated museum exhibit. Furthermore, the games
		    clearly provoked collaboration and social interaction among the players. We
		    even noticed that interaction was induced not only by the game sequences that
		    were deliberately designed to stimulate collaboration and discussion, but also
		    by some other aspects of the game design, such as the creation of their own
		    personal avatar in the beginning of the game (Fig. 7) or the funny visuals and
		    audio tracks. With regard to the learning of the main messages of the museum
		    content, the questionnaires showed that on average 70-75% of the participants
	    answered the questions relating to the key content of the museum correctly. </p>

	    <p class="caption">Fig. 7: Avatar and team</p>
	    <p>The observed behavior and the questionnaire certainly
		    confirmed the enhanced motivation of the youngsters. Over 90% indicated that
		    they liked the games. When asked what they think about the idea of using a PDA
		    as a guide throughout the museum, 85-90% selected &ldquo;great, it makes a museum
		    visit a lot more fun&rdquo;. This proves these mobile games are an ideal tool to
		    stimulate and motivate youngsters to visit a museum or heritage institution.
		    This is especially true for pupils of technical and vocational secondary
		    schools who are typically less motivated to visit a traditional museum or to
		    learn about history or heritage in a traditional way. By means of our framework
		    and our well thought-out game design, we can increase the attractiveness of
		    museum learning and heritage education for this target group that is often
	    difficult to reach by the educational staff of museums and heritage sites. </p>
	    <h2>The Design of Educational Mobile Games</h2>
	    <p>Based on our experiences in designing and evaluating our
		    mobile game, we propose a set of basic guidelines that steer the realization of
		    educational mobile games for youngsters. These guidelines are applicable for
		    both museums and the cultural tourist sector. The main guidelines we present
		    below relate to the design process and the involvement of the end-user
		    throughout this process, designing game concepts that act as good learning
		    environments, designing for social interaction and collaborative learning, and the
	    importance of an evocative graphical design. </p>
	    <h3>1. Follow a User Centered Design Process</h3>
	    <p>The conception of a mobile guide requires a design process
		    that tunes the presentation and behavior of the mobile guide to the target user
		    group and to the message the museum or cultural tourist site wants to convey.
		    An appropriate design process runs through different phases, starting from user
		    analysis and concept generation towards implementation and evaluation. We argue
		    for a User Centered Design (UCD) approach, which involves the end-users of a
		    product throughout the development lifecycle, from planning through evaluation,
		    in order to guarantee a positive user experience, including&nbsp; usability, accessibility and
		    functionality (Moore &amp; Redmond-Pyle, 1995). At Museums and the Web 2007
		    (Van Loon et al., 2007) we described our initial implementation of a UCD
		    process. We will point out some of the most important aspects of this process
	    here in the form of a few guidelines. </p>
	    <h4>Work with a multidisciplinary team </h4>
	    <p>ISO 13407 (1999) standardizes human- and user-centered
		    design approaches and recommends the involvement of a multidisciplinary team.
		    In our case this team consists of two computer scientists, a graphical designer,
		    and a historian with a background in education, working in close collaboration
		    with delegates from the museum staff. In this way the different perspectives
		    and concerns of all the stakeholders involved will be accounted for throughout
	    the entire development lifecycle, and will result in a better product.</p>
	    <h4>Use the appropriate tools to communicate in a multidisciplinary team</h4>
	    <p>A multidisciplinary team typically encompasses persons from
		    diverse backgrounds and with a different jargon, and therefore it is not always
		    easy for them to &nbsp;understand each other. In a UCD approach, several
		    artifacts are created throughout the different stages in the development
		    process (Haesen et al., 2008). These generally
		    comprehensible artifacts, such as user task models, storyboards and paper
		    prototypes, are concrete and tangible results of the different development
		    stages and facilitate communication amongst the team members and with the
	    museum staff.</p>
	    <h4>Get to know your users</h4>
	    <p>It is important to get acquainted thoroughly with the
		    needs and expectations of the target group (user analysis). What are they
		    interested in? How do they prefer to learn? What does their ideal educational
		    field trip look like? What are their expectations towards a mobile museum game?
		    Target group surveys and focus groups or brainstorm sessions helped us in
		    providing good insight in the target group. Regular user tests in different
	    phases of the development process helped us to stay on track. </p>
	    <h4>Plan user testing early in the design process</h4>
	    <p>The testing and evaluation of the evolving system by
		    future users is probably one of the most important steps in the UCD process,
		    and unfortunately it is also the step which is often neglected. Designers
		    quickly assume that if they and their colleagues can use the system and find it
		    attractive, others will too. Furthermore, they prefer to avoid evaluating
		    because it adds to development time and costs money. But without evaluation,
		    designers cannot be sure that their system will be usable. Therefore, we
		    involved the future users from an early phase of the development process
		    onwards to check whether their needs were being met. Users can already be
		    involved after the realization of the first paper prototypes, before any
		    functionality has been integrated. The results of these user tests can be used
		    to steer the further development process. Such an iterative design process
	    allows gradual fine-tuning of the system for future users.</p>
	    <h3>2. Create game concepts that act as good learning environments</h3>
	    <p>The starting point of this guideline is the question posed
		    by J.P. Gee (2003):&ldquo;Why are youngsters willing to put so much time and effort
		    in learning to play extremely complex video games?&rdquo; According to Gee, the
		    answer must be found in the &ldquo;good principles of learning built into its design&rdquo;
	      that fit in with the skills needed for &ldquo;the modern, high-tech, global world
		    today's children and teenagers live in&rdquo; (Gee, 2003, p. 6-7). Following the
		    insights articulated by Gee, the characteristics that constitute games as
		    optimal learning environments are described by Sandford &amp; Williamson (2005). We built on these characteristics to create our game
	    concepts and design guidelines. </p>
	    <h4>Aim for game functionalities and content that can be learned by playing</h4>
	    <p>Youngsters do not always want to be aware of the fact that
		    they are learning. To promote unconscious learning, it is important to gradually
		    increase the complexity of the user interactions or tasks instead of providing
		    users with manual-like dry information about the PDA functionalities or game
		    logic. Step by step, players will acquire these skills by themselves. Furthermore,
		    instead of explicitly lecturing about content, it is possible to aim for game
		    concepts that reflect the key messages of the museum or site in such a way that
	    the content is learned simply by playing the game. </p>
	    <h4>Aim for a truly interactive experience</h4>
	    <p>To have a real game experience, the players have to feel
		    that they are in control: their choices and actions determine the outcome. The
		    players must be allowed to create their own experience by exploring their
	    actions and the specific effects they cause. </p>
	    <h4>Enhance the commitment of the players to the content on display </h4>
	    <p>The players' experience can be enhanced
		    by providing a virtual character or avatar that has a part in the games
		    or stories offered through the mobile guide. When a close match between the
		    mobile guide and the physical presentation is obtained, these virtual
		    characters or avatars allow players to identify with the messages of the museum
	    or institution and even to relive a certain episode of the content. </p>
	    <h4>Provide a clear challenge for each target group</h4>
	    <p>To increase the motivation of the players, it is important
		    to propose a challenge that is rather difficult, but doable. Support the
		    players by providing the tools and information necessary to meet the
		    challenges, but do this in such a way that the players still have to discover
		    how to use these clues. By gradually increasing the complexity of the
	    challenges posed, the current level of skills of the players can be raised. </p>
	    <h3>3. Design for social interaction</h3>
	    <p>There are two reasons to consider social interaction in
		    the design of educational mobile games for youngsters. First, youngsters attach
		    great importance to their social network, their peers. Certainly when visiting
		    a museum or cultural tourist site on a field trip, youngsters want to share
		    this experience with their classmates. Second, communication and interaction with
		    peers improves the learning effect. Children remember better those insights
		    they discover while discussing and interacting with their peers (Falk &amp; Dierking, 2000). There are several ways to design mobile
	    games specifically to support social interaction. </p>
	    <h4>Design for teams rather than individual players</h4>
	    <p>Gaming as a team, certainly when in competition with other
		    teams, causes a spontaneous feeling of solidarity among team members, and with
		    that comes natural group communication. Because of the difficulty of sharing
		    one device among multiple players, it is advisable to give each team member his
		    own PDA, but there are ways to maintain and even stimulate the team spirit via
		    the mobile guide. Avatars or virtual characters of the different team members, for instance, can be visualized on the PDA,
		    players can be consequently addressed as a group, and various collaborative
		    activities can be built in. This contributes to creating a truly shared
	    experience at the museum or cultural tourist site. </p>
	    <h4>Create collaborative learning moments</h4>
	    <p>To create a collaborative learning experience, it is
		    necessary to deliberately create group interactions during the games &ndash; times
		    when the messages of the museum or institution are discussed, when information
		    is transferred among players, when opinions are expressed... Depending on the
		    type of content and the game concept, numerous ways of communication are
		    possible: role-playing sequences, aiming for the consent of the whole group
		    about certain game decisions, searching for problem-solving strategies, arguing
	    for or against a certain opinion.... </p>
	    <h4>Trigger communication through humor</h4>
	    <p>Humorous and surprising elements in the graphical design,
		    the audio tracks or the presented content evoke laughter and comments by the
		    players. This natural verbal and nonverbal communication enhances the shared
	    experience youngsters have and stays in their memories. </p>
	    <h3>4. Value the graphical design of the user interface</h3>
	    <p>The importance of the graphical design to attract and
		    maintain the attention of pupils on the presented content can hardly be
		    overrated. Strive for a subtle match between the graphical interface and the
		    physical presentation so that the design reflects the presented content. This
		    close match between the mobile guide and the physical presentation can also be
		    exploited to stimulate interaction with the real artifacts and objects on
		    display. The PDA can trigger the players to explore their surroundings,
		    discover detailed aspects of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; objects and steer their gaze towards
	    the most interesting parts of the collection. </p>
	    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
	    <p>Determining the appropriate way to introduce mobile ICT
		    solutions in museums and the cultural tourist sector remains a difficult and
		    complex process. We stress the importance of allowing for the context of the
		    visit and for the different technological solutions to support this context, to
		    enhance visitor experience. Depending on the significance and the
		    interpretation the target museum, institution or site attaches to the personal,
	    physical and socio-cultural context, the mobile application can vary. </p>
	    <p>The resulting wide scope of possibilities in the
		    deployment of mobile guides for museums and the cultural tourist sector reveals
		    a strong need for further guidance with regard to the realization of mobile ICT
		    solutions. To meet this demand, we are currently setting up an expertise centre
		    that includes a demo- and test-infrastructure in which prototypes of different
		    institutions can be tested and evaluated. The main goal is to offer support in
		    the assessment of mobile ICT solutions and to serve as a test environment in
		    which novel ICT applications can be deployed, experienced and evaluated. Fig. 8
		    shows an overview of how such a demo- and test-infrastructure could function.
		    The target environment (any given museum or cultural tourist site) can be
		    simulated by means of projections on large screens, computer screens embedded
		    in movable display cases, ambient sound, and other interactive systems. This
		    simulated environment allows development of realistic mobile solutions, tuned not
		    only to the target environment but also to the target visitor group, by means
	    of user tests. </p>

	    <p class="caption">Fig. 8: Simulated museum environment to evaluate and demonstrate
	    mobile ICT solutions</p>
	    <p>The demonstration of early prototypes in such an
		    infrastructure entails important surplus value in the increased involvement of
		    all stakeholders (visitors, museum staff, decision makers and developers) in an
		    early stage of the development of a mobile guide. This infrastructure also
		    gives us the opportunity to refine and steer the guidelines proposed above and
		    to verify mobile guide solutions in different contexts. In this way, the centre
		    allows us to offer full support for the development process of a mobile ICT
	    application for museums and the cultural tourist sector.</p>
