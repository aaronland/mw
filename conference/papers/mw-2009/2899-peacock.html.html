        School-based users, both students
          and educators, have always been a primary target audience for museum on-line content.
          Museums and other cultural organisations have made significant investments in developing
          and disseminating content on-line to reach and engage these users. Yet despite the
          obvious logic of this connection, in practice it has proven difficult to build effective
          permanent bridges between the wealth of museum digital content and the classroom
          environment. While many individual institutions host outstanding educational content
          on their individual Web sites, this material may remain inaccessible or under utilised
          in a classroom environment due to technology and security constraints, or simply
          through lack of awareness or discoverability. We are yet to develop effective and
          sustainable supply chains of museum digital content from multiple institutions for
          use in classroom environments. In Australia and Canada two new national approaches
          to solving the supply chain problem have been developed by two agencies working
          with museum organisations to facilitate the flow of content into classroom environments.
          This paper examines the imperatives driving these initiatives and the lessons learned
          in creating an integrated national approach to developing digital supply chains
      for school-based users of museum content.</p>
      <p class="AbstractText">Keywords:
      schools, education, digital content, supply chain, museums.</p>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The past fifteen years of the digital revolution have seen
        a transformation of cultural content and experiences through the use of new
        information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as the Web. These
        technologies have radically changed the types of content that are created and
        how it is distributed and used. The chains of connection from originating
        source to end user have been remade so as to be completely different from those
      of less than a generation ago. </p>
      <p>The effects of these &lsquo;disruptive technologies&rsquo; has
        arguably been most profoundly felt in the cultural and informational
        industries: news, entertainment and education. In the publishing, broadcasting
        and recorded music industries, the landscape has been completely reworked by
        the new digital supply chains and the business models that they enable
        (Benkler, 2006). Those content producers and providers that have not embraced
        new models for distribution on-line have been usurped or have withered where
        they stood. Think <i>Amazon, </i>publishers
        and book stores. Think <i>iTunes,</i> record
      companies and music stores. Think <i>Netflix</i> and video rental stores.</p>
      <p>Museums have often been quick to adopt new ICTs, but
        generally slow to adapt to the deeper challenges and opportunities they
        present. There has been a wealth of experimentation but little systemic shift
        in how content is produced and delivered to key markets. The institutional Web site
        remains the primary delivery mechanism for museum on-line content, as it was 15
        years ago.  Collaboration between museums and other cultural institutions has
        supported multi-institutional sites and portals at the regional, national and
        sometimes international level, yet the stand-alone, institutional Web site
      remains predominant in the digital supply chain for museum content. </p>
      <p>A dozen years have passed since people like David Bearman
        and Lyn Elliot Sherwood alerted cultural organisations to the imperative for
        new business models to support digital content delivery (Bearman, 1997; Elliot
        Sherwood, 1997). So where&rsquo;s the hold- up? As the information and entertainment
        industries around us progress to ever more integrated, flexible and globalised
        digital supply chains, notwithstanding the impediments of copyright, proprietary
        formats and trade barriers, the museum sector is yet to achieve a basic level
        of integrated content distribution, much less one which encompasses peer memory
      institutions such as libraries and archives.</p>
      <p>The Web&rsquo;s promise of easy user access across
        multi-institutional repositories remains unfulfilled. While thousands of single
        museum shopfronts have emerged on-line, there is no simple point of access, no <i>eBay</i> or <i>Amazon</i> to broker, enable and stimulate supply and demand. In the
        absence of such integrated distribution, filtering and feedback systems, supply
        and demand - in this case for museum digital content - remain poorly aligned. As
        a result, would-be suppliers and potential users both lose out, as many of the
        possible exchanges of content and feedback never occur. A sustainable market
        for museum digital content can be created only when the digital supply chains
      joining these links are firmly established. </p>
      <p>Aggregation and customisation are the keys to distribution
        in the digital era. With very few exceptions, the single museum Web site will
        probably always lack the range of content and level of customisation required
      to meet the needs of significant national or global market segments.</p>
      <p>In recent years many museums have begun to distribute and
        co-create content via third-party Web 2.0 platforms such as <i>Flickr</i>, <i>YouTube, Facebook</i> and <i>Second
          Life</i>. (Rothfarb and Doherty,
            2007; Alexander, et al, 2008; Bernstein, 2008; Dawson, et al, 2008; Oates,
            2008). These initiatives have shown that new distribution channels beyond
        the museum Web site reach a wider user base, increase content use, build user
        loyalty and engagement and may also attract traffic back to the institution,
        both virtual and physical. Web 2.0 platforms, with their rankings, ratings,
        tagging and recommender systems, also provide instantaneous feedback on how
        resources are being accessed, rated, circulated, interpreted and/or reused. Supply,
        demand, appraisal, utilisation and feedback are tightly linked,  improving the
        responsiveness of suppliers and stimulating demand in a mutually reinforcing,
      ongoing dynamic. This is the essence of an effective business model.</p>
      <p>While some of these  initiatives have been targeted
        at particular user segments, often to engage new or hard-to-reach consumers,
        little progress has been made to date in developing extensive content
        distribution systems, based on sustainable business models, which directly
        service existing primary museum customers <i>en
          masse</i>. While Web 2.0 platforms provide a high pressure hydrant for
        distributing content, we still need to learn where to point the fire hose for
      maximum benefit, both for users and for museums.</p>
      <p>In their recent book <i>Thriving
        in the Knowledge Age</i>, John Falk and Beverley Sheppard argue cogently that
        museums, &ldquo;must consciously and deliberately develop business models for the new
        age in which we now live.&rdquo; (Falk and Sheppard, 2006: 222). Further, they
      contend that, </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">the museum community&rsquo;s strongest public role in this new
        age is as educator. [&hellip;.] The ultimate mission, then, may be to use the institution&rsquo;s
        assets to create the richest learning environments possible for as many people as
      possible. (226). </p>
      <p>While these comments are primarily addressed to the
        physical museum space, such a focus is arguably equally valid for on-line
      spaces.</p>
      <p>Given the imperative for explicit business models and the
        primacy of the education mission, what better place to start on the challenges
        set by Falk and Sheppard than with a business model for digital content that
        serves the needs of school-based users of museum services, a fundamental and
      abiding target customer segment?</p>
      <p>The failure to establish effective and well targeted
        digital distribution systems for museum content is particularly apparent and
        regrettable in the case of school-based users, or potential users, of museum
        digital content and services. It represents a major unfulfilled opportunity to
        develop new markets, products and services and to transform institutional
        practice for the digital age. This paper explores how two countries, Australia
        and Canada, are progressing towards achieving a more systematic flow of museum
      digital content within classroom environments.</p>
      <h2>Why Schools Matter</h2>
      <p>School-age students, their teachers, parents and other
        carers represent prime, if not primary audiences for most museums. In countries
        like Australia, Canada and the United States, the school-age population
        represents around 10% of the total population. That&rsquo;s about two million, three
        million and 30 million potential users respectively in each of those nations. Add
        the adults using the Web alongside those students and we are talking about as
      much as 25% of the total population.</p>
      <p>For those institutions that receive significant public
        funding, school-based users also represent a key responsibility for museums,
        indeed a <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>, in the view of
        governments. They are also a significant focus for the investment of museum
        resources. According to a study by the Institute for Museum and Library
        Services (IMLS) conducted in 2000-01, the 15,000 museums in the United States
        committed more than 1 billion dollars of resources annually to school age
      programs (IMLS: 2002).</p>
      <p>There can be no doubt that museums and their funding
        agencies continue to consider educational users key to the success of their
        mission. As a target for museum on-line content, the value and importance of
        these users is difficult to underestimate. Moreover, there is a natural
        affinity and compatibility between schools and museums as well as long
        established patterns of relationship. As trusted sources of information and
        valued providers of experiential learning, museums are better placed to succeed
        in the marketplace of school digital content than their competitors. Similarly,
        schools represent perhaps the most promising and manageable market for museum
        digital content. All these indicators point to what should be a win-win
      scenario.</p>
      <h3>From piecemeal to pipeline?</h3>
      <p>Given these imperatives and opportunities, it is somewhat
        surprising that the digital supply chains between museums and school-based
        users should be so fragmented or underdeveloped. In Australia, for example, the
        demand for digital content resources from the nation&rsquo;s collecting institutions,
        according to Russo and Watkins, &ldquo;remains largely unrealised: [as a] lack of
        communication between cultural institutions and the education sector means that
        the significant demand pull that the secondary school [Years 7-12] could exert
        on cultural institutional &lsquo;supply&rsquo; is only beginning to be felt&rdquo; (Russo and
      Watkins, 2007: 153). </p>
      <p>There is already some evidence of the low level of use of
        digital content from Australian cultural institutions within Australia&rsquo;s
        classrooms. Research undertaken for Australia&rsquo;s Online Ministerial Council in
        2005 revealed that less than 2% of the content sourced on-line within
        Australian schools came from its cultural institutions (Collections Council of
      Australia, 2008). Clearly there is significant scope for improvement.</p>
      <p>This failure to connect, to build the pieces into a
        pipeline, is the result of many factors. Problems at the supply end include
        institutional inertia, poor quality, unmanaged data and generally inadequate
        resources. At the consumer end, school users, or would-be users, are beset by a
        number of impediments, most of them not of their own making. Internet filtering
        and other restrictions on the free flow of content, teacher reluctance or
        resistance to using on-line content, and limited access to equipment or
        infrastructure all play a part. In a recent survey of 1100 Australian
        educators, respondents identified the following common barriers to using
      on-line technologies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Poor access to bandwidth (41% of respondents)</li>
        <li>Blocking or filtering of Internet content (40%)</li>
        <li>Limited access to computers and Internet connections (21%)</li>
        <li>Limited confidence or expertise (20%)</li>
        <li>Lack of relevant resources on the Internet (12%)  (education.au,
          2008)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The shifting sands of government decisions in educational
        policy and funding also create a complex environment, seldom conducive to
        co-ordinating on-line content initiatives across the jurisdictional boundaries
      that shape school curricula, priorities and resources.</p>
      <p>There is also the ongoing problem of effective design of
      schools resources. </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">All too often, digital library developers create collections
        of resources in the absence of rigorous examination of educator and learner needs.[&hellip;.T]eachers
        have very specific information needs relating to mastering the curriculum
        content and the behavioural structures of their classrooms for a diverse range
      of learners. (<span class="BlockQuoteAuthorChar">Mardis: 2009</span>)</p>
      <p>Despite the lack of systemic solutions, there are a number
        of extant and imminent initiatives that seek to address the problem of digital
        supply chains between museums and schools. Projects such as the <i>Teaching with Digital Content</i> in
        Illinois, funded by the IMLS (Bennett and Trofanenko, 2002),<i> </i>the<i> Science Museum Collaboratory</i> in San Franscisco (Kahn, 2007) and <i>Access.ca</i> in Canada (Zilber and Marsh,
        2007) all bring together resources from multiple institutions into on-line
        learning environments aimed at meeting teacher and student needs. The <i>National Museums Online Learning Project </i>in
        the UK, presented at Museums and the Web in 2008, also shows enormous promise,
        both in its scope, and also in its clear focus on particular user groups and a pragmatic
        approach to technological integration with museum back-end systems (Makewell,
      2008).</p>
      <p>Yet while cultural organisations get better organised,
        there are also emerging competitors in the on-line classroom space. In any
        marketplace, new providers will seek to fill the space of unmet demand. To
        circumvent the common prohibition of access to<i> YouTube</i> imposed in many schools, Google launched <i>TeacherTube</i> early in 2007 (<a
href="../http://www.teachertube.com/"><span class="URLChar">http://www.teachertube.com/</span></a>)
        featuring peer-to-peer content sharing for teachers, including video, in an
        educationally oriented and &lsquo;safe&rsquo; on-line environment. Such services will
        continue to raise the bar of expectation regarding what museums can offer
      educators on-line.</p>
      <h3>Two new approaches to the museum digital supply chain problem</h3>
      <p>Australia and Canada share a number of similarities: they
        are nations with indigenous and settler histories, they have populations that
        are similarly sized and widely dispersed geographically, and they have similar
        structures of government, where education is primarily delivered by
        state/provincial administrations, while the national government provides
        significant funding and policy directions. In both of the cases described here,
        a national government agency &ndash; in Australia, The Le@rning Federation and in
        Canada, the Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN) - has worked to
        facilitate the production and distribution of museum digital content for
        classroom use by collaborating with a range of museums. These projects and the
        work that preceded them demonstrate many of the structural, technological,
        content, design and organisational issues that need to be addressed to
        establish national infrastructure to connect museums and classrooms
      effectively. </p>
      <p>This paper will discuss the two approaches taken and
        explore the issues, successes and future plans of these two initiatives. These
        examples and the learning gained offer potential models for other nations to
        develop sustainable, multi-institutional supply chains to support classroom use
      of museum on-line content. </p>
      <h2>Case 1: Collaboration between Museums and the School Education Sector in
      Australia</h2>
      <p>The Le@rning Federation (TLF) is a collaborative
        initiative of Australian and New Zealand national and state governments,
        established in 2001 and managed by the Curriculum Corporation (<span
class="URLChar"><a href="../http://www.thelearningfederation.edu.au/">http://www.thelearningfederation.edu.au</a></span>). The TLF develops
        digital curriculum content for use through school-based technology
        infrastructure at no charge. By June 2009, more than 8,600 digital learning
        objects will be available through TLF and distributed to all Australian and New
        Zealand schools; the majority of them have been developed in collaboration with
      the cultural sector. </p>
      <p>The Le@rning Federation has also been responsible for
        facilitating agreements across education sectors on technical, intellectual
        property and metadata specifications to support the distribution of content.
        The initiative has developed infrastructure to manage the storage and
        distribution of content and recently launched a portal, <i>Scootle</i> for registered users (<a href="../http://www.scootle.edu.au/"><span
class="URLChar">http://www.scootle.edu.au</span></a><i>)</i>. <i>Scootle</i> has been
        enthusiastically taken up by teachers. Since June 2008, 12,000 teachers have
        subscribed and created 6,000 learning pathways that can be shared by others.
        During this six month period, 960,000 digital learning objects were viewed.
        When combined with data from other education portals, it is estimated that TLF digital
      curriculum content is being accessed more than three million times per month.</p>
      <p>Since 2002, TLF has worked with Australian cultural
        organisations to develop and digitise museum, library and archival content to
        facilitate school-based access and use through the national TLF Learning
        Exchange and other state based content distribution systems. TLF has worked
        with a range of Australian cultural institutions to source and describe in
      curriculum terms more than 4 500 digital content items.</p>
      <p>Our experience in working with museum-sourced content and
        observing its use by teachers raises some important questions about how to
        prepare and present such information. What, for example, is context, and how
        does it impact on the use and interpretation of items within museum
        collections? How does audience perspective influence the presentation of items,
        particularly within an on-line environment? What opportunities does an on-line
        environment allow for the contextualisation of museum objects based on audience
      perspective and requirements? </p>
      <p>In 2007 The Le@rning Federation and the Australian
        Association for the Teaching of English worked with teachers to develop units
        for the teaching of English to students aged 14 to 18. The teachers primarily
        used on-line digital items sourced from Australian museums, galleries and
        libraries by TLF and participating institutions. The items (digitised images,
        film and sound) had been selected, digitised and described to support the
      Australian curriculum. </p>
      <p>These digitised museum and gallery items, called digital
        resources, consist of a file of the digitised item and associated metadata. The
        file could be an image of a vase, a film of a horse race, or a recording of an
        anthem. The metadata consists of text that describes the item and its
        educational value, spatial and temporal information and copyright and
        permissions acknowledgements. To assist teachers to discover the content within
        the search engines of education portals and repositories, keyword descriptors
      are sourced from a thesaurus of educational terms and topics called the <i>Schools Online Thesaurus</i> developed by TLF. </p>
      <p>A review of the English units reflects the diverse range
        of topics and curriculum perspectives, with titles such as &ldquo;Advertising&rdquo;,
        &ldquo;Ballads in Year 9&rdquo;, &ldquo;Heroic endeavours and relationships&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Me
        Generation&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ordinary people can be extraordinary&rdquo;, &ldquo;Poets paint words&rdquo;, and
        &ldquo;The power of protest&rdquo;. The unit, &ldquo;How do we use language to persuade?&rdquo; is
        described as &ldquo;selected digital content is used alongside paper and web-based
        materials to support critical literacy development including persuasive
      techniques and analysis of point of view and bias&rdquo; (<span class="URLChar"><a

      <h3>Matching museum information with teacher needs</h3>
      <p>Given such diversity of topics, it would be very difficult
        for a museum-based educator, Web content manager or curator to anticipate and
        prepare for the specific requirements of each of these teachers. The digitised
        museum collection has open access and potentially empowers teachers and
        students to interpret the items beyond the context offered within the walls of
        the physical museum and the culture of the museum staff. A digitised
        collection, when presented with the appropriate tools and flexible access,
      enriches the value of the collection for a wider range of audiences.</p>
      <p>The Le@rning Federation has worked with more than twenty-six
        cultural and public institutions identifying and developing digital resources
        for on-line distribution to Australian and New Zealand schools. Schools access
        these items either through portals developed specifically for schools, such as <i>Scootle,</i> or through the institutional Web
        sites. Initially, the process was labour intensive as The Le@rning Federation
        provided the resources required to develop the digital resources to the
        requirements of the Australian and New Zealand school curriculum. Increasingly,
        however, participating institutions took on more responsibility, with TLF
        providing support through training and quality assurance. The development
        process though remained external to the core digitisation and curatorial
        systems within the institutions, and hence, was not sustainable. A new solution
        was needed to streamline the content production process and better integrate with
      the workflow within the cultural organisations. </p>
      <p>In a collaborative project with three of Australia&rsquo;s major
        public museums: Museum Victoria (<span class="URLChar"><a href="../http://museumvictoria.com.au/">http://museumvictoria.com.au</a>)</span>,
        National Museum of Australia (<span class="URLChar"><a href="../http://www.nma.gov.au/">http://www.nma.gov.au</a></span>)
        and Powerhouse Museum (<span class="URLChar"><a href="../http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/">http://www.powerhousemuseum.com</a></span>)
        and The Le@rning Federation, a
        pilot has been established to model more sustainable processes for museums to
        be able to meet the diverse requirements of the education community. Key to the
        model is to leverage the core processes of museums whilst focusing on the
        requirements of teachers and students. The principles underlying the pilot are
        that the digital resources are discoverable and accessible within a range of on-line
        environments and systems, that the items are relevant to teachers, and that the
        context in which they can be applied allows for the diversity required, as
      witnessed with the English teacher project. </p>
      <p>To meet these objectives, the participating museums are
        reviewing their digitisation processes and knowledge management, particularly
        when it comes to managing the associated text accompanying the digitised item.
        There has been agreement between The Le@rning Federation and museums on
        metadata and technical specifications to ensure that the technology maintains
        the integrity of the data. TLF is supporting the museums through providing
        feedback on the quality and relevance of the metadata and information on the
        use of the digitised items by teachers and students. Finally, the pilot is
        investigating the pedagogical application of selected Web 2.0 tools such as
      chat, wiki and collaborative content creation. </p>
      <p>Of interest to TLF is exploring and promoting pedagogical
        strategies when using Web 2.0 tools. Educators are continually encouraged to
        adopt the latest technologies, but little is shared on how to apply these
        within an educational context. Teachers are wary of adopting new practices
        unless evidence can demonstrate that learning was improved. TLF is working with
        teachers from 16 schools in this pilot to review the strategies they use to
      exploit the museum content and utilise the tools within <i>Scootle</i>. </p>
      <p>One strategy is for teachers to set the scene for students
        through using deep questioning techniques. For instance, &ldquo;Should bridges be
        designed primarily for their aesthetic or structural value?&rdquo; In this type of
        questioning, there is no right or wrong answer, and students are encouraged to
        research and debate their viewpoints. Within the <i>Scootle</i> environment, groups of students will be able to discover,
        select and annotate relevant content, debate their viewpoints, and collectively
        present the groups&rsquo; findings. The teacher will be able to view each student&rsquo;s
        input to the evolution and final version of the presentation. The Le@rning
        Federation will collate the teaching and learning strategies developed through
      the pilot for distribution to the education and museum sectors.</p>
      <p>Figure 1 describes the architecture of the pilot where
        museums make metadata available to The Le@rning Federation using Open Search
        protocols, which in turn distributes the metadata to educational portals. For
        the purpose of the pilot, the portal developed by The Le@rning Federation, <i>Scootle</i>, is being used. <i>Scootle&rsquo;s</i> search and browse interface
        allows teachers and students to discover digital resources using broader and
        narrower educational terms and topics, timelines and <i>Google maps</i>. Embedded Web 2.0 tools allow students to collaborate
        over their assigned work and for the teacher to review the collective and
      individual student contributions. </p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 1: The
        architecture of the collaborative pilot between museums and The Le@rning
      Federation describing the flow of metadata and feedback mechanisms</p>
      <p>Challenges for the pilot are many and have exposed issues
        of knowledge management and quality, student engagement with the digital content,
        and teachers&rsquo; capacity to utilise on-line technologies through effective
      pedagogy. </p>
      <p>One key finding has been the need to manage the
        information associated with a museum object, such as its acquisition data,
        significance information and curatorial notes and labeling. Participants have
        found that the voice for each type of information varies and rarely forms a
        coherent narrative when combined. The default practice for writing information
        about collection objects focuses on collection management and within the
        context of exhibitions. As yet, the practice of describing content for an on-line
        audience does not occur for the bulk of digitised items in museums. It is
        anticipated that the feedback mechanism from student and teacher use of the
        content will inform the museums on the best way to prepare the content for the
      schools&rsquo; education audience. </p>
      <p>In an ideal world, teachers and students should be able to
        discover and use digitised content that is authoritative, relevant and presented
        in a way that allows them to engage with the content in the creative ways that
        good teaching and learning encourages. Museums are ideally situated to be key
        repositories of quality resources. In the transition between the physical and
        the digital collections, legacy practice and systems are being reviewed and
        aligned to support a more integrated digital production process. This pilot
        will inform this process, particularly when considering the requirements of two
      key audiences, teachers and students.</p>
      <p>The findings of the pilot will inform further projects
        between the Australian school sector and museums. It has already shaped
        knowledge management processes within the participating museums. Australian
        museums are using this pilot to inform their own agreements on technical and
        metadata standards. The tools developed for this pilot will be made available
      to all teachers registered within <i>Scootle</i>.</p>
      <h2>Case 2: Virtual Museum of Canada&rsquo;s Teachers&rsquo; Centre</h2>
      <p>In Canada, CHIN has established its Teachers&rsquo; Centre
        project as part of its successful Virtual Museum of Canada (VMC) initiative (<span
class="URLChar"><a href="../http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca</a></span>) The Virtual Museum of Canada
        is a portal that brings Canada&rsquo;s rich and diverse cultural heritage into
        Canadian homes and schools. The VMC gives more than 1300 partner museums of all
        sizes and disciplines the ability to reach Canadians and an international
      audience via the Internet.</p>
      <p>The VMC features a guide to Canadian museum services and
        events, as well as a repository of more than 600,000 digital artefacts. Visitors
        are able to view and interact with more than 500 on-line exhibits and games,
        create and manage personal museums, send electronic postcards, watch cultural
        videos, and listen to podcasts on a variety of art, natural science, and
        culture-based subjects. With over 50 million visits from more than 200
        countries since its launch in March 2001, the VMC is now established as one of
      the world&rsquo;s premier heritage gateways.</p>
      <p>Through user testing and feedback analysis obtained from
        visitors to the VMC, it was determined that a significant number of VMC
        visitors were from educational institutions and had specific learning-based
        needs. These included students completing homework assignments and
      professionals doing research. </p>
      <p>The VMC, since its beginning, has had the goal of
        showcasing Canadian cultural content. Evolving social technologies, Web
        behavior, and user expectations also made it apparent that new aspects and
        functions of the VMC would have to involve active user participation,
      contribution, and collaboration. </p>
      <p>In 2007, CHIN created a new educational application for
        the Virtual Museum of Canada&rsquo;s Teachers&rsquo; Centre. The Centre currently contains more
        than 360 Learning Resources and several Web applications allowing educators to
        create and manage virtual classrooms, create lesson plans, use communications
        tools like blogs and wikis, and share content with students and other
      educators.</p>
      <p>Addressing the educational pursuits of our audience and
        actively involving them became the basic initial requirements upon which the
      new Teacher Centre application was created.</p>
      <p>With the VMC Teacher&rsquo;s Centre, CHIN has worked closely
        with 21 museum partners and many educators to create modular digital content
        items and associated learning objectives. Museums have contributed more than 1,800
        digitized media files (image, audio, video, Flash, text) in the form of more
        than 300 Learning Objects. The VMC Teachers&rsquo; Centre application allows teachers
        and students to deconstruct the modular learning objects and create their own
        lessons with the museum content. Additionally, Teachers are able to set up
        virtual classrooms, create and manage student accounts, and use blogs, wikis
      and messaging systems to complete their virtual learning initiatives.</p>
      <p>CHIN has worked with many educators in and outside of the
        classroom in order to create learning scenarios and lesson plans. The VMC
      Teachers&rsquo; Centre now has more than 430 registered teacher and student users.</p>
      <h3>Lessons learned from thirty years of service to museum education</h3>
      <p>CHIN has been helping museums to digitally expand their
        educational outreach for the better part of its thirty-plus year existence.
        Previous to the VMC, in 1998, CHIN launched <i>Learning
          with Museums</i>. This was an on-line tool by which museum professionals could
        catalogue virtual exhibits and highlight the educational content found within.
        They could also highlight pre-created lesson plans. General users (including
        educators, teachers, and students) were able to find the catalogued resources
        through a public interface. This Web application facilitated the dissemination
      of cultural content to an audience with specific education-based needs.</p>
      <p>In 2006, CHIN started planning the new Teachers&rsquo; Centre.
        This involved defining high level business requirements and eventually a broad
        concept. In order to advance our thinking, we ensured the projects CHIN undertook
        at this time also contained specific educational components. One such project
        was <i>Massive Change in Action,</i> based
        around the <i>Massive Change</i> exhibition
        created by Bruce Mau and commissioned by the Vancouver Art Gallery. CHIN
        created a supplemental project working with Bruce Mau, the Toronto District
      School Board, and several teachers and classes. </p>
      <p>This project allowed us to begin defining what a learning
        object would be; how on-line activities could be structured; how learning
        resources could be used by teachers before and after visits to the exhibition;
        and as well to address several other conceptual aspects regarding what our
      virtual learning environment might be and how it might be used.</p>
      <p>Following <i>Massive
        Change in Action</i>, we finalized our definition of a &ldquo;learning object&rdquo; as a
        stand-alone entity that can be coupled and decoupled in multiple ways to create
        various learning or training scenarios. Every learning object must contain
        specified learning objectives. We also further defined the concept for our
        virtual learning environment in preparation for it to eventually become the new
        Teachers&rsquo; Centre. This led us to launch a project in collaboration with six art
        galleries from across Canada. We asked the galleries to provide us with their
        ideal learning objects based upon our definition. This project was very
        revealing in that what we received differed enormously from one institution to
        the next. The six learning objects varied greatly in size, depth, technologies
        used, level of interactivity, and intention. While all six learning objects
        contained very valuable educational content, none of them could interoperate
        with the others. This project provided us with something to consider and discuss,
        and really helped us determine how to go about structuring and assembling
      content. </p>
      <h3>Founding principles for the Teachers&rsquo; Centre</h3>
      <p>The research undertaken over the previous years taught us
        many lessons.. These lessons became fundamentals upon which our new Teachers&rsquo;
      Centre application would be constructed.</p>
      <p>We recognized the need to better address the
        education-based needs of museum audiences. We also knew the importance of
        allowing our audience to truly participate. This led to the first founding
        principle of our project:  &ldquo;learning by doing&rdquo;. Museum educators
        needed to be able to create their own learning objects, educators needed to be
        able to create their own lesson plans, students needed to be able to create
        their own projects, and all these people needed to be able to interact with one
      another.</p>
      <p>We also understood the need for standards. Every aspect of
        the project would be based on standards &ndash; technical, methodological, and
        content-based. As we wanted users to be able to couple and decouple museum-contributed
        content, standards in structure and technology were crucial in the development
        of interoperable learning objects. Additionally, as we wanted people to be able
        to find content and have it reflect their expectations, then metadata and
      content creation standards were also required.</p>
      <h3>Research and development project: <i>Agora</i></h3>
      <p>Originating from the Greek word for &ldquo;meeting place&rdquo; and
        with the &ldquo;go&rdquo; in <i>Agora</i> branded to
        reflect active participation, the VMC Teachers&rsquo; Centre&rsquo;s new research and
        development project, titled <i>Agora</i>,
      was underway by the end of 2006.</p>
      <p><i>Agora</i>'s two main
        components were a Web application for museum professionals and a Web
        application for educators and students. The Learning Object Input Template is a
        tool that was created to facilitate the interoperability of learning objects.
        Rather than burdening museums with innumerable standards, we created a system
        that allows museums to upload content, fill out metadata schemas, and produce
        content that can easily be broken down and reassembled by educators and
      students.</p>
      <p>Every piece of content, which we call a &ldquo;media file&rdquo;, is
        combined with metadata based on the GCED standard. This is the Government of
        Canada Education Standard based on Dublin Core and Cancore profiles. The
        implementation of metadata compatible with universally accepted metadata
        standards allows for interoperability of our content with other e-learning
        initiatives (such as provincial curriculum-based initiatives to disseminate
        educational content to school boards, undertaken by the Governments of Ontario
        and New Brunswick). Museum professionals upload files, fill out form fields,
        and save their work, all on-line. Once content has been entered by the museums,
        the resulting learning resources are published by the application for use by
      educators and students.</p>
      <p>The &ldquo;Learning by doing&rdquo; theme is central to the public
        aspect of <i>Agora</i> as well. The Virtual
        Classroom allows educators to create student accounts, manage classes of
        student accounts, and use a variety of Web communication tools. The heart of
        the application, however, is the content aggregator. This is what allows
        educators to save museum created content, in whole or in part, and reassemble
        content (from a variety of sources) into personally aggregated lesson plans.
        User-created content can be added to these compositions as well. These lesson
      plans can then be assigned to classes and shared with other educators.</p>
      <h3>Validation and evolution</h3>
      <p>From <i>Agora&rsquo;s</i> earliest conceptualization through design and development, CHIN has been
        conducting testing. These activities included consultations with CHIN members
        and advisory groups, concept testing, usability testing with teachers,
        usability testing with students, formal focus groups with teachers, formal
        focus groups with students, technical testing, and user acceptance testing with
        teachers, students, and museum professionals. From all of these activities,
      feedback was compiled, analyzed, and used in order to tune <i>Agora</i> into what users wanted and expected.</p>
      <p>Once construction was complete, and many policy and
        business issues resolved (such as handling copyright, access and registration
        of minors on-line, and content moderation) the soft launch of <i>Agora</i> took place in the fall of 2007. It
        was launched as a research project and was not fully integrated in the Virtual
        Museum of Canada. This was done so that the third phase of the <i>Agora</i> project could begin: the applied
      research phase.</p>
      <p>With <i>Agora</i> live
        on the Internet, CHIN undertook many different testing and use scenarios in an
        attempt to determine how the new VMC Teachers&rsquo; Centre would take shape. While
      this was taking place, public users were free to use <i>Agora,</i> and this provided us with even more relevant data.</p>
      <p>The differences in teaching methodologies, technical
        support, and technical aptitude between schools and teachers are phenomenal. As
        such, the first applied research activity CHIN undertook was the use of <i>Agora</i> by teachers in the classroom. From
        simply printing out learning objects to full virtual use and distance
        education, this process provided excellent insight into the variety of ways in
        which <i>Agora</i> could and would actually
        be used. At the end of this research activity, teachers were asked to fill out
        questionnaires, and again the feedback received was excellent. No matter how
        great the iterative design and testing method was during the construction of
        the application, very valuable technical and user requirements for the next
      release of the application emerged through this process.</p>
      <p>After the in-class testing, CHIN undertook several other
        activities. Heuristic evaluations of the application were completed by
        usability experts, researchers, and teachers. Information sessions and demos
        took place at conferences - both for museum professionals using the input
        template and for teachers and students using the public application. In the
        past few months, CHIN has also started hosting webinar sessions. The first was
        directed at teachers, but more are planned for museum professionals as well as
      students.</p>
      <p>In the past year of evaluation, these activities have
        produced excellent feedback in the form of both criticisms and validations. The
        data that has been developed has been compiled and analyzed, and a plan for
        evolution has been put in place. At the same time, new users of the application
        have been steadily growing in numbers so that there are now more than 500
        registered users, while museum content contribution to the system has become a
      formalized process that has evolved based on feedback as well.</p>
      <h3>Discoveries</h3>
      <p>Some of the lessons learned through the in-class testing
        are not related to general usability or technical concerns. One issue was our use
        of nomenclature. Educators and students often use different terms than museum
        professionals in reference to things like &ldquo;media files&rdquo;. How we would address
        this took careful thought and planning since the input template of our
        application was designed for use by museum professionals, and the public
        virtual learning environment was addressed to educators and students. One
      global standard for nomenclature is not enough.</p>
      <p>Within the virtual classroom, the two main tasks are <b>finding</b> content and <b>using </b>content. The use scenarios revealed a disconnection
        between the two tasks. This is something that hadn&rsquo;t been revealed through any
        previous testing but was confirmed when a larger number of people actually
        started using the live product. We had to bring the two activities closer
        together so that they became part of the same task. Users could find content as
      they were constructing content aggregations.</p>
      <p>Another lesson learned has been the use of third party
        software. Many teachers and students have their own blogs, use their own e-mail,
        have <i>Flickr</i> accounts, etc. While our
        system provides these services, many users would prefer to be able to integrate
        the software solutions they are already using. We are currently designing the
        Teachers&rsquo; Centre to be a more open and interoperable system, yet at the same
        time continuing to adhere to all the intellectual property, copyright, and
        privacy constraints we have to abide by and which are often stricter that those
      held by private industry.</p>
      <h3>The New VMC Teachers&rsquo; Centre</h3>
      <p>The evaluation phase of <i>Agora</i> is now complete, and the research and development project
        titled <i>Agora</i> has ended. The
        application has been validated and is being brought into the VMC as an official
        product. Its first real evolution (in software terms) is currently underway.
        The spring of 2009 will see the launch of a redesigned, re-conceptualized
        Virtual Museum of Canada, complete with a newly integrated VMC Teachers&rsquo; Centre
      application.</p>
      <p>Evaluation and evolution of the Teachers&rsquo; Centre will,
        however, not cease. CHIN has several use and testing activities planned in
        order to continue to better meet the educational needs and expectations of our
        audience. In fact, based on the lessons we continue to learn, the next planning
      phase of the Teachers&rsquo; Centre evolution is already underway.</p>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this paper has been to stimulate discussion
        about the best models for improving the distribution of museum digital content
        for school-based users. The examples here show some of the dilemmas, obstacles and
        possibilities in building integrated and sustainable digital supply chains to
        support this relationship. In both instances, a national government agency &ndash; in
        Canada, the Canadian Heritage Information Network, and in Australia, The Le@rning
        Federation- has worked as a broker in the relationship between museum producers
        and school-based users, for the benefit of all parties. The new distribution
        and feedback systems they have created are still in their infancy but show
        great potential. Of course, these are not the only, or necessarily the best,
        models for all nations. However, they do demonstrate the capabilities of
        integrated systematic approaches to deliver content on the industrial scale
        required by the education sector, but with suitable levels of customisation and
      flexible functionality. </p>
      <p>What the two cases presented here demonstrate is that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Integrated and efficient digital supply chains for museum schools
          content are viable;</li>
        <li>Sustainable business models for museum digital content need to span
          multiple institutions;</li>
        <li>Agreed standards for content design and interoperability are
          critical;</li>
        <li>There is a high degree of variability in the way teachers use on-line
          content;</li>
        <li>The needs of educational users of museum content are highly
          diverse;</li>
        <li>Effective teaching and learning requires the capacity of teachers
          and students to create and engage with the content;</li>
        <li>Digitisation of content broadens access and use of museum
          collections, and a flexible publishing model will account for audience
          expectations and other museum requirements;</li>
        <li>Cross sectoral partnerships are necessary to stimulate change.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>The challenges for government policy makers and
          educational administrators are to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support significant investment in digital content distribution
          systems that are based on sustainable business models;</li>
        <li>Foster cross sectoral projects to challenge default practice;</li>
        <li>Provide support for teachers to investigate new pedagogies that
          will exploit the technologies young people access;</li>
        <li>Overcome the technical and administrative impediments that
          inhibit access to on-line museum content; </li>
        <li>Establish feedback processes to inform museums on the use of
          their digital content in schools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The challenges for museums are to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Realign their priorities and work practices and consider the audience
          early in the supply chain;</li>
        <li>Establish processes and culture amongst staff that encourage the
          flexible use of digital content that Internet users expect;</li>
        <li>Understand the technical and educational context of the schools
          sector;</li>
        <li>Ensure copyright permissions allow for flexible use of content
          within an educational setting;</li>
        <li>Understand that to support wider use, museum digital content must
          be able to be used in a range of non-museum contexts. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The rewards for establishing sustainable digital supply chains
        for museum content for school-based users will be significant and long-lasting.
        Not only will the interests of quality, variety and efficiency be served, but
        the new interactions between producers and users made possible through
        systematic feedback will also spur greater creativity and innovation. Conversely,
        the costs of continued failure to forge these connections in an integrated and
        systemic way will be borne by both the museum and the education sector.
        Investment in distribution systems such as those described here will ensure
        that both sectors do not miss out on the potential synergies streamlined
        production and distribution systems offer to fulfil their missions in the
        digital era. The projects presented here show the emergence of a new approach
        that will enable the much anticipated potential of museum digital content for
      school-based users to finally be fulfilled.</p>
