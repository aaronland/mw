		<h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
		<p class="AbstractText">How
		  can museums employ new media to enhance their visitors' experience and their
		  collections' accessibility? With the Internet moving into the public domain through
		  wireless connections, broadband mobile telephony, and location-aware technology,
		  museums are no longer bound by their physical limits (the building), but can
		  use all relevant spaces, be it the city, the country or the public domain.</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">Technology
		  enables audiences to access, produce, and share media everywhere and at all
		  times, and museums are quite far on in digitizing large parts of their
		  collections. The combination of 24-hour on-line audience availability and rich digitised
		  cultural musem content brings ample opportunities to create new cultural
		  experiences.</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">In
		  this context, Waag Society recently developed a number of projects in which
		  users are guided by mobile technology. The paper gives an overview of these
		  projects and argues that the physical non-institutional environment is a great setting for appreciating cultural content and inducing active
		    user participation.</p>

	    <h2>Introduction</h2>
	    <p>More and more location-based projects are
		    being developed in the heritage domain. Although they are still
		    relatively small in both number and in size, the impact of these projects on
	    established cultural practices may turn out to be surprisingly great. </p>
	    <p>The motivation to
		    explore location-based projects lies in the (technical) developments that take place, as well as the opportunities they offer for heritage
		    institutions to connect to (new) audiences. But location-based projects trigger
		    a lot of questions within heritage institutions. Is this for us? (How) can we first
		    stimulate and then deal with user participation? What technological choices are
		    best in the long term? The actual user experience seems distant in these
	    discussions.</p>
	    <p>This paper describes the impact that location-based
		    projects have on the users/participants, and analyses a number of the projects
		    Waag Society has initiated. By offering this glimpse into our practice, the
		    authors hope to further the discussion on the (im)possibilities of locative
	    experiences in the cultural domain. </p>
	    <h2>The Advent of Locative Media</h2>
	    <p>With the emergence of the Internet and developments
		    in digitization, museums and related organizations are forced to reinvent
		    themselves to find and establish new and unusual alliances. The Internet is
		    rapidly rearing its head in public space. With the advent of wide-band mobile
		    phone with advanced positioning capabilities (TomTom principle), it is possible
		    to produce, consume, and share media anywhere. People are always on-line somewhere,and
		    know more and more how to take advantage of this. In addition, institutions are
		    busy implementing the policies of the government regarding digitization of
		    museum collections. In Holland, the 170Meuro project &ldquo;Beelden voor de Toekomst&rdquo;
	      (Images for the Future) gives both space and money to do this right. This
		    brings forward new opportunities for the experience of heritage museums. Where
		    the collection was previously (arbitrarily) confined inside the walls of the
		    museum, it is now possible to make it visible in other places where it is
	    relevant: in the city, in the country, and in public space.</p>
	    <p>We see a proliferation of different mobile
		    devices popping up in the streets. Next to MP3 players, the Mobile Phone is the
		    most obvious example. As these devices get more powerful and connected,
		    different kinds of use can be envisioned. The Dutch Social Cultural Planning
	    Bureau (SCP) writes in its report, The Virtual Culture Visitor, June 2008: </p>
	    <p class="BlockQuote">The growing availability of digital culture, greater familiarity
		    with digital media and increasing digital skills of the Dutch will stimulate the
		    use of virtual cultural heritage. It is plausible that the balance between the different
		    kinds of uses will change. The Internet is now mainly used as an information medium,
		    but in the future, there will be more emphasis on the use for relaxation, personal
		    development and communication and the formation of communities&hellip;.. Finally, the emergence
		    of many Web 2.0 applications leads towards the user taking a creative, producing
		    role regarding cultural heritage. This will intensify the use of existing content
	    and even more and new people will make use of virtual cultural heritage.</p>
	    <p>These developments lead to a new kind of
		    cultural experience that facilitates both existing and new target groups. Many
		    museums are experimenting with PDAs within the museum. They focus on explaining
		    the collection and linking objects in the collection, but often there is no
		    link with the world outside of the museum. Mobile cultural projects and stories
		    can trigger stories and reactions in the participants, but there is rarely a
		    possibility to upload your own story that connects to a specific location. In
		    short, there are few examples of successful integration of technological
		    possibilities with the goals of museums and visitors. The aforementioned report
	    of the SCP writes about near future developments: </p>
	    <p class="BlockQuote">The experts also expect a further rise of the mobile Internet,
		    leading to place-independent network access. The interface is no longer (only) the
		    PC; the laptop or mobile phone is the ideal tool. According to the experts, because
		    of the emergence of the mobile Internet, cultural consumption is increasingly becoming
		    a cross-media experience, which uses different kinds of media to stimulate a reaction
		    or emotion with the viewer/visitor. In exhibitions or performances, for example,
		    physical and virtual environments can alternate or overlap each other. An online
		    game can help visitors to explore a museum and people can add information to an
	    exhibition themselves. </p>
	    <p>As mentioned, in this context location-based
		    projects have started up all over the world, but heritage institutions - and
		    their financers - struggle with the questions they bring to the table. The
		    possibilities seem endless, the technology is not transparent enough for  making choices, the costs are often high, the staff is not
		    used to audience participation, the audience is aging, etc. Our own experience
		    with location-based projects can provide new angles to a more user- and content-
	    driven discussion.</p>
	    <h2>Waag Society: Background</h2>
	    <p>The Waag Society is an Amsterdam-based
		    Media Lab that develops technology for social Innovation. The foundation was
		    established in 1994 and continues to empower people to both express themselves
		    and connect to other people. It works in the domains of Culture, Health Care,
		    Education, Sustainability, and the Public Domain. One
		    of the key subjects that Waag Society has researched is the use of locations,
		    and more recently, modern mobile phones, both in education and in cultural
		    heritage. This research was set up in 2001 with <i>Amsterdam Realtime</i>, with users drawing a real time map of Amsterdam
		    by tracing their routes with GPS. Amsterdam Realtime was a collaboration with
		    artist Esther Polak and sparked several location-based projects. Some of these
	    are detailed bellow.</p>
	    <h2>Projects</h2>
	    <h3>Creating a historical sensation</h3>
	    <p>In 2005, the project <b>Frequency 1550</b> was developed. Frequency 1550 is a mobile city game
		    that uses GPS and UMTS technology to let pupils of the secondary schools actively learn about history - instead of passively absorbing
		    knowledge - by walking around and playing in Amsterdam&rsquo;s city centre. The aim
		    of Frequency 1550 was to bring the Middle Ages alive for pupils, within the
		    context of their history lessons. The reactions were overwhelmingly positive, both
		    with the participating schools and with a general audience. At that point, the
		    technology was so new that, by itself, it didn&rsquo;t attract the attention of a
		    wide audience. Frequency 1550, however, made it to The Dutch TV News because of
	    its innovative and applied character.</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="vandijk.fig1.jpg" alt="figure 1" width="400" height="300" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 1: Pupils using the mobile history
	    game</p>
	    <p>For the pupils who played it, the
		    technology was not the only attractive aspect. The impact of the experience was
		    boosted both by the use of game elements and by the fact that they
		    navigated the centre of Amsterdam on a medieval map. Looking at familiar
		    surrounding with this different view provided the pupils with a strong
	    experience, stronger than any textbook can provide. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="vandijk.fig2.jpg" alt="figure 2" width="400" height="273" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 2: Medieval map of Amsterdam divided
	    into four (coloured) game spaces</p>
	    <p>When talking about the impact of this type
		    of cultural heritage project, reference to Johan
		    Huizinga&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;historical sensation&rdquo; is immediate. Huizinga (1872-1945), a Dutch historian, stands for an emphatic and
		    intuitive approach to history (Boone, 2008). In that light it is logical that
		    he doesn&rsquo;t offer a strong definition of the concept of historical sensation,
	    but rather describes a feeling: </p>
	    <p class="BlockQuote">the feeling of an immediate contact with
		    the past, a sensation as deep as the purest enjoyment of the Arts&hellip; you touch
	    the essence of things, the experience of Truth through history. </p>
	    <p>It is an experience often described as
	      &lsquo;immersive&rsquo;; we like this definition even though it&rsquo;s different from the
		    popular use of the word immersive used to describe VR and theme park
		    experiences, because of its link to the authenticity
		    and personal nature of the experience, and because it&rsquo;s small, a fleeting
	    moment. </p>
	    <p>As an example of an historical sensation,
	    Huizinga asked the reader to imagine the following.</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuote">You walk on the street, and a barrel organ
		    [the well-known organ you find in the Dutch streets] is playing, and if you
		    approach it, it suddenly happens that a breeze of recognition blows through
		    your mind, as if for a moment you understand things which otherwise would be
	    covered by the shrouds of life.</p>
	    <p>Such fleeting moments of recognition help
		    to introduce you into History more than any statistics
	    or generalizations could do (Boone, 2008). </p>
	    <p>Dutch historian and philosopher Frank Ankersmit (2005) elaborates on Huizinga&rsquo;s comparison to the arts. </p>
	    <p class="BlockQuote">... our experience of a work of art is a
		    quite specific situation and most fundamentally different from the
		    epistemological situation that historians normally find themselves in when
		    having to develop the most plausible hypothesis about what has happened in the
	    past.</p>
	    <p> Furthermore, Ankersmit says that in
	    historical sensation,</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuote"> All spatial and temporal demarcations
		    have momentarily been lifted: it is as if the temporal trajectory between past
		    and present, instead of separating the two, has become the locus of their
		    encounter. Historical experience pulls the face of past and present together in
		    a short but ecstatic kiss. Historical experience is, in this way, a surface
		    phenomenon: It takes place on the surface or interface where the historian and
	    the past meet each other.</p>
	    <p>In other words, it is where the
	    interpretation and experience meet each other. </p>
	    <p>Is it the case that an active experience of history through
		    the immersing qualities of a location-based game really adds to historical
		    awareness, knowledge and appreciation of the city and its history, and enhances
		    competencies such as the interpretation of historical sources and references?
		    This question can be answered positively, according to Joost Raessens,
		    Professor of New Media and Digital Culture (Raessens, 2006; and additional
	    research by ILO and IVLOS on learning competences). </p>
	    <h3>Fostering personal reflection </h3>
	    <p>As the concept of historical sensation
		    seems to create an openness to enjoy history and a willingness to learn more
		    about history, it is a powerful concept for cultural projects. In addition, the
		    concept of such a strong sensation can have broader meaning as it can be
		    defined as an experience, triggered by an unplanned, surprising, and maybe even
		    magical moment, that somehow connects to you, in the way that art can do. The
		    trigger can be an event,some music, an image - basically anything and
		    everything. Apparently the historical sensation has a strong relationship with
		    the present. It can give agency to cultural projects with a more general user
	    group: we actively pursued this in the Rituals project. </p>
	    <h3>Rituals</h3>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="vandijk.fig3.jpg" alt="figure 3" width="400" height="600" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig3: Mobile phone interface with the
	    Rituals route</p>
	    <p><b>Rituals</b> is a GPS-based walking route connecting
		    religious monuments in a theatrical approach. The
		    project was part of the activities that accompanied the European Year of Religious
		    Heritage. In Holland, formal religions are in decline, while at the same time
		    spirituality is taking a more important place in our increasingly
		    individualistic society. Therefore we decided to target the personal and
		    emotional level: the private (spiritual) experience of the participants. To
		    achieve this, we attempted to combine the notion of an on-site historical
		    sensation with the concept of <i>storification</i>. Storification involves
		    not only experiencing a story, but also simultaneously making sense of the
		    experience (Akkerman, Huizenga, Admiraal, 2009). Maybe we are capable of experiencing an
		    historical sensation and at the same time relating it to our every-day life and
		    making sense of it. Storification seems to ask for strong narrative
	    organization and possibilities for internal structuring of the experience. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="vandijk.fig4.jpg" alt="figure 4" width="400" height="600" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 4: Mobile phone interface with a
	    Rituals assignment</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="vandijk.fig5.jpg" alt="figure 5" width="400" height="267" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 5: Participant photographing herself
	    in historic mirror</p>
	    <p>As the goal here was to evoke personal
		    reflection and active audience participation, the narrative was organised in a
		    such way that participants could experience the power of rituals and share
		    stories of their own, by using dramaturgical elements such as writing down a
		    personal confession (whether big or small) at the start of the walking route
		    and referencing that confession at several locations. The confession was
		    written down in private in front of a huge mirror - which participants found
		    powerful. In addition, several mirrors were used throughout the route, as
		    metaphors for personal reflection. In a church, participants listened to a
		    (recorded) confession. In a Buddhist temple they burnt an incense stick while
		    having to think about their own confession. In the &quot;hidden church&quot; <i>Onze Lieve Heer op Solder</i> (Our
	    Lord in the Attic, one of the oldest and most remarkable museums in Amsterdam), they created their personal place of worship. </p>
	    <p>By carrying out these acts and by walking the
		    route, a new ritual was introduced: distancing oneself from the confession, tossing the confession to
		    the wind at the end of the route. In the end, the route brought about an exchange or dialogue that transcended religions and enabled
	    people to experience familiar urban surroundings in a different manner. </p>

	    <h2>Stimulating Cultural Exchange</h2>
	    <p><b>City
		    Ragas</b> is a visual cultural exchange game played on
		    mobile phones. City Ragas was developed for the Amsterdam-India Festival that took
		    place in November 2008. In November, throughout the city, cultural events that
		    originated in India took place. With City Ragas we tried to set up contact
		    between people from Amsterdam and Delhi, bringing the experience of Delhi to
		    the streets of Amsterdam and the other way around - based on the exchange of user-generated
	    content. </p>
	    <p>On the Web, users are increasingly
		    approached as content creators. Web sites like YouTube, Flickr, and MySpace are
		    dependent on the input from the community. Without contributions from users
		    there is no content and no linking between people. For mobile applications, it
		    is also valuable to think about user participation. In the Rituals project, the
		    participants knew that their confession would be kept secret; in City Ragas,
		    the users&rsquo; input is central and public. Within a given theme, participants in
		    Amsterdam and Delhi made a photo story onsite. The acts consisted of
		    photographing the city and responding to photographs from the other, unknown
		    city. Players found it very special to receive a picture of someone else whom
		    they do not know, from a distant land, a foreign culture - making the
		    Amsterdam-India Festival very relatable on a human level. Empowerment of the users is important because it allows them
		      to create &ldquo;new forms of global awareness or connectedness that are not part of
		        the global commercial media or consumption industry, nor part of a cultural
        elite of &lsquo;high culture&rsquo;&rdquo; (Sassen 2006). </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="vandijk.fig8.jpg" alt="figure 8" width="400" height="760" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 8: Some of the user contributions in
	    City Ragas</p>
	    <p>It is often assumed that young people especially
		    are interested in mobile applications. In Rituals, we deliberately aimed at a
		    general, older audience. These elderly people were interested in the mobile
		    application and mastered it much faster than we expected. This target group
		    however differs from younger people in the way they react to and use mobile
		    applications. Elderly people like to be guided by the
		    application, they prefer to be told where to go, what to do, etc.... Younger
		    participants like to determine what they do themselves. Also, they prefer to do
		    things in their own order. It was found that young people tend to capture their
		    own images more often. They are more inclined to be producers of their own
		    content. The development of mobile applications specifically for the elderly,
	    however, needs specific attention.</p>
	    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
	    <p>Based
		    on our experience with cultural heritage projects, we conclude that the physical
		    environment is a great setting for triggering
		    historical sensation, storification, personal reflection, and cultural
		    exchange. Technical (locative) tools can further enhance this, linking history
		    and personal or present-day experience. Looking back on the three projects
		    described, we have moved from a technology-driven, very controlled situation (Frequency
		    1550) to an open system for content exchange (City Ragas), with a growing role
		    for user participation. As we are dealing with interfaces between the fictional
		    and the real, the urban and the virtual, as well as the interaction between
		    street and &lsquo;players&rsquo;, it is a logical step to connect the locative experience
		    to gaming and theatre and performance art, in order to trigger active user
		    participation. <span style='color:black'>Critical design practice should investigate
		      the scenarios and dramaturgies that are necessary for a general audience to
        assume an active and independent role.</span> </p>
	    <p>Also, the connection of this type of
		    project to existing museum practice needs more research, though<span
style='color:black'> it is clear that heritage institutions can provide
		      critical </span>context for the
		    experience. The Waag Society&rsquo;s strategy in this is to
		    set up more experiments with cultural heritage partners in a long-term
		    programme by the name of Location Based Heritage, incorporating partnerships
	    with artists, heritage institutions and sector institutions. </p>
