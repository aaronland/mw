        <p class="AbstractText">Technology is consistently transforming the ways in which
		  museums and libraries provide access to their collections and holdings.
		  Multi-touch interactive table exhibits have the power to deliver objects and
		  documents in engaging communal settings. The unique experience that interactive
		  tables provide, both in terms of the type and quality of interaction with
		  artifacts and with other individuals, makes them ideal for sharing collections
		  on-site and beyond the walls of the cultural institution. This paper examines
		  these benefits within the context of the Library of Congress&rsquo;s interactive
		  multi-touch application, <i>History at Your
		    Fingertips: U.S. Presidential Nominating Conventions</i>, which showcased
		  historical content on the Microsoft Surface platform at the 2008 Democratic and
	    Republican National Conventions.</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The Library of Congress is the nation&rsquo;s oldest federal
		  cultural institution and the largest library in the world with 142 million
		  items in its collections. These items include books, recordings, photographs,
		  maps, and manuscripts which are available in 470 languages. With a mission to
		  make these vast, multi-format resources available and accessible,
		  implementation of new technologies is one way the Library is able to increase
	    access to its resources in innovative and far-reaching ways.</p>
		<p>In the summer of 2008, the Library made significant and
		  timely content available to its two main constituencies, Congress and the
		  American people, via an interactive table application developed for the
		  Democratic and Republican presidential nominating conventions. The multi-touch,
		  interactive Microsoft Surface platform proved ideal for presenting primary
		  source documents, multi-format materials, and curatorial information while
	    providing interaction that simulates actual manipulation of objects. </p>
		<p>Using the <i>History at
	    Your Fingertips</i> project as a case study, this paper will address how:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>multi-touch user interfaces approximate &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; object
		    manipulation;</li>
		  <li>interactive tables provide greater access to museum and library
		    collections;</li>
		  <li>interactive multi-touch tables provide engaging experiences for
		    users.</li>
	    </ul>
		<h2>The Project</h2>
		<p>Developed in under six weeks, the <i>History at Your Fingertips</i> application allows users to select host
		  cities to access multimedia objects from past presidential nominating
		  conventions. More than 170 available objects include photographs, hand-written
		  documents, sound clips, seating charts, video clips, telegrams, posters,
		  political cartoons, and speeches spanning 150 years. Highlights include a
		  poster from the first Republican Convention held in 1856, a hand-written letter
		  from Abraham Lincoln to the convention president accepting his party&rsquo;s
		  nomination, a sound recording of Franklin D. Roosevelt made in 1932, a
		  photograph of Coretta Scott King at the 1976 Democratic Convention, and video
	    of Barbara Jordan&rsquo;s keynote speech at that same 1976 convention.</p>
		<p>Developed in partnership with Microsoft and the development
		  firm InterKnowlogy, the application runs on the Microsoft Surface platform and
	    was coded in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). </p>
		<h2>Multi-touch Interfaces and Object Manipulation</h2>
		<h3>User interfaces &ndash; requirements for multi-touch</h3>
		<p>The Library content identified by curatorial staff and the
		  expanded possibilities available with interactive tables provided the basis for
		  functional design. InterKnowlogy used an iterative design and development
	    process to construct the final user interfaces and interaction schemas. </p>
		<p>Five key considerations were addressed during the design
	    process.</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>Multi-user interaction &ndash; multiple people will use the application
		    at one time.</li>
		  <li>Multi-user orientation &ndash; individuals can use the table from any
		    of the four sides.</li>
		  <li>Intuitiveness &ndash; users should be able to guide themselves through
		    the application.</li>
		  <li>Discovery &ndash; animations and graphics should be used to effectively
		    invite users to touch elements that allow for progression through the
		    application.</li>
		  <li>Enticement &ndash; passersby should be attracted to approach the table
		    and engage with it.</li>
	    </ol>
		<p>Each of these requirements guided decision-making throughout
		  user interface development. User observations conducted during the design
	    process helped to fine tune the &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; nature of the application.</p>
		<h3>User interfaces &ndash; the benefits of multi-touch</h3>
		<p>Standard touch-screen kiosks generally implore the user to
		  touch various buttons, controls, and other on-screen elements as a way to
		  navigate through information in a self-serve environment. However, multi-touch
		  tables are better suited for object discovery as touch and gesture are employed
		  in a way that approximates actual manipulation. The larger surface and horizontal
	    orientation of interactive tables allow for shared and social experiences.</p>
		<h4>Starting out &ndash; maps and playing cards</h4>
		<p><i>History at Your
		  Fingertips: U.S. Presidential Nomination Conventions</i> begins by offering
		  users the option to view Democratic or Republican artifacts. After the choice
		  is made, the main geographic interface highlights U.S. cities where party
		  conventions have taken place, along with the year(s) of the convention(s). Upon
		  selection of a city/year, a card pops up which features a picture of the
		  nominated candidate for that year along with summary information about the
		  convention itself. The card is oriented in the direction of the user who
		  selected the item.  Upon touching a control on the card, the screen is
	    populated with related multimedia objects.</p>
		<p class="caption"><img src="pyne.fig1.jpg" alt="figure 1" width="500" height="262" /></p>
		<p class="caption">Fig 1: The map interface on the <i>History at Your Fingertips: U.S. Presidential Nominating Conventions</i> Microsoft Surface table</p>
		<h4>Moving an object</h4>
		<p>Users can move artifacts around by touching and dragging
		  them. A user can move an object closer, &ldquo;pass&rdquo; one across the table to another
		  user, and change the orientation to share details with another person. (This
		  works just like passing real documents or photographs across a desk and
	    rotating them in the direction of the viewer.)</p>
		<h4>Flipping an object</h4>
		<p>Users can flip an artifact over by placing two fingers down
		  on it and performing a &ldquo;flipping&rdquo; motion. A flip-over icon can also be touched
		  to get the same result. Turning over objects such as photographs and audio
		  files reveals additional content in the form of citations and curatorial
		  information. (Think of flipping an old photograph over to see the written
	    information printed on the back.)</p>
		<h4>Zooming in and out</h4>
		<p>Users place two fingers on an object and move them apart and
		  together for the desired zooming affect. (Imagine stretching an item with two
	    fingers.)</p>
		<p class="caption"><img src="pyne.fig2.jpg" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="382" /></p>
		<p class="caption">Fig 2: User initiating action to &ldquo;zoom in&rdquo; on artifact</p>
		<p class="caption"><img src="pyne.fig3.jpg" alt="figure 3" width="500" height="382" /></p>
		<p class="caption">Fig 3: Artifact enlarged by user for closer examination</p>
		<h4>Playing audio and video</h4>
		<p>Users &lsquo;press&rsquo; play, stop, etc., by touching the multimedia
		  control buttons anchored to the audio and video artifacts (just like pressing
	    the controls on your DVD or video player).</p>
		<h4>Object recognition</h4>
		<p>Though not part of the initial implementation of <i>History at Your Fingertips</i>, Microsoft
		  Surface tables are capable of recognizing actual physical objects tagged with
		  identifying codes. Imagine placing a facsimile of a document or a replica of an
		  artifact on the computer table to have related information displayed.
		  Curatorial information, location, educational activities, video and any
	    associated relevant content could be made available in this way.</p>
		<h2>Multi-touch and Collection Access</h2>
		<p>Web sites and on-line collections are effectively being used
		  to expose more of an institution&rsquo;s holdings than can be physically exhibited.
		  Interactive tables have the benefit of providing high-quality digital access to
		  items both on-site in the context of a full exhibition and in other settings as
	    stand-alone exhibits to deliver collection items outside of the institution.</p>
		<p>Six Microsoft Surface tables were available at both the 2008
		  Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado and the Republican National
		  Convention in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Attendees, delegates, press, House and
		  Senate members, governors and others had access to <i>History at Your Fingertips</i> for the full four days of each
	    convention.</p>
		<p><img src="pyne.fig4.jpg" alt="figure 4" width="500" height="375" /></p>
		<p class="caption">Fig 4: Attendees at the 2008 Republican National Convention
		  using the <i><br />
		  History at Your Fingertips:
	    U.S. Presidential Nominating Conventions</i> application</p>
		<p>The Library was essentially able to &ldquo;bring&rdquo; collection
		  treasures on-site to share with the public the history of a long-standing and
		  significant event right in its midst. Conference-goers were able to magnify and
		  rotate captivating photographs, zoom in to read important handwritten and
		  printed documents, and play poignant sound and video clips to recall stories of
		  the past, all while they themselves were becoming a part of convention history.
		  In this manner, an institution could conceivably provide any manner of its
	    content related to any context using interactive tables as display tools.</p>
		<h2>Engaging Experiences for Users</h2>
		<p><i>History at Your
		  Fingertips</i> was uniformly well received at both conventions. The format provided
		  for users to receive an optional five-minute demonstration on the table itself.
		  Most users interacted with the application for an additional fifteen to twenty
		  minutes after the introductory demonstration, while others stayed for upwards
		  of an hour. Adults and children were equally facile, with younger users more
		  willing to dive in without a demonstration. The technological aspect of the
		  experience quickly dissolved as users realized how self-evident it all was. The
		  application was self-explanatory and the technology responded in predictable
		  ways. The content took front stage as individuals became enthralled listening
		  to the voice of William Jennings Bryan recorded in 1896, reading a 1912
		  telegram from Theodore Roosevelt, examining a photograph of Dwight and Mamie
		  Eisenhower, or watching video of President Kennedy delivering a speech. The
		  objects made the stories come to life, and the platform allowed users to &ldquo;touch
	    history.&rdquo;</p>

		<h2>Summary and Conclusion</h2>
		<p>In addition to providing engaging communal experiences
		  on-site, multi-touch computer-based exhibits also have the power to deliver
		  artifacts outside the walls of the cultural institution. The type and nature of
		  the interaction in multi-touch environments allows for high-quality simulated
		  object manipulation via touch. The medium allows for collection holdings to be
		  presented in relevant and meaningful real-world settings;  interactive tables
		  allow for captivating experiences that are collective in nature. The Library of
		  Congress&rsquo;s <i>History at Your Fingertips</i> Microsoft Surface application exhibited at the 2008 presidential nominating
	    conventions effectively demonstrated these benefits. </p>
