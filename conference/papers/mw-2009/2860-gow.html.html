        <h4 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h4>
        <p class="AbstractText">Digital New Zealand aims to help make New Zealand content
    easy to find, share and use. The project team has chosen an approach which
    involves identifying and attempting to solve the challenges faced when
    creating, describing, licensing, preserving and making digital content
    available: every part the project team’s work is targeted at creating a
    solution to a challenge. The first wave of the project produced three
    innovative tools: Memory Maker, for making short videos using researched New
    Zealand material; a customisable search builder, for gathering data; and an
    open API for connecting DigitalNZ metadata with other data sources. In this
    way, DigitalNZ is showing what is possible when you improve the accessibility,
    usability and discoverability of New Zealand content. There will be more to
  come.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="caption"><img src="gow.fig1.gif" alt="figure 1" width="480" height="325" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 1: Map of the world</p>
<p>If you ask the average
    Northern Hemisphere citizen to locate New Zealand on a map, you may begin to
    get a sense of why many New Zealand cultural organisations find it difficult to
  make their content visible in the vastness of the Web.</p>
<p>New Zealand is a small island nation with a population of
    just over four million people (around 0.06% of the world’s population). It is
  noted for its geographic isolation, natural beauty, and ‘can-do’ attitude.</p>
<p>In this paper, we describe some practical solutions the
    Digital New Zealand programme has developed to confront issues that make New
    Zealand content difficult to discover, share and use; and discuss how we are
    working with a range of cultural heritage institutions in New Zealand to
  provide access to collections.</p>
<p>DigitalNZ is testing ways to create digital content,
    collect and share existing digital content, and build smart, freely available
    search and discovery tools. The project is working with New Zealand
    organisations, communities and individuals to aggregate their metadata and help
    make hard-to-find content available for discovery, use and re-use in unique
    ways.  </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Memory Maker lets people craft their own commemoration of the 90th
    Anniversary of the Armistice by remixing film, photographs, objects and audio
    clips into a short video that can then be saved, shared, and embedded. </li>
  <li>A
    customisable search builder lets people design their own search widget to find
    the type of New Zealand content they are interested in and embed it in their
    blogs and Web pages. </li>
  <li>Finally, an open API enables developers to connect the
    metadata that fuels DigitalNZ with other data sources, enabling new digital
    experiences, knowledge, and understanding. </li>
</ul>
<p>We draw particularly on the programme’s first activities,
    which used the theme of “Coming Home” to focus content development, based on the
    commemoration of the 90th Anniversary of
  the World War One Armistice and the return of soldiers to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Digital New Zealand, however, has a much wider reach
    across collection, content and topic boundaries – including into the
  geospatial, educational, and research sectors, and indigenous cultures.</p>
<h2>Making Memories</h2>
<p class="caption"><a href="../http://warart.archives.govt.nz/node/599"><img src="gow.fig2.jpg" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="536" /></a></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 2: Walter Armiger Bowring, <em>The Homecoming from Gallipoli</em>, 1916. Painting held by <span
class="MsoHyperlink">Archives New
    Zealand. Te Rua Mahara o te Kāwanatanga.</span><span
class="MsoHyperlink">(<a href="../http://warart.archives.govt.nz/node/599">http://warart.archives.govt.nz/node/599</a>).</span></p>
<p>Early last century, when the population of New Zealand was
    just over one million, many New Zealanders’ first experience of leaving the
    country was to fight in the First World War. From that 1914 population of just over
    one million, the War took more than 100,000 New Zealanders overseas. Far fewer
  came home, and nearly half of those who did were wounded.</p>
<p>As with many other countries, the impact of the First
    World War on New Zealand lasted well beyond the Armistice in November 1918 – a
    fact recorded and documented in many of the country’s cultural and heritage
    institutions, not to mention in the fabric of the community and through the
  presence of memorials in almost every town.</p>
<p>Yet much of the wealth of New Zealand content that carries
    these memories – often already made digital and stored in collection databases
    – is hidden or buried, especially in an indexed international Web of one
    trillion pages (Singer, 2009) which simply scrapes the surface and dilutes
  content from small nations or specialised niches.</p>
<p>If content is hidden or buried, it can’t be used to make
    new ways of remembering. As cultural thinker Charles Landry (2007) puts it,
    “heritage works best when we perceive ourselves to be part of its continual
  creation”.</p>
<h3>Memory Maker: Remixing cultural heritage content</h3>
<p class="caption"><a href="../http://remix.digitalnz.org/"><img src="gow.fig3.jpg" alt="figure 3" width="500" height="768" /></a></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 3: Interface to the Memory Maker
  (<a href="../http://remix.digitalnz.org/">http://remix.digitalnz.org</a>)</p>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Memory  Maker blurs the line between consuming and producing content. What’s sometimes called
    ‘remix culture’ [&hellip;]. Digital technologies have opened up new possibilities for young
    people to access and represent the stories of their culture by taking sound and
    images and recombining them to say something new, something relevant to them. <br />
    (Sarah
  Jones, Lunch Box: Software &amp; digital media for learning, November 2008) <a href="../http://lunchbox.org.nz/2008/11/get-coming-home-on-your-schools-website-wiki-or-blog/">http://lunchbox.org.nz/2008/11/get-coming-home-on-your-schools-website-wiki-or-blog/</a>)</p>
<p>The interactive Memory Maker provides a real-world example
    of how licensed or out-of-copyright New Zealand content can be remixed by users
    to create new perspectives and experiences if content is appropriately
  identified.</p>
<p>Inspired by previous Museums and the Web conferences, we
    wanted to let New Zealanders create their own way of remembering the impact of
    war by finding and creatively reusing (without restriction) digital content
  from organisations, individuals, and communities.</p>
<p>The Memory Maker is an interactive on-line video remix
    tool that lets people mix historical film footage, digitised photographs and
    objects, and music/audio clips into a 60 second video that can be saved,
  shared, and embedded on other sites.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The Memory Maker uses the Ideum Editor One software
    application. The problem we were trying to solve here was not software
    development, but lack of understanding and adoption of new licensing and rights
  practices by cultural heritage institutions.</p>
<p>Using an off-the-shelf product allowed us to focus on
    working with members of New Zealand’s National Digital Forum - a coalition of
    museums, archives, art galleries, libraries and government departments - to
    identify material that could be
  ‘freed up’ for people to remix with permission.</p>

<h3>Success stories</h3>
<p class="BlockQuote">I made a movie last
    night with mum. Mum said it was really cool, we should send it to people. That’s
    what I did <i>(School student, Room 5, Nelson
  Central School)</i></p>
<p class="BlockQuote">Thanks for
    directing me to room 5's masterpiece. It's really exciting to see our content
    being used like this and I can't wait to see what else evolves. (<i>Project manager photographic collections, The
  Nelson Provincial Museum)</i></p>
<p>The Memory Maker provides a taste of what is possible when
    collecting institutions modernise their practices for keeping and managing
    copyright information, using Creative Commons licenses or ‘no known copyright’
  statements.</p>
<p>For us, the success of the endeavour was seeing a class of
    school children use the tool to make movies that put our attempts to shame.
    Learning about ‘hyperlinks’ today, these young New Zealanders will be the
  developers and creators of tomorrow.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig 4: Children from Nelson Central School recount their
    DigitalNZ stories </p>
<p>But it wasn’t always easy to convince institutions to try
    something new. Later in this paper we describe how we worked with content
  providers to take up this opportunity.</p>
<h2>Exploring the Coming Home Collection</h2>
<p>The “Coming Home” theme provided a focus for New Zealand’s
    National Digital Forum to work together to enhance electronic access to our
  culture and heritage.</p>
<p>The Memory Maker uses only a fraction of the Coming Home content.
    The full set of contributions is accessible through a Coming Home search tool, occasionally
    on a google-like hosted search page (Figure 5), but more often through a search
  widget embedded on many New Zealand Web sites (Figure 6).</p>
<p class="caption"><a href="../http://search.digitalnz.org/cominghome"><img src="gow.fig5.jpg" alt="figure 5" width="500" height="251" /></a></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 5: The Coming Home search widget (DigitalNZ hosted

<p class="caption">Fig 6: The Coming Home search widget on Auckland City

<p>The result is unique New Zealand content being brought
    together and accessed through discovery points all over the Web, from
    educational blogs through to institutional Web sites, wikis and intranets – and
    if people can’t add the search widget to their site, they can link directly to
  a hosted version of the search.</p>
<h3>What the user experiences</h3>
<p>The following screenshots give a taste of what users
    experience when they come across the Coming Home search tool. Figure 7 shows
    the Coming Home search box (‘powered by DigitalNZ’) embedded on a community
  repository Web site that has also provided content for Coming Home.</p>
<p class="caption"><a href="../http://horowhenua.kete.net.nz/adopt_an_anzac"><img src="gow.fig7.jpg" alt="figure 7" width="500" height="403" /></a></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 7: The Coming Home search box on a community Web site
  (<a href="../http://horowhenua.kete.net.nz/adopt_an_anzac">http://horowhenua.kete.net.nz/adopt_an_anzac</a>)</p>
<p>Figure 8 shows the user searching Coming Home for ‘flu
    epidemic’. One of the tragedies of the Great War was that in the two months
    following the declaration of peace, New Zealand lost about half as many people
    to influenza as it had in the whole of the First World War – and one of the
  ways the disease spread was at memorial events.</p>
<p>The first results are embedded in the Web page, and the
    user can click on a result to go straight to the item on the content provider’s
  Web site – or choose to see more results.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="gow.fig8.jpg" alt="figure 8" width="500" height="530" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 8: Searching for ‘flu epidemic’</p>
<p>In Figure 9, we see what happens when the users select
    ‘Show more results’. They are taken to the ‘hosted search result’ page on the
    DigitalNZ Web site. This provides a full interface to the Coming Home
    collection. Note the faceted filtering allowing further search refinement and
  manipulation of information, including the License facet.</p>
<p class="caption"><a href="../http://search.digitalnz.org/cominghome/search?search_text=flu%20epidemic&amp;filter[category]=Images"><img src="gow.fig9.jpg" alt="figure 9" width="500" height="342" /></a></p>

<p>Figure 10 shows a search result selected by a user. In
    this case the content was created by a small provincial museum, and is hosted
  by the DigitalNZ shared repository, Kete Digital New Zealand.</p>
<p>Kete (the Māori word for “basket”) is an open source
    community repository developed by New Zealand company Katipo. DigitalNZ hosts a
    Kete to support institutions that lack the resources to otherwise get their
  content on-line.</p>
<p class="caption"><a href="../http://kete.digitalnz.org/site/images/show/44-diary-24-nov-1918?view_size=large"><img src="gow.fig10.jpg" alt="figure 10" width="500" height="570" /></a></p>

<p>The final step
    in our user’s progress is to follow a link from Kete Digital New Zealand to the
  Nelson Provincial Museum Web site (Figure 11). </p>
<p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.museumnp.org.nz/"><img src="gow.fig11.jpg" alt="figure 11" width="500" height="446" /></a></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 11: The Nelson Provincial Museum Web site. Definitely
  worth a visit! (<a href="../http://www.museumnp.org.nz/">http://www.museumnp.org.nz/</a>)</p>
<p>DigitalNZ is driving users from all over the Web to
    content providers’ Web sites, where they can get more detail about the content
  and the institution that provides it.</p>
<h3>Widgets for everyone</h3>
<p>The Coming Home collection was a timely example of what
    the DigitalNZ technology can do, but it is only the start of the DigitalNZ
    programme. In fact, the Coming Home content currently represents only 10% of
    the material we have brought together. There is huge potential if we let other
  users build search widgets for their Web sites as we have for Coming Home.</p>
<h2>Make your own Search Engine</h2>
<p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.digitalnz.org/customise/create"><img src="gow.fig12.jpg" alt="figure 12" width="500" height="761" /></a></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 12: Interface to ‘Make your own search tool’

<p class="BlockQuote">Wow! You can see the educational uses immediately. Pop a
    search on your wiki or Web site relating to your class’s inquiry or project -
    learners will be guaranteed quality New Zealand content on that topic. <span
lang="EN-NZ" xml:lang="EN-NZ">(Sarah Jones, Lunch Box: Software &amp; digital media for learning,
  December 2008) (</span><a href="../http://lunchbox.org.nz/2008/12/liberating-our-digital-content/">http://lunchbox.org.nz/2008/12/liberating-our-digital-content/</a><span
lang="EN-NZ" xml:lang="EN-NZ">)</span></p>
<p>The customisable search builder application lets users
    build a search engine across information in DigitalNZ to find the New Zealand
  content they are interested in – in 3 easy steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select</li>
  <li>Style</li>
  <li>Save</li>
</ol>
<p>On saving the search, they can also:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Link to a hosted version of the search</li>
  <li>See the search in the Widget gallery (<a href="../http://digitalnz.org/widget-gallery">http://digitalnz.org/widget-gallery</a>)</li>
  <li>Share the search in the context of their own content such as a blog
    or Web site </li>
  <li>Subscribe to an RSS feed alerting them to new results in the search.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability for people to take their designed search tool
    back into their own space is a crucial feature of what DigitalNZ has developed.
    We don’t expect the DigitalNZ Web site or search box to be the centre of
    everyone’s universe - in fact, we initially set out to build an on-line
  presence with no homepage.</p>
<p>The customisable search builder tool is simple to use, but
    that doesn’t mean you can’t do some very powerful things with it, as we
    demonstrated with the cross-collection Coming Home search, which uses advanced
  Boolean logic.</p>
<h2>Stepping Back</h2>
<p>The examples we have drawn on so far show part of what
  DigitalNZ is doing, but they don’t explain why or how.</p>
<p>Digital New Zealand ā-Tihi o Aotearoa (also known as
    DigitalNZ) is a national programme of work that aims to make New Zealand
  digital content of all types easier to find, share and use.</p>
<h3>Origins of Digital New Zealand</h3>
<p>Like many nations, New Zealand has developed government
    strategies to ensure it stays visible and relevant in a digital world,
    including a targeted Digital Content Strategy ‘Creating a Digital New Zealand’
  (<a href="../http://digitalcontent.govt.nz/">http://digitalcontent.govt.nz</a>).</p>
<p>The Digital Content Strategy, led by the National Library
    of New Zealand, seeks to ‘chart a course for a content-rich digital New
    Zealand, where New Zealanders are actively engaged in creating, discovering,
    sharing and using content in a digital form’ (National Library of New Zealand,
  2006). In summary:</p>
<p class="BlockQuote">Creating a Digital New Zealand is about making New Zealand visible
    and relevant in a connected digital world. It aims to ensure that we are innovative,
    informed and capable in telling our stories, experiencing our heritage and cultures,
    and creating our digital future. To that end, an important starting point for the
    strategy is recognising that the value of content is in what it delivers and enables
  for end-users (<a href="../http://digitalcontent.govt.nz/">http://digitalcontent.govt.nz</a>).</p>
<p>The Digital New Zealand programme is a flagship action of
    the Content Strategy. DigitalNZ received ongoing government funding in 2007,
  and the first project work kicked off in 2008.</p>
<h3>But what exactly <i>is</i> Digital New Zealand?</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, Digital New Zealand is developing and
    testing solutions that showcase what’s possible when we really focus on
    improving access to and discovery of New Zealand content. Figure 13 shows what
  Digital New Zealand currently does.</p>
<p class="caption"><a href="../../../external.gif?link=http://www.digitalnz.org/images/site/placeholders/larger_view.gif"><img src="gow.fig13.gif" alt="figure 13" width="500" height="385" /></a></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 13: Diagram showing how DigitalNZ works
  (<a href="../../../external.gif?link=http://www.digitalnz.org/images/site/placeholders/larger_view.gif">http://www.digitalnz.org/images/site/placeholders/larger_view.gif</a>)</p>
<p>Our goal is to uncover hidden or buried New Zealand
    content such as images, audio, video, interactives, and documents, and make
  these available for discovery, use and re-use through our services.</p>
<p>The example tools and applications we have discussed so
    far are ‘powered by Digital New Zealand’, and fuelled by the metadata and
  content from the many content providers we collaborate with.</p>
<p>But our tools and solutions aren’t just software
    developments. We are also establishing good practice guidance on creating,
    describing and managing content, and an on-line service for New Zealand
    organisations that may have questions about digital content projects or
  contributing to DigitalNZ.</p>
<h3>Collaborators and partners</h3>
<p>DigitalNZ is led by a small team based in the National
    Library of New Zealand. We work with New Zealand organisations, communities and
    individuals to gather and aggregate information about cultural heritage content
    in a machine-readable, standards-compliant way; so that new tools can easily be
  developed to bring the content to life.</p>
<p>We’ve worked with three companies so far (Boost New Media
    for design, 3Months for front-end development and Codec for back-end
    development), employing an agile development approach using Scrum. Ideum
    provided the remix editor for the Memory Maker, and the Aotearoa People’s
  Network and Katipo worked with us to build the DigitalNZ Kete.</p>
<p>We have been joined by a wonderful variety of New Zealand
    content providers around the country, including universities, small and large
    museums, archives, libraries, community initiatives, broadcasters, and
    government agencies. A list of content providers we have worked with to date is
  provided as Appendix 1.</p>
<h3>Behind the scenes</h3>
<p>Our content partners share metadata about New Zealand
    content with us (including direct URLs to content objects such as photographs
    and documents), so that we can share that information with everyone through a
    Web interface, and open it up to other developers - as yet unknown - through an
  Application Programming Interface (API).</p>

<p class="caption">Fig 14: Behind the scenes of how Digital New Zealand works</p>
<p>Technically, the Digital New Zealand system is in three
    parts: a backend, a metadata store, and a front end. The backend harvester is
    written in Java and some legacy PHP (based on the open-source PKP Harvester
    project). The metadata store is in MySQL, using Solr to power the search. The
    front end, including the API, the Web site, widgets and so on, are in Ruby on
  Rails.</p>
<p>We worked fast and furiously to launch the tools and
    applications we have described in this paper – and relied on an agile
    development methodology to complete our first wave of activity within a tight
  timeframe of 16 weeks: in time to meet the immovable date of the 90<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Armistice Day, 11 November 2008.</p>
<h3>Bringing metadata into a centralised repository</h3>
<p>Our approach to gathering the metadata involved:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Direct harvesting from
    individual content providers via OAI-PMH, XML sitemaps and screen scraping, or RSS
    feeds.</li>
  <li>Collaboration with
    aggregating content and metadata services that content providers already
    participate in such as Matapihi, KRIS, NZ Museums, <span
class="MsoHyperlink">Aotearoa Peoples
      Network kete</span>, Kete Horowhenua, and NZ On Screen.</li>
  <li>Providing the Kete Digital
    New Zealand Web site for organisations to use if they couldn’t find an immediate
    hosting alternative that could easily ‘port in’ to DigitalNZ.</li>
  </ul>
<p>More specifically, we worked with content providers to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Harvest, copy, host and/or store their
    metadata and thumbnail images to allow free access to it via the Internet. This
    means that more <b>people</b> will know that their digital collections exist,
    and see links to their items alongside other related content (including through <a
href="../http://search.digitalnz.org/">DigitalNZ
      Search</a>).</li>
  <li>Establish and
    maintain RSS or similar data feed services for the metadata we collect for
    their content, so that it is <b>machine-readable</b> and can be discovered by
    more users through other Web sites and on-line services.</li>
  <li>Enable public API
    (Application Programming Interface) access to the metadata so that <b>developers</b> can build applications to query, discover, and connect it with other data
    sources (subject to the Digital New Zealand <a
href="../http://www.digitalnz.org/terms">Terms of Use</a> [<a href="../http://www.digitalnz.org/terms">http://www.digitalnz.org/terms</a>]).</li>
</ul>
<p>We discuss common questions from content providers in
  following sections.</p>
<h3>Encouraging new tool development through an open
  API</h3>
<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">The coolest thing to be done with your data will be
    thought of by someone else  (Rufus Pollock, Director of the Open Knowledge
  Foundation, May 2007)</p>
<p>The best plain English explanation of an API (Application
    Programming Interface) we have heard recently is from George Oates, speaking at
    New Zealand’s National Digital Forum conference: “an API is basically a way to
    give developers permission to hack into your database”. It’s a way for us to
  enable people to make new, exciting tools based on the content we have aggregated.</p>
<p>While open APIs have been around for a while &ndash;
    particularly for large corporations such as Google, Amazon, and Yahoo – there
    aren’t nearly as many examples of open APIs serving data from cultural heritage
    organisations, especially over 25 unique collections brought together in one
  data source.</p>
<p>Developers must register by completing a simple form which
    links to our terms and conditions
    (<a href="../http://www.digitalnz.org/developer/api-docs">http://www.digitalnz.org/developer/api-docs</a>). The current API gives others
    access to the same functionality we use to build our tools, so is mainly
    focused on searching the collection and fetching metadata. We will add new
  features as we need them ourselves, and in response to developer feedback.</p>
<p>We’ve provided a place for developers on the Web site,
    including documentation (by developers for developers), a starters guide, and a
    Google Group where developers can share information
  (<a href="../http://digitalnz.org/developer">http://digitalnz.org/developer</a>).</p>
<p>We’re excited about seeing what gets built using the API,
  and encourage you to use it too!</p>
<h2>Take a Leap of Faith With Us</h2>
<p>Our challenge at DigitalNZ is to encourage collecting
    institutions to see that it’s possible to have a spectacular Web site for
    digital collections AND to participate in the greater network by sharing
  information about the contents or digital surrogates.</p>
<p>During our start up phase, we took an ‘ask don’t just
    take’ approach to harvesting the data and acquiring content, because we wanted
  to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Engage content providers
    and inform them about the goals of the project so they could work through the problems
    with us.</li>
  <li>Give organisations the
    opportunity to open access to their collection content more widely than through
    a closed ‘portal’ model (initially we weren’t even going to have a ‘DigitalNZ search’
    page).</li>
  <li>Educate content providers
    about new Web concepts so they can make informed choices. The API and RSS feeds,
    for example, are optional.</li>
  <li>Cache low resolution
    copies of thumbnails for collection items, and make sure content providers are aware
    that any risk around IP infringement is their responsibility. The thumbnail
    cache is optional, but important to improve the performance of our system.</li>
</ul>
<p>We worked hard to keep the communication channels open and
    involve our content providers in the process – establishing a blog and
    information sharing space, ‘being on the end’ of the telephone or e-mail to
    answer questions (in real time), willingly attending face-to-face meetings, and
  being open and honest about what we did and didn’t know along the way.</p>
<p>Some of the common questions or talking points we worked
  through with potential content providers are discussed below.</p>
<h3>What’s an API?</h3>
<p>Depending on whom we spoke to within the organisation (a
    curator or a technical representative), the question we found ourselves
  answering most often was, ‘What’s an API’?</p>
<p>We took time to explain to our content providers what an
  API is and does, using aids such as this video from TechnoMarketer: <a
href="../http://blip.tv/file/399231/">http://blip.tv/file/399231/</a></p>
<p>The difficulty was not having many local examples drawing
    on publicly-funded or cultural heritage content to refer our content providers
    to. We’re proud to be among the first to build demonstration applications, and 
    show what is possible when collecting institutions allow open access to
  information about collection contents.</p>
<h3>What’s in it for me?</h3>
<p>Having just launched, we aren’t able to quantify all the
    benefits for our content providers until we see what people start making with
  the API and our tools.</p>
<p>Yet there are some obvious potential benefits of participation
  in DigitalNZ, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tools that will drive
    people to the unique services of our content providers (tools that can also be
    used <i>by</i> the content provider. One institution we work with is
    considering using our search tool as their local search box instead of a Google
    one).</li>
  <li>Ensuring their visibility
    in the parts of the Web where their users are and want them – or at least their
    collections – to be.</li>
  <li>Sharing the development
    load by enabling others to build applications that surface their New Zealand content.</li>
  <li>A free API that they can
    use to enhance and add value to their own services.</li>
</ul>
<p>We try to encourage
    institutions to think of the real reason we strive to make our collections more
  accessible on the Web: so that the digital content can be <i>used</i>.</p>
<p>In many cases
    our content providers are as excited as we are about the possibilities opened
    up here, and the ability to demonstrate these possibilities to others in their
  organisation.</p>
<h3>An aside: branding</h3>
<p>If you look at the screenshots earlier in the paper, you’ll
    see that there is very little Digital New Zealand branding - except on the
    Memory Maker, which has branding from one of our partners. We are trying to put
  ourselves across as enablers, not beneficiaries.</p>
<p>We recognise that our content providers have stakeholders,
    and funders, local constituencies, and people who hold purse strings who are equal
    stakeholders in any decisions they make – and are often the very reason that
  digital content is available on-line.</p>
<p>When Web users discover content such as an image through
    DigitalNZ, they see only a link. That link leads them directly to the digital
  object on the content provider’s site.</p>
<p>Some things we suggest our partners consider to maintain
  their institutional profile in the “Web of data” (Coates, 2005) include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are the URLs for your
    content objects good ones? Compare <a href="../http://hdl.handle.net/101382/217">http://hdl.handle.net/101382/217</a> (which has no identification of an institution) with
    <a href="../http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-JCB-031.html">http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-JCB-031.html</a>.</li>
  <li>Is your institution listed
    as the ‘publisher’ of the content in the metadata, so that your institution is displayed
    on DigitalNZ search result pages?</li>
  <li>Is your institution credited
    as the creator where that is relevant?</li>
  <li>When a person arrives
    at any part of your site, or your collection object, is it clear who has provided
    the content on-line, and how you can get back to that institution’s collection or
    institutional home page?</li>
</ul>
<h3>What if someone does something bad
  with my data or content?</h3>
<p>Our response to this question is simple: ‘What if someone
    does something really good?’. However, we advise our content providers, ‘If in
    doubt, leave it out’ – work with safe content first and test the waters until
  you’re comfortable. If you don’t try at all, however, you’ll never find out.</p>
<p>It’s important to emphasise that we have imposed some
    limits on what New Zealanders and others are ‘free’ to do with the data and
  content we make available through DigitalNZ.</p>
<p>For both our tools and the API, we sought extensive legal
    advice on the terms of use, which every site user must agree to. These include clauses
  such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You must not use the DigitalNZ
    API or the Digital New Zealand content in any context that is obscene, indecent,
    pornographic or otherwise inappropriate.</li>
  <li>You may not otherwise
    reproduce, modify, distribute, decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any portion
    of the DigitalNZ API or the Digital New Zealand content.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read the full terms and conditions on the DigitalNZ
    Web site at: <a href="../http://www.digitalnz.org/terms">http://www.digitalnz.org/terms</a> and for DigitalNZ Kete at:
    <a href="../http://kete.digitalnz.org/about/topics/show/21-kete-digital-new-zealand-terms-and-conditions">http://kete.digitalnz.org/about/topics/show/21-kete-digital-new-zealand-terms-and-conditions</a>.</p>
<p>We have also ensured we can act very quickly to block
    access to anyone breaching the terms of use, and remove metadata or content
  from the service if required.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>At the time of writing we are only at the beginning of the
  journey. Nonetheless, here are a few suggestions that we think will  benefit readers.</p>
<h4>Develop solutions to fit the environment rather
  than expect the environment to fit the solution.</h4>
<p>We started out hoping that OAI-PMH would be the best way
    to harvest metadata from content providers. However, very few organisations are
    set up to do this, and it was clear that we had to work on something easier. So
    we set up harvesters using XML sitemaps and RSS feeds. More harvesting methods
    give us greater flexibility – and a side benefit for content providers of
  having sitemaps for search engines to discover their content.</p>
<p>Similarly, we didn’t develop specs for our API or HTML
    interface up front, waiting instead to see what sort of data content providers
    would give us. The lack of standardisation in coverage information (i.e.
    geographical locators), for example, means this isn’t currently provided as a
  filter for discovering content.</p>
<h4>Remember that the value of your filters, facets,
  and API is proportional to the quality of your metadata.</h4>
<p>Developing a good search experience is not just about
    being able to harvest metadata. Good quality metadata aids discoverability of
    content. And good quality metadata is not just about structure, but also about shared
    approaches to data values in dates, subject terms, and so on. Letting users
    enhance metadata might allow us to benefit both content providers and users – a
  test for another day.</p>
<p>DigitalNZ also wants to increase understanding and
    knowledge about improving metadata quality among content providers. Our good
    practice guidance includes advice about metadata creation (see
    <a href="../http://www.digitalnz.org/contributor/describing/">http://www.digitalnz.org/contributor/describing/</a>) and, once fully operational,
  our on-line help service will contribute to this goal.</p>
<h4>A lot of metadata exists telling people what they <i>can’t</i> do with content and far less telling people what they <i>can </i>do. Make both
  obvious.</h4>
<p>New Zealand content providers have more to learn about
    digital rights, permissions, and licenses. Creative Commons licences (New
    Zealand has its own versions) are not always the right answer, especially in
  the cultural heritage sector. You can’t license what you don’t hold copyright to.</p>
<p>It can also be difficult for content providers to be
    certain if an item is out of copyright. We have processes in place for fast
    take-downs should any issues arise, but are also looking to develop tools to
  help reduce uncertainty.</p>
<p>Participating in a Web of data also makes it important to
    keep information consistent across all of the locations where users might
    encounter access points to collections. It’s confusing for users to be remixing
    content in one application, only to locate the source on an institution’s Web
  site and be told they can’t reproduce it without permission.</p>
<h4>Provide for education, advice, and examples</h4>
<p>Convincing content providers to pre-approve heritage
    content for change; or set metadata free; is difficult when you can’t predict
    how the content might be used. We were glad some were willing to take a leap of
  faith with us.</p>
<p>Part of the barrier was lack of awareness or understanding
    of new generation Web concepts. For example, content providers often need
    advice on how to use Creative Commons licenses appropriately before they are
  willing to adopt them.</p>
<p>We hope by showing people some example tools and
  applications, we are helping to break this barrier down.</p>
<h2>What’s Next?</h2>
<p>Digital New Zealand is as much about good process and
    problem solving, and enabling others to find share and use New Zealand content,
  as it is about delivering digital experiences.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, we are starting to evaluate the
    test solutions developed in the first stages of the programme, and beginning to
    identify new problems to solve in the next phase. This iterative approach
    allows us to develop solutions that are agile and responsive to the
  fast-changing pace of the digital environment.</p>
<p>Do get in touch if you are interested in what we are
  doing. We’d love to talk to you about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Making New Zealand-related content around the world easier to
    find, share and use (including in international digital collections)</li>
  <li>Working with institutions that have opened up API data access</li>
  <li>Finding partners to work jointly on innovative software
    solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage you to make an effort to locate the DigitalNZ
    Web site (<a href="../http://digitalnz.org/">http://digitalnz.org</a>) as we
    explore and push more boundaries on the ever-growing New Zealand digital space,
  and welcome your feedback or questions on the work we have done so far.</p>
<p>We hope you will soon see tools and experiences powered by
    DigitalNZ appearing all over the wide world Web wherever information about New
  Zealand appears.</p>
