      <h2>This Is A Story About Naming Things</h2>
      <p class="BlockQuote">A map is, in its primary
        conception, a conventionalized picture of the Earth's pattern as seen from
        above. <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Erwin Raisz)</span></p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Every map is someone's way of
        getting you to look at the world his or her way. <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Lucy Fellows)</span></p>
      <p><b>Geocoding </b>is the act of converting a named place or address into machine readable coordinates, typically a latitude and longitude
        using the Mercator projection. This is Raisz' &quot;conventionalized
        pattern&quot;.</p>
      <p><b>Reverse-geocoding</b> is the act of taking a latitude and longitude and
        converting it back in to a named place. This is Lucy Fellows' getting you to
        &quot;look at the world her way&quot;.</p>
      <p><b>Geotagging</b> is the act of assigning geographic metadata to a photograph. As location
        information is increasingly stored in databases as a first-class data type, the
        way dates are, the phrase &quot;geotagging&quot; might now be considered a
        misleading. The term evolved at a time when few systems allowed users to index
        geographic data explicitly and so, taking matters into their own hands, they
        simply used existing tagging infrastructures to store, query and retrieve
        location information using ad hoc techniques. And the name stuck.</p>
      <p>When users geotag photos on Flickr they, typically, first
        geocode an address to locate the place they want to say a photo was taken ,and Flickr then revers- geocodes that point in order
        to display the name of the place the photo was taken in. Geocoding is the art
        of inferring meaning from a multiplicity of written forms, but it is costly to
        perform and not a particularly efficient way to store and retrieve documents,
        photos in Flickr&rsquo;s case, that have been geo-referenced, particularly when the
        initial geocoding may have been incorrect or used only to begin a more
        fine-grained positioning.</p>
      <p>  Which
        means: This is a story about naming things.</p>
      <p>It is easy to get caught up in the rhetoric of the digital
        revolution and believe in what I think of as the illusion of addressability.
        Everything is just ones and zeroes and can therefore can be given a unique
        identifier, goes the argument. The IPv6 standard, for example, supports 2x128 possible
        IP addresses, leading many to claim every object created and every human born
        will be issued their own identifier and, in turn, the world will finally be
        connected in a seamless Web devoid of ambiguity. Unfortunately, the only
        &quot;people&quot; who relate to the world this way are robots.</p>
      <p>Once upon a time, I worked at a small Internet service
        provider where we all shared the responsibility of fielding technical support
        calls. One day I answered the phone and was asked to explain
        to a person only just beginning to use the Web why the
        &quot;whitehouse.com&quot; Web site was full of porn. This was a
        reasonable question, since most people were unaware that domain names are
        simply conversational short-cuts for the numeric
        addresses that actually identify sites on the Internet. I also explained that
        same &quot;name&quot; may exist in multiple domain spaces, none of which needed
        to know anything about the other, and that the actual United States government Web
        site was located at whitehouse .gov.</p>
      <p>As it happens, the whitehouse .com Web
        site is no longer a porn site; &nbsp;instead it is a news and information portal, but that
        only serves to illustrate the still-fugitive nature of &quot;named
        places&quot;, even on the Web. That transience is further reflected in the
        commercial nature of the Internet which requires that ownership of a domain
        name be renewed at a yearly cost, and failure to do so is all it takes for
        another interested party to claim &ldquo;your&rdquo; name.</p>
      <p>The problem is not that both whitehouse .com and whitehouse .gov have different IP
        addresses. The problem is that all names are shortcuts for interlocking and
        constantly evolving sets of ideas, assumptions and relationships that computer
        science struggles, and generally fails, to keep pace with. The same issues
        manifest themselves in daily life as the association of French Champagne
        producers, straddling both sides of the debate over globalization and the
        politics of identity and terroir, take out full page advertisements in U.S.
        magazines (New Yorker 20090119 pg. 7) decrying the use of the name &quot;Champagne&quot; by wines
        produced in California.</p>
      <p>Long before the Internet exploded into everyone's lives we
        were collecting photos in shoeboxes and writing dates and place names on the
        back of each image; fussing over the time it took to do but eventually
        regretting the decision not to. Place is history, and names are a reflection of
        the experiences we share with close relations, the larger community and even
        our own past. For all its ambiguity and shifting meaning, the name we give a
        place is the air that a representation of that place breathes.</p>
      <p>Geocoding a name, when someone searches for, or geotags, a
        photo, is only one-half of the problem. It allows you
        to fix a photo to a map, but how then do you connect that spot to memory and
        the history of the event?</p>
      <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
      <p class="BlockQuote">We need to understand the difference between location and place.
        Computers and mobiles are very good at location, but we describe where we are as
        place, where culture meets location.&nbsp; <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Matt Jones)</span></p>
      <p>Flickr works with a large database of places, historical and
        contemporary, called GeoPlanet. Every place is assigned a unique identifier
        called a Where On Earth (WOE) ID and contains information about its ancestors,
        children, sibling and neighbouring places. For scaling and performance reasons
        we opted to store only pointers to individual WOE IDs in the Flickr database
        itself. This meant that we had to boil the ocean a little in order to trim the
        number of possible members in any given location hierarchy. Eventually we
        settled on the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Neighbourhoods</li>
        <li> Localities</li>
        <li> Counties
          (optional)</li>
        <li> Regions</li>
        <li> Countries</li>
        <li> Continents</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is worth noting that this is only one possible hierarchy,
        and some of the choices we've made were due solely to the mechanics of
        operating a site as large as Flickr. If only as an exercise, a critic might
        argue that our model is biased towards a philosophy of liberal economic
        governance and traditional capitalist land ownership. Although it would be
        wrong to ascribe that much motive to our actions (we simply started the geo
        project with an existing data source that had been originally developed for use
        by government agencies and worked with what we had), it is interesting to
        consider the possible facets, still present, in an otherwise seemingly rigid
        hierarchy.</p>
      <p>A simple example is to contrast the way that Flickr and
        FireEagle (a Web application for collecting and sharing personal locative
        information) handle &quot;localities&quot; since the two sites share an almost
        exact hierarchy of places. Flickr treats anything with neighbourhoods as a
        locality, so in our model Duncans Mills, CA (pop. 84) and Mexico City (pop.
        19M) are assumed to be the same &quot;type&quot; of place. FireEagle does not.
        If you authorize a third-party application to access information about your
        whereabouts at a city level, there is an expectation, assuming that you share
        an expectation that cities are &quot;big&quot;, that your actual location will
        be suitably obfuscated (or &quot;fuzzed&quot;), and in a town of 84 people
        there's not a lot of room to get fuzzy in.</p>
      <p>With all that in mind, when a Flickr user drops a photo on the
        map:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> We calculate a search radius based on the
          map's zoom level, which is mapped to its corresponding place type in the Flickr
          hierarchy.</li>
        <li> We query GeoPlanet for all the places of
          that type (say, neighbourhoods) that intersect the query radius.</li>
        <li> We filter the list to only those places
          whose bounding box overlaps the center point, factoring in a degree of allowable
          fuzziness. If the center point falls outside a bounding box by a hundred meters,
          then it's usually still worth considering.</li>
        <li> We then iterate over the second list
          measuring both the distance of the center point to the logical and political
          center point of each bounding box.</li>
        <li> As a rule, the bounding box with the
          shortest distance wins, but the process is often messier and involves testing
          whether one bounding box is contained by another or whether a particular
          administrative relationship (the town where mail is typically delivered in the
          case of very small places) against the geographic reality.</li>
        <li> If
          none of those tests succeed in finding a suitable location, we determine the
          parent of the place type we've just tested and try again until we&rsquo;ve exhausted
          all the possible place types in our hierarchy. Once we have established a
          &quot;root&quot; location we then query for its ancestors and store each along
          with its WOE ID in the Flickr database.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, if you've tried to geotag a photo in the woods of
        Siberia and we can't find a matching town, we should at least be able to tell
        you the photo was taken in Siberia or, failing that, Russia. Sometimes, though,
        after all of that work we still choose to display the wrong place.</p>
      <h2>Synthetic Telepathy</h2>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Location is an 80/20 problem where the 20 really matters. <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Aaron Straup Cope)</span></p>
      <p>Until recently we've only ever been able to work with bounding
        boxes, a limiting function of the available data from our provider. Despite
        that, we have been surprisingly successful at mapping location to place even in
        the case of neighbourhoods. But there have always been mistakes, and no one is
        very tolerant of mistakes about &quot;place&quot;. Never mind so-called
        disputed places (Kashmir, the West Bank, Cyprus, etc.): all neighbourhoods are
        &quot;disputed&quot; around the edges. This is often true of localities, as well.
        Our experience, reverse geocoding photos at Flickr, has been that there are few
        better ways to pick a fight than to tell someone what neighbourhood they are in
        and being wrong.</p>
      <p>The problem of course is that even if we mapped every
        combination of latitudes and longitudes, multiplied by an infinite number of
        decimal points, to a single place, people still wouldn't agree on the answer.
        In the same way that a point is really just a very small bounding box, a single
        point is also a flattening of the history of that place and, ultimately, there
        is only so much human subtlety you can, literally, codify in to a computer
        program.</p>
      <p>Instead of simply trying to keep pace with all of human
        history and prejudice as a series of cascading if/else statements, what if we
        laid our cards (the named places that we think a pair of latitude and longitude
        coordinates might be) on the table, and when we are wrong, give people the
        chance to tell us what they meant and to learn from that? What if the next time
        you geotagged a photo, we compared where we think that place is against the
        places that you've told us are nearby? If not you, then your
        contacts? What if every single person on Flickr points out that a
        neighbourhood, or town, is just plain wrong?</p>
      <p>By adding a relatively small change to the site, allowing
        people to indicate that the place we had associated with a location was
        incorrect and allowing them to choose from a list of available options, we were
        able to better reflect their understanding of the
        world and begin to map facts on the ground rather than from on high. In
        the first week alone, we received one hundred thousand corrections! Depending on your point of view, this is either a
        testament to community-driven data, and so-called neo-geography, or proof that
        everything we've done to date was broken and wrong.</p>
      <h2>The Shape of Observation</h2>
      <p class="BlockQuote">&quot;We should be mapping information that in some ways has
        been historically unmappable because it is 1) not valued or is 2) actively seen
        as threatening or is 3) simply too hard to map using traditional tools.&quot;
        <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Anselm Hook)</span></p>
      <p>I tell these stories because as of this writing Flickr has
        over 100 million geotagged photos, each of which has up to six unique place
        (WOE) IDs associated with it. Over time we've wondered: if we plotted all the
        geotagged photos associated with a particular WOE ID, would we have enough data
        to generate a mainly accurate contour of that place? Not a perfect
        representation, perhaps, but something more fine-grained than a bounding box.
        It turns out we can, effectively rendering the contour of all the points
        associated with a place into a recognizable shape, using software we developed
        called Clustr.</p>
      <p>Clustr is a thin wrapper around the open source Computational
        Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) and uses a technique called &quot;alpha
        shapes&quot; to calculate the shape formed by a set of points:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Imagine a huge mass of ice-cream making up the space ... and containing the points as &quot;hard&quot; chocolate
        pieces. Using one of those sphere-formed ice-cream spoons we carve out all
        parts of the ice-cream block we can reach without bumping into chocolate
        pieces, thereby even carving out holes in the inside (eg. parts not reachable
        by simply moving the spoon from the outside). We will eventually end up with a (not necessarily convex) object bounded by caps, arcs and
        points. If we now straighten all &quot;round&quot; faces to triangles and line
        segments, we have an intuitive description of what is called the alpha shape.... <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Tran Kai Frank Da, Mariette
        Yvinec)</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;The
        results have been stunning, and while we can draw a near perfect outline of the
        United States or France or Texas using no other geographic information than the
        locations associated with photos, many, if not most, of the shapes we create
        look a little weird. Possibly even &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;. This is
        both okay and to be expected for a few reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Sometimes we just don&rsquo;t have enough
          geotagged photos in a spot to make it is possible to create a shape. Even if we
          do have enough points to create a shape there aren&rsquo;t&nbsp; enough to create a&nbsp; shape that you&rsquo;d recognize as the place
          where you live. We chose&nbsp; to publish those shapes anyway because it shows both
          what we know and don&rsquo;t know about a place, and it encourages users to help us
          fix mistakes.</li>
        <li> We did a bad job
          reverse-geocoding photos for a particular spot and they&rsquo;ve ended up
          associated with the wrong place. We&rsquo;ve learned quite a lot about how to do a
          better job of it in the two and a half years we&rsquo;ve been doing this, but human
          awareness is fickle and does not always lend itself to being formalized.</li>
        <li> Sometimes, the data we have for trying to
          work out what&rsquo;s going on is just bad or out of date, and we rely on users
          pointing out what is obvious to them but novel and unexpected to us.</li>
        <li> We are not very sophisticated yet in how
          we assign the size of the alpha variable when we generate shapes. As far as we
          can tell, no one else has done this sort of thing so as with reverse-geocoding,
          we are learning as we go. For example, with the exception of continents and
          countries, we boil all other places down to a single contiguous shape. We do
          this by slowly cranking up the size of the ice cream scoop; this in turn can
          lead to a loss of fidelity. There is a lot left to learn.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Does the &quot;shape&quot; of Florida, or of Italy, include
        the waters that lie between the mainland and the surrounding islands? It&rsquo;s not
        usually the way we imagine the territory that a place occupies, but the warping
        of the coast of Massachusetts by people taking, and geotagging, photos while on
        whale-watching boats is not an entirely inaccurate depiction of place either.
        On the other hand, including the ocean between California and Hawaii as &quot;part
        of&quot; the United States would be kind of dumb.</p>
      <h2>&quot;Donut Holes&quot;</h2>
      <p class="BlockQuote">They do not detail locations in space but histories of
        movement that constitute place. <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Rob Kitchin, Chris Perkins)</span></p>
      <p>More recently, while generating visualizations of these place
        shapes, we've noticed some interesting patterns. If we draw the shape of the
        city of Paris and then, on top of that, draw the shapes of all the city's child
        neighbourhoods, we see a richer and subtler definition of its boundaries.</p>
      <p>The first outline maps roughly to the extremities of the RER,
        the commuter train that services Paris and the surrounding suburbs. This is a
        fairly accurate representation of the &ldquo;greater metropolitan&rdquo; area of Paris,
        reflected in both popular folklore and government administrivia as more and
        more people shift from rural to urban living. The rest, taken as a whole,
        follows closer to the shape of the old city gates that most people think of
        when asked to imagine Paris. Which one is right? Both, obviously!</p>
      <p>Cities long ago stopped being defined by the walls that
        surround(ed) them. There is probably no better place in the world to see this
        than Barcelona which first burst out of its Old City with the construction of
        the Eixample at the end of the 19th century, and then again, after the wars of
        the 20th century, pushed further out towards the hills and rivers that surround
        it.</p>
      <p>There are lots of reasons to criticize urban sprawl as a
        phenomenon, but sprawl, too, is still made of people who over time inherit,
        share and shape the history and geography they live in. Whether it&rsquo;s Paris, Los
        Angeles, William Gibson&rsquo;s dystopic &ldquo;Boston-Atlanta Metropolitan Axis&rdquo; (BAMA) or
        the San Francisco &ldquo;Bay Area,&rdquo; they all encompass wildly different communities whose
        inhabitants, in spite of the grievances harboured towards one another, often
        feel as much of a connection to the larger whole as they do to whatever
        neighbourhood, suburb or village they spend their days and nights in.</p>
      <p>That&rsquo;s one reason it&rsquo;s so interesting to look at the shape of
        cities and see how they spill out beyond the boundaries of traditional maps and
        travel guides. In the example above, the shape for Paris completely engulfs the
        commune of Orly, 20 kilometers to the South of central Paris: this &nbsp;makes a
        certain amount of sense. It also contains Orly airport which isn&rsquo;t that notable except that Flickr treats airports as though they were
        cities in their own right; the realities of contemporary travel mean that
        airports have evolved from being simple gateways to capital-P places with their
        own culture, norms and gravity. So, now you have cities contained within cities
        which most people would tell you are just neighbourhoods.</p>
      <p>As of this writing, we&rsquo;ve finished rendering the third batch
        of shapes for the corpus of places in the Flickr database and looking ahead are
        wondering whether we should also be rendering shapes based on the
        &ldquo;relationship&rdquo; of one place to another. Rendering the shape of the child places
        for a city or a country would allow you to see a city&rsquo;s &ldquo;center&rdquo; but also
        provide a way to filter out parts of a shape with low Earthiness (aka water)
        quotient, typically countries.</p>
      <p>The issue is not to prevent, or correct, shapes that provide a
        false view, because I don&rsquo;t think they do. Schuyler Erle, developer of the
        Clustr application, observed while we were getting all this stuff to work in
        the first place and testing the neighbourhoods that border the San Francisco
        Bay that they are really &ldquo;the shapes of people looking at the city&rdquo;. They are each different, but the same.</p>
      <p>But maybe we should also map the neighbourhoods that aren&rsquo;t considered the immediate children of a city but which overlap its boundaries.
        What if you could call an API method to return the list or the shape of a
        place&rsquo;s &ldquo;cousins&rdquo;? What could that tell us about a place?</p>
      <h2>Communities of Authority</h2>
      <p class="BlockQuote">The &ldquo;long here&rdquo; that Flickr represents back to me is
        becoming only more fascinating and precious as geolocation starts to help me
        understand how I identify and relate to place. The fact that Flickr&rsquo;s mapping
        is now starting to relate location to me the best it can in human place terms
        is fascinating ... but where it falls down it falls down gracefully, inviting
        corrections and perhaps starting conversation &nbsp;<span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Matt Jones)</span></p>
      <p>We could have released these shapes before the corrections
        project, but then it would have been little more than a closed cycle, where our
        misinterpretations of place were relayed back to our data provider and so on.
        By giving users the ability to signal their interpretation of place, we not
        only break the feedback loop, but also provide a way for those corrections to
        be fed back in to Flickr's reverse-geocoding engine to better geotag photos in
        the future: we use the wisdom of the community to give shape and nuance, and
        voice, to the authority of the dataset that we are working from.</p>
      <p>As with any visualization of aggregate data, there are likely
        to be areas of contention. One of the reasons we&rsquo;re excited to make the data,
        via the Flickr Application Programming Interface (API), available is that much
        of it simply isn&rsquo;t available anywhere under a non-commercial license, and the
        users and the developer community who make up Flickr have a gift for building
        magic on top of the API so we&rsquo;re doubly-excited to see what people do with it.</p>
      <p>Clustr, the software used to generate shapes, was released
        under an open source software license and is designed to work with any set of
        latitudinal and longitudinal derived points. In the future we hope to add a
        feature to assign an abstract weighting to any individual point to affect how it
        is interpreted by the application. For Flickr, this weighting might be whether
        or not its associated photo was corrected or whether the
        location was offered as a suggestion by another user. Another limiting
        agent might be whether a photo was geotagged by a user who could be considered
        a resident of that place, rather than a tourist or visitor. </p>
      <p>But more than that, we hope other projects will start to map
        the shape of their projects and share them with the wider community.</p>
      <h2>History Boxes</h2>
      <p class="BlockQuote">The
        (Minnesota Historical) Society has the largest collection in the universe of
        Minnesota fiction and many of these books create thinly veiled places based on the
        author's experience with an authentic local place. <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Patrick
        Coleman)</span></p>
      <p>What are the shapes of user-defined places? The first place
        you kissed your spouse? Napoleon's march in, and then back out, of Russia? Your daily commute? Does the shape of New York City's
        &quot;ground zero&quot; extend beyond the city blocks excavated after the World
        Trade Center towers fell, to the places that people ran to, or to the vantage
        point from which a person saw events unfold?</p>
      <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's SENSEable Cities
        project has been researching and visualizing the movement of tourists in
        Barcelona through the photos they've posted to Flickr, since 2007. What would
        it mean, not simply to plot those photos as a cloud of isolated events, but to
        give them shape, and meaning, as entirely new neighbourhoods or temporary
        cities in time, like Black Rock City which seems to emerge fully-formed out of
        the Nevada desert for the annual Burning Man event, only to disappear and
        &quot;leave no trace&quot; (except, as it happens for a lot of geotagged
        photos) ten days later?</p>
      <p>Stamen Design's Oakland Crimespotting is an interactive map
        for visualizing and understanding crimes in the city of Oakland. By filtering
        incident reports by date and type, a viewer is able to see both the shape of
        criminal behaviour in the city and also the shape the city's response to it;
        for example, the seemingly clockwork intervals between no activity in a
        neighbourhood followed by nearly block-to-block reports of prostitution
        arrests. What is the shape of the history unseen in a place?</p>
      <p>&quot;Over 9, 000 Londoners lost their lives to V2 rocket
        strikes in World War 2,&quot; writes Tom Taylor, creator of the
        rocketstrikes.iamnear.net Web site. &quot;Below are the five ... rocket strike
        locations&quot; nearest to Westminster. Financial institutions and lenders may
        want to pattern the world with spending habits and agency, but I'd like to use
        the same tools to see the pattern of nearby. We all have friends who've sat in
        the same seat on the same airplane flying back and forth between destinations,
        only to have a third friend, years later with the aid of the Internet and a
        GPS-enabled device, see a photo of that seat and realize they are sitting only
        meters away. Not on the same plane, but in the same physical space that both
        planes occupied and the same place, the same anti-space, that anyone seated on
        a plane waiting to taxi from the terminal to the runway inhabits.</p>
      <p> You
        are here, so say all the maps.</p>
      <h1>The Hammock of Interpretation</h1>
      <p>Place is history, and if the Internet is even half the
        &quot;architecture of participation&quot; that its supporter claim, then maybe
        history need no longer be written by the victors alone. Given the chance, what
        are the dinner-time, war-time and drunken
        kitchen-party stories that the places we have known would tell?</p>
      <p> What
        would they name?</p>
