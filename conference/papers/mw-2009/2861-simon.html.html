		<h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
		<p class="AbstractText">Museum technology professionals have spent the last
		  several years advocating for, experimenting with, and expanding the Web
		  presence of museums. We&rsquo;ve created museum spaces on-line that offer free access
		  to visitors all over the world and increasingly invite visitors to talk with
		  each other, take content away with them, access and remix parts of the
		  collection that aren&rsquo;t on public display &ndash; in short, to do things that aren&rsquo;t
	    possible in the real museum. </p>
		<p class="AbstractText">But now we should be going in the other direction and
		  applying the methods and lessons of the Web and Web 2.0 to the museum itself. How
		  can museums be more like the Web? How can they be open 24/7? How can visitors
		  customize their experiences? How can museums become places to talk with other
	    visitors and sneak into the most interesting drawers and move things around?</p>
		<p class="AbstractText">This paper advocates for museum Web technology
		  professionals to take a broader view of their roles within their institutions
		  and focus energy on translating their knowledge to the onsite experience. It
		  presents models and case studies for how to do this kind of translation from
		  virtual-to-real space, both strategically (so that curators, directors, and
	    boards can sign on to the vision) and practically. </p>

		<p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Metaphor is for most
		  people a device of the poetic imagination and the rhetorical flourish - a
		  matter of extraordinary rather than ordinary language. Moreover, metaphor is
		  typically viewed as characteristic of language alone, a matter of words rather
		  than thought or action. For this reason, most people think they can get along
		  perfectly well without metaphor. We have found, on the contrary, that metaphor
		  is pervasive in everyday life, not just in language but in thought and action.
		  Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is
	    fundamentally metaphorical in nature. (Lakoff and Johnson 1980)</p>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>In 2008, the British comedy sketch group Idiots of Ants
		  released a video called &ldquo;Facebook in Reality&rdquo;(<a href="../http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrlSkU0TFLs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrlSkU0TFLs</a>).  In it, an obnoxious young man harasses a former
		  classmate by showing up at his door, poking him, asking him personal questions,
		  writing graffiti on his wall, sharing old embarrassing photos with his mother,
		  etc. The video casts the interactions on social networks like Facebook as
		  absurd departures from real life behavior. This perspective is not limited to
		  comedians; journalists have comparably bemoaned the decline of interpersonal
		  communication and mocked the need for &ldquo;Facebook in the Flesh&rdquo; seminars for
	    college students (Shulman, 2007).</p>
		<p>But interactions on social media sites are not as foreign as
		  the Idiots and journalists would have you think. Consider this account from
		  Harry Hay<span class="style1"> </span>describing the gay pickup
	    scene in 1930s San Francisco:</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">At Finocchios, you didn&rsquo;t meet at the bar and make
		  connections. You met through&hellip; you were introduced by the waiter. If you wanted
		  to meet a young man who was sitting at this table over here, you had the waiter
		  take a bottle of wine and a glass on a little tray. And your card. So I&rsquo;d look
		  back (sigh) and decide that you&rsquo;re not my type, so consequently I would say
		  thank you very much, but I&rsquo;d never take the glass. I&rsquo;d simply turn it over. Thanks
		  but no thanks. However, if I liked your looks, I&rsquo;d simply say, &lsquo;Roy, won&rsquo;t you
		  pour me a drink.&rsquo; And you would pour me a drink. And then I would say, &lsquo;and why
		  don&rsquo;t you bring me a second glass,&rsquo; and you would do that. And then the moment
		  he brought the second glass and he poured that the other gentleman came and he
	    joined you at the table (transcribed from Carlsson, 1996).</p>
		<p>The gay flirting rituals of the 1930s are no different from
		  the social interactions between people today on Facebook. The wine glass and
		  the superpoke are both social objects that mediate interactions between people,
		  lubricating connections that feel too exposed or uncomfortable to make
		  directly. We&rsquo;ve always needed tools to help us meet new people and start
	    relationships. </p>
		<p>So if social objects have always been part of our lives,
		  what makes social media different? For the first time, social objects are being
		  produced on a mass scale and are accessible to millions of people. The wine
		  glass gesture at Finocchio&rsquo;s was an idiosyncratic quirk of a specific restaurant.
		  Had a man walked into a restaurant in New York City and sent a bottle to a man
		  at another table, his message might not have conveyed itself clearly. But tools
		  like Facebook are universally available and provide a common language for
		  mediated interaction. The language is so familiar that comedians like Idiots of
		  Ants can perform sketches heavily laden with specific Facebook references and
	    millions of people will watch the videos and laugh.</p>
		<p>The social Web is receiving so much media attention that even
		  people who do not engage with on-line social tools are fascinated by their
		  cultural implications. This includes museum directors, who see the on-line
		  landscape as the breeding ground for future visitors and donors. And so people
		  in positions of power in museums are getting Ideas. This is a good thing &ndash; they
		  are finally interested in the Internet not just as a dumping ground for content
		  but as a starting point for innovations that impact entire institutions. They
		  are looking for information about how the rise of the social Web will affect
	    the business model and viability of museums.</p>
		<p>You need to be the source of that information. It is time
		  for museum technologists to step up to the plate and apply your expertise in
		  on-line social experience design to your physical institution. Start with your
		  institutional mission and find the core experience goals that you can deliver in
		  new and powerful ways. Then, innovate backwards, using on-line platforms like
		  Facebook and Twitter and Delicious as models for museum-specific mediating
		  experiences that are physically realized in the galleries. Marry the mission to
		  the metaphor and you will transform your museum. You will be creating your own
		  wine-wooing platform, starting with the largest empirical dataset possible: the
	    behaviors and experiences of the social Web.</p>
		<h2>Designing Real Versions of Virtual Ideas</h2>
		<p>How do you take a virtual concept and apply it to the
		  physical space of the museum? Consider this simple example from an ice cream
		  shop in Santa Cruz, CA. Marini&rsquo;s is a locally-owned store with a friendly,
		  funky atmosphere. In summer, when the store is busy, they put up a
		  chalkboard-style &ldquo;gift board&rdquo; next to the menu board. When you buy a gift
		  certificate for someone at Marini&rsquo;s, the purchase is an (opt-in) public act:
		  the staff member writes on the gift board, &ldquo;Nina gives Julia a hot fudge
		  sundae&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ben gives Theo a double-scoop cone.&rdquo; When you come in to use a gift
	    certificate and claim your gift, the message comes off the wall.</p>
		<p>Readers familiar with Facebook and MySpace will spot the
		  relationship between this ice cream gift board and the interpersonal
		  exchange-based interactions on social networking sites. Gifting is a core game
		  mechanic (Kim, 2006) by which people express affection for each other. Social
		  networking sites have turned gifting into a public act by enabling people to
		  send gifts (virtual tacos, messages on walls, snowballs) and broadcast their
		  gift-giving on public profiles. In this way, a traditionally private
		  interpersonal exchange becomes a collective experience by which the generosity
		  of the gift-giver and the worthiness of the receiver can be witnessed and
	    acknowledged by others. </p>
		<p>When Marini&rsquo;s decided to transform their gift certificate
		  program into a gift board program, they capitalized on the same design strategy
		  that social networks use in making gifts public. There are benefits for
		  gift-givers, who look generous, and gift-getters, who are publicly adored. It
		  also introduces a casual storyline to the store. Will Julia redeem her sundae? Why
		  did Theo deserve that double-scoop? The store positions itself as part of the
		  emotional life of its patrons in a public way. Stores always tell you that gift
		  certificates are a great way to show people you care. Now, Marini&rsquo;s is showing
		  the value of gift certificates, and receiving benefits in the form of higher
	    certificate sales.</p>
		<p>Another less benevolent example is Harrah&rsquo;s Casinos, one of
		  the four largest casino companies in the gaming industry. Harrah&rsquo;s uses
		  &ldquo;loyalty cards&rdquo; to induce people to play longer and spend more money (Abumrad,
		  2008). The cards function like bank cards; users swipe them at the slot
		  machines to play, and the cards register wins and losses. The loyalty cards are
		  part of a pilot program to track individual user behavior. The casino maintains
		  real-time data on the actions of every card-holder and uses the data to
		  determine individuals&rsquo; financial &ldquo;pain point&rdquo; &ndash; i.e. how much money they are
		  willing to spend before leaving the casino. The casino uses that pain point to
		  stage strategic interventions during real-time play. When a player comes close
		  to her limit, a staff member on the casino floor receives an alert from a
		  dispatcher, greets the player, and offers her a free meal, a drink, or a bonus
		  gift of money added to the loyalty card. By mitigating the bad experience of
		  losing with a gift, Harrah&rsquo;s extends people beyond their pain points and they
	    stay and play longer.</p>
		<p>What does a loyalty program at a casino have to do with
		  virtual-to-real design? The technology that drives the loyalty cards&rsquo; success
		  is unique: trackable IDs. The casino knows that every player must insert money
		  to play at a slot machine, and they already track the real-time usage of every
		  machine. But to reach players personally on an emotional level, the casino
		  needed to know <i>who</i> was using which
		  machines when. A clunky, more obvious solution could have required players to
		  &ldquo;sign in&rdquo; to slot machines with a username. But by combining the action players
		  already do (inserting money) with the desired new action (identifying
		  themselves), the loyalty cards achieve the new desired goal with no additional
		  action by users. In fact, the players prefer to play with the loyalty cards
		  because they receive perks for doing so. Players get an easier way to play and
		  receive rewards, and the casino gets unique, trackable data on every player in
	    the room.</p>
		<p>The Harrah&rsquo;s example has a direct application in museums. It
		  would be appealing to assign a unique ID to each visitor and exhibit and be
		  able to provide customized, real-time feedback and recommendations based on
		  visitors&rsquo; dwell time at different exhibits. So far, all attempts to do this
		  have been clunky at best, requiring visitors to do an additional, unintuitive
		  behavior (swiping a card, flashing an RFID chip) each time they approach or use
		  a new exhibit. This activity is further complicated by the fact that most
		  exhibits are not experienced individually, and most RFID-enabled exhibits force
		  people into a &ldquo;single-player&rdquo; mode. Finally, unlike slot machines, there is no
		  clear narrative to visitors&rsquo; use of exhibits, and so it is not easy to define a
	    guaranteed linear set of visitor actions upon which to operate. </p>
		<p>The problem of how to assign unique IDs in a museum setting
		  is not a difficult one. Institutions like The Tech Museum of Innovation and the
		  Ontario Science Centre have integrated RFID and barcode-based unique IDs into
		  exhibits for years. The problem is integrating the technology into the visitor
		  experience <i>in a natural way that adds value &ndash; </i>and that is the brilliance of Harrah&rsquo;s implementation. Comparably, the
		  problem of how to enable social exchanges in a museum setting is primarily a
		  problem of understanding how the new behavior can best be integrated into
		  familiar user behavior. More globally, any metaphorical design extension &ndash; from
		  virtual to real, from casino to museum &ndash; is fundamentally based on the
		  designer&rsquo;s ability to creatively map the desired behavior to behaviors and
	    experiences already in place.</p>
		<h2>A Five-Step Process for Metaphor-Mapping</h2>
		<p>So how does that mapping work? Here&rsquo;s a five-step process I
		  use when I&rsquo;m trying to move from a virtual concept to a physical in-museum
	    implementation. </p>
		<p class="MsoCaption"><img src="simon_fig1_low.png" alt="figure 1" width="552" height="550" /></p>
		<p class="caption">Fig 1: Five-step process for virtual-to-real design</p>
		<h3><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Start with a clear
	    concept virtually. </b></h3>
		<p>Saying, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s make a museum that functions like the Web&rdquo; is
		  too broad. You should be able to specifically define the virtual product or
		  design technique that you wish to use or emulate. For example, in the case of
	    Harrah&rsquo;s, the specific design goal was unique, trackable user IDs. </p>
		<p>This step may require breaking down the virtual concept to
		  detail specific elements of the design concept. For example, making an
		  exhibition that functions like a wiki is a reasonable goal, but the
		  connotations of the term &ldquo;wiki&rdquo; are diverse and misrepresented enough that you
		  would be well-served to spell out the specific meaning of interest. I once
		  worked with a museum director for whom &ldquo;wiki&rdquo; was synonymous with &ldquo;Wikipedia.&rdquo; To
		  him, making an exhibition like a wiki meant making a phenomenally popular,
		  encyclopedic exhibition fed content by independent researchers all over the
		  world. His concept of a wiki was not going to change, so I had to change the
		  language I used to explicitly demonstrate the functions that would be present
	    in the physical product.</p>
		<p> If you are making an exhibition that functions like a
		  wiki, does that mean that anyone can edit it? That anyone can add to it? That
		  the exhibition archives and makes available all iterations to date? That there
		  will be some kind of editorial review of visitors&rsquo; submissions? Your answers
		  may be &ldquo;all of these&rdquo; or you may be focused on a very specific wiki design
		  mechanic. The more specific you can be in defining the core concept, the
	    better. </p>
		<h3><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Define its core value
	    and relationship to your institutional or programmatic mission.</b></h3>
		<p>You should be able to define the core value of the design
		  goal, not globally, but specifically to your institution, project, and overall
		  mission. For Harrah&rsquo;s, unique user IDs enhance the casino&rsquo;s understanding of
		  user behavior and its ability to use that information to encourage longer
		  playing (and spending) time. That&rsquo;s how unique user IDs relate to the casino&rsquo;s
	    bottom line: it enhances the ability to make money.</p>
		<p>How is your concept useful from the perspective of your
		  institutional or project mission? How does it add value? Consider the Monterey
		  Bay Aquarium&rsquo;s simple mission statement: &ldquo;The mission of the non-profit
		  Monterey Bay Aquarium is to inspire conservation of the oceans.&rdquo; If you work
		  for the Aquarium, any initiative you propose should clearly and fundamentally
		  enhance the institution&rsquo;s ability to inspire conservation of the oceans. The
		  only verb in their mission statement is &ldquo;inspire.&rdquo; To me, that implies looking
		  for external and virtual models that are beautiful and motivate action. This is
		  very different from the types of models I would look for in an institution
		  whose core mission was around &ldquo;community&rdquo; or &ldquo;engagement.&rdquo; And while the
		  Aquarium may also be interested in community engagement, it will always be
		  easier to win an argument about a project there if you can demonstrate that you
	    are positively contributing to &ldquo;inspiring conservation of the oceans.&rdquo; </p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to be mission-driven in a technology department.
		  Most of the demands on technology departments of museums are not mission-related;
		  PR staff decide that the museum needs a blog or a board member goes gaga over
		  multi-touch tables. This is problematic for two reasons. If your work is not
		  tied tightly to the mission, it is expendable, and your job is at risk. But
		  more disturbingly, if you are not mission-driven, then you will not be seen as
		  core to the success of your institution. You will not be in a position to
		  influence the institution&rsquo;s direction if your work is seen as tangential to the
	    primary goals of the organization.</p>
		<p>Going back to the design process, you should be able to
	    write a sentence in this form:</p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">&ldquo;We should try to integrate X into our exhibition/program/initiative/institution
	    because it will enable us to carry out Y aspect of our mission by Z.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>This sentence will help you talk about the project with
		  decision-makers across your institution. It will demonstrate that technology
		  projects can be mission-driven and should be motivated by an opportunity to
	    improve the visitor experience, not an opportunity to use some cool gadget. </p>
		<h3><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Define inputs and
	    outputs of the concept as applied to the  onsite experience. </b></h3>
		<p>This is the step where we leave high concept strategizing
		  and get into the tough business of mapping the virtual to the real. If you are
		  designing a new technology into the standard museum visitor experience, you
		  need to determine where the technology will enter the experience and where it
		  will exit. Start by mapping the visitor experience without the technology, and
		  look for the places where it might most logically insert itself. Experience
		  prototyping techniques like Place Storming (see section on The Importance of Experience
	    Prototyping) may be useful at this step.</p>
		<p>In the Harrah&rsquo;s example, the input is when the player sits
		  down at a slot machine and puts in his money. This is an activity the player is
		  already familiar with and expects to do in order to play. The output is more
		  subtle: it occurs anytime the player receives rewards. Traditionally, players
		  receive rewards when they win at the slots. Lights flash, coins emerge. And
		  while the loyalty cards registers these types of wins, they also regulate the
		  delivery of a secondary reward &ndash; free drinks, tickets to the show, and other
		  perks. Traditionally, distribution of these secondary rewards was semi-random,
		  based on the psychological judgment of casino floor managers as to players&rsquo;
		  emotional states. But the loyalty cards created a system by which these
		  secondary rewards became deliberate and strategic. They were an underutilized
	    output that became a core part of the new system.</p>
		<h3><b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Define the behavior
	    changes, if any, required by the input and output.</b></h3>
		<p>This is the real question: how much are you asking visitors
		  to change what they already want or are prepared to do to engage in a new
		  experience? Do they need to take one extra step or many? Do they have to visit
		  a specific kiosk? Do they have to type something in or stand in a particular
		  location? The more new steps involved, the harder it is to capture visitors,
		  especially if those steps seem dislocated from the familiar visit experience. For
		  this reason, it is essential to design your new service or experience to fit
	    into familiar actions as tightly as possible.</p>
		<p>For Harrah&rsquo;s, the fact that the loyalty card replaced the
		  use of cash at the slot machines was an easy way to switch technologies with minimal
		  behavior change. Once players have loyalty cards, it&rsquo;s actually <i>easier</i> for them to play the slots,
		  because they don&rsquo;t have to worry about how many dollars or tokens they have on
		  hand. They can just swipe and play. And the output &ndash; receiving rewards &ndash; has
		  not changed from the players&rsquo; perspective. The more significant behavior change
		  in Harrah&rsquo;s situation was the adoption of loyalty cards. The casino had to get
		  the cards into people&rsquo;s hands, and this required a new behavior at the input
	    when players first enter the casino. </p>
		<p>You should be able to detail exactly how the new technology
		  fits into the familiar experience and where it deviates. What additional things
		  will people need to do to make use of it, both on the input side (visitor
		  engages in experience) and the output side (visitor and institution receive
		  value)? Make a list, and map as many things to familiar actions as possible. If
		  the leftover list of items that require behavior change has more than five
		  entries, throw away your idea. The technology should enter the visitor
	    experience via a scalpel, not a hacksaw.</p>
		<h3><b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Make the behavior
	    change as simple as possible.</b></h3>
		<p>Try as you might to elegantly match your technology to a
		  familiar visitor experience, there will always be some minor behavior change
		  required. In those cases, you need to make that change as easy and painless as
		  possible. At Harrah&rsquo;s, the behavior change requires players to sign up for a
		  loyalty card before playing. No one wants to go sign up for a card when on
		  entering a casino, so instead of trying to cleverly streamline sign-up into
		  play, the casino does the next best thing: they offer a perk. What&rsquo;s the best
		  perk to give in a casino? The cards come preloaded with a few dollars. &ldquo;Everyone
		  wants to sign up for that card,&rdquo; says Gary Loveman, Harrah&rsquo;s CEO. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s free money.&rdquo;
	    (Abumrad, 2008).</p>
		<p>Museums don&rsquo;t have to give out free money to encourage
		  visitors to change their behavior. But they do have to find ways to make the
		  change apparent and easy to accomplish. It&rsquo;s also useful to clearly message how
		  doing the new behavior will benefit visitors so they realize their actions will
	    pay off later.</p>
		<h2>An Elegant Example</h2>
		<p>I don&rsquo;t want you to think this is all about casinos. My favorite
		  example of this kind of thinking comes from Bibliotheek Haarlem Oost, a branch
		  library in the Netherlands. Jan David Hanrath, an architect and former library
		  information technologist, designed a tagging system into this branch library
		  (<a href="../http://www.hanratharchitect.nl/projecten/haarlem-oost/">http://www.hanratharchitect.nl/projecten/haarlem-oost/</a>). Tagging has huge
		  theoretical value to museums and libraries as a way to allow users to create folksonomies
		  around institutionally-held collections, and there&rsquo;s a clear mission connection
		  for institutions whose goal is to engage visitors with collections and
		  learning. While many museums are ably exploring the world of tagging on-line,
		  no one has figured out how to make it work in the  onsite visitor experience. Tagging
		  could be very useful  onsite if there were a way to access the tags and use
		  them to discover artifacts of interest. Ideally, there would be a complete
		  feedback loop where you would then be able to assign tags to objects as you
		  view them in the galleries, thus creating more data for new visitors walking in
	    the door.</p>
		<p>What I&rsquo;m describing maps to a complicated set of inputs and
		  outputs. At the input (performing the tagging), visitors while onsite would
		  need a way to mark individual exhibits with keywords. Then, on the output (using
		  tags to access content of interest), visitors would need a way to scan the
		  keywords at any exhibit, see linked related exhibits, and receive directional
		  information to find the other exhibits. I can think of several ways to do this,
	    and they all have long, painful lists of behavior changes associated with them.</p>
		<p>The library at Haarlem Oost wanted to do this same thing &ndash; to
		  allow patrons to tag the books they&rsquo;d finished so they could be displayed on
		  shelves and in the database for others to find books they might enjoy. But Hanrath
		  didn&rsquo;t come up with a clunky technology with lots of required behavior changes
		  and instruction sets. They did something very, very clever. They installed more
	    book drops.</p>
		<p>The library created a book drop for a set of predefined tags
		  (boring, didn&rsquo;t read it, great, funny, exciting, good for kids, etc.). They
		  also created shelves for the individual tags. When patrons return books, they
		  place them on the shelves that appropriately categorize their books. Because
		  the majority of books in the Dutch library system have RFID tags, the shelves
		  were enabled with RFID readers that scan the books and add the tags to the
		  books&rsquo; digital entries in the library database. The only behavior change
		  required is for the patron to shelve his or her books in categories, and the
		  benefit on the output side (the tags appearing in the library on-line catalogue)
	    is immediate.</p>
		<p>No patron would call the activity of putting their books in
		  book drops &lsquo;tagging,&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s a good thing. There&rsquo;s little concern here
		  about barriers to use, educating the visitor on how to participate, or even
		  significant infrastructure or support costs. The feedback loop is there, and it
	    works because it&rsquo;s a clever, simple distillation of the core idea of tagging.</p>
		<h2>The Importance of Experience Prototyping</h2>
		<p>The hardest part of the virtual-to-real process is steps
		  three and four, where you map existing user behaviors against the new
		  technology and try to creatively limit behavior changes. Experience prototyping
		  can help you walk the museum from visitors&rsquo; perspectives and gain new insight
		  about potential inputs and outputs for your new technology experience. This is
		  different from prototyping the technology to make sure it works properly, or
		  doing user testing to see how visitors respond to the device. Experience
		  prototyping is used early in the process to understand existing and potential
		  user experiences in context. As IDEO designers Marion Buchenau and Jane Felton
	    Suri (2000) put it: </p>
		<p class="BlockQuote">If designers and clients can have informative personal
		  experiences, it is easier for them to grasp the issues and feel greater empathy
		  with both the people who will be affected by their decisions, and the
	    experiences users may face. </p>
		<p>If you can think and act like a visitor, you will find entry
		  points for your metaphorical concept. Improvisational acting techniques,
		  creative prop-based games, and Place Storming (active brainstorming in real
		  environments) can all help you get out of standard pathways of thinking and
		  explore new opportunities. Devising useful metaphors requires making new mental
		  connections between ideas, and those connections are often most successful when
	    they are surprising.</p>
		<p>There are two ways to use this kind of prototyping in
	    conjunction with the process explained above. </p>
		<ol>
		  <li>First,
		    designers should spend time experiencing the museum or venue in ways that are
		    familiar for intended technology users (visitors). If you know that your
		    technology will require a particular kind of input or output; for example, that
		    the visitor must stand in a single location for at least 3 seconds, then track
		    your progress through the museum and note every location where you find
		    yourself standing for more than three seconds. You will come out of this
		    experience with a list of potential locations and opportunities for
		    technological intervention that will dovetail harmoniously with current visitor
		    actions. This will help you in step three of the process.</li>
		  <li>Second,
		    designers should set out in the museum with entirely symbolic prototypes of the
		    new technology to test the overall experience and brainstorm ways to eliminate
		    or diminish required behavior changes. The Place Storming technique (Anderson
		    and McGonigal, 2004) is particularly effective for this. Give your design team
		    an object that is loosely evocative of the design concept. If the concept is
		    around tagging, you might give out stickers. If the concept is around social
		    connections, you might give out string. Assign an evocative verb to the object
		    (i.e. &ldquo;the tagger,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the connector&rdquo;) and then tell the team to go use the
		    object in the museum. Changing contexts by taking the object to the gift shop,
		    the restaurant, the parking lots, and out on the street will help designers
		    explore the ways that usage of the object integrates into the visitors&rsquo;
		    experience beyond the museum galleries. The more time you spend &lsquo;using&rsquo; your
		    evocative object in a variety of real environments, the more creative
		    observations you will make about its value and limitations.</li>
	    </ol>
		<p>These playful, creative techniques will not give you the
		  final answer, but they will help you stretch your mind and find new connections
		  between familiar and potential visitor experiences. They can also help you
		  avoid undesirable activities. For example, the Haarlem Oost tagging project
		  started as a sorting project. The original concept was a game where library
		  patrons would sort their books into library categories on shelves, and they
		  would get buzzed if they put a book in the wrong slot. While this job/game was
		  appealing from the librarians&rsquo; standpoint, they quickly realized how
		  unappealing and potentially unpleasant the experience would be for patrons. When
		  they started to think like library users, they realized that the original
		  concept could be modified slightly to accommodate a very different kind of
		  experience &ndash; sharing opinions, not sorting. Later, after implementation, they
		  discovered a second flaw in their design: the new shelves and book drops
		  required patrons to put every book into a tagged location. They hadn&rsquo;t thought
		  about the harried moms and quick-moving patrons who want to just dump their
		  books and move on. In redesign, they are making half of the shelves and book
		  drops &lsquo;general&rsquo; (i.e. untagged), while the other half give patrons tagged
		  options. Had the Haarlem Oost design team performed simple experience
		  prototyping from the perspective of patrons, they would have quickly realized
	    the need for an untagged option. </p>
		<h2>What Happens When You Don&rsquo;t Practice Metaphorical Thinking?</h2>
		<p>This process and these prototyping techniques will take time
		  and effort to implement. But they are worth the effort, because the alternative
		  &ndash; designing clunky, non-contextualized, non-user-friendly technologies &ndash; produces
	    costly failures.</p>
		<p>For example, consider ThinkeringSpace (http://www.id.iit.edu/ThinkeringSpaces/).
		  This project, like Hanrath&rsquo;s project at Haarlem Oost, is library-focused. But
		  unlike the tagging shelves, ThinkeringSpace does not fit into familiar
		  behaviors of library patrons, was not designed with the library mission, context,
		  and content in mind, and is not being developed with user-centric experience
		  design techniques. ThinkeringSpace is a MacArthur Foundation-funded project of
		  the IIT Institute of Design to produce &ldquo;a system, made of both physical and
		  virtual environments, that aims to promote creative and critical thinking
		  skills for the 21st century.&rdquo; Functionally, ThinkeringSpace is a physical remix
		  station that blends smart table technology with digital library assets to allow
		  kids to socially &ldquo;co-construct&rdquo; creative media. Realistically, it is an
		  expensive design project without a client, a context, or a connection to the
	    familiar ways people use libraries.</p>
		<p>The ThinkeringSpace prototype I saw was painfully clunky,
		  not in technology, but in experience. Compared to Hanrath&rsquo;s elegant shelves,
		  ThinkeringSpaces requires patrons to slowly physically scan a book across a
		  surface to pull up information related to it. It&rsquo;s unclear why patrons would
		  want to do this when they could quickly pull up relevant information about the
		  book via the catalogue at multiple computers in the library or at home. The
		  prototype demonstrators frequently used the verbal construction, &ldquo;and then
		  you&hellip;&rdquo; to explain an endless progression of non-intuitive actions like flipping
		  a cube or sliding a book. It was clear that no one would think to perform these
	    actions unless explicitly instructed.</p>
		<p>ThinkeringSpace is aggressively non-intuitive for several
		  reasons. It is a universal platform that is explicitly content-agnostic, so the
		  design is not contextualized to the content it should support. The actions
		  required to operate it are unfamiliar, and there is no clear incentive for
		  patrons to do them. It&rsquo;s explicitly meant to support digital remixing
		  activities that are unfamiliar in physical space. Rather than searching for
		  physical remixing metaphors to build on, like collage-making, the IIT team
		  created their own model. Finally, the IIT team are designers, not librarians. Watching
		  prototyping videos, it was embarrassingly clear that they did not do any kind
		  of experience prototyping to see what activities might meaningfully fit into
		  the ways people use the library. The ThinkeringSpace do not have libraries&rsquo;
	    missions in mind; they have their own colonizing goals.</p>
		<p>ThinkeringSpace asks far too much of patrons in terms of
		  behavior change, and it doesn&rsquo;t offer clear reasons to make the change. They
		  may argue that it is non-intuitive because they are trying to create a platform
		  to support a new kind of behavior, but remixing is not new. Instead, they have
		  designed a clunky, decontextualized piece of machinery &ndash; a peg that barely
	    understands or acknowledges the hole in which it is meant to fit.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s admirable to be ambitious and try to create new
		  platforms for visitor experiences. But if they aren&rsquo;t built into familiar
		  experiences, they are unlikely to inspire adoption. And if they are not
		  contextualized to your overall mission, they are unlikely to receive
	    institutional support.</p>
		<h2>Making It Happen </h2>
		<p>It is not easy to devise creative, elegant ways to map
		  visitors&rsquo; familiar actions to new technologies. Some of your best ideas will be
		  easy to support virtually and unsustainable in physical space. You should still
		  try them. For example, Dick Rijken, a Dutch researcher, wanted to find a way to
		  encourage people to contribute to local historical archives. Rather than
		  setting up a wiki, he erected a stall at a town festival, and cooked and served
		  food based on 17<sup>th</sup> century recipes that were in the archive. To get
	    fed, visitors had to submit their own recipes.</p>
		<p>Is Dick going to spend every day cooking and traveling to
		  festivals to help people understand their power to contribute to archives? No. But
		  he created a mini-platform for contribution that could be extended to other
		  elements of the archive or museum. It was a cheap, elegant way to demonstrate a
		  metaphorical concept in physical space. The food stall was the first step
	    towards a more participatory archive overall. </p>
		<p>Your job is to think in new metaphors. By doing so, you can
		  translate your digital experience design skills into the physical space of the
		  museum. No matter how innovative your museum is on the Web, the core service of
		  most museums is still based in the physical building. The more the on-line
		  functions of a museum deviate from the onsite experience, the more your work
		  will be seen as tangential to the mission of the institution. Now is the time
		  to align your experiments and innovations to the core mission of your museum,
		  and to demonstrate that your successes can be translated to the physical
		  galleries, exhibitions, and programs. Museum directors are struggling to
		  redefine our institutions as relevant, essential spaces in the cultural landscape.
		  I believe you have the metaphors to make this happen. Make new connections,
	    align them to your mission, and start the transformation today. </p>
