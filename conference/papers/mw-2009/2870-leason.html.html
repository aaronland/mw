        <p class="AbstractText">This paper reports qualitative research about the
    experience of contributors to the steve.museum social tagging project. The
    research project explored whether social tagging could enhance access
    to, and create engagement with, museum collections. One element of the research
    was the development and administration of a survey which probed the motivations and experiences of the tag
    contributors. This analysis focuses on reasons for
    tagging and the effect of institutional affiliation. To address the research
    question surrounding the effect of institutional affiliation, the study compares
    the responses from two groups of participants: those who tagged in The
    Metropolitan Museum of Art&rsquo;s community-specific tagger and those who
    tagged in the public site at <a href="../http://tagger.steve.museum/">http://tagger.steve.museum</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Introduction and Background </h2>
      <p>&ldquo;Researching Social Tagging and Folksonomy in Art Museums,&rdquo;
        a National Leadership Grant for Research funded by the Institute of Museum and
        Library Services, was the collaborative effort of a consortium of U.S. art
        museums (and professionals that support them) known as Steve: The Art Museum Social Tagging Project. The research project
        sought to discover whether social tagging could enhance access to, and create
        engagement with, museum collections. One aspect of the research included the
        administration of a survey designed to elicit information about the tagging
        experience and to discover what may have motivated individuals to participate
        in contributing tags or descriptive terms for works of art. The data gathered
        from the survey has been useful in allowing the steve team to substantiate
        project hypotheses about the probable behavior and attitudes of the tag
        contributors, and to better understand the quantitative data about tags and taggers
      that has been gathered during the two-year research project. </p>
      <h2>Survey Development and Administration</h2>
      <p>A survey of people who tagged artworks during the research
        project was planned to complement the project&rsquo;s overall experimental
        methodology, which is described in detail in &ldquo;Tagging, Folksonomy and Art
        Museums; A report of the steve.museum research&rdquo; (Trant, 2009). A survey &ndash; consisting
        of eleven multiple response and three open-end text questions &ndash; was developed
        to solicit information about contributors&rsquo; previous experience with tagging,
        their reasons for visiting the steve tagger, and their impressions of the
        tagging experience. The survey was delivered using Survey Monkey, a tool for
      creating Web-based survey instruments and capturing survey responses. </p>
      <p>The survey was sent in February-March and August, 2008, to all tag contributors who had completed
        tagging activities, filled out the tagger registration form, and agreed to be
        contacted by the research team. Two distinct groups of participants were asked
        to respond: contributors who had participated in tagging in The Metropolitan
        Museum of Art&rsquo;s community-specific installation (the &ldquo;MMA&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;single-institution&rdquo; tagger), and those who had contributed by tagging in the public
        site at http://tagger.steve.museum (the
        &ldquo;public&rdquo; or &ldquo;multi-institution&rdquo; tagger). The
        two separate tagging deployments were established in order to measure variations
        in tagging behavior and contribution between users with a relationship to a
        specific institution and those with a more general interest in tagging. Users
        from the two deployments were also segmented into groups based on the volume of
        their tagging activity. Each group was surveyed using separate data collectors
      in Survey Monkey, resulting in eleven separate data sets. </p>
      <p>A total of 739 contributors were solicited; 238 surveys
        were completed. In the multi-institution installation, 361 users had agreed to
        be contacted. Of those, 32% had not submitted any tags and were extracted from
        the sample since they would not be able to provide adequate feedback about the
        experience of tagging. The survey link was sent by e-mail to the remaining 247.
        The group segmentation was derived using an equal distribution of tags in order
        to attain comparable amounts of data among groups. Users were sorted into
        groups based on the number of tags they had submitted. The single-institution
        survey had a larger pool of recipients (492) who also contributed more tags.
        User groups from this deployment had slightly different grouping thresholds
        based on the higher volume of tags submitted. The overall response rates for
        the multi-institution and single-institution surveys were 33% and 28%
        respectively. Users directly affiliated with the steve.museum project were
      excluded from the sample.</p>
      <h2>Survey Analysis</h2>
      <p>The survey instrument collected responses that allowed for
        investigation along a number of avenues. For purposes of this report, we have
        limited our analysis to questions directly related to key hypotheses of
        interest to the project partners. The analysis focuses on questions about
        motivation (reasons for tagging, and the effect of institutional affiliation);
        about the tagger&rsquo;s perception of the tagging experience; and about the effect
        of work type or characteristics on tagging. Although identifying information
        provided by respondents might have allowed for the cross-tabulation of survey
        responses with contributors&rsquo; actual tagging behavior, we have not performed
        those cross-tabulations. Future work along these lines might prove valuable in
        relating the qualitative responses from the survey with quantitative data
        collected in the tagger. In addition, this survey analysis aggregates responses
        from contributors who tagged in any of the different research interfaces (Trant,
        2009, section 8). Although we recognize that the particular interface presented
        to a contributor may have influenced his or her responses to some of the questions
        in the survey, the cross-tabulation required to determine which users tagged in which environments is beyond the scope of this particular
      study.</p>
      <p>Some sample responses to questions were suggested in multiple choice options. Open-end text responses to these
        same questions were allowed in most cases. Many questions in the survey allowed
        the user to &ldquo;check all that apply,&rdquo; and the resulting tabulation of responses
      to these questions will therefore frequently total more than 100%.</p>
      <h3>Reasons to tag</h3>
      <p>The team hypothesized that users who feel a personal
        affiliation with a museum and its collection may be more motivated to tag than
        members of the public at large. Analysis of the quantitative data collected
        from the steve tagger deployments bears out this
        hypothesis. Users invited to tag by the MMA contributed four times more tags
        than those who were recruited in more generic, less personal, ways (Trant,
        2009). The survey questions about motivation sought to validate the assumption
        about contributors&rsquo; interest in tagging on behalf of an institution with which
        they felt affiliated, but also looked for additional factors that might compel
      participation.</p>
      <h4>The expected experience</h4>
      <p>One survey question aimed to understand the expectations
        of the visitor to the steve tagger: we were curious
        about what the initial impetus for a visit to a museum tagging site might be. <br />
      </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="leason.figure1-w.jpg" alt="figure 1" width="500" height="340" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: Expectations for tagging: public and MMA
      contributors compared (check all that apply)</p>
      <p>The vast majority of respondents were motivated by
        curiosity about tagging art (see Figure 1) with a slight difference in public
        participants&rsquo; (96%) level of curiosity compared with that of MMA participants
        (87%). Tag contributors in the public installation were also more interested in
        seeing tags that others assigned to works that they had also tagged: 48% of
        public tagger contributors cited &ldquo;seeing others&rsquo; tags&rdquo; as a motivating factor,
        compared to 29% of contributors in the MMA installation. Approximately one-third
        of MMA respondents (32%) wanted to be exposed to works other than those they
        had seen before, making this the second highest ranked motivation among MMA
        participants. There was very little interest (less than 10%) in searching for
        works similar to ones that had already been seen, and in seeing one&rsquo;s
        previously applied tags. These responses indicate that tag contributors sought
        new experiences, exposure to new works of art, and were somewhat interested in
      seeing descriptions assigned by others to artworks.</p>
      <h4>Motivation for tagging</h4>
      <p>The survey also sought to understand some of the reasons
        that people might engage in tagging activities, especially in tagging works of
        art. The team hypothesized that many contributors are motivated by altruism,
        the desire to serve other individuals or institutions with which they are
        affiliated. A survey question, &ldquo;Why did you tag?&rdquo; included responses that
        supported the idea of helping others, as well as choices that included reasons
      for tagging usually seen in non-art environments such as del.icio.us or Flickr.</p>
      <p>Helping museums to document works of art was the highest
        ranked response for both groups of contributors, at 66% amongst visitors to the
        public tagger and 68% for MMA contributors (see Figure 2). The second most
        prevalent reason for tagging in the MMA installation was &ldquo;for fun,&rdquo; at 52%
        (compared to 46% of public tagger respondents); the second highest ranked
        response in the public installation was &ldquo;to improve search for other users,&rdquo; at
        51% (compared to 39% of MMA respondents). Tagging to learn more about art was a
        much stronger motivation for MMA respondents (42%) than for respondents to the
        public survey (16%). Amongst those surveyed, altruism does seem to be a
        critical motivating role, with the majority of respondents indicating that they
        tagged either to help museums with documentation or to enable search for other
      users. </p>
      <p><span class="caption"><img src="leason.figure2-w.jpg" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="302" /></span></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 2: Motivation for tagging: public and MMA contributors
      compared (check all that apply)</p>
      <p>It is interesting to note that more than one-third of
        public tag contributors surveyed specified reasons for tagging other than those
        provided. Of these respondents, the majority indicated that they tagged for
        personal or professional research purposes. Some were conducting research on
        Web 2.0 applications in museums, trends in technology use, or folksonomies. A
        few of these participants were teachers who were interested in using the
        interface as a tool in their classes, and several others were students who
        tagged as part of a class exercise. A few respondents said that they tagged as
        a challenge to themselves, as a mind exercise. Recruiting strategies for the
        research project may have been partially responsible for producing these
        results, since significant recruitment took place within the community of
        museum and information science colleagues interested in the research project
        itself. In addition, solicitations to tag, as well as the tagging interface
        itself, all described the project as an investigation into the possibility of &ldquo;enhancing
        access to museum collections,&rdquo; and may have predisposed respondents to select
      the &ldquo;improve search&rdquo; option when queried about motivation.</p>
      <h4>Number of visits</h4>
      <p>The team hypothesized that tagging was an engaging
        activity that users would enjoy enough to do more than once. In the survey,
        respondents were asked to describe the frequency of their visits; we have
        cross-tabulated these responses against responses about contributors&rsquo;
        motivation for tagging, seeking evidence of links between satisfaction and
        engagement (more visits) and motivation.&nbsp; Survey respondents reported their visit frequency as follows: for the
        public installation: frequently 3, occasionally 65, and once 31, for a total of
        99 respondents (see Figure 3); for the MMA
        installation: frequently 5, occasionally 60, once 73, and no response 1, for a
        total of 139 respondents (see Figure 4). The occasional user was in the
        majority in the public instance (66%), and the one-time visitor was in the
        majority in the MMA instance (53%). (Numerical definitions for &ldquo;occasionally&rdquo;
        and &ldquo;frequently&rdquo; were not provided in the survey and may cloud any detailed
        analysis comparing these two categories.) Some of the open-ended text comments
        received from MMA participants indicated that they might have been willing to
        do more tagging if they were asked via additional e-mail prompts. In addition,
        several MMA respondents indicated that they believed tagging was a one-time exercise,
        perhaps explaining the high number of those visiting only once. Fewer than 5%
        of users (public 3% and MMA 4%) said that they were frequent visitors; this indicates
      that users did not return to the tagging tool often, as was initially hoped. </p>
      <p><span class="caption"><img src="leason.figure3-w.jpg" alt="figure 3" width="408" height="318" /></span></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 3: Number of survey respondents from public tagger
      survey, by frequency of visits</p>
      <p><span class="caption"><img src="leason.figure4-w.jpg" alt="figure 4" width="409" height="303" /></span></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 4: Number of survey respondents from MMA tagger survey,
      by frequency of visits</p>
      <p>The analysis shows that for both public and MMA
        installations, frequent tag contributors visited primarily for fun and were not
        interested in finding works again later or in connecting with others (see
        Figures 5, 6). Occasional and one-time participants visited for all reasons
        provided, but primarily to help museums document works of art. It must be noted
        that the research project&rsquo;s experimental design deliberately limited the number
        and nature of interface variables: in particular, the kinds of variables thought
        by experts in social media to create &ldquo;fun&rdquo; environments &ndash; i.e. those that are
        most likely to create &ldquo;stickiness&rdquo; and return visits &ndash; were not offered to
        taggers in this phase of the steve project research. Far more research is
        required to understand the relationship between the number of visits by taggers
      and their perception of &ldquo;fun.&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 6: Motivation to tag / frequency of visits, MMA tagger
      (check all that apply)</p>
      <h4>Institutional affiliation</h4>
      <p>One of the project team&rsquo;s most important hypotheses
        surrounded the concept of institutional affiliation. The team&rsquo;s conviction that
        a sense of association with a particular art museum (rather than with museums
        in general, or with the tagging activity) would induce participants to visit
        more, tag more, and possibly to provide more useful tags. The research
        experiment itself yielded strong affirming evidence for this hypothesis (Trant,
        2009); one survey question sought explicit confirmation that a request from a
      local museum to help by tagging would influence a user to tag more.</p>
      <p>Figure 7 charts the response to the question about whether
        respondents would be likely to tag more if asked by their local museum. Both
        sets of surveys indicated a strong positive response, with a slightly higher
        percentage of MMA respondents (75%) than public tagger contributors (69%)
      indicating that an institutional invitation would motivate them to tag more. </p>
      <p><span class="caption"><img src="leason.figure7-w.jpg" alt="figure 7" width="500" height="335" /></span></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 7: Willingness to tag if invited by local art museum</p>
      <h3>Perception of tagging experience</h3>
      <p>One survey question that was offered as a counterpoint to
        the &ldquo;expectations&rdquo; question charted in Figure 1 looked at what users felt about
        their tagging experience after the fact. In Figures 8 and 9, we have
        cross-tabulated responses about the user perception of the steve tagger experience against the user&rsquo;s (self-defined) frequency of visits.<b> </b>Those respondents who found tagging
        interesting comprised the largest population of tag contributors in both
        installations (public 83% and MMA 70%). The public participants found tagging
        more fun (58%) than challenging (44%), while more MMA participants described
        their experiences as challenging (55%) than fun (47%). Frequent, occasional,
        and one-time participants visited for all reasons provided, except frequent
        visitors did not typically identify their experience as useless. It is not
        surprising to find that the vast majority of survey respondents responded
        positively to tagging and that those who had a negative reaction, finding
        tagging boring or useless, made up approximately 10% of those surveyed; this
        number would presumably be higher in a survey of all visitors to the steve
        tagger, not just those who completed the survey. Of
        those respondents who specified a response as &ldquo;other,&rdquo; a few from the public
        tagger wanted more control over their experience, and others indicated that the
        subjective nature of the experience made tagging difficult. Those who specified
        a response of &ldquo;other&rdquo; in the MMA survey pool said that the exercise was time-consuming
        and confusing. A few also questioned its usefulness. One respondent indicated
        that, as structured, the tagging activity might pass a threshold for continued
      engagement: &ldquo;It was fun and interesting for a while, but it became boring.&rdquo; </p>

      <h3>The effect of object characteristics</h3>
      <h4>Object type</h4>
      <p>The team was interested in knowing whether the
        characteristics of an object (its type, origin, or dates) affect tagging
        behavior. Several survey questions were posed to assess the tag contributor
        experience related to the characteristics of the works tagged and to provide a
        comparison with the quantitative analysis. We hypothesized
        that two-dimensional works (i.e. paintings, photographs, and prints and
        drawings), which tend to contain more representational content and might
        require less technical knowledge to describe, would be easier for the
        non-specialist user to tag. We asked the questions: &ldquo;Were certain types of art
        easier to tag?&rdquo; and &ldquo;If so, which?&rdquo; Responses suggest that two-dimensional
        works were considered easiest to tag (see Figure 10), although approximately
        one-quarter of respondents in both installations (public 26% and MMA 22%) said
        that they did not remember if some works were easier to tag than others. This
        could be due to the fact that some time had passed since the respondents
        actually tagged or that there was not a noticeable difference to some
        contributors; others may simply have skipped works that they were not compelled
        or able to tag. In fact, several users noted that they had tagged only
        paintings. Three-dimensional works were obviously thought by the majority to be
        more difficult to tag, while textiles (rugs, clothing, etc.) ranked as least
        easy to describe (public 4% and MMA 9%). Respondents were also given the option
        to specify their response as &ldquo;other&rdquo; (public 14% and MMA 7%). Respondents stated
        that, &ldquo;representational works had more obvious content hooks&rdquo; and that &ldquo;paintings,
        photographs, prints and drawings are always easier to tag as most would base
        their tagging on the subject/image. The three dimensional is different: most of
        the &quot;tags&quot; are already included in the description/label provided by
      the museum.&rdquo; </p>
      <p><span class="caption"><img src="leason.figure10-w.jpg" alt="figure 10" width="500" height="335" /></span></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 10: &ldquo;Easy to tag&rdquo; by Object Type (check all that apply)</p>
      <h4>Object culture</h4>
      <p>The team also hypothesized users would find it easier to
        tag works from their own culture; that is, they might struggle with non-Western
        or ancient works, preferring works created by Western artists and in the modern
        era. When asked if works from a specific period or geographic location were
        easier to tag, respondents felt most strongly that European and American art
        was easier to tag (public 36% and MMA 45%: see Figure 11), although almost
        one-third of respondents stated that they did not remember if some works were
        easier to tag than others. As with a similar question asked about
        two-dimensional and three-dimensional works, this might be because contributors
        had simply skipped works that were difficult to tag, or because the object
        culture types suggested in the survey were unfamiliar. In some, but not all,
        interfaces, taggers were provided with museum-created caption information that
        would have identified the work by culture, although we cannot be certain that at
        all times users knew what they were looking at. MMA tag contributors found
        Medieval and Renaissance works easier to tag (27%), compared to public
        contributors at 19%; contributors from the public survey were slightly more
        comfortable tagging modern and contemporary works (25% versus 21% for MMA). Both
        sets of respondents were least comfortable tagging Asian, African, or other
        non-Western works (public 11% and MMA 8%), providing support for the core
      hypothesis about the influence of culture on ease of tagging.</p>
      <p><span class="caption"><img src="leason.figure11-w.jpg" alt="figure 11" width="500" height="335" /></span></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 11: &ldquo;Easy to tag&rdquo; by Culture or Period (check all that
      apply)</p>
      <p>A few factors to note: we were unable to make any firm
        determinations about whether objects were from the survey respondent&rsquo;s culture,
        since we did not collect demographic information for survey respondents. It is,
        however, assumed that the large majority of respondents and taggers were North
        American, as recruiting activities focused on communities in the U.S. and
        Canada. Certain users might have had a richer understanding of the collection
        that they were tagging. A few of the open-ended text responses also support the
        team&rsquo;s assumptions: &ldquo;ease of tagging just depended on whether the piece (or
      some aspect of it) was in some way familiar to me.&rdquo; <i></i></p>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>The survey of tag contributors affirms some of the key
        findings of the data analysis, and provides preliminary insights into the
        motivations and experience of those who tag art. Users in this study expressed
        altruistic motives for their tagging activities, indicating that they tagged in
        order to assist museums in documenting works of art and, to a lesser extent, to
        aid individuals who may be searching for artworks. People wanted to be involved
        with the work of museums and to respond to their requests for input. This may
        provide museums with a justification for making appeals both to individuals who
        are already affiliated with their institutions as well as to those from the
        general public. Some valuable information about the experience of users in
        tagging objects with different characteristics was also collected, and should
        be verified in further studies of object characteristics and the relationship
      to tags and contributor behavior.</p>
      <p>Survey respondents&rsquo; motivations for tagging must be seen
        through the limited prism of their tagging experience in the steve project&rsquo;s experimental interface(s). Although survey respondents indicated that
        they tagged for fun, and to learn about art, the project&rsquo;s overall experimental
        construction constrained the conclusions that could be drawn from the data and
        the surveys. The project team made a deliberate choice to conduct the testing
        using a set of simple interfaces with minor variations on the presentation of
        objects or object-related information. Data collected in these simple tagging
        environments provides important baseline information about the behavior of
        those who tag art and allows useful conclusions to be drawn about the effect of
        object choice and metadata presentation on tag generation. These interfaces,
        however, contained few elements designed to engage, reward, and inspire, and an
        examination of how best to create long-term engagement with taggers &nbsp;- how to make tagging applications
        &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; &ndash; awaits testing in environments that are designed to provide &ldquo;fun&rdquo;
        experiences or learning environments. Such environments might contain social
        media elements (user profiles and user-created communities); elements of
        competition and reward; or the possibility to customize or personalize the
      tagging experience. </p>
      <p>Review of open-ended text responses supplies some of the most
        compelling and lively information about users and their experiences, providing
        perspective on what drew individuals to tagging artworks. The vast majority of
        respondents had a positive reaction to the project, and comments collected in
      the surveys included the following statements: </p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">I love, love, love this.&nbsp; I feel like I am in school again learning and contributing
        to this. It has become a hobby, I try to do some
        whenever I have a quiet moment.&nbsp; I
        look forward to doing it.&nbsp; I am so
      excited to be a part of it.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Very interesting project, I found it when researching about
        taxonomy, folksonomy, Web semantics and museum. We are working to implement the
      Steve software at our project.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Loved the experience.&nbsp; Immediately told all my museum goer &amp;
      &quot;art&quot; friends &ndash; they seemed to like it too.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">1. It's fun, interesting, educational, a
        &quot;trip&quot;.&nbsp; 2. Makes me feel
      I have a stake in the collections. 3. Delightfully self-aggrandizing.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Should happen at more museums. Very
      interactive.</p>
      <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">This was a fantastic project! I would have LOVED to have been on the editorial team that had to go through and
        edit the tags.&nbsp; Thanks for doing
        this &ndash; I think it will make the artwork so much easier to search for for users,
      particularly students and non-experts.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, research into the potential of tagging as a
        tool for museum practice cannot be considered complete until a thorough study
        is undertaken of the various methods that might be employed to create long-term
        engagement between tag contributors and museum collections. In the meantime,
        these visitor voices encourage the project&rsquo;s members to think about ways to
      continue to offer tagging experiences that motivate and teach.</p>
