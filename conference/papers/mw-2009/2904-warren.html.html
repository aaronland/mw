		<p class="AbstractText">Video podcasts seem like the ideal method for the United
		  States National Park Service to attract new generations to its parks. At the
		  National Parks of New York Harbor Education Center, two video podcast projects
	    used very different strategies as a way of engaging teens and young adults.</p>

	    <h2>Introduction</h2>
	    <p>The visitors gather after dark. Strangers introduce
		    themselves as they spread blankets on the ground. Children watch the flames of
		    a campfire. A cheerful woman or man, wearing a uniform and a Stetson hat, tunes
		    the guitar to get visitors&rsquo; attention. The park ranger sets the mood by
		    teaching the group a song, which visitors sing in unison. Then the park ranger
		    begins to reveal the park&rsquo;s wonders that lie all around them, hidden in the
	    darkness.</p>
	    <p>Campfire programs are as iconic to the United States
		    National Park Service (USNPS, or NPS) as the park ranger hat. Local sites have their
		    own variations. Visitors to Rock Creek Park may listen to a string quartet,
		    while at Cape Cod National Seashore, visitors work together to draw a large map
		    of the cape in the sand. But the basic elements remain consistent. Campfire
		    programs attract young and old, not merely because the ranger knows so much
		    about the park, but because visitors participate in the park&rsquo;s mystery - even
		    if they only gather as an audience. Families, couples and singles share a
		    common experience on common ground, the kind of museum experience Falk (2008)
		    describes as &ldquo;deeply personal, intimately tied to each subject&rsquo;s sense of
		    identity.&rdquo; Visitors become a part of, not apart from, the National Park. The
		    values of park stewardship pass from ranger to visitor and from generation to
	    generation.</p>
	    <p>This last point - inspiring a new generation of park
		    stewards - is practically encoded in the agency&rsquo;s DNA. The Organic Act of 1916,
		    which founded the NPS, charges the agency with preserving natural and historic
		    treasures for the enjoyment of the public &ldquo;by such means as will leave them
		    unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations&rdquo; (NPS, 1916). Parks are
	    charged with looking toward the future of the resources they protect. </p>
	    <p>Today, the Internet is the most obvious medium to engage a
		    new generation of young adults and teens to support their parks. New technology
		    has the added potential to attract new, younger and more diverse audiences to
		    National Parks than we have today. Studies show African-Americans and Hispanics
		    are less likely to visit National Parks than the general population, and more
		    likely to feel unwelcome when they do visit (Solp,
	    Hagan and Osterman, 2003).</p>
	    <p>But how can the Web convey the warmth of a campfire
		    program? Can new technology transmit the excitement and intimacy of a National
	    Park&rsquo;s story to so-called &ldquo;digital natives&rdquo;?</p>
	    <p>In the spring and summer of 2008, the National Parks of
		    New York Harbor Education Center (the Center) facilitated two video podcast
		    projects. (The Center, which is managed and operated by Gateway National
		    Recreation Area, helps National Parks in New York Harbor create education services which support state and local curriculum standards.) Each
		    project used a different approach to attract &ldquo;Millennials&rdquo;
	      (also called &ldquo;digital natives&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gen Y,&rdquo; short for &ldquo;Generation Y&rdquo;) to New
		    York Harbor&rsquo;s 23 NPS sites. One project placed videocameras into the hands of high school students. The other project relied on a
		    professional documentarian to create a series of video podcasts about National
		    Parks in New York Harbor. Each approach had its own challenges and rewards, and
	    each points the agency to new ways it can interact with visitors.</p>

	    <p class="caption">Fig 1: High school students interview science teacher
	    Christopher Chieh, who immigrated from Liberia (<a href="../http://www.nps.gov/npnh/photosmultimedia">http://www.nps.gov/npnh/photosmultimedia</a>)</p>
	    <h2>&lsquo;Digital Natives,&rsquo; the Web and the NPS</h2>
	    <p>Both national reports and local NPS data confirm that
		    young adults and teens use new technologies and expect such conveniences as
		    part of their daily lives. A market research report by PhoKusWright,
	      &ldquo;The NEXTgen Traveler&trade;&rdquo; (Cudebec,
		    2008), studied how technology users of all ages make choices in their travel
		    destinations. The report offers provocative data on how technology users,
		    including &lsquo;Gen Xers&rsquo; and &lsquo;Millenials&rsquo;,
		    use the Web in their daily lives. (The parameters of these generations are
		    debatable, but Gen Xers are often described as those
		    born between 1964-1980, with Millenials born between
	    1980-2000.) </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li> 71% use the Internet to search for travel
	        information</li>
	      <li> 59% download or stream video, including 26%
	        downloading video podcasts</li>
	      <li> 56% visit MySpace (a social networking Web site) regularly </li>
	      <li> 34% share videos via YouTube</li>
	      <li> 26% use Photobucket,
	        while 17% use Flickr (two photosharing Web sites)</li>
	      <li> 45% write reviews about movies, music, etc. on-line,
	        with 10% writing their own blogs</li>
	      <li> Only 14% report not participating in any social
	        networking, sharing or community-oriented sites</li>
        </ul>
	    <p>Young adults obviously use the Web to make travel
		    decisions and to gather content. But they also use interactive, many-to-many tools
		    such as social networking sites, blogs and photo sharing. The Web is not merely
		    a tool used to retrieve content, but also a space where young people share both
	    content and comments. This has profound implications for museums and parks.</p>
	    <p>For parks and museums, though, the figures are less hopeful.
		    While 74% took one to three leisure trips in the past year, visiting a national
		    or state park attracted only 11%. Cultural vacations and educational vacations
	    scored still lower, at 9% and 7%. </p>
	    <p>Are younger people uninterested in parks and cultural
		    institutions, or are such destinations merely off their radar? Can parks and
		    museums increase their visibility and visitation by a more savvy presence on
	    the Web? If so, what forms should that presence take?</p>
	    <p>The NPS has paid increasing attention to &lsquo;Gen Y&rsquo;. A focus
		    group of students at Johnson &amp; Wales University (Drohan,
		    2007) visited National Parks in their area and surfed park Web sites. They gave
		    their recommendations at the 2007 Northeast Region&rsquo;s Chiefs of Interpretation
		    Conference held in Providence, Rhode Island. The group recommended increased electronic
		    communication to reach young people, specifically podcasts, e-tours and cellphone tours. They also mentioned that young visitors
		    will feel more connected with park rangers closer to their age, staff who may
		    be able to present information in ways that appeal to their generation. A focus
		    group of students from Siena College suggested testimonials about a park from
		    other young adults, as well as NPS presence on social networking sites such as
	    the popular sites MySpace and Facebook. </p>
	    <p>Dr. Mary C. Lynn, Professor of American Studies at
		    Skidmore College, facilitated a workshop at Saratoga National Historical Park
		    on Gen Y. She noted (Lynn, 2007) that generalizations about an entire
		    generation should be balanced with an understanding that gender, ethnic and
		    class differences must also be considered. Nonetheless, she observed that many
	    in Gen Y:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li> Are increasingly separated from nature, despite
	        an increased environmental awareness and interest;</li>
	      <li> Spend more time indoors, often while using new
	        technologies;</li>
	      <li> Want interactivity, quick feedback, choices,
	        flexibility;</li>
	      <li> May have less exposure to National Parks due to
	        a busy, highly structured family life, which places children in organized group
	        activities while parents work.</li>
        </ul>
	    <p>Young adults in New York City offer an interesting look at
		    the perception of National Parks, thanks to the city&rsquo;s ethnic diversity. Dr.
		    William Kornblum, Professor of Sociology at the Graduate
		    Center of the City University of New York, conducted a focus group of CUNY
		    undergraduates as part of the workshop &ldquo;Digital Natives and Analog Parks:
	    Engaging Young Adults&rdquo; (Kornblum, 2008).</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="warren_fig_2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="500" height="375" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 2: William Kornblum,
		    Professor of Sociology at the Graduate Center, City University of New York,
	    shares the findings of his survey of CUNY students</p>
	    <p>Kornblum reported that nearly
		    40% of young adults in New York City speak a language other than English at
		    home. Three of every four survey participants report being introduced to a
		    National Park, either by visiting a New York Harbor park (36%), via a
		    television show (36%) or the Internet (12%). Students rated their interest
		    level in visiting a National Park as medium (26%), relatively high (46%) or
		    high (27%). They stated that they were most likely to hear about new activities
		    from the Internet (33%), newspapers (28%), friends (23%), teachers (9%) and
		    family (7%). Kornblum concludes that young adults &ldquo;will
		    become a vanguard of diversity in uses of the region&rsquo;s NPS facilities in the
		    future.&rdquo; A more sophisticated Web presence would attract them to visit National
	    Parks. </p>
	    <p>However, as of this writing, fewer than two dozen NPS
		    units offer podcasts (audio or video) on iTunes. While NPS unit
		      Web sites now have a uniform appearance (Stanton, 2001), individual park
		    sites are responsible for updating their Web content. It may be useful to think
		    of the NPS as a confederation of small museums within a national framework. Only
		    around 20,000 full time employees work for the agency, spread across 391 units
		    from the Virgin Islands to American Samoa (<a href="../http://www.nps.gov/">www.nps.gov</a>).
		    Understandably, parks spend their limited budgets and resources on walk-in
	    visitor services and infrastructure. </p>
	    <p>Cobell v. Salazar, a class
		    action lawsuit brought by Native Americans against the US Department of the
		    Interior (DOI, which includes the NPS), may also have had an inadvertent
		    chilling effect on Web-based innovations. Now in its twelfth year, the lawsuit
		    alleges that DOI mismanaged money accounts for Native Americans. This includes
		    alleged mismanagement of electronic records. In December 2001, the Federal
		    judge in the case ordered many DOI Web sites and e-mail addresses to be shut
		    down until they met enhanced security standards. By mid-2002 the NPS went back
		    on-line, but some DOI offices were not reconnected until mid-2008 (<a
href="../http://www.doi.gov/bia/">http://www.doi.gov/bia/</a>). As a
		    result, agency employees may perceive new technologies not only as difficult to
		    master, but also as risky and insecure. In this writer&rsquo;s experience, park
		    rangers respond to news about Web innovations by asking, &ldquo;Are we allowed to do
	    that?&rdquo;</p>
	    <p>Perhaps, then, placing video cameras in the hands of high
	    school students might seem a bit less risky after all. </p>
	    <h2>Student-Created Content: The Save Our History&trade; Project</h2>
	    <p>In March 2008, juniors at the College of Staten Island
		    High School for International Studies (CSIHSIS) videotaped interviews with
		    immigrants living in their community. This was the culmination of a year-long
		    focus on immigration, titled &ldquo;Immigrant Experiences: From Ellis Island to
		    Staten Island.&rdquo; The project was funded by a grant from the History Channel&rsquo;s
	    Save Our History&trade; program (<a href="../http://www.history.com/minisites/saveourhistory">http://www.history.com/minisites/saveourhistory</a>).</p>
	    <p>Aligning the interests and goals of all partners in a
		    project is, when it works well, a highly choreographed dance. The partners in
		    this project had interlinking relationships. Statue of Liberty National
		    Monument (which includes Ellis Island) is another NPS unit in New York Harbor.
		    Save Ellis Island is a cooperative association helping to preserve New Jersey&rsquo;s
		    section of Ellis Island. The Center has a formal partnership with the College
		    of Staten Island, which in turn helped create CSIHSIS as a charter school. All
	    partners contributed time, staff and space to the project. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="warren_fig_3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="500" height="375" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 3: Who&rsquo;s right? At the NPNH Education Center, students
	    read official records that contradict an Ellis Island immigrant&rsquo;s oral history</p>
	    <p>The inspiration for students interviewing modern-day
		    immigrants came from an ongoing oral history project at Ellis Island with
		    immigrants who had passed through the island during its years of operation
		    (1892-1954). The activity was the culmination of a year-long focus on immigration
		    in US History class. At the same time, students in Technology class (a
		    half-year course) learned how to create and edit videos. Partner organizations
		    brought in speakers, from park rangers to professors. They taught students how
		    to take documentary photographs, how to conduct oral histories and how to
	    evaluate primary sources.</p>
	    <p>Teams of students located Staten Island residents who had
		    immigrated to the US, researched the person&rsquo;s country of origin, and sat down
		    for an interview. Originally, the Center had wanted students to engage communities
		    actively, with flyers and visits to community centers. Instead, students
		    interviewed relatives, teachers and in at least one case, a co-worker at a
		    restaurant. But this did not detract from the project at all. Indeed, the
		    project gave several students the chance to discuss family history with their
		    mothers, fathers and grandparents for the first time and to have new
		    conversations with their teachers. Students interviewed immigrants from China,
		    Cuba, Ghana, Hong Kong, Ireland, Lebanon, Liberia, Pakistan, Poland and South
	    Korea. (One team chose to interview a migrant from Puerto Rico.)</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="warren_fig_4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="285" height="160" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 4: George Kaluski interviews
		    his grandmother, Margaret Kubasczyk, whose Polish
	    family narrowly escaped death from the German Army in World War II</p>
	    <p>Before any filming began, we contacted the NPS solicitor.
		    Several forms needed to be created and signed first. Some parents, out of
		    concern for their children&rsquo;s safety, do not want their child&rsquo;s face on the
		    Internet. The NPS solicitor approved the language for photo/video release forms
		    which parents needed to sign for their minor children prior to the filming.
		    Since agency-created material belongs to the public domain, students and
		    parents also had to agree to waive claim to copyright control. Some interview
		    subjects expressed opinions about politics; therefore each video began with a
		    disclaimer. If we did not receive all permission forms, we did not place a
	    video on exhibit or on the Web. </p>
	    <p>Students had been encouraged to check out the school&rsquo;s videocameras, tripods, MiniDVs and microphones, some of which were purchased specifically for the project.
		    However, both audio and video technical quality varied widely. Several students
		    grabbed the family videocamera and recorded on to
		    Memory Sticks, creating grainy videos, or filmed next to noisy refrigerators
		    and busy stairs. Out of fifteen student team projects, nine were chosen by the school
		    as good enough for exhibition, based on both the quality of student questions
	    and the technical qualities of the recording.</p>
	    <p>But the content of the videos ranged from good to
		    astonishing. Students had clearly studied the home countries of the immigrants
		    and asked thoughtful, intelligent questions. Immigrants clearly were at ease
		    with the students, sharing many personal details of their old and new lives in
		    the US. Indeed, they may have been more open with answering students&rsquo; questions
		    than they would have been sitting with an academic oral historian. Interviews
	    were as short as ten minutes or as long as an hour.</p>
	    <p>An example: George Kaluski interviewed his grandmother, Margaret Kubasczyk, who
		    immigrated from Poland after her husband&rsquo;s involvement with the Solidarity
		    movement made life even more difficult in the Communist state. In her
		    interview, she recalled an incident during her childhood, where German soldiers
		    were burning their village. &ldquo;I started kissing this German soldier&rsquo;s hand,&rdquo; she
	    remembered, &ldquo;saying, in Polish, &lsquo;Please, please let us go to my grandmother.&rsquo;</p>
	    <p>Immigrants often had advice for the students. Christopher Chieh, a science teacher at CSIHSIS, compared his
	    experience fleeing Liberia with human tragedies closer here in the US: </p>
	    <p class="BlockQuote">Being a refugee is not some&shy;thing you plan for... Hurricane Katrina came
		    and people were internally displaced. You must prepare for the unexpected ...
		    always keep your head up high, be very optimistic, and continue working hard
		    and believe in yourself, believe in your family values... and you will definitely
	    make it. (<a href="../http://www.nps.gov/npnh/photosmultimedia">http://www.nps.gov/npnh/photosmultimedia</a>)</p>
	    <p>Some teams preferred one on-camera interviewer, while the
		    team that interviewed Debbie Goon took turns asking questions, even calling out
		    follow-up questions off-camera. Goon revealed that she &ldquo;cried for two weeks
		    straight&rdquo; when she started attending school on the lower east side of Manhattan
	    until another Chinese girl in class started to mentor her.</p>
	    <p>The nine videos chosen were further
		    edited down to podcast size by a professional film editor. The Center
		    designed a temporary exhibit at Ellis Island and featured the students&rsquo; work,
		    including the nine videos; the exhibit was on display in June and July 2008. Close
		    to half a million people visited the island during those two months alone. A
		    formal opening took place at Ellis Island on Saturday, June 7. In addition to
		    text and photos, visitors could select for themselves any of the nine video interviews
		    they wanted to watch. Observers noticed that families often chose to watch
		    videos of people from the same home countries as themselves. The panel featured
	    the immigrant&rsquo;s name as well as the name and flag of their country of origin.</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="warren_fig_5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="500" height="333" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 5: Visitors to Ellis Island choose an immigrant to watch</p>
	    <p>For preservation after the exhibit was taken down, copies
		    and transcripts of the edited interviews were donated to four local history
		    institutions: the Bob Hope Immigration Archives at Ellis Island; the archives
		    of the College of Staten Island; the Staten Island Historical Society; and the
	    Staten Island Museum.</p>
	    <p>The good work of students and partners alike earned the <i>Save Our History</i> <i>Preservation Award,</i> given annually to the grant recipient that
		    preserves a significant aspect of community history or heritage. In addition to
		    its monetary component, the award allowed both teachers and four students to
	    attend the award ceremony in Washington, DC.</p>
	    <h2>Creating Videos = Creating Meaning?</h2>
	    <p>John Dewey (1916) reminds us that while experience alone
		    is &ldquo;primarily an active/passive affair, it is not primarily cognitive. But&hellip;the
		    measure of the value of an experience&hellip; includes recognition in the degree in
		    which it is cumulative, or amounts to something, or has meaning.&rdquo; Did the
	    experience of creating videos have meaning for our students? If so, why?</p>
	    <p>In November and again in June, students filled out Personal
		    Meaning Maps (PMMs) which were evaluated by Claudia Ocello, formerly of Save Ellis Island. Out of 58 PMMs
		    collected initially in November, 24&nbsp;(41%) made some changes/additions to
		    their PMMs. Of the 41% that made changes or additions, 21% exhibited evidence
		    of increased breadth of knowledge. They added phrases or words such as <i>hardship, deportation, positive and negative
		      effects </i>and<i> interviews</i>. Examples
		    included adding drawings of artifacts seen on field trips or of dollar signs;
		    crossing out the word <i>boat</i> and
		    replacing it with <i>ship</i>. A deeper
		    content knowledge was demonstrated by 17% by using words such as <i>no Medicare, illness</i> and <i>health checks</i>. Some expressed how the
		    interview they did &ldquo;shed light on what it was like to come from another
	    country,&rdquo; in the words of one student.</p>
	    <p>Why did students learn from the year-long project? Perhaps
		    it was because they now associated immigration with individuals they knew - teachers,
		    workmates, family members. But the creation of the
		    videos themselves almost certainly added meaning to the project for students. Levy
		    (2008) observes, &ldquo;When students work on curriculum standards in the context of
		    producing a genuine product for an authentic audience, the result is enhanced
		    achievement in content-area knowledge, literacy, craftsmanship and character.&rdquo;
        Students knew that their videos would go on the Web. </p>
	    <p>The Save Our History&trade; project has terrific potential for
		    the NPS. By &ldquo;deputizing&rdquo; high school students to collect, preserve and present
		    history to the public, we invite them to host their own virtual &ldquo;campfire
		    programs.&rdquo; The agency is sharing its intellectual hegemony with teenagers and
		    with the immigrants who agreed to be interviewed. This is a bold step toward
		    engaging the agency with schools, students and local communities. Several
	    students also chose to create portfolio projects on immigration.</p>
	    <p>Like all bold steps, the project faltered at times. As
		    stated earlier, the quality of the videos varied widely. The initial intent of
		    the project was too ambitious to match the pace of curriculum. We wanted
		    students to shoot part of their videos at Ellis Island, drawing a direct
		    comparison between the recent immigrant and an Ellis Island immigrant from the
		    park&rsquo;s Oral History Project. The videos could have been used by visitors while
		    touring Ellis Island itself. Although we met with each group of students and
		    matched them all with an Ellis Island immigrant oral history, the video
		    component of the project ended with the modern immigrant interviews. It is
		    unclear why the project stalled there. Were there tensions within the school that
		    all parties were unaware of, or was it simply too late in the school year to do
		    much more? Or did competing events, such as a trip to Germany, overwhelm the
	    students? </p>

	    <p class="caption">Fig. 6: Students practising their
	    interview and video skills</p>
	    <p>In retrospect, the project was more daunting than perhaps
		    any partner had realized. While the college and the Center had a prior
		    relationship, the Center and CSIHSIS had never worked together before. Monthly
		    conference calls took place among the partners to resolve outstanding issues,
		    but front-line staff probably needed to talk to each other more frequently
		    about integrating curriculum with the project&rsquo;s timetable. One example: the
		    history class was year-long, while the technology class was a half-year. The
		    two teachers also lacked a common meeting time. How could they coordinate
		    lesson plans? It might have been better for the school and the Center to work
		    together on a smaller project first, so that each had a better grasp of the
		    other&rsquo;s needs and abilities. Also, the earlier a detailed plan is in place, the
	    easier on all parties.</p>
	    <p>Finally, a project as rich and complex
		    as this demands student buy-in. In retrospect, we made the classic teacherly mistake of frontloading content and skills first,
		    saving the &ldquo;fun stuff&rdquo; until late in the school year. By then, perceptions were
		    set about the project, one way or the other. Next time, we would give students
		    more choice and autonomy. We would ask them to define what they wanted to learn
		    - to write their own &ldquo;essential question.&rdquo; Ironically, had we ceded more control
		    to students at the beginning, we might have come closer to our original
	    expectations.</p>
	    <h2>Hiring An Expert: The More Traditional Route</h2>
	    <p>Issues of content and quality are much easier to address
		    when the museum or park pays someone else to do the work. In the summer of 2008
		    the Center, in contract with Heritage Partners, Inc., hired Ducat Media to
		    create a series of video podcasts. Vivian Ducat is the executive
		      producer and principal of Ducat Media LLC, a documentary and multimedia
		      production and design company creating projects for museums, universities and
		      other cultural institutions. The series would feature different aspects
		    of some of the National Parks in New York Harbor. The entire schedule was ten
		    weeks, from preparation to final cut. This compressed schedule had its
		    advantages: it kept everyone on task, while contractors knew when they were
	    free to take on other projects. </p>
	    <p>While this project seems at first quite different from the
		    Save Our History&trade; project, there are important parallels. First, each video
		    project intended to attract young people to NPS sites through the Internet.
		    Second, oral histories are not unlike documentaries. Both involved collaborative
		    efforts between interviewer and subject, with an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; answering questions (given
	    either on-camera or off-camera) and the shaping of content via video editing.</p>
	    <p>Ducat, a former reporter for National Public Radio, moved
		    into documentary films because she wanted to tell stories visually. She
		    eschewed storyboarding the videos but still framed the videos in a traditional
		    documentary format, rather than a fast-cut, looser, post-MTV style. She asked
		    rangers, partners and volunteers questions off-camera, with her questions cut
		    out of the final product. Answers by the &ldquo;experts&rdquo; were intercut with moving
	    and still images.</p>
	    <p>The initial interview meetings began in mid-July, weeks
		    before any filming occurred. Ducat visited each of the six units, along with an
		    NPS employee of the Center. NPS staff sometimes approached these meetings
		    nervously. They were unfamiliar with new technologies and may have been wary of
		    letting an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; reshape their site&rsquo;s narrative. But Ducat quickly put
		    them at ease. She made it clear that NPS expertise would guide her editing
		    decisions by asking question after question from site staff about the park
		    resource. What stories did they themselves find the most compelling? Employees
		    and volunteers realized they were in their familiar roles, as storytellers, and
	    opened up to the project. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="warren_fig_7.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="500" height="380" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 7: Park Ranger Anne Yen sketches a heron at Jamaica Bay</p>
	    <p>Each video included three to six speakers: park rangers,
		    volunteers, professors at partner colleges and supervisors. Whenever possible,
		    younger people were featured on camera to present content and to share their
		    enthusiasm about the parks. Park Ranger Anne Yen sketched herons while off-duty.
	    She observed: </p>
	    <p class="BlockQuote">Jamaica Bay is an amazing place to draw birds because
		    there&rsquo;s so much variety, there&rsquo;s so many birds, coming and going... there&rsquo;s, I
		    think, over 350 species of birds, and it changes throughout the seasons, so you&rsquo;ll
	    never get bored. </p>
	    <p>Videos allowed park sites to highlight unfamiliar
		    resources. Sandy Hook chose not to feature its popular beaches, visited by two
		    million people per year, instead focusing on its salt marsh and holly forest. &nbsp;Hook&rsquo;s video on military history
		    revealed the former presence of nuclear missiles. In a cramped room surrounded
		    by dials, switches and buttons, Park Ranger Tom Minton explains the choice a
	    battery commander would face if an enemy bomber violated US airspace: </p>
	    <p class="BlockQuote">[At] the moment of readiness he would throw the switch and
		    release the warhead. [The] Missile would be on its way down range, and... when the interception clock clicked to zero you would throw
		    this switch here, manually detonating a nuclear warhead over American home
	    soil.</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="warren_fig_8.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="500" height="377" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 8: At Sandy Hook, Park Ranger Tom Minton shows the room
	    where Army soldiers could have launched a nuclear attack</p>
	    <p>One video featured a team of &lsquo;citizen scientists,&rsquo; led by
		    Professor Russell Burke of Hofstra University, monitoring
		    diamondback terrapins at Jamaica Bay. Shannon Ronquillo,
		    a high school student and NPS volunteer, noted her surprise that a natural area
		    like Jamaica Bay could exist in the boroughs of New York City. &ldquo;Once you enter
		    this place it&rsquo;s like - it&rsquo;s like you forget... that right over there is
	    Manhattan, you just forget. It looks like you&rsquo;re somewhere else.&rdquo; </p>
	    <p>Over 40 hours of filming took place - enough material that
		    an extra video was added to the project, bringing the total to 12. As filming
		    progressed, some sites added employees to be interviewed. The result was a
		    richer, denser narrative, but it also added to the overall cost of filming,
		    transcribing and editing. This heterogeneous voice followed the documentary
		    tradition more than the campfire talk tradition, where one speaker is generally
		    the &lsquo;expert&rsquo;. Gloria C.A. Lee, a young park ranger, was chosen as &lsquo;host&rsquo; of the
		    series, welcoming visitors to New York&rsquo;s National Parks. Her deft mix of
	    friendliness and expertise set the tone perfectly. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="warren_fig_9.jpg" alt="Figure 9" width="500" height="376" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 9: Park Ranger Gloria C.A. Lee welcomes virtual
	    visitors to the video series &ldquo;National Parks in Your Pocket&rdquo;</p>
	    <p>By mid-September, all twelve videos had passed from rough
		    cut to review process to final cut. The voice of the NPS was unmistakable,
		    delivered by uniformed park rangers and volunteers as in a traditional campfire
		    program. But Ducat&rsquo;s editing choices shaped the raw footage into coherent,
		    unified narratives. While the final products may look like a well-made NPS
		    production, they were in fact collaborative creations between NPS staff,
	    partners and volunteers on the one hand and Ducat, her cameraman David Gaynes and video editor Michael Culyba on the other. </p>
	    <p>But will these videos appeal to young people? It is too
		    soon to tell, and it will be difficult to tell. Currently, the NPS can track
		    hits on Windows Media video files (.WMV) but not Quicktime (.MOV) or other formats. The videos included many young faces, but lacked prior
		    input from young people. If time had permitted, a focus group of teens and
		    young adults might have offered helpful suggestions. But anything created by
		    the NPS must also be consistent with its established identity. Museums of
		    modern art can splash pinks and oranges throughout their Web sites because
		    modern art itself uses these colors. If the NPS traded its earth tones for electric
		    blue and hot pink it would seem inauthentic, even condescending, to the
	    audience we hope to attract.</p>
	    <p>For the NPS, video podcasts and having an engaging Web
		    presence are necessary steps in bringing our resources and our stories to new
		    audiences. But if the Web is indeed a cool medium, then content alone cannot
		    make a virtual visitor warm towards a National Park. For a generation that
		    writes blogs, uploads photos and meets new friends via social networking sites,
		    passive content will not be enough to engage them. To approach the excitement
		    of a campfire program, park Web sites must also engage visitors actively, in
	    real time, with real people.</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="warren_fig_10.jpg" alt="figure 10" width="500" height="375" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 10: Liz Reif, graduate
		    student at Hofstra University, points out swimming
	    terrapins to high school student Shannon Ronquillo</p>
	    <h2>Towards a &lsquo;Virtual Campfire&rsquo;</h2>
	    <p>Nothing will replace visiting a real park in the flesh.
		    The screen simply cannot convey the depth of the Grand Canyon, the rugged
		    heights of the Rocky Mountains or the solemnity of the battlefield at
		    Gettysburg. On-line experiences can engage virtual visitors in active
		    participation. A video podcast will never feel like hiking a mountain trail or
	    seining in the Atlantic, but it can take you to these pristine places.</p>
	    <p>The NPS can draw upon lessons learned in both video
		    projects. The work by Ducat Media sets a high standard for the technical
		    quality of new video podcasts. Now, NPS employees will have the much harder
		    task of learning how to create similar results. Ducat&rsquo;s documentary style can
		    also guide NPS podcasts away from the hegemony of the lone expert toward a more
		    inclusive approach, with multiple voices and opinions. College students or
		    community members can make their own videos, combining the content knowledge of
		    park rangers with input from park volunteers and users. Media projects using
		    the documentary approach can create much more than Web content; they can build
	    bridges between local NPS sites and their neighbors.</p>
	    <p>The Save Our History&trade; project holds even more potential to
		    share our knowledge and authority, our meaning making, with others.
		    Partnerships with schools and students take a great deal of care and attention
		    - they are not ways to accomplish tasks quickly - but the payoff is enhanced
		    community involvement, more provocative interpretation and, ultimately, stewardship
	    of these resources by the next generation.</p>
	    <p>At the virtual campfire, visitors will do more than sit on
		    benches and warm themselves. They will gather the fuel,
		    select the songs and sing in harmony. The NPS, like museums in general, must
		    find ways to create unique experiences on-line, foster live interaction with
		    and among visitors, allow visitors to contribute content and to meet each other
	    in a safe virtual gathering space. Kelly (2008) observes:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuote">We are becoming people of the screen... On the screen, the
		    subjective again trumps the objective. The past is a rush of data streams cut
		    and rearranged into a new mashup, while truth is
		    something you assemble yourself on your own screen as you jump from link to
	    link.</p>
	    <p>As we shift &ldquo;from book fluency to screen fluency, from
		    literacy to visuality,&rdquo; the viewer is no longer a
		    passive consumer of content but an active participant in content
		    reorganization. Creating content in a visual format is an important first step
		    to attract a new generation. The next step requires museums to empower their
	    audiences more than ever. Museums and parks alike </p>
	    <p class="BlockQuote">could use social media to create or improve popular
		    knowledge-sharing networks, in which cultural participants share images,
		    information, and experiences through communities. By promoting user-generated
		    content, museums could enable cultural participants to be both critics and creators
	    of digital culture. (Russo, Watkins, Kelly and Chan, 2008)</p>
	    <p>Museums are not classrooms in the traditional mode;
		    visitors, in the flesh or on-line, are not students seated in rows. Visitors
		    create their own interpretive &ldquo;mashup&rdquo; based on the
		    content museums offer. John Falk (2006) warns us that museums should not ignore
	    this </p>
	    <p class="BlockQuote">out of fear of being unable to
		    control the results.... Such action (or inaction) ignores the human realities
		    of how meaning is constructed and how museums currently are used by the public
	    to support personal growth and development.</p>
	    <p>This will challenge both the traditions of the NPS and its
		    circumspection as an agency. At this writing, NPS Web sites do not have blogs
		    where the public can ask questions or make comments. Employees cannot access
		    blogs on their work computers, nor social networking sites, not even YouTube.
		    The NPS has a lot to learn technologically, but learning new skills in the name
	    of constructivist pedagogy is truly daunting.</p>
	    <p>Paradoxically, the traditions of our campfire programs can
		    help the agency as it embraces new technologies and new interpretive
		    approaches. What made the campfire program so joyful, so memorable? Ultimately,
		    it was not the campfire itself, nor the ranger&rsquo;s ability to entertain a willing
		    audience. Visitors attend campfire programs because they want a unique social
		    experience and because they trust the Park Ranger&rsquo;s knowledge of the resource.
		    NPS expertise and visitor interest come together to create a social gathering
		    space, where visitors can meet, ask questions and share their knowledge and
	    experiences. </p>
	    <p>Bruce McHenry, a retired regional chief of interpretation whose
		    father gave campfire talks in the 1930s at the Grand Canyon and Rock Creek Park,
		    has thought his entire life about how parks can engage with citizens. He views
		    new technology as an extension of NPS traditions and methods. &ldquo;The computer,&rdquo;
	      he states confidently, &ldquo;is the campfire of today.&rdquo; It is up to NPS employees to
	    light that fire.</p>
