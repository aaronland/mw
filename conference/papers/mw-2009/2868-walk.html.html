    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p class="" align="left" style='
text-align:left'>While SaaS
        and Open APIs are not necessarily intrinsically connected, they have much in
        common and are two important aspects of what we might call <i>cloud services</i>. All of these newly fashionable concepts are
        currently subject to a degree of marketing hype, with service providers and
        pundits alike jockeying to introduce variations on these themes. Some examples
        would include, <i>platform as a service
          (PaaS), data as a service (DaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), cloud
          computing, cloud storage</i> and so on. The extent of this proliferation can be
        seen in Peter Laird&rsquo;s Cloudmap.&nbsp; It
        is worth visiting his accompanying blog post (Laird 2008) for more information
      and links to all of the services mentioned on the map. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a><a href="walk-fig1.html"><img src="walk.fig1-w.png" alt="figure 1" width="500" height="455" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: Peter Laird&rsquo;s&nbsp; &lsquo;Cloud Map&rsquo; <a href="../http://saaslink.googlepages.com/Laird_CloudMap_Sept2008.png">http://saaslink.googlepages.com/Laird_CloudMap_Sept2008.png</a></p>
      <p>Inevitably,
        this does involve a certain amount of re-selling of old ideas. Nonetheless, the
        increasing viability of the Web to offer a platform for service development and
      delivery cannot be ignored.</p>
      <p>An
        important difference is revealed in the fact that the functionality offered by
        many SaaS services can be subject to frequent change. Although not true of all
        SaaS, the perpetual beta approach (which I examine in a later section) is
        increasingly used to deliver a steady stream of improvements and new features.
        This can be contrasted with APIs which, by their very nature, are not changed
        frequently or, indeed, lightly. In fact, as we shall see, there are systems
      which already depend on the availability and <i>predictability</i> of APIs on the Web.</p>
      <h2>Software As A Service</h2>
      <p><i>Software as a Service</i> (SaaS) is not a new idea. The
        notion of the <i>Application Programming
          Interface</i> (API) is, arguably, even older. Yet these two terms have sprung
        into, if not the mainstream, then at least increasingly common and widespread
        usage. A third term, <i>The Cloud</i>, is
        frequently used in the same contexts and, as a concept, may serve to unite
      them.</p>
      <p>In its
        simplest sense, SaaS describes a software delivery model. Rather than
        delivering the software in a packaged form for the user to install and run locally,
        the vendor deploys the software on a controlled platform, and the user accesses
        its functionality remotely via a network connection.&nbsp; In the typical case the vendor deploys and maintains a
        single instance of the software which is accessed by many users, an
      architecture which is known as <i>multitenancy</i>. </p>
      <p>In the
        currently fashionable sense of SaaS, some generalities are made more specific.
        For example, the network is the Internet and, furthermore, in the great
        majority of cases implies the Web. The contemporary usage of SaaS frequently,
        but certainly not always, implies that the user is armed with nothing more than
        a standard desktop-based Web-browser, although in the last year particularly
        this implication has been challenged more frequently with increasing interest
        in the idea of the rich-Internet-application (RIA) and the new generation of
        rich mobile software found on such devices as Apple&rsquo;s iPhone and phones running
      Google&rsquo;s Android operating system.</p>
      <p>Some
        notable examples of contemporary SaaS providers include SalesForce.com (<a
href="../http://www.salesforce.com/">http://www.salesforce.com</a>), which offers a comprehensive
        suite of &lsquo;customer-relationship-management&rsquo; tools, and Google, which offers a
        set of set of collaborative productivity tools called Google Docs
      (<a href="../http://docs.google.com/">http://docs.google.com/</a>).</p>
      <h2>Application Programming
      Interfaces And The &lsquo;Open API&rsquo;</h2>
      <p>The
        concept of the API has its origins in the development of <i>modular</i> programming environments and languages. Modularity of
        programming environments has allowed developers to exploit the concept of <i>encapsulation</i>, where a computer program
        is divided into self-contained modules each handling a discrete function, or
        set of functions. Such modules are often described with the <i>black box</i> metaphor, indicating that they
        can operate while being opaque to the system which uses them. The essential
        characteristic of such modules is that they explicitly define their allowed <i>inputs</i> and their possible <i>outputs</i>. If you understand what kind of
        data (if any) you can feed into the module, and what kind of data (if any) you
        expect to get back, then you should be able to use the module with confidence,
        without needing to understand how it works internally. This opaque boundary
        between the internal workings of the module and the system or agent which seeks
        to use it, together with any mechanism or documentation which aid the
        understanding and exploitation of the module, is what constitutes the
        application programming interface or API. As the development of this approach
        to software development has matured, the use of encapsulation and
        well-described, predictable interfaces has been extended to the development of <i>components</i> distributed across a network,
        and hence to the concept of the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), which
        describes how <i>services</i> can be invoked
      and exploited via documented interfaces.</p>
      <p>In recent
        years the Web has come to be recognised more as a platform upon which
        applications can be developed, driving much of the development behind the &lsquo;Web
        2.0&rdquo; phenomenon. From a traditional programming point of view the Web, when
        compared to a local operating system, is a relatively limited platform for
        developing software, yet its ubiquity, scale, proven resilience and <i>openness</i> are very attractive features.
        The notion of the API has been adopted as an integral part of the Web 2.0
        paradigm, underpinning especially the fashion for a type of point-to-point
        service integration known as the <i>mashup</i>.
        Because the Web essentially constrains much of the interaction between servers,
        clients and users through its reliance on open standards and protocols, a large
        part of what might be considered part of the API is pre-determined. To give the
        obvious example, the great majority of services which expose an API on the Web
        will expect it to be accessed via the HTTP protocol. The maturity and ubiquity
        of HTTP allows the average Web API to be primarily concerned with the naming of
        resources or functions, and the format and structure of data. In the world of
        Web 2.0 mashups, the great majority of APIs give access to data-centric
        services. It would appear, on the face of it, that there is a resonance with
        Museums which typically have structured data, or metadata, which is is of
      interest to others.</p>
      <p>The term <i>open API</i>, while gaining some currency,
        might be considered a fairly poor one. APIs are, essentially, open by
        definition &ndash; we might better call them &lsquo;Web APIs&rsquo;. However, the use of &lsquo;open&rsquo;
        in the Web context emphasises the point that the Web service in question offers
        some functionality which can be directly exploited by remote, third-party
        software. In most cases it implies that the data entities underlying the Web
      site can be accessed as structured data suitable for use in another system.</p>
      <p>Some good
        examples of Open APIs of this sort on the Web include the API to Flickr
        (<a href="../http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">http://www.flickr.com/services/api/</a>) and that of Twitter (<a
href="../http://apiwiki.twitter.com/">http://apiwiki.twitter.com</a>). Both of these are popular Web 2.0
        services, each with a well documented API which is freely available for
      non-commercial use.</p>
      <h2>The Case For Using SaaS</h2>
      <h3>Core and chore services</h3>
      <p>Harrison
        (2008) used the terms <i>core</i> and <i>chore</i> to differentiate between types of
        IT services managed within an organisation &ndash; a university in his case. Core
        activities or services are those which are part of the business <i>focus</i> of the organisation. Core services
        are where the organisation puts most of its creative energy and are often
        related to those areas in which the organisation competes with others. In a
        museum context, IT services related to the curation of collections, marketing,
        and event management might be examples of core services. Chore services, on the
        other hand, are those which the organisation is simply obliged to provide.&nbsp; Many examples of this kind of IT
        service are common to most organisations; examples include payroll and finance
        systems, Web hosting, and the provision of &lsquo;office&rsquo; tools to staff. Generally,
        the organisation&rsquo;s priority in the provision of chore services is to seek to
        improve efficiency and reduce cost. In terms of budget and resource allocation,
        the organisation typically wants to invest more in core services, and
      correspondingly less in chore services.</p>
      <h3>Outsourcing IT, and paying for what you use</h3>
      <p>The SaaS
        model of software deployment and service delivery introduces a new opportunity
        for the organisation to out-source core services. SaaS and core services might
        fit naturally together because the service provider gains from delivering
        services to the widest possible user-base, while the service consumer is
      happier to outsource those services which are not its business focus. </p>
      <p>The
        removal of the need for users to deploy, secure, upgrade and maintain complex
        systems on their own infrastructure can be a significant benefit. Beyond this,
        even the <i>possibility</i> of using
        powerful and &lsquo;expensive&rsquo; software may be something which an SaaS model can
        provide to cash-strapped organisations which might otherwise not be able to
        afford such software in a more traditional packaged form. A significant
        difference between purchasing &lsquo;off-the-shelf&rsquo; software and SaaS is that the
        latter introduces the possibility of a &lsquo;pay-as-you-go&rsquo; model of payment:
        essentially, software can be <i>leased</i> instead of paid for as a straightforward purchase. In terms of budget planning,
        the reduced need for up-front investment in infrastructure (servers and more
        powerful PCs) coupled with the lack of a single large payment for software
        means that the cost of some IT services is no longer classed as capital
        expenditure, but becomes part of the organisation&rsquo;s operational costs. This can
      have an impact in simplifying financial planning for the organisation.</p>
      <h3>Perpetual beta</h3>
      <p>The
        concept of the &lsquo;perpetual beta&rsquo; level of service has become almost synonymous
        with Web 2.0 services, and is an aspect of much of contemporary SaaS. With this
        usage, the meaning of &lsquo;beta&rsquo; has shifted slightly. When applied to traditional
        packaged software it means that the software is unfinished and still being
        developed &ndash; that it still contains bugs but that it is stable enough to use to
        some extent. Such software would tend to be released, at no cost, to a limited
        group of users with the expectation that they will find and report problems
        with it to the supplier. The use of beta in the context of Web-based SaaS
        implies that the software is subject to continuous change and improvement. A
        certain degree of stability is expected and implied, but the service provider
      might reserve the right to add or remove features.</p>
      <p>The
        ability of SaaS to operate in a perpetual beta mode has ushered in a new model
        of software upgrade. Rather than the periodic deployment of <i>patches</i> and new versions of software -
        occasioning an often disruptive process of upgrading local systems &ndash; the SaaS
        model allows for the software to be updated with little or no disruption to the
        user. This also means that updates can be applied more frequently. If a problem
      is uncovered in the software, it can be fixed <i>in situ</i> &ndash; and all users gain the benefit of this fix.</p>
      <h3>Infrastructure as a Service</h3>
      <p>Many of what
        we might characterise as chore services in IT provision relate to
        infrastructure, including such services as data storage and Web service
        hosting. In the last 2-3 years a new form of SaaS has emerged offering
        infrastructural, rather than user-facing, services, which are becoming known as
        IaaS. Probably the most prominent vendor of IaaS and one of the first to offer
        such services is Amazon. Amazon offers a number of infrastructure services -
        prominent among these are its remote data storage service, S3, and its remote
        server deployment service, EC2. The S3 service allows the user to store and
        make available data on Amazon&rsquo;s infrastructure. For example, a museum can elect
        to store digital photographs of its collections on this service. These are then
        made available in a standard way through the Web. The museum pays for this
        service in a very simple variable cost model, paying only for the storage space
        and the bandwidth it uses. If it needs more space for a new collection, this
        can be made available immediately. Amazon provides a highly resilient service,
      and additionally offers options for backing up data.</p>
      <p>While the
        procurement of storage technology is not especially expensive at the outset,
        its maintenance can be costly, and it will need frequent replacement as well
        as, inevitably, expansion. With the use of a service such as S3, this upgrading
        becomes significantly easier to deal with as much of the management burden is
        adopted by the service provider. S3 has proven its reliability as an
        infrastructure service and now underpins a number of very popular Web 2.0
      services.</p>
      <p>With the
        subsequent introduction of its EC2 service, Amazon rounded out its offering by
        providing the platform to deploy software as well as data. EC2 allows the user
        to forsake &nbsp;local hardware
        (especially servers), and to deploy software on one or more <i>virtual servers</i> running on Amazon&rsquo;s
        infrastructure. There are a number of immediate potential benefits to this
        arrangement. The payment model for this service is very simple and <i>linear</i> according to use, so what can be
        a considerable capital expenditure (buying, configuring, maintaining and
        upgrading servers) can become a simple, recurring, operational cost. When more
        capacity is need, the service can be <i>scaled-out</i> (adding more virtual servers) easily and rapidly. Similarly, capacity can be
        reduced, perhaps when a service is retired, resulting in an immediate
        cost-reduction. EC2 is built upon S3, so the two services complement each other
      well.</p>
      <p>In the
        UK, museums are often obliged to rely on the provision of IT services and
        resources by local government authorities. This level of infrastructure is
        rarely large enough to exploit the sorts of economies of scale available to
        Amazon, and it lacks the levels of control and flexibility which come from
        dedicated, local deployment. The potential benefits to be realised by utilising
        infrastructure &lsquo;in the cloud&rsquo; will undoubtedly become increasingly interesting
      and attractive to museum management.</p>
      <h2>The Case for Providing
      Open APIs</h2>
      <h3>&ldquo;The coolest thing to do with your data will be thought of by someone else.&rdquo;</h3>
      <p>This
        statement, attributed to Rufus Pollack (Walk 2008/07/23), is a provocative
        challenge to the established approach to data management. Until recently the
        effort involved in making data available to interested third-parties could be
        considerable as, unless the raw data was packaged up in some way and delivered,
        it would have to be processed and delivered through an application. In this
        sense, even a simple Web site is an application constituting some simple
        functionality (navigation, search etc.) built upon data. Without the
        expectation of some sort of return on this investment, the cost can be
        prohibitive. Applications, like Web sites, must be designed according to
        specific requirements or their value is considerably reduced; this means that
        those requirements need to be understood in advance. Different users may have
        different requirements and so a trade-off between general usefulness and
      specific utility is inevitable.</p>
      <p>However,
        recent interest in making data available on the Web in a structured and open
        way introduces the possibility of a new way of thinking. Rather than trying to
        predict every possible use of your data, and building, or more likely <i>failing</i> to build, applications and
        services to facilitate this, an alternative approach is to accept that it is
        entirely possible some other party might find an interesting use for your data
        &ndash; even one which has never occurred to you. In terms of technical difficulty,
        the barrier to exposing data on the Web in such a way that it can be used by
        others is being lowered steadily. The widespread adoption of a few standard
        technologies, such as XML and JSON, for encoding and exchanging data, together
        with the ubiquitous HTTP, has played an important role in accelerating the development
        of software to process data described in this fashion. The mashup phenomenon is
      largely founded on these three technologies.</p>
      <p>A recent
        attempt to accelerate the development of this approach in the museums sector
        can be seen in <i>hoard.it</i> (<a href="../http://feeds.boxuk.com/museums/">http://feeds.boxuk.com/museums/</a>),
        a Web service which extracts collection data from museums&rsquo; Web sites using a
        process known as &lsquo;screen-scraping&rsquo;. Screen-scraping is an approach which
        attempts to extract semantics from (often loosely) structured Web pages.
        Crucially, the use of such a technique implies a lack of commitment by those
        managing the source Web page to maintaining the page in such a way that the
        screen-scraping approach will continue to work into the future. While
        screen-scraping can be effective, it is also time-consuming to develop and <i>brittle</i> in the sense that this approach
      can be broken by a simple change to the source Web page.</p>
      <p>There is,
        therefore, a case to be made for designing Web services around APIs, with a
        view to exposing those APIs so that others may build more services.
        Notwithstanding the local value of designing a system using the principles of
        encapsulation afforded by APIs, there is also the potential benefit arising
        from a third-party&rsquo;s use of these APIs. Another, more business-oriented way of
        looking at it is to view this approach as a &lsquo;loss leader&rsquo; &ndash; an investment which
        creates the conditions for possible future return on that investment. For a
        museum, that &lsquo;return&rsquo; might be a partnership with another cultural-heritage
        organisation, or an exciting combination of its collections data with some
        other data-source, creating value for all. It might simply be more exposure for
        its data, increasing awareness of the value of the museum&rsquo;s collections. The
      creators of hoard.it express this idea thus:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">The
        aim is that by syndicating your content out in a re-usable manner, whilst still
        retaining information about its source, an increasing number of third-party
        applications can be built on this data, each addressing specific user needs. As
        these applications become widely used, they drive traffic to your site that you
        otherwise wouldn't have received: &quot;Not everyone who should be looking at
        collections data knows that they should be looking at collections data&quot;.
      (Ellis, M 2008)</p>
      <h2>Risks and Issues</h2>
      <p>Neither a
        move to reliance on SaaS solutions nor the opening up of data through Web APIs is
        without risks. In both cases, most issues arise from a real, or perceived, loss
      of immediate control.</p>
      <h3>Increased dependance on the software supplier</h3>
      <p>When
        purchasing software of any kind, it makes sense to make some appraisal of the
        supplier as software needs to be supported. Such dependance on a supplier
        carries a risk. For many years, one approach to mitigating this risk has been
        to use open-source-software (OSS). Especially when software was backed by a
        healthy development community, the risk of sudden loss of support of OSS is
        considerably less than it is with closed, proprietary software. However, a move
        to the SaaS model generally means a step back to using closed, proprietary
        software. It is interesting to note that, as reported by Johnson (2008), GNU
        creator and Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman considers &lsquo;cloud
        computing&rsquo; to be &ldquo;simply a trap aimed at forcing more people to buy into
      locked, proprietary systems that would cost them more and more over time&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>With
        SaaS, there is a real risk of the software,s being suddenly withdrawn. This can
        happen for two reasons: the supplier decides to stop providing the software, or
        the supplier itself stops trading. While the size of the supplier can be a
        factor in deciding its stability as a business, it appears to be no indicator
        of its likelihood to maintain particular services. Google is clearly a very
        large company, yet it has recently announced the end of a handful of its
        services, including <i>Jaiku, Google Video</i> and <i>Google Notebook</i> (Needleman, 2009),
        as it rationalises its portfolio. Customers of these services will be given a
        period of notice in which to consider their options and, if possible, extract
        their data so that they can import it into an alternative system. Such a
        migration of data, assuming it is even possible, can be costly and
      time-consuming. </p>
      <h3>Service level agreements</h3>
      <p>The
        service level agreement (SLA) is an arrangement which gives reassurance about
        the level of service being offered, and a route for redress should this level
        not be met. SLAs are frequently encountered in the case of remote Web-hosting,
        with hosting companies offering quantified assurances of &lsquo;99.9%&rsquo; availability
        of your data. Such SLAs can be reasonably effective in providing a mechanism
        for risk management when using remote services. However, in the case of data
        hosting, and especially archiving, such quantified guarantees are less
        effective. After all, who would be reassured to be told that &ldquo;we guarantee not
        to lose 99.9% of your data &ndash; we might lose the odd byte or two but we&rsquo;ll
      compensate you for that if it happens&rdquo;?</p>
      <h3>Data privacy</h3>
      <p>In cases
        where data is not &lsquo;public&rsquo; or open access, remote hosting introduces risks
        associated with entrusting sensitive data with third parties. Aside from the
        question of the degree to which a consumer can trust an SaaS provider, the
        variety in international law around data privacy is an important factor. As a
        specific example, in the United States the <i>Patriot
          Act</i> gives the US Government the right, under certain conditions, to access
        data held by private businesses. If an organisation based in the UK uses a
        remote data storage service provided in the US, then its data is subject to the
        Patriot Act. Recognising that there are genuine concerns about this, Amazon, a
        US company, has opened data-centres in other countries, including some in the
        European Union. Customers of the S3 data-storage service can now choose where,
        in a geographical sense, they want their data to be stored &ndash; effectively
      selecting the jurisdiction which will apply to it.</p>
      <h3>Distributed services &ndash; chaining responsibilities</h3>
      <p>Lamport
        (1987) said, &ldquo;A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer
      you didn't even know existed can render your own computer unusable.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Bearing
        in mind that this statement was made several years before the Web was even
        established, Steve (2006), in a post about Google&rsquo;s sudden removal of its SOAP
        API to its search engine, proposed updating it to, &ldquo;You know you have a
        distributed system, when a company you didn't know you had a relationship
      [with] changes their business plan and your application stops working&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>As we
        have identified, there are risks associated with even the relatively simple
        SaaS relationship of consumer and service-supplier. However, as the viability
        of using remote services and data is increasingly recognised, we can expect to
        see such relationships become more complex and, crucially, to involve <i>more parties</i>. If it is not a trivial
        task to establish a relationship of trust between supplier and consumer, how
        difficult will it become if the supplier is also a consumer of a second
        supplier, and so on? Those percentage-based SLAs start to become very difficult
        to calculate once there is a chain of dependency. There are signs of this issue
        already starting to affect services on the Web. On the 15th February, 2008,
        Amazon&rsquo;s various infrastructure services suffered major problems resulting in
        them being off-line for a period. One service which uses S3 is Twitter, a
        Web-based communications tool growing in popularity.&nbsp; Twitter was therefore adversely affected by the problems
        with S3. However, there is already an ecosystem of tools and services which add
        value to the Twitter service. Stone (2007) claims that the Twitter API has in
        order of magnitude more traffic than Twitter&rsquo;s own Web site. So a very
        significant number of people using a multitude of mainly unrelated tools and
      services were affected by the problems with S3.</p>
      <p>It is an
        article of faith that <i>all</i> software
        systems will fail at some point. No one system should be singled out just
        because it has not maintained perfect reliability. But an increasingly
        distributed system like this clearly requires new models of risk assessment and
      management.</p>
      <h3>Being open &ndash; managing usage</h3>
      <p>An
        obvious risk with providing open APIs to data services is the possibility of
        increased demand for those services. Predicting future demand, with a view to
        planning capital investment in new hardware, for example, is difficult if a
        strategy of &lsquo;open up and see what happens&rsquo; is adopted. The supplier of data
        through open APIs also needs to know something about who is using the data and
        for what purpose. In the case of a museum, it may well need to justify the
        expense of maintaining such data services. A popular approach to managing this
        issue with Web 2.0 services is to issue an API &lsquo;key&rsquo; to prospective users. This
        has the effect of establishing a more explicit relationship between supplier
        and consumer, and allows the supplier to manage usage and load on the system.
        In the event of some sort of abuse of the service, an API key can be rescinded.
      Strategies of throttling bandwidth usage of APIs are common also.</p>
      <h3>Recession</h3>
      <p>While we
        have already briefly covered the risk of reliance on a supplier (and the
        suppliers it depends on too) for services, we should note that the risk of
        suppliers disappearing suddenly is increased in a time of global economic
        recession. In August 2008, just as the current recession was starting to look
      like a certainty, I suggested that:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">...the vast majority of Web 2.0 companies are a
        fraction of the size of Google. As it is, many Web 2.0 services appear to exist
        with no visible means of support, other than venture capital. I imagine that
        venture capital can become harder to find in a period of economic down-turn.
        Much Web 2.0 service delivery is supported through an advertising model,
        relying on a revenue stream coming from a small percentage of advertisements
        &lsquo;clicked&rsquo; on. Again, perhaps people are less likely to respond to
      advertisements in a recession&hellip;.? (Walk 2008/08/17)</p>
      <p>Recession
        will affect museums like any other organisation or business. It may be that
        budgetary pressures force the issue &ndash; that such risks are worth taking for the
        potential costs saved. This in turn may help to preserve certain SaaS suppliers
        from business failure. Massie (2009) suggests that &ldquo;SaaS vendors cannot be
        considered &lsquo;recession-proof&rsquo;.&nbsp; Perhaps &lsquo;recession-resistant&rsquo; would be more
        accurate&rdquo;, pointing out that SaaS suppliers are vulnerable to a sudden loss of
      customers in a way that packaged software vendors are not.</p>
      <h2>Why This Is Only the
      Beginning</h2>
      <p>Clearly, over
        the last several years there has been an explosion of Web-based functionality,
        loosely characterised as Web 2.0. Initially operating at the veneer of
        dedicated user-interfaces, Web 2.0 has increasingly come to depend on open
        APIs. These APIs are allowing a <i>convergence</i> between the Web, the users and the many different devices they might use. A
        quick check on Apple&rsquo;s iTunes application store reveals more than thirty iPhone
      applications which make some use of the Twitter API.</p>
      <p>The new
        Web-based SaaS model needs time to mature, and it will be fascinating to
        observe how SaaS and Web APIs develop over the next few years. If these models
        survive the expected economic climate, then it may well provide the crucible
      from which they emerge thoroughly tested and stronger than before.</p>
      <p>We have
      been in a similar situation before:</p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">Once we got past the recession at the end of the <a
href="../http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">dot-com bubble</a> in the first
        years of this century, the notion of an open-source operating system had
        reached a level of sufficient maturity for it to enter the mainstream. Web 2.0
        services and SaaS as a viable, mainstream approach will likely reach similar
      levels of maturity in time. (Walk 2008/08/17)</p>
