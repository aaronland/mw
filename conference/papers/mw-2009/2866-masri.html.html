        <p class="AbstractText">While there&rsquo;s been a lot of excitement about new
        audience-engaging technologies such as Flickr, YouTube, Facebook and
        SecondLife, most museums simply don&rsquo;t have the staffing or budgets to
      constantly create new sites, games and functionality. </p>
      <p class="AbstractText">However, many institutions DO have a wealth of legacy,
        evergreen content that is still popular but may not have aged gracefully in
        terms of browser compatibility, design and support of social networking
        features or multimedia. How do they keep them alive &ndash; and augment them &ndash; with
      the advent of new technologies, browsers and platforms?</p>
      <p class="AbstractText">All museums are looking for ways to stretch Web and
        marketing budgets as well as maximize staff time. By showcasing enhancements
        and upgrades to existing sites and functionality using tech tools that are
        readily available, easily implementable and free (or extremely inexpensive),
        museums of any size or focus can not only keep their existing content relevant,
      but also feature the latest and greatest without a complete site overhaul.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>To say that the rise of user-generated content and the
        social Web has been astronomical in the past several years would be an
      understatement.</p>
      <p>When Facebook, a site once dominated by teens and
        twenty-somethings, posts growth of 276% in the 35-54 year-old demographic in
        the six months from July 08 to Jan 09 (<a href="../http://www.istrategylabs.com/">http://www.iStrategyLabs.com</a>), it is
        clear there has been a broad and permanent shift in the activities of on-line
        denizens. From blogs, podcasts and wikis to rating/ranking features, sharing
        tools like deli.cio.us and Digg, as well as ubiquitous news feeds and Twitter,
        the Web has come alive with the push and pull of information &ndash; a two-way
      conversation that museums are beginning to embrace.</p>
      <p>Since Forrester Research first described &quot;Social
        Computing&quot; in 2006 as a groundswell of people using on-line tools and
        technologies to connect and create their own experiences (Li &amp; Bernoff,
        2008), user-generated content and social networking have evolved from an
        interactive phenomenon to a new world order for how to engage and connect with
      others on-line.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the look and feel of Web sites have had to
        keep pace not only with the technological demands of incorporating these
        interactive tools and functionality, but also with the need for graphical
        refreshes to continually keep the attention of an audience with billions of
      on-line options.</p>
      <p>Much like the rapid-fire growth of on-line tools, the
        shelf-life of Web site graphic design has also quickened. Long gone are the
        days when a Web site design could be launched and remain unchanged for five or
        six years and still be as effective as when first developed. Nor can it be
        expected that subsequent site redesigns can be superficial, such as updating a
      logo or updating home page imagery.</p>
      <p>Clearly, museums are dealing with an on-line world where
        users expect technological and design changes at a rapid pace. Whether or not
        your users even realize that they expect these things, the global competition
        on-line has created innate expectations for things that are fresh, new and
        different. And these users are no longer content to take the museum's
        interpretations as the sole source of their understanding &ndash; they want the same
        tools they see on other Web sites that allow them to comment, to share, to react
      and to be part of a more participatory experience with your institution.</p>
      <p>However, according to the latest survey of <span>Museum Financial Information by the American Association of
        Museums (Merrit, 2006)</span>, the average operating budget of a US museum is
        only $783,000. Comparatively, a site redesign with the integration of social
        networking tools and user-generated content features can often cost $75,000 or
        higher (the average comparable Web development budget from the authors' Web
        development studio, Bean Creative, from 2006 to 2008) &ndash; which is approximately
      10% of the average museum's operating budget.</p>
      <p>Combine this with the current global financial crisis and
        museums are facing the reality of making do with smaller budgets, minimal staff
        and fewer resources available as grant money, endowments and visitor
        contributions shrink. <span>T</span>he
        result is that a majority of institutions, regardless of size or budget, are
        struggling &ndash; and juggling &ndash; to meet internal operating demands as well as their
      public roles due to severely limited physical resources.</p>
      <p>Now more than ever, museums of all shapes and sizes need to
        have the ability to change the design and functionality of their Web sites
      without arduous and expensive undertakings, and without substantial staffing. </p>
      <h2>Current Problems</h2>
      <p>Museums are well aware that visitors of museum Web sites are
        no longer coming <i>only</i> to view images and curatorial notes pushed out by
        the institution. In the era of the participatory Web, museums cannot solely
        control the dialogue, but must instead offer additional avenues to make the
      collection relevant to visitors.</p>
      <p>Site visitors want to comment on and tag content, share
        collection imagery, download podcasts and peruse collection slideshows and
        videos. While the mindshift in museums' curatorial philosophies and approaches
        in light of these new functionalities is not the focus of this paper, the
      real-world Web ramifications of supporting these new directions are.</p>
      <p>It is therefore important to begin by understanding the
        challenges that museums face in implementing Web redesigns as well as adding
      community and social networking features for sites of the 21st century.</p>
      <p>Many museums do not have any dedicated in-house personnel
        devoted to working on their Web sites at all, so other staff &ndash; often with
        minimal or no Web or graphic design skills &ndash; are solicited to update&nbsp; sites. Other museums have a single
        Webmaster in charge of keeping content and collections up-do-date, but often
        those staff are either not comfortable with back-end Web coding to implement
        new site functionality or do not have graphic design skills necessary for
      redesigns.</p>
      <p>And still other museums <i>do</i> have IT staff with the
        technical know-how to incorporate social networking and user-generated content
        features, but must find the time to do so while managing the rest of their
        museums' technical needs, such as computer tech support, systems networking,
      kiosk and exhibit repair and maintenance of collections databases.</p>
      <p>If there are no in-house personnel to tap, that leaves
        museums to bring in outside vendors to handle site redesign and Web technology
      implementation, often at significant expense.</p>
      <h2>New Solutions</h2>
      <p>Luckily, the progression of technology integration on-line,
        as well as in Web design and development coding, has reached a confluence to
        accommodate more professional, do-it-yourself options that can be achieved with
        minimal time and budget impact. There are currently a dizzying array of free
        and minimal-cost tech options that make it easier to publish and allow interaction
        with any type of content including text, images, videos, podcasts and
      documents.</p>
      <p>The user-generated content movement started out on dedicated
        social media sites (such as MySpace, Friendster and Facebook), but has since
        fanned out to Web properties that include on-line retailers, major media
      destinations, portals and yes, museums.</p>
      <p>User-generated content and social networking tools have
        exploded in the past few years, with people creating and consuming
        user-generated content in record numbers. Their level of engagement is deep and
        broad, with participation rates of up to 62% in categories like customer
        reviews, and involvement in an ever-expanding range of on-line content that
        includes video, audio, personal profiles, avatars, photo sharing and encyclopedia
      entries (http://www.eMarketer.com).</p>
      <p>Several technologies and new methods for technology
        implementation have facilitated this era of more responsive and interactive
      design and functionality: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>CSS:
          Cascading Style Sheets</b> is a simple mechanism used to style documents
          written in HTML, XHTML and other markup languages. Using CSS, you can easily
          affect the look of&nbsp; fonts, colors,
          spacing and other design aspects of Web documents by separating document
          content (written in HTML or a similar markup language) from document
          presentation (written in CSS).<br />
          <br />
          Changing the font characteristics
        of a link in your site's CSS file, for example, will change the font of all
        links throughout your entire Web site. Thus, a cost-effective and quick
        redesign can be accomplished simply by making CSS changes in one file (or a
      small set of files) that then automatically update the rest of the site.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to allowing efficient
        redesigns, the separation of content from styling can also improve content
        accessibility and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content
      (such as by allowing for tableless Web design). <br />
        <br />
        Of particular interest to museums
        is that CSS can also allow the same markup page to be presented in different
        styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by text
        readers and on Braille-based, tactile devices. Indeed, CSS allows for stylistic
      redesigns that are truly far-reaching in scope and impact.</li>
        <li><b>AJAX:
          Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</b> is
          not a technology itself, but rather a term that describes an approach to
          using a number of existing technologies together, including HTML/ XHTML,
          Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and the XMLHttpRequest object. <br />
          <br />
          When these technologies are
        combined in the AJAX model, Web applications are able to make quick,
        incremental updates to the user interface without reloading the entire browser
        page (hence its &quot;asynchronous&quot; nature). This functionality makes the
        application faster and allows you to update portions of a page based upon user
      events. <br />
      <br />
      Now imagine your museum visitors
        able to search your collection and &ndash; right from the search results page &ndash; be
        able to view image and data about each artifact that overlay on top of the
        results page without having to navigate away to a new screen. AJAX drastically
        improves the user experience, and there are many third-party tools and features
      we'll discuss in more specifics shortly that tap into this power.</li>
        <li><b>There is a </b><b>definite march toward decentralization of computing</b>, as evidenced
          by the wide variety of external, third-party social networking tools that are
          now available at minimal or no cost for you for use in enhancing your site. <br />
          <br />
        Not only can you find everything
        from free blog software and sharing tools to RSS news feed services, but even
        Internet giants are joining in on the free bandwagon. Amazon products are
        readily and cheaply available (C2 for cloud computing/processing, S3 for
        storage, and SimpleDB for data) and of course, Google continues to provide a
      wide range of free interactive tools (Search, Analytics, Maps and Apps)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the past, it was common and usually necessary to keep
        your Web code in a walled garden, where everything was created, accessed and
        housed internally. Now, it is to your site's benefit to have a flexible and
        modular structure that can easily pull in data and functionality from third
        parties. Why reinvent the wheel when there is so much rich, vetted and
      fully-supported functionality free for the taking?</p>
      <h2>Opportunities for Enhancing Existing Content and Sites</h2>
      <p>Given the current state of Web technologies, tools and
        back-end coding functionality, there are three distinct areas that represent
        the greatest opportunity for museums to implement with ease and at no or low
      cost.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Graphic redesign </li>
        <li>Sharing tools for distributing content from your
          site </li>
        <li>User-generated content and community tools to
          allow your constituents to interact with your museum</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These three areas were chosen because the cost and
      implementation time versus impact ratio is exceptionally high.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Each of these areas will now be discussed in greater detail
        to showcase the impressive level of impact that can obtained with minimal
        effort or cost, as well as offer analysis of the best of the many free and low
      cost tools available.</p>
      <h2>Graphic Redesign Using CSS</h2>
      <p>In the early days of the Web, sites were typically
        hard-coded. Nearly all of the presentational attributes of HTML documents were
        contained within the HTML markup &ndash; all font colors, background styles, element
        alignments, link colors, tabled layouts, borders and sizes had to be explicitly
      described, often repeatedly, within the HTML, and within each page of the site. </p>
      <p>With the advent of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), much of
        that styling information is now removed from the individual pages and instead
        contained with a single document (or small subset of documents) that is
      referenced each time a Web page is rendered. </p>
      <p>As a striking example of what can be accomplished by
        updating a site stylesheet, compare these two Web sites in Figure 1 and Figure
        2. They are identical in content and code, but one has a stylesheet that
      completely alters the look and layout of content:</p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=none"><img src="masri.fig1.jpg" alt="figure 1" width="500" height="378" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: The home page of CSS Zen Garden with no stylesheet
      <a href="../http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=none">http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=none </a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/213/213.css&amp;page=0"><img src="masri.fig2.jpg" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="379" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 2: The exact same home page of CSS Zen Garden with a
      stylesheet applied <a href="../http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/213/213.css&amp;page=0">http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/213/213.css&amp;page=0</a></p>
      <p>Much like database-driven Web sites that pull page content
        from a back-end repository into a template when a page is clicked for viewing,
        CSS files house all the stylistic programming tags so that the presentation of
        content is separated from the structure (i.e. HTML markup) of the pages
      themselves.</p>
      <p>Since a single CSS file can define colors, fonts, text
        alignment, size, borders, spacing, layout and many other visual characteristics
        throughout a site, making changes to site-wide design attributes can be done
        quickly and efficiently instead of wading through each and every page of a site
      to edit. </p>
      <p>CSS can also provide graphical formatting for print-friendly
      pages and mobile devices, making it an extremely efficient styling method.</p>
      <p>In fact, the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), the
        international standards organization for the Internet, has embraced&nbsp; these considerable advantages of CSS
        for governing the graphic presentation of Web pages, and in 1999 deprecated the
        use of HTML markup to control the look and feel of Web sites (http://www.w3.org)<span>. Still, 10 years later, many sites fail to utilize this
      benefit.</span></p>
      <p><span>If your site has been built within
        the last five years, chances are that your site is CSS-based, and therefore
        suitable for this type of redesign. But it is </span>important to understand
        that not every site is a candidate for a redesign using this method. Some
        existing sites are so old and poorly constructed as to not really be viable for
      a purely CSS overhaul. </p>
      <p><span>The primary attributes required by
      a site to be effectively redesigned without touching the existing HTML are:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>An existing external stylesheet.</b> Without
          an external stylesheet to manipulate, a CSS redesign can be as complex as any
          other redesign.</li>
        <li><b>Few or no inline style attributes.</b> Anything hard-coded in the HTML &ndash; for example, font styles, alignments, image
          dimensions &ndash; cannot be over-ridden via CSS. Effective CSS moves background image
          calls, dimensions, borders and other presentation items completely to the
          stylesheet.</li>
        <li><b>A prevalence of styling hooks.</b> &ldquo;Hooks&rdquo; is
          the term used for IDs, classes, spans and other design attributes that allow
          you to target specific content when creating styles. Most older sites used
          unnamed tables to handle all sorts of layout needs, from the entire page to
          minimal details, meaning that each of these elements did not have any
          individual styling hook. Without any specific identifiers in the code for these
          tables, CSS treats them all the same, meaning that table-based layouts need to
          be reworked before the benefits of CSS can be gained. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>While the above list of attributes is <i>ideal</i> for a CSS
        redesign, a site that does not meet all the above criteria can still altered
        and improved using stylesheets, but will not be a complete departure from the original
      design as seen in the CSS examples in Figure 1 and Figure 2.</p>
      <h2>Content Sharing Tools</h2>
      <p>The sharing of text, images, services and other digital
        content as a way of communicating is growing in popularity, especially among
        the rapidly-expanding social networking segment. In August of 2008, researchers
        (comScore, 2008) estimated that social networking users comprised more than 65
      percent of the Web&rsquo;s 860 million unique monthly visitors. </p>
      <p>The wide variety of sharing services available provide
        museums with a comprehensive toolset to make any content &ndash; whether a Web page
        or a standalone application &ndash; easily sharable to other sites, a user&rsquo;s desktop
      or a mobile device. </p>
      <h3>RSS </h3>
      <p>RSS (Really Simple Syndication) has blossomed into the de
        facto protocol used by most Web sites as the means of distributing their news
        and information. According to the 2008 Google Zeitgerist report
        (http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/zeitgeist2008/mind.html), the fifth most
      searched &ldquo;what is&rdquo; question on Google was &ldquo;What is RSS?&ldquo; </p>
      <p>A recent Avenue A | Razorfish Digital Consumer Behavior
        Study (2008) found that 56% of consumers use RSS feeds, and that number is
      expected to grow.</p>
      <p>Through RSS, your audience can keep in touch with your
        institution on a regular basis by seeing your news feed on their mobile
      devices, computer desktop, Web home page and more.</p>
      <p>Clearly, there is a high demand among Web users to keep up-to-date
        on content of interest, whether that is exhibit information on a favorite artist,
        a recent curatorial blog post or a new podcast. Several free and robust RSS
      creation tools exist to dynamically create RSS for your Web site:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>FeedforAll</b> &ndash; <a href="../http://www.feedforall.com/">http://www.feedforall.com</a><br />
          An easy-to-use, desktop (PC/Mac) wizard
          walks novices through the process of creating, editing, managing and publishing
          RSS feeds. It supports unlimited feeds and can load and repair any existing
        feeds with ease for a one-time cost of $40.</li>
        <li><b>Ponyfish</b> &ndash; <a href="../http://www.ponyfish.com/">http://www.ponyfish.com<br />
        </a>This on-line tool just needs to be
          pointed to the Web page from which you want to create a feed, and requires only
          a few steps to set up which types of links you want to include in the feed. The
          resulting functionality pulls in links to relevant pages (as opposed to the
          actual content). Several free accounts are available, but additional premium
        services (like manual feed updating and link/title filtering) are only $60 a year.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><a href="../http://www.feedforall.com/#_blank"></a>Distribution </h3>
      <p>When you make content easy to share, more visitors are
        likely to do so. Articles, text, images, videos and audio can all be shared
        across blogs, social networks, e-mail, instant messaging or text messaging by
        rolling over a small graphical button. On rollover, the button expands to offer
        a large selection of distribution tools (Digg, Deli.cio.us, Reddit, Facebook,
        Technorati, etc.) and lets visitors import address books and friend lists to
      make it easy for them to bookmark and share your content with others.</p>
      <p>Sending your museum's content to social bookmarking services
        and social networks brings more traffic back to you and increases your link
      popularity for enhanced search engine rankings. </p>
      <p>Distribution tools are also extremely easy to install and
        provide tracking analytics to know where your museum content is going <span>across more than 80 social
      networking, blogging and bookmarking services<i>.</i></span> </p>
      <p>Some of the best free tools include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>AddThis</b>&nbsp; &ndash; <a href="../http://www.addthis.com/">http://www.addthis.com<br />
        </a>This popular bookmarking and
          sharing service, recently purchased by Clearspring <span>Technologies (a leading widget network), offers a
            free and easy-to-set-up sharing button and multiple language support, as well
        as tracking and analysis. </span></li>
        <li><b>ShareThis</b> &ndash; <a href="../http://sharethis.com/">http://sharethis.com<br />
        </a>This tool is a close competitor of
          AddThis, and features a free and simple one-page wizard that allows you to
          choose whatever &nbsp;services are
        available on-click. Analytics let you learn what people are sharing, and how.</li>
        <li><b>AddToAny</b> &ndash; <a href="../http://www.addtoany.com/">http://www.addtoany.com<br />
        </a>Like AddThis and ShareThis, this
          free button is customizable (and has a button pool in Flickr for other
          options), set-up is quick and intuitive with a guided wizard, and it interfaces
          with Google Analytics for stats tracking. The resulting two-in-one button
          offers both share/save/bookmark and subscribe options within the same on-screen
        button.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Widgets </h3>
      <p>A widget is a portable piece of code that brings in live
        content &ndash; advertisements, links, images, video or really anything you could see
        on the Web &ndash; from a third-party site without the Web site owner having to
      update or control the process manually.</p>
      <p>Instead of forcing users to share content by manually
        cutting and pasting HTML code into their Web pages, you can instead easily and
      quickly create a widget and give users simple tools to make sharing a breeze. </p>
      <p>Familiar Web widgets include event countdowns, auction tickers,
        stock market tickers, flight arrival information, daily weather and more. In
        the case of museums, widgets may take the form of events calendars, collections
      repositories and more.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Clearspring</b> &ndash; http://<a href="../http://www.clearspring.com/">http://www.clearspring.com<br />
        </a>In the world of widgets,
          Clearspring is a clear leader, as comScore (2008) reported 254
          million monthly unique viewers of Clearspring widgets, outdistancing its
          nearest competitor by 93 million visitors. Clearspring is widely credited for
          jump-starting the widget category by being first to introduce free click-to-share
        technology for making embeddable Web content portable. <br />
        <br />
        Their viral distribution enables
          Web widgets to be shared and distributed across over 80 blogging, social
          networking, and bookmarking services. Clearspring&rsquo;s analytics suite enables
        detailed tracking and analysis of widget activity and performance. </li>
        <li><b>Widgetbox</b> &ndash; <a href="../http://www.widgetbox.com/">http://www.widgetbox.com<br />
        </a>This site offers a user-friendly
          wizard to walk you through the creation and publishing process, and accepts
          everything from Flash, HTML and JavaScript to blogs and Google Gadgets. The
        tool is free to make and distribute widgets.</li>
        <li><b>Widgenie</b> &ndash; <a href="../http://www.widgenie.com/">http://www.widgenie.com<br />
        </a>This free tool provides widget
          creators with simple steps and tutorials to create widgets. Users can import
          data from Excel spreadsheets, CSV files and data feeds from Widgenie&rsquo;s partner
          sites. After the data is input, it can be customized via a drag-and-drop editor, giving you control over colors, size, headings and fonts.
        Additional customization is available for $50 a month.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Image Slideshows and Video</h3>
      <p>The ability to showcase museum collections, event
        happenings, tours of physical spaces and other important visual museum elements
        makes photos, imagery and video a key aspect for a successful and compelling
      Web site.</p>
      <p>Image and video management, storage and display can
        potentially be an arduous task for museum staff in addition to their other
        functions. Many museums already use external, third-party sites for hosting
        images (Flickr, Picasa, SnapFish) and videos (YouTube, Google Video, Yahoo!
        Video.) However, sending museum visitors to an external site is arguably less
        professional and clearly not branded to your institution. It also means
      visitors are exiting your site instead of being engaged within your parameters.</p>
      <p>There are several image and video-sharing Web sites that now
        offer the ability to create, customize and embed image slideshows and video
      directly within your Web site:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Flickr
          PictoBrowser</b> &ndash; <a href="../http://www.db798.com/pictobrowser/index.html">http://www.db798.com/pictobrowser/index.html</a><br />
        Flickr dominates the on-line world
          of photo sharing (http://www.alexa.com). The PictoBrowser is Flickr's free Web
          application that displays Flickr images and video on Web sites and blogs.
          Simply login to your Flickr account (or create a new one and upload images),
          then use a simple wizard to set, tag or group images as well as customize the
          look and functionality of your site to best suit your images and your Web
        site's design. <br />
        <br />
        Flickr will then generate HTML code
          for you to embed the PictoBrowser slideshow wherever you desire within your Web
          site. The free version allows for three albums, and for $25 a year you may have
        unlimited albums and collections. <br />
        <br />
        Pictobrowser has a interactive
          AJAX Organizer for organizing the images, and lets you add or modify, tag
          pictures, share your images with your groups, add geo-location tags for the
          images, edit the permission and captions for the images and do minor editing
        like rotating. <br />
        <br />
        You can alter the layout of the
          pages to a certain extent with pre-designed layouts (four layouts for the free
          version and six layouts for the paid version). The slideshow is displayed via
          Flash, and users can also subscribe to the RSS feed of your comments. Visitors
        need to be registered to post comments.<br />
        <br />
        There is a 100MB upload limit per
        month, with a limit of 200 images (5 MB each).<br />
        <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>Picasa</b> &ndash; <a href="../http://picasaweb.google.com/">http://picasaweb.google.com</a> <br />
        This Google-owned property is not
          as popular as Flickr, but offers many of the same benefits. It requires a free
        software download to use the tool.<br />
        <br />
        Once you upload images and videos
          to create slideshows (with features like image organization, cropping and image
          editing), you can also choose your settings (such as image size, captions, and
        autoplay) and copy the resulting HTML code into your Web site.<br />
        <br />
The downside is that you cannot
          customize the look of your Picasa albums to match your site. Picasa also offers
          paid options ($25 a year) that up the storage capacity from 1GB to 7GB. There
          is a 10MB limit per image.<br />
          <br />
Picasa features an AJAX organizer
          for arranging images within an album. The finished slideshow is displayed via
          AJAX and HTML and the embedded player is in Flash. Visitors need a Google
        Account to post comments.<br />
        </li>
        <li><b>SmugMug</b> &ndash; <a href="../http://www.smugmug.com/">http://www.smugmug.com</a><br />
        For $60 a year, this site hosts
          unlimited images, embedded slideshows and even embedded video (HD-quality video
          is $150 a year). While it does not offer embedded tools within your site, the
          on-line galleries you can create are high calibre and can be branded with a
        custom URL.<br />
        <br />
        Since it is aimed at professional
          (as opposed to general) usage, it uploads and displays images without
          compression for rich detail. It also has security features like right-click
          image copying protection. <br />
          <br />
Administrators can make any
          gallery unlisted, password-protected, or limited to select museum members or
          donors sent to a group of unlisted galleries via a single URL. Best of all, you
          can remove SmugMug's branding and customize the logo, header, footer, and color
          scheme to match your own site.<br />
          <br />
SmugMug creates Flash slideshows
          and video players, with the ability to offer feeds as well as commenting
          (moderated or unmoderated).</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Many other sites offer free image slideshow options, such as
      <a href="../http://www.photoshow.com/home/start">http://www.photoshow.com/home/start </a> , <a href="../http://www.viewbook.com/">http://www.Viewbook.com</a>, <a href="../http://www.bubbleshare.com/">http://www.Bubbleshare.com</a>      and <a href="../http://www.phlook.com/">http://www.Phlook.com</a>.</p>
      <h2>User-Generated Content and Community</h2>
      <p>Social networking applications help you engage and enlarge
      your audience by giving them a sense of identity and ownership. </p>
      <p>User-generated content can benefit museums in a host of
      ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Interacting with your visitors and interested
          Web communities</b> by promoting upcoming shows, sharing recent recordings and
          hearing what your museum-goers are saying</li>
        <li><b>Raising awareness </b>by getting the word out
          on important issues and causes and inspiring others to take action</li>
        <li><b>Connecting with your members and event
          attendees</b> by starting the meet-and-greet before they even arrive and
          sharing photos and videos afterwards</li>
        <li><b>Fostering appreciation for your collection</b> by building exposure and awareness of your unique curatorial niche</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For the purposes of museum usage, we have focused our
        analysis on tools that allow Web site visitors to comment, tag, and rate/rank
        content, but you will see that many of these tools are wide-reaching platforms
        that also incorporate other helpful community-building tools such as image
        slideshows, widget creation, RSS and other easy-to-implement features to help
      you turn every visitor into an active member. </p>
      <p>In addition, we have only included tools that allow for
        customization of the tool's design and the ability to disable advertising,
        since these features are imperative for the professional branding and
      credibility of museums.</p>
      <h3>KickApps &ndash; <a href="../http://www.kickapps.com/">http://www.kickapps.com</a></h3>
      <p>KickApps is a broad Web-based platform that makes it easy
        for you to add a wide array of social features to your Web site. It offers
        tools to implement rating, tagging and commenting. As part of its wheelhouse,
        KickApps also supports image, video and audio embedding, widget creation, blogs
      and RSS content distribution.</p>
      <p>KickApps supports membership and profile creation so that
        your site can foster an on-line community of constituents that can be segmented
        into more granular group subcategories, if desired. On the back-end, the
        platform provides content moderation, stats on usage and CSS control to
      customize look and feel.</p>
      <p>The free option comes with advertising, but you can pay to disable
        ads. If your site has fewer than 5,000 hits per month, the cost is $100 a
        month, and fewer than 20,000 hits per month is $300/month. If your site has
        more than 20,000 hits a month, you will need to purchase the enterprise level,
        which, at several thousands of dollars a month, would no longer be a low-cost
      budget option.</p>
      <h3>Ning &ndash; <a href="../http://www.ning.com/">http://www.ning.com</a></h3>
      <p>Comparable to KickApps is Ning, a similar social networking
        platform created by former Netscape founder Marc Andreessen. For the less
        technologically-sophisticated, basic users can set up a social network with
      point-and-click setup options. </p>
      <p>Much like KickApps, Ning offers image slideshows, music,
        audio/video, forums/message boards, blogs, RSS, search, widget creation,
        tagging, CSS for customized design, membership creation, content moderation and
        usage stats. Ning also offers Facebook integration and an events calendar tool,
      but does not support rating/ranking features.</p>
      <p>The free version has advertising, but it can be disabled for
      $20 a month.</p>
      <h3>Google Friend Connect &ndash; <a href="../http://www.google.com/friendconnect">http://www.google.com/friendconnect</a></h3>
      <p>If you want to test the waters before diving head first into
        social networking technologies, this tool from the Google team allows you to
        implement commenting and ranking on your site. By adding a snippet of code to
        your site, you can launch commenting and community social features immediately
      without programming. </p>
      <p>To support the posting of user messages, the administrative
        area allows for moderation and easy removal of comments/messages. You can
        choose to allow posts in real-time or to require moderation. You can also
        choose to allow anonymous posts or require a site membership login (via Google)
      and can block membership, if necessary.</p>
      <p>The resulting commenting area looks and acts much like a
        Facebook Wall, where site users can add feedback to share with the visiting
      community.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Google Friend Connect lets you pick and choose from built-in
        functionality like user registration, invitations, member&rsquo;s gallery, reviews
        and message posting, as well as additional third-party applications built by
        the popular OpenSocial developer community. The interface makes it extremely
      easy to adjust size and colors as well to match your site branding.</p>
      <p>Note that you need a free Google account to set up Friend
      Connect. </p>
      <h3>Kampyle &ndash; <a href="../http://www.kampyle.com/">http://www.kampyle.com</a></h3>
      <p>If you're looking for a free tool to engage your
        constituents in discussion, Kampyle is a handy free feedback management
      platform to increase customer loyalty and satisfaction.</p>
      <p>Using a simple wizard, you can make basic style edits to the
        Kamplye tool and quickly deploy it on your site to solicit ratings and ranking
        as well as collect valuable feedback. The back-end offers tools to analyze and
        manage your Web site visitors' feedback. Kampyle allows you to create multiple
        feedback forms for different locations of your Web site so that you may
      customize relevant questions for each page's content. </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Many free and easy tools exist to update and upgrade your
        site; &nbsp;more are coming on-line each
        day and may be a perfect fit for your museum&rsquo;s need. However, it&rsquo;s important to
      keep in mind that you should not implement technology for technology's sake.</p>
      <p>As with any communications plan, your implementation should
        not be wedded to any particular technology, but instead, aligned with the
      people, objectives and strategies of your museum. </p>
      <p>Take a realistic, critical look at the people visiting your
        Web site. What are their age ranges, levels of computer savvy and Web
        proficiency?&nbsp; You need to delve
        into not only who they are, but also what they want from their experience on
        your site. Some people like to create content; such as uploading photos or
        posting their ideas, while others are happier as critics who judge and comment
        on the Web actions of others. Determining the levels of engagement that your
        audiences will expect should come before you decide what technologies to
      implement. </p>
      <p>Only then, armed with this critical focus, can you select
      technology that meets your needs.&nbsp; </p>
