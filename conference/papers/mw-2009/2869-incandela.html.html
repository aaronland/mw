		  New ways of publishing video on-line emerge constantly, leaving us the

<h2>The Expanding Role of On-line Video</h2>
<p>In the past several years, the world has witnessed a
    dramatic expansion in the use of video as a vital communication medium on-line.
    Spanning on-line, embedded and user generated video content to video delivered
    via cell phones and inserted in chat sessions, the pervasive use of video is
    now a fact of life. On-line video Web sites such as YouTube and others have
    taken their place as fixtures in the on-line landscape. Consider that in
    November 2008, comScore Inc. reported that YouTube placed second only to Google
    in the number of search queries served (comScore, 2008), making it not only a
    major player in on-line video, but also the second largest search engine with
    respect to volume of searches regardless of content type. Likewise, the Pew
    Internet Project revealed in 2007 that nearly three-quarters (74%) of broadband
    users report watching or downloading on-line video content (Madden, 2008). Pew
    also reported in early 2008 that the audience of daily users of on-line video
    had increased dramatically from 8% to 15% between December 2006 and December
    2007 (Rainie, 2008). More recently, comScore additionally reported that
    Americans watched 34% more on-line video in November 2008 as compared to just
    one year earlier (comScore, 2009). Clearly the trend regarding public access to
  and consumption of on-line video is expanding exponentially.</p>
<p>This fact has not been lost on museums and cultural
    institutions. The past several years have also shown a dramatic expansion in
    the number of museums and cultural institutions using on-line video as a way to
    engage audiences with their content and collections. Many museums are now
    actively using a variety of these distribution channels to promote their
    content. Alexander et al (Alexander, 2008) provided a survey of several museums
    using YouTube for distributing video. Greenfield provides insight for the use
    of collaborative and user-generated content platforms in his 2008 paper
    (Greenfield, 2008). Bernstein expanded upon the earlier Caruth, Bernstein paper
    (Caruth, 2007), highlighting the Brooklyn Museum&rsquo;s community building efforts,
    including those using on-line video (Bernstein, 2008). Ways for museums to take
    advantage of these new media outlets were presented and discussed in detail by
  Incandela et al 2007 (Incandela, 2007) and Dance and Pau in 2007 (Dance, 2007).</p>
<p>For another interesting take on the role of video in
    promoting museum content, Figure 1 shows search volume data retrieved from
    Google&rsquo;s Insight for Search (Google, 2009), a tool designed to reveal trends in
    search activity. The following graph shows the trends in searches containing
    the terms <b>museum,</b> <b>video</b> and <b>blog</b> within the Arts and Humanities category as defined by Google. While this graph
    shouldn&rsquo;t be used to intimate absolute numbers, the trends here show that
    searches for video and blog are trending upward at roughly the same rate since
    2004, while museum searches are steadily declining, with searches for video in
  this category overtaking searches for museum sometime in 2006.</p>

    from Google Insight for Search comparing searches for &lsquo;museum&rsquo;, &lsquo;video&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;blog&rsquo; from 2004-Present</i></p>
<p>As museums and cultural institutions continue to move more
    heavily into this space, one quickly learns that there are an ever-increasing
    number of options for how to distribute museum video content on-line. But how
    should an institution choose among all of the platforms available? Which
    features are the most important to consider? Where will museum-produced content
    earn the most bang for the buck? These are questions which will no doubt vary
    based on each museum&rsquo;s specific goals. In this paper we describe the IMA&rsquo;s
    initial efforts in this area and attempt to outline some suggestions and
    strategies to consider in forming an overall institutional strategy regarding
  video deployment.</p>
<h2>Case Study: The Indianapolis Museum of Art</h2>
<p>The IMA began publishing videos on-line in July of 2006. At
    that time, the museum was in the early stages of Web redesign. The existing
    site was difficult to navigate and hard for staff to update, especially with
    regard to hosting and presenting video content on-line. During that same time
    period, YouTube began offering Director&rsquo;s Channels to qualified content
    authors. As the IMA became more accepting of technology and sought to innovate
    on-line, the opportunity to establish a relationship with YouTube seemed ideal.
    Host video for free, experiment with new audiences, and easily embed our video
  content into our Web sites, blogs and more. It was an easy decision. </p>
<p>YouTube&rsquo;s service gave IMA the freedom to experiment with
    a variety of content approaches &ndash; marketing trailers, short
    documentaries, artist interviews and talks. There were no rules in this new
    environment, and we made the most of the opportunity. As the number of
    institutions on YouTube grew, it initiated a new account for non-profits which
    allowed greater flexibility in branding the look of the site and greater
    capacity for uploading video. Between July 2006 and December 2007, the IMA
    continued to publish all types of video content to YouTube. The content varied
    from a promotional video for a Bruce Nauman exhibition to a calligraphy
  demonstration by artist Hirokazu Kosaka. </p>
<p>Towards the end of 2007, the IMA was introduced to iTunes
    U, which allowed educational institutions to post their digital content
    directly into the iTunes Store. Other museums have also taken advantage of this
    distribution opportunity. Within iTunes U, Apple created a Beyond Campus
    category for other institutions to leverage their own digital content. With
    this second distribution channel for our video content coming on-line, the IMA
    determined to take a more strategic approach in the deployment of content. Longer
    format and more educationally focused audio guides or videos such as interviews
    with contemporary artists were reserved specifically for the format and
    audiences of iTunes U. The IMA continued to publish video to YouTube, choosing
    to focus on more marketing-related, shorter format or edgier content pieces
  that might play well to YouTube&rsquo;s audience. </p>
<p>The relationship with iTunes U has been a highly
    successful, albeit surprising, digital venture for the IMA. We assumed that our
    iTunes U project would be similar to our YouTube page, in terms of views or
    hits. The unanticipated result from the iTunes partnership was, in fact, the
    power of the Apple marketing team. Apple takes iTunes U very seriously. They
    work very closely with their content providers (such as the IMA) to highlight,
    advertise or include in e-mail blasts &lsquo;featured content&rsquo; to their subscribers. In
    turn, the IMA took its relationship very seriously with iTunes U producers to
    keep them abreast of new or innovative content appearing on the IMA iTunes U
    page. The result was record numbers of video views, downloads and subscriptions
  when Apple chose to feature or highlight IMA content.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Incandela_Figure2.jpg" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="342" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 2: Monthly downloads of IMA videos on iTunes U</p>
<p>As mentioned above, our strategy for content delivery
    involved trying to target appropriate content to these two different audiences.
    Our focus for YouTube&rsquo;s audience was to highlight shorter-format content, even
    shorter marketing-driven videos or the use of big names &ndash; such as big
    name artists, speakers or scholars. We felt this might make our content stand
    out from our traditional approach via improved search results and community
  buy-in for the type of content YouTube&rsquo;s audience would expect. </p>
<p>In considering the iTunes U audience and its emphasis on
    educational experiences for academic audiences, we chose to focus on longer
    format video with more in depth content. Specifically, we chose to upload
    interviews conducted with contemporary artists, enhanced gallery tours,
    performances, talks and some exhibition-focused content. The contemporary
    artist interviews, part of IMA&rsquo;s <i>In the
    Factory</i> series, were longer-format videos incorporating standardized
    questions. The shooting style, questions and editing were consistent for every
    artist interview and focused on hearing from the artist directly.  These
    videos, as well as the gallery tours, talks and exhibition content, require a
    greater commitment from our on-line visitor. We believe those downloading this
    content from iTunes U will be more inclined to invest the required effort to
  download and watch this type of content.</p>
<h2>A Critique of Current Methods</h2>
<p>The experience of developing content for YouTube and
    iTunes U has allowed the IMA to experiment freely in the production of art
    video content and its distribution on-line. Along the way, we&rsquo;ve discovered
    that although we consider our results to be successful, there were many
    problems with each of these channels: deciding what content to feature on which
  channel is sometimes confusing.</p>
<p>The available options for on-line delivery of video have
    some spotty issues regarding image quality. As a visual arts institution, the
    IMA wants greater control over the video quality. Since 2007, the IMA has been
    shooting productions in HD video. Video providers like YouTube and iTunes may
    choose to provide HD content; however, it will always be at their discretion
    and may be limited to video which drives significant amounts of traffic to
    their site. These business decisions are required to sustain a successful
  business model. </p>
<p>In addition, the structure and access to content has some
    inherent challenges. The search results for content related to art or artists
    on YouTube are widely varied and difficult to source. Much of the content on
    YouTube is not well described or catalogued, and as a result it is difficult to
    distinguish between art-related humor and more educational content. Video
    content on iTunes is organized in a very specific way which is controlled by
    Apple according to their plans and intentions. This content and metadata is
    searchable from within iTunes, but is not penetrable from outside search engines
  at this time.</p>
<p>In an effort to address some of these issues, in the
    summer of 2008 the IMA began serious planning and discussions to create a new
    on-line venue for art video content. The hope was that many institutions could
    contribute content to the site to create a high-quality, on-line destination of
    for art content. That summer, an internal team of technologists, software
    developers, graphic designers, video editors, educators and marketing staff
  from the IMA began building ArtBabble (<a href="../http://www.artbabble.org/">http://www.artbabble.org</a>).</p>
<p>A variety of features were taken into account when
    designing ArtBabble. We wanted to drive traffic to the site from search
    engines. An emphasis on full text transcription of each video was also a
    priority. The full transcript enables closed captioning on videos, increasing
    accessibility for hearing impaired audiences. Text transcripts are also
    rendered into each video&rsquo;s Web page allowing search engines to crawl this
    content. The underlying hope was that visitors might arrive to find in the
  middle of a long talk content that would otherwise have been hidden from them.</p>
<p>As discussed above, using free distribution platforms like
    YouTube and iTunes comes at a price. These businesses will always need to
    control the presentation of certain elements on their own sites. The creation
    of a museum-led video platform ensures that the educational content and user
    experience can be first and foremost. Decisions about the presence of
    advertising and platform features can be made from a museum&rsquo;s perspective, and
    content promotion and features can be based on the merits of the content. The
    collective resources and partnerships of content providers can create a
  powerful content distribution and marketing platform.</p>
<p>Historically, the experience of watching video content has
    been relatively passive. The ArtBabble team was determined to create an
    enhanced experience for viewers. Aside from the specific video content,
    ArtBabble provides timed notes to the right of the video player. These notes
    feature Web links tied to the content of the video. These Web links are
    presented to the viewer at the corresponding point in the video. For example,
    viewers of a Maya Lin lecture might find a deeper connection to the art or
    artist by visiting links to Maya Lin&rsquo;s official Web site, a book of her work on
    Amazon, images on Flickr from her installations, or even by watching other
    related videos. The hope is that this additional content becomes a jumping-off
    point for the viewer to explore interesting content related to the current video.    </p>
<p>Finally, ArtBabble needed to set really high standards for video quality. The
  reliable delivery of HD video content was a priority. Efforts were made to
  ensure that videos would provide a great experience even to users accessing the
  content from cafes, hotels, universities and airports. Lower bandwidth versions
  of video content are provided for users with older computers or slower
  connections, but the focus was on building a platform which would match likely
  future capabilities.</p>
<h2>Deciding on a Strategy for Video Delivery</h2>
<p>How should museums decide on which set of solutions is the
    best fit for their organization and the sorts of content they create? IMA&rsquo;s
    solution initially focused on making educated guesses: some succeeded and some
    did not. In an attempt to offer a few more concrete suggestions, we&rsquo;ll look at
  ways of targeting platforms based on audience and use patterns.</p>
<p>There are a number of tools available to museums that want
    to better understand the audiences consuming on-line video content. In addition
    to the references cited in this paper, several different services for
    estimating traffic and audience demographics are available on-line for free.
    Services like Alexa, or Quantcast recruit users to install browser plugins which
    monitor their traffic and Web behaviors. The thought is to create a statistical
    sampling of user behavior and then to relate this to overall traffic patterns
    on the Internet. In general, these statistics should be interpreted carefully
    since their data are sometimes based on a very small sample size. However, when
    attempting to measure high traffic sites like YouTube, our confidence level in
  these measurements goes up.</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Incandela_Figure3.jpg" alt="figure 3" width="310" height="384" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 3: YouTube Demographic Age Ranges from Quantcast.com</p>
<p>In examining the previous chart taken from Quantcast.com,
    we can see that the YouTube audience is strongest between the ages of 12 and 34
    (55%) and that significantly less than the Internet average of visitors between
    the ages of 35-49 are among this audience. When we compare this range with the
    YouTube-provided statistics regarding viewers of IMA video content on YouTube,
  we can see some interesting differences.</p>
<p class="caption"><a name="fig4" id="fig4"></a><a href="incandela-fig4.html"><img src="Incandela_Figure4-small.jpg" alt="figure 4" width="500" height="372" /></a></p>
<p class="caption"><a href="incandela-fig4.html">Fig 4: YouTube Insights for all-time views of IMA videos</a></p>
<p class="caption"><img src="Incandela_Figure5.jpg" alt="figure 5" width="433" height="536" /></p>
<p class="caption">Fig 5: Age demographics of viewers of IMA video on YouTube</p>
<p>It appears that the majority of viewers of IMA videos on
    YouTube are between the ages of 45-54, with the average age skewing closer to 50
    years old. This is a significant difference when compared to YouTube&rsquo;s
  strongest age demographic in the late teens. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that the content the IMA has been featuring
    on YouTube does not quite hit the sweet spot with that particular user demographic.
    In examining the distribution of views among the various types of content
    featured on IMA&rsquo;s video channel, it appears that instructional videos and
    exhibition trailers tend to have a younger demographic of viewer and may offer
  clues about what types of video content would be most successful on YouTube.</p>
<h2>A Look at Distribution</h2>
<p>By comparison, it is very difficult to find accurate
    demographic information about users of iTunes U. Tools like Quantcast or Alexa
    are of very limited value since the iTunes store does not run within a
    traditional Web browser. Other statistics regarding audience demographics for
    iTunes are hard to come by. EMarketer quotes comScore in a 2007 article
    describing these demographics (eMarketer, 2007). It was determined that about
    half of the podcasting audience was between 35 and 54 years of age, while those
    between 18 and 24 accounted for only 29% of this audience. This range seems to
    be more in line with the YouTube statistics for IMA viewers; however, this data
    represents statistics from 2006, and more up to date information was not
  available.</p>
<p>A look at the usage characteristics of iTunes U gives us
    perhaps a different way to determine a strategy for successful content
    deployment. In examining the most popular downloads from iTunes U, we see some
  interesting facts.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that among the top five most

    Many of the most popular videos feature a longer-form lecture or discussion

    is likely, given the larger files sizes, that the audience on iTunes generally
    has access to faster Internet connections.  These characteristics seem to hold

<p>These statistics and performance seem to support our
    earlier conjecture that the iTunes U audience engages better with more in-depth
    and longer format content than the audience on YouTube. These simple mechanisms
    provide at least an entry point into making decisions about content
  distribution based in facts and measureable consumption.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This paper outlines the IMA&rsquo;s efforts and attempts at
    coming to an understanding regarding the audiences and distribution mechanisms
    for on-line video. These efforts have included over 125 videos published on
    YouTube and a broad combination of enhanced podcasts and videos published to
    iTunes U. The IMA has experimented with content types, monitored on-line
  visitor response, and altered content offerings for both YouTube and iTunes U.</p>
<p>After some experimentation on YouTube, the IMA chose to
    alter its content strategies to publish longer-format, educationally focused
    content on iTunes U. This reserved the shorter format, marketing style and
    edgier content specifically for YouTube. The IMA continues to use the same
    styles of content development, but chooses to publish them in different ways. This
    adjustment in strategy maximizes the impact of the museums content and exposure
  to on-line audiences.</p>
<p>In this paper, we have outline some ways in which other
    museums might choose to measure the performance of their own video content in
    these areas. An analysis of the demographics of users consuming video content
    on-line is very helpful in understanding how well a museum&rsquo;s content matches
  the &lsquo;sweet-spot&rsquo; of any particular distribution channel. </p>
<p>An examination of the characteristics of the most popular
    content (filesize, quality, length, and content type) offers a way to determine
    whether or not the content your museums is producing matches what is
  successful.</p>
<p>Learning from these insights and wishing to expand upon
    the strategies for exposing audiences to high quality video content, the IMA
    initiated a new on-line project to showcase video art content. Responding to
    lessons learned utilizing YouTube and iTunes U, the IMA team planned and
    strategized a new approach for museums and institutions to publish art content
    on-line. ArtBabble was created in an effort to provide a high quality video
    viewing experience, an on-line destination managed and maintained by expert
    museum staff, a more immersive video experience, and has the ability to market
    and highlight innovative and educational content, enhanced search tools and
    search engine optimization. A detailed measurement of the performance and
    audiences for ArtBabble will help inform us as to its special characteristics
  and opportunities as the system matures.</p>
