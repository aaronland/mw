		<p class="AbstractText">We present an overview of CultureSampo, an ambitious
		  system for creating a collective semantic memory of the cultural heritage of a nation
		  on the Semantic Web 2.0, combining ideas underlying the Semantic Web and the
		  Web 2.0. The system addresses the semantic Web challenge of aggregating highly
		  heterogeneous, cross-domain cultural heritage collections and other contents into
		  a semantically rich intelligent system for human and machine users. At the same
		  time, CultureSampo is an approach to solving the social and practical Web 2.0
		  challenge of organizing the underlying collaborative ontology development and
		  content creation work of memory organizations and citizens. This paper focuses
		  on CultureSampo&rsquo;s search, recommendation, and visualization services for the
		  end-users. The key idea here is to access cultural heritage on the Semantic Web
		  through nine &ldquo;thematic perspectives&rdquo;: such as places on the maps, the social network of
		  cultural persons, timelines, and narrative texts, e.g. biographies and literary
		  works.</p>

      <h2 class="MsoTitle">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Publishing
        Collections Collaboratively on the Semantic Web 2.0</h2>
      <p>CultureSampo (<a href="../http://www.kulttuurisampo.fi/">http://www.seco.tkk.fi/applications/kulttuurisampo/</a>)
        (Hyv&ouml;nen et al., 2008) is a publication system and a portal by which memory
        organizations and citizens can publish their collections on the Semantic Web in
        a collaborative way. CultureSampo extends our earlier application &ldquo;MuseumFinland
        - Finnish Museums on the Semantic Web&rdquo; (Hyv&ouml;nen et al., 2004, Hyv&ouml;nen et al., 2005)
        (<a href="../http://www.museosuomi,.fi/">http://www.museosuomi.fi/</a>), a system
        for publishing artifact collections on the Semantic Web, by supporting
        publication of different kinds of cross-domain contents, both material and
        immaterial. The system also introduces many novelties to both end-users and
      publishers. </p>
      <p>Creating a system like CultureSampo is challenging for two
      major reasons:</p>
      <p class="MsoList"><b>Semantic challenges</b>. Cultural heritage content is
        semantically heterogeneous and available in various forms (documents, images,
        audio tracks, videos, collection items, learning objects etc.); it concerns
        various topics (art, history, handicraft etc.); it is written in different
        languages; and it is targeted to both nonprofessionals and experts.
        Furthermore, the content is semantically interlinked, as depicted in figure 1.1.
        For example, the content may contain a person&rsquo;s narrative biography, works of
        art she created, places of interest where she lived, Wikipedia articles or
        novels about or by the person, social connections to other persons, and events
        in history that the person was related to. In our work, semantic Web technologies
        (<a href="../http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/</a>) are used
      to address these challenges.</p>
      <p class="MsoList"><b>Organizational challenges</b>. Museums, archives,
        libraries, media organizations, associations, and individual citizens create
        cultural heritage content independently from each other. This has led to a situation
        where metadata produced by different organizations is usually incompatible one with
        another in terms of metadata schemas, vocabularies, and cataloguing conventions.
        In our work, ideas underlying Web 2.0 are used to support collaboration and
      promote interoperability in distributed content creation.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="hyvonen-figure1.1-linked-w.png" alt="figure 1.1" width="500" height="361" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1.1: Cultural heritage is semantically heterogeneous
      and mutually linked.</p>
      <p>CultureSampo has been developed since 2004 as a part of the
        FinnONTO project (2003&ndash;2007, 2008&ndash;2010) (<a
href="../http://www.seco.tkk.fi/projects/finnonto/">http://www.seco.tkk.fi/projects/finnonto/</a>).
        The goal of this work is to build a national level semantic Web content
        infrastructure and demonstrate its usefulness in practical applications. The
        first public prototype of CultureSampo was published in September 2008 and can
      be used in three languages on the Web at <a href="../http://www.kulttuurisampo.fi/">http://www.kulttuurisampo.fi/</a>.</p>
      <p>CultureSampo consists of three components (cf. figure 1.2):</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Collaborative ontology infrastructure</b>. The basis of CultureSampo
          is the national FinnONTO infrastructure (Hyv&ouml;nen et al., 2008b). It includes a
          collaboratively created system of cross-domain ontologies and related ontology
          services for utilizing them cost-efficiently as services. The ontologies and
          the services were published as the National Ontology Service ONKI (<a
href="../http://www.yso.fi/">http://www.yso.fi/</a>) on September 12,
          2008.</li>
        <li><b>Content production system</b>. Our content creation model
          consists of a set of metadata models and a content creation process for
          producing and harvesting content from museums, libraries, archives and other
          organizations, as well as from individual citizens and (inter)national Web 2.0
          sources.</li>
        <li><b>Semantic Web 2.0 portal</b>. The portal itself is unique in its
          use of versatile cross-domain semantic models, new semantic searching and
          browsing methods, and semantic visualizations for the end-users.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="caption"><img src="hyvonen-figure1.2-components-w.png" alt="Figure 1.2" width="500" height="278" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1.2: Three components of CultureSampo.</p>
      <p>In the following, these three components are overviewed
        with an emphasis on the end-user interface of the portal. After this,
      contributions of the work to related research are summarized.</p>
      <h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Collaborative
      Ontology Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>The ontologies of the FinnONTO infrastructure constitute
        an integral part of CultureSampo. They complement the generic, logic based W3C semantic
        web recommendations, such as RDF, OWL, and SPARQL, with domain specific concept
        descriptions in different domains. Most of the FinnONTO ontologies were developed
        by transforming nationally used thesauri into lightweight ontologies. The process
        was not purely mechanical, like e.g. in (van Assem, 2006), but also manual
        processing was required in order to refine the semantic thesaurus relations
        into full-blown subsumption hierarchies. In the FinnONTO model, the ontologies in
        different domains are developed in a distributed fashion by collaborating
        expert groups of different fields, and are mapped together to form a large
        national ontology called KOKO encompassing all domains. KOKO includes e.g. an
        upper ontology YSO (20 600 concepts), a cultural heritage ontology MAO (6800
        concepts), an agriforestry ontology AFO (5500 concepts), an applied art
        ontology TAO (2600 concepts), and a photography ontology VALO (1900 concepts).
        Figure 2.1 illustrates the KOKO system of mutually mapped ontologies where YSO
      constitutes the upper ontology.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="hyvonen-figure2.1-koko-w.png" alt="figure 2.1" width="500" height="315" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 2.1: KOKO system of mutually mapped cross-domain ontologies.</p>
      <p>The ontologies are provided to end-users not only in
        RDF/OWL form, as usual, but also as ready to use semantic Web widgets (M&auml;kel&auml;
        et al., 2007) using Web 2.0 AJAX APIs, as well as through conventional Web Services.
        In addition to KOKO, CultureSampo also utilizes a geographical registry of 800,000
        places in Finland, a spatiotemporal ontology of historical Finnish municipalities
        1865&ndash;2007 (Kauppinen et al., 2008), and an ontology of persons and organizations.
        Furthermore, international vocabularies, such as the Iconclass (http://www.iconclass.nl/),
        the Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) (<a
href="../http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting%20research/vocabularies/aat/">http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting
          research/vocabularies/aat/</a>), and the Union List of Artists&rsquo; Names
        (ULAN) (<a
href="../http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting%20research/vocabularies/ulan/">http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting
      research/vocabularies/ulan/</a>) are used.</p>
      <h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Content
      Production System</h2>
      <p>CultureSampo contains cultural objects of nearly 67
        different content types including artifacts, paintings, drawings, sculptures, pieces
        of abstract art, novels, comics, Web pages, three types of folklore, five types
        of folk music, photos, aerial photos, persons, organizations, biographies,
        historical events, skills, videos, buildings, and archeological sites. These
        content types are represented using 18 different metadata schemas. The
        aggregated knowledge base contains 134,000 cultural objects and 285,000 other
        resources, such as ontological class concepts and place instances. The cultural
      objects and other resources are described by 2.4 million RDF property triples.</p>
      <p>The content is enriched
        using reasoning, resulting in some 11.4 million property triples. The enriched
        knowledge base is used for intelligent information retrieval and for creating
        semantic recommendation links between objects. The content is represented using
        RDF and OWL, and SPARQL is used for querying recommendations. The system also
        utilizes external Web resources through Web services: all Wikipedia articles in
        English and Finnish that have coordinate information, as well as photographs of
        the Panoramio service Panoramio (<a href="../http://www.panoramio.com/">http://www.panoramio.com/</a>)
      can be found on CultureSampo&rsquo;s map views.</p>
      <p>These information
        sources have diverse ownership. The contents come from 22 Finnish museums, archives,
        and libraries, most of which produce their contents independently from each
        other using heterogeneous cataloguing systems and practices. Wikipedia and
        Panoramio content is created (inter)nationally by the public. CultureSampo also
        has a commenting facility by which individuals can contribute new knowledge to
        individual content items; e.g. identify persons in an old photograph of a museum
        collection. In these ways, citizens are able to contribute to the national
        semantic memory. Furthermore, distributed content production based on the SAHA
        editor (Valkeap&auml;&auml; et al., 2007) has been used internally in the system by the participating
      organizations.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="hyvonen-figure3.1-culsa-w.png" alt="figure 3.1" width="500" height="314" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 3.1: CultureSampo system in a nutshell.</p>
      <p>Figure 3.1 depicts the CultureSampo system as a whole. In
        the center is the KOKO ontology and other infrastructure ontologies. The
        collection items (cf. figure 1.1) around the ontologies are attached to the
        ontologies by metadata. The content providers depicted around the circle, i.e.
        CultureSampo, publish metadata locally and independently using shared metadata
        schemas and ontologies. The result is a large global semantic RDF network
      linking different contents together in ontologically meaningful ways.</p>
      <p>From a semantic
        modeling viewpoint, one research focus of our work has been event- and
        process-based annotations used in artificial intelligence and knowledge representation
        (Sowa, 2000). In our case, events have been used for modeling cultural
        processes and narrative stories (Junnila et al., 2008) and for metadata schema
        integration (Ruotsalo, Hyv&ouml;nen, 2007). The KOKO ontology was designed to
        support this by clearly separating events and processes from other concepts as
      in Dolce (Gangemi et al., 2002).</p>
      <p>In some metadata
        schemas of CultureSampo it is possible to annotate content using processes in
        terms of events, subevents and their sequences. The model in use in the
        prototype is a simplified version of our earlier schema (Junnila et al., 2008).
        The portal then automatically generates an interactive representation of the
        process as a kind of temporal table of contents. This system is used in the
        prototype for creating skill models, cultural process models, and documentation
      of processes in videos:</p>
      <p class="MsoListContinue"><b><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Semantic skill models</span></b><span
lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. An example of a skill model is the model &ldquo;Production of Ceramics&rdquo;
        produced by experts at the University of Applied Arts in Helsinki. It illustrates
        and explains the composition of different work phases when manufacturing
        ceramics. At each phase, semantic recommendations to other relevant CultureSampo
        contents can be created automatically. For example, links to products in
        collections that were manufactured using the same techniques are automatically
      obtained.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoListContinue"><b><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Semantic models of cultural
        processes</span></b><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. There is a similar kind of chronological
          model &ldquo;A Year on a Farm&rdquo; of the seasonal farming events and processes taking
          place at a typical farm in Finland. Again, tools and other materials from CultureSampo
          are linked automatically with related events. This model was created by a
          farmer employed at the Finnish Museum of Agriculture. The permanent exhibition
          of this museum is actually organized using the same idea of presenting farming
      events taking place during different yearly seasons.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoListContinue"><b><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Semantic documentation on videos</span></b><span
lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. The annotation model can be applied also to documenting instances
        of actual skill events or processes documented on a video. The case example
        available on the portal describes how the shoemaker Onni Wirlander manufactured
        a pair of traditional leather boots. The video was produced and the annotation
        created by the Espoo City Museum using the SAHA editor connected to the ONKI
        ontology services. The semantic model describes what happens at different
        (sub)sequences on the video. Semantic search can find not only the video as a
        black box, as in systems such as YouTube, but also points of interest inside
        the video. The video can be viewed directly starting from different points of
      interest. This is important with longer videos.</span></p>
      <p>The examples above demonstrate our new ideas of
        representing and storing non-material, procedural cultural heritage in the
        memory system, here descriptions of handicraft skills and cultural processes.
        Typical cultural heritage portals contain metadata only about static objects
      such as artifacts.</p>
      <p>Content creation in CultureSampo, both ontologies and the
        metadata, is based on distributing the work to organizations and citizens in a Web
        2.0 fashion. In this strategy, extra costs can be minimized by reorganizing the
        work done already in the organizations and in public. The work is supported by
        a number of generic FinnONTO tools, such as the metadata editor SAHA,
        information extraction tool POKA (Valkeap&auml;&auml; et al., 2007), and the semantic
      content validator VERA (<a href="../http://www.seco.tkk.fi/services/vera/">http://www.seco.tkk.fi/services/vera/</a>).</p>

      <p class="caption">Fig 4.2: Using the semantic search box.</p>
      <h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Semantic Web
      2.0 Portal: Thematic Perspectives</h2>
      <p>Figure 4.1 depicts the front page of the portal
        CultureSampo. The system is multilingual: Finnish, Swedish, or English can be
        selected by the links in the upper right corner. However, because nearly all
        contents are in Finnish and translations of some parts of the Finnish KOKO ontologies
        are not available, the system is not equally powerful in other languages. On
        the bottom of the page, lately viewed objects from the knowledge base are shown,
      as well as objects that have elicited comments lately by end-users.</p>
      <p>In the upper left
        corner, there is a Google-like search box for typing in a search query. CultureSampo
        utilizes semantic autocompletion (Hyv&ouml;nen, M&auml;kel&auml;, 2006) in order to guess the
        possible query words that the user is aiming at. Semantic query expansion based
        on the ontologies is used in order to enhance recall. Furhermore, the underlying
        ontologies are used to organize the hit results into meaningful categories. For
        example, in figure 4.2 the user is typing into the search box &ldquo;Kuller...&rdquo; aiming
        probably at the hero &ldquo;Kullervo&rdquo; of the Kalevala epic. The hit results are
        categorized by the roles connecting the hero and the matched objects; e.g., paintings
      depicting him, runes telling about him, etc.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="hyvonen-figure4.3-map-w.png" alt="figure 4.1" width="500" height="371" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 4.3: Collection objects on the map based on 12

      <p class="caption">Fig 4.4: Historical areas tab.</p>
      <p>A major novelty of the portal is to provide the end-user
        with access to the cultural RDF knowledge base through nine &ldquo;thematic
        perspectives&rdquo;. They are available at the main entry page and as choices in the
        menu bar (cf. figure 4.1 in the middle). These perspectives are overviewed below
        in order to illustrate the underlying ideas and functionalities available. New
        perspectives can be added into the system fairly easily, because the underlying
        architecture is based on a set of general service components, such as the semantic
      recommending system. </p>
      <h3>Perspective 1: Maps Search and Browse Views</h3>
      <p>There are four map views (Kauppinen, et al., 2006) &nbsp;available using Google Maps. Each
      view has its own tab:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The tab &ldquo;Search for Items on the Map&rdquo; shown in figure 4.3 displays
          any collection object with coordinate information on Google Maps, and tells the
          semantic relations of objects to the places. There are 12 different spatial
          relations in use, such as &ldquo;place of acquirement&rdquo;, &ldquo;place of subject&rdquo;, and
        &ldquo;place of manufacture&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>The tab &ldquo;Historical Areas&rdquo; is used for finding old Finnish
          counties with their digitized limits on the maps, based on the spatiotemporal
          Finnish place ontology SAPO (Kauppinen et al., 2008)&nbsp;. In figure 4.4, a link
          directory to old places is shown on the left, and the user has selected historical
          Helsinki. Semantic recommendation links to related collection items are
          automatically shown on the bottom of the page with short explanations about
          their relation to the place.<br />

        <span class="caption">        Fig 4.5: Historical maps on Google Maps.</span></li>
        <li>The tab &ldquo;Historical Maps&rdquo; (Kauppinen, et al., 2006) is used for viewing
          historical maps layered semi-transparently over modern Google Maps. Wikipedia
          articles in Finnish or English with coordinate information and photos from the
          Panoramio service can be seen on the maps and can be opened by clicking on
          them. For example, in figure 4.5 old Finnish Karelian maps are viewed
          semi-transparently on top of modern Russian Google Maps (this area is part of Russia
          today). The user has located the historical Finnish park &ldquo;Monrepos&rdquo;, and found
          a modern Panoramio photograph there, taken by a contemporary Russian citizen.
          On the left, there is also the index of old Finnish places on the maps as
          direct selection links. Semantic recommendations to collection items related to
          historical places on the maps are displayed below. In this case, for example, links
          to pieces of folk music and poems collected from the region can be seen, as
          well as related paintings, artifacts, and old aerial photographs. <br />

        <span class="caption">Fig 4.6: Finding nearby cultural sites.</span></li>
        <li>The fourth tab &ldquo;Nearby objects&rdquo; is used for finding nearby
          objects of interest: the user clicks a point and the system finds nearby
          cultural sites of interest (cf. figure 4.6).</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Perspective 2: relational search</h3>
      <p>The relational search perspective is a demonstration of
        relational search (Kurki, Hyv&ouml;nen, 2007) &nbsp;also called association identification
        or knowledge discovery (Sheth et al., 2005). Here the idea is to search not
        for objects but for associative relation chains between objects. We used the
        ULAN registry of 120,000 artists and organizations with 390,000 names. Here the
        user can type in two names, using semantic autocompletion, and CultureSampo
        tells how the persons or organizations are related to each other by the social
        network based on some 50 different social roles (e.g., parent-of, teacher-of, patron-of
        etc.). The underlying social RDF/OWL network can also be browsed by a graphical
        network browser. For example, in figure 4.7 the user typed in Napolean I (the
        French emperor) and Akseli Gallen-Kallela (a Finnish artist), and CultureSampo
        found a social path of 7 steps between the persons. The browsable social
      network of Napolean I is depicted on the right hand side window.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="hyvonen-figure4.7-relational-w.png" alt="figure 4.7" width="500" height="339" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 4.7: Answering the question &ldquo;How is Napolean I, the
        French emperor, related to Akseli Gallen-Kallela, the Finnish artist?&rdquo; by
      relational search.</p>
      <h3>Perspective 3: search and organize</h3>
      <p>In the <b>search and organize</b> perspective, the idea
        is to move beyond locating interesting singular items. Using the tools of this
        perspective, it is possible to analyze the contents and create organized
        presentations that are able to bring out interesting trends and information
        contained in the data as a whole. For example, it is possible to find out what
        the most popular themes in Finnish fiction were in the year 2007. In figure
        4.8, the end-user is analyzing how beard fashions have changed during the ages
        by first searching for collection items depicting beards in different ways, and
        then projecting the results on a timeline. In figure 4.9, images of churches
        are visualized on the map in order to investigate the geographical distribution
      of different kinds of churches in Finland.</p>
      <p>The user interface of the perspective is divided into two
        functional parts. On the top, constraints for the result set are specified and
        changed. For example, in figure 4.9, the user has formulated the query &quot;Tell
        me about photographs related to the keyword church&quot;. On the bottom, the
        constrained result set can be organized, grouped and visualized according to
        different ontological facets as lists, on a map, or on a timeline. For example,
        it is possible to view the results &quot;as a list according to the most
        popular theme&quot;, &quot;according to time of manufacture on a timeline&quot;
        or &quot;colored according to style and placed on a map according to place of
        manufacture&quot;. For both query constraining and organizing, the perspective
        makes use of domain-centric faceted search (M&auml;kel&auml; et al., 2007), a
      generalization of the faceted search paradigm to heterogeneous data.</p>

      <h3>Perspective 4: collections</h3>
      <p>Here the contents can be accessed based on an
        organizational view. Each participating organization has an automatically
        generated home page in the system with links to its collections and the actual
      collection items.</p>
      <h3>Perspective 5: Finnish history</h3>
      <p>This view is based on an ontology representing events in
        Finnish history (Hyv&ouml;nen, MuseumFinland, 2007). These events are of interest
        on their own, but are also used to create semantic recommendations to other
        contents; e.g. to biographies of persons participating in the events. The
        history ontology in the prototype system contains 220 events on a timeline in
        1860&ndash;1919. The content originates from the Agricola portal (<a
href="../http://agricola.utu.fi/">http://agricola.utu.fi/</a>) maintained
      by history researchers.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="hyvonen-figure4.10-wirlander-w.png" alt="figure 4.1" width="500" height="449" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 4.10: Semantic video viewing with dynamic
      recommendations.</p>
      <h3>Perspective 6: Skills and Cultural Narratives</h3>
      <p>Figure 4.10 depicts the idea of documenting traditional
        skills semantically on videos, and providing the documentation through a
        semantic video viewer. The use case here is the shoemaker Wirlander producing a
        pair of leather boots. This process has been described semantically as a sequence
        of hierarchical events that take place in the video in different parts. The
        corresponding &ldquo;table of contents&rdquo; is automatically generated for the end-user
        on the left. The user can then view any part of the video by selecting items
      from the list.</p>
      <p>In the screenshot, the user is viewing the part
        &ldquo;sharpening of the knife&rdquo;. At the same time, the system recommends items of
        interest in the collections, in this case different knives belonging to the
        collections of the museums. Each part of the video that forms a meaningful
        entity is a search object of its own, and can be found through the general
      search engine of the system.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="hyvonen-figure4.11-biography-w.png" alt="figure 4.1" width="500" height="310" /></p>
      <p class="caption"> Figure 4.11: Biographical perspectives to cultural heritage&nbsp;.</p>
      <h3>Perspective 7: Biographies</h3>
      <p>In this view, biographies of the National Biography are
        used to access CultureSampo contents. When reading the biographies, related
        contents are shown as recommendations based on the concepts extracted from the
        text using the information extraction tool POKA (<a
href="../http://www.seco.tkk.fi/tools/poka/">http://www.seco.tkk.fi/tools/poka/</a>).
        Figure 4.10 depicts the situation where the user is reading the biography of
        Akseli Gallen-Kallela, retrieved from the server of the Finnish Literature
        Society (SKS), and provides her with links to e.g. the art works of the artist
      as well as biographies of other persons related to his life.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="hyvonen-figure4.12-biography-w.png" alt="figure 4.1" width="500" height="362" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Figure 4.12: Semantic Kalevala epic.</p>
      <h3>Perspective 8: Semantic Kalevala</h3>
      <p>This view contains a semantically annotated version of the
        national epic of Finland, Kalevala, that is related in many ways to Finnish art
        and culture. The epic also has interesting links to old Finnish folklore, on
        which it is actually based, and to folk music lyrics. Thousands of runes and
        pieces of folk music are available in the portal. When reading Kalevala,
        annotations related to its subsequences can be viewed to help reading, and
        semantic recommendations to related materials in CultureSampo are automatically
      produced 
      (Hyv&ouml;nen et al., 2007b).</p><p>For example, in figure 4.12 the user is reading a part of
        the fourth rune in Kalevala. A part of the rune is selected, and a modern
        Finnish explanation of the part can viewed. Furthermore, the system is
        suggesting semantic links to objects related to the part selected, in this case
        e.g. to sculpture depicting the fictive person Aino mentioned in the selected poem
      part.</p>
      <h3>Perspective 9: Karelia</h3>
      <p>This last thematic perspective contains Wikipedia articles
        about the Karelia area in Finland that has been influential to the Finnish
        culture. For example, lots of folklore has been collected into national
        archives from this area, and the Kalevala epic is strongly associated there.
        Like in the biographies view, the POKA system is used for extracting concepts
        from the texts (here Web pages). Based of the extracted concepts, semantic
        recommendations to related contents are created for additional information (cf.
      figure 4.12). </p>
      <p>In addition to human end-users, the system can be used by
        machines via AJAX interface and widgets. The application use case here is that a
        collaboratively aggregated and semantically enriched national knowledge base
        can be used not only by the CultureSampo portal but also by other portals and
        systems on the Web. To facilitate this we introduce the cost-effective idea of utilizing
        ready-to-use Web 2.0 mash-up services in the same spirit as Google Ads or Maps
        are used on external Web pages and applications. In this way, museums,
        libraries, tourism portals, news papers, individual citizens, and other users
        can include CultureSampo materials, such as semantic search results and
        recommendation links, on their Web pages using mash-ups. This clearly benefits
        everybody: the materials of the CultureSampo collaborative network get more
        visibility and the external users can enrich their own materials for &rdquo;free&rdquo;:
      only 1&ndash;2 lines of Javascript code is needed. </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="hyvonen-figure4.13-widget-w.png" alt="figure 4.1" width="500" height="379" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Figure 4.13 Semantic CultureSampo Widget.</p>
      <p>An example mash-up is depicted in figure 4.13. Here the
        user types in a search word in the input field. After each character input, the
        CultureSampo service is queried and the matching results are displayed below
        the search field. In this case, the user is typing &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; in English, and bathroom
        equipment and some paintings related to the concept are returned. The actual contents
        are available only in Finnish. However, searches can be performed successfully
        because parts of the underlying ontologies are available in English and
      Finnish.</p>
      <h2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussion</h2>
      <p>The vision and design of CultureSampo goes beyond current
        semantic Web portals for cultural heritage (Hyv&ouml;nen, 2009). The contributions
        of the work underlying the CultureSampo system have many facets and have been
        made over several years. The contribution of this paper is to give an overview of
        the whole system, its philosophy, and the new thematic perspective-based end-user
        interface, with pointers to papers and Web sites explaining the approaches and
      software developed in more detail.</p>
      <p>To summarize our work, CultureSampo contributes to the research
        and development of semantic portals for cultural heritage especially in the
      following ways:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Cross-domain content, ontologies, and metadata</b>: The system
          is highly cross-domain with dozens of content types and metadata schemas. Usually
          only one schema, such as Dublin Core or VRA Core (<a
href="../http://www.vraweb.org/projects/vracore4%20/">http://www.vraweb.org/projects/vracore4/</a>),
          is used in cultural portals (cf. e.g. (Schreiber et al., 2006; Wang et al.,
          2008)).</li>
        <li><b>Event-based narrative semantic models.</b> CultureSampo makes
          use of sophisticated semantic annotation models, including events and processes.</li>
        <li><b>Semantic search and recommending.</b> The system uses new kinds
          of semantic search and recommendation techniques.</li>
        <li><b>Semantic visualizations</b>. The system has an exceptionally
          versatile selection of semantic visualizations available; such as different map
          views, timelines, graphs, process visualization, and semantic video viewing.</li>
        <li><b>Collaborative ontology development</b>. The system is based on
          a large nationwide collaboratively maintained infrastructure of ontologies and
          ontology services.</li>
        <li><b>Collaborative metadata creation</b>. The system includes a
          model of and tools for collaborative semantic content creation.</li>
        <li><b>Machine semantics and services</b>. The services can be made
          available for machines.</li>
        <li><b>Large collaboration network</b>. The system has been developed
          on a national level with content from over 20 memory organizations, and
          includes content from many international sources.</li>
        <li><b>Multilinguality</b>. Although the contents are in Finnish, the
          system can be used in two other languages.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Two user evaluation studies concerning semantic
        recommendations of an earlier version of CultureSampo have been performed with
        some promising results (Ruotsalo and Hyv&ouml;nen, 2007). However, end user evaluation
        of the interfaces of the new prototype with its various features has not yet
      been done.</p>
      <p>The portal is scalable
        in terms of its Web 2.0 content creation model and different types of content.
        An explicit concern in implementing the portal has been computational
        efficiency in terms of speed and memory consumption, since a national level cultural
        heritage portal, if successful, will have lots of content inside and a large
        number of simultaneous users. For this goal, our earlier memory- and Prolog-based
        search engine used in MuseumFinland was replaced by conventional search engine technology,
        Apache Lucene, that was configured to do semantic search using semantic
        indexing. The CultureSampo search engine has been tested with a knowledge base
        of 20 million objects resulting in response times of less than 2 seconds on
      ordinary PC hardware.</p>
