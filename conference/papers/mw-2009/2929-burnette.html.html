<h2>Changing Roles of Museum Web Sites</h2>

<p>They say time is relative, but never more so than when we
consider the extraordinary changes that have taken place on-line - and
specifically to museum Web sites - over the last ten years. A quick review of
the WayBack Machine (<a href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php">http://www.archive.org/web/web.php</a>)
provides a startling reminder of how things have evolved in terms
of&nbsp;design, technology, interaction, and purpose. </p>

<p>Starting out
as relatively modest generation 0.1 Web sites, comprising a mix
of&nbsp;brochureware, basic visitor information, and &ldquo;tasters&rdquo; from their
collections,&nbsp;museum&nbsp;Web sites have now evolved into expansive,
technically sophisticated, and often visually slick entities. The fact that
hits on these Web sites now typically outstrip the numbers of visitors coming
through the museums&rsquo; front doors, sometimes by as much as a factor of five
(Vogel, 2006), has been a serious driver for organizations to engage more fully
with the medium and with their demanding domestic and international on-line
audiences.</p>

<p>This paper explores
the response of four large-scale, US- and UK-based organizations as they
address the many challenges in planning, developing, and deploying their new
and improved Web sites, and shares a few of the sometimes painful lessons
learned.</p>

<h2>Status of Participating Institutions</h2>

<p>As of
publication, the&nbsp;museums&nbsp;represent the different cycles of a redesign
initiative: the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC (NGA) is in the
discovery and strategy phase, the National Gallery, London, and The Museum of
Modern Art (MoMA) are in the development stage, and the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art (SFMOMA) site is live.</p>

<p><b>The NGA</b>, working with the firm IconNicholson,
began its redesign project with a discovery and strategy phase in 2008. NGA is
now developing its content and information technology recommendations, as well
as creative design directions and navigation strategies. The phase will finish
with an executionable roadmap, sustainability strategy, and build schedule. The
original NGA.gov site launched in 1997. </p>

<p class="caption"><span class="FootnoteTextChar">Fig 1: The home page
of NGA&rsquo;s Web site, http://www.nga.gov</span></p>

<p>At the time
of writing, <b>MoMA</b> is weeks away from
launching the redesign of MoMA.org, with a complete overhaul of the back- and
front-end technology and a new design. The site originally launched in 1996,
and the last redesign was conducted in 2002, with a visual update when the
museum expansion opened in 2004. The current redesign project began in the fall
of 2007, taking about 18 months from start to launch. </p>

<p><b>The National Gallery</b> is moving into the final production
stages in preparation for the launch of nationalgallery.org.uk in 2009. The new
&ldquo;National Gallery Online&rdquo; represents a route and branch reworking of the Web site
not seen since it was last updated in 2001 and is one of the most complex
digital developments since 2005, when the&nbsp;museum&nbsp;launched ArtStart,
its in-gallery interactive touch-screen system. The Web site will provide a
streamlined information architecture (IA) and an elegant design, and will be
fully content managed. </p>

<p><b>SFMOMA</b> launched its new site in November
2008. Prior to this, it had been ten years since sfmoma.org had been
redesigned, and the recent redesign was a three-year process that involved the
implementation of a content management system and a new design. Although the
SFMOMA site is now live, the work is far from complete. SFMOMA&rsquo;s Web team is
currently fixing bugs, implementing features that were not completed for the launch,
conducting a summative evaluation, and beginning the second phase of the project,
redesigning the on-line store.</p>

<h2>Why Should Museums Redesign Their Web Sites? </h2>

<p>Museums, given their limited staff and resources, tend to
postpone upgrading and redesigning their sites far longer than for-profit
organizations. While some redesigns are triggered by specific events, such as
the opening on a new building or the impetus of a new director, they are most
often driven by a set of common needs and overarching goals. We identified six
reasons why most museums, regardless of their size or discipline, embark upon
redesign initiatives:</p>

<h3>1. to strengthen infrastructure</h3>
<p class="MsoList">Two core drivers are a failing infrastructure and changing
technology. NGA, MoMA, the National Gallery, and SFMOMA all shared the same
goal of wanting to move away from sites that were built in another Internet era
with static pages to more dynamic sites driven by content management systems,
or CMSs. The existing sites of all four institutions comprised mainly static
HTML pages, with some database-driven portions, making updates tedious, time-consuming,
and inefficient.</p>

<h3>2. to improve the information
  architecture (IA)</h3>
<p class="MsoList">Many museums
find that they need to redesign when they outgrow their information
architecture. When it becomes extremely difficult to add new sections or
content to the Web site, and users have difficulty finding what they need, a
redesign is in order. It is time to clean out the dusty corners, and
restructure the site so that the information architecture is intuitive, clear,
and designed around user needs.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Some symptoms
of a failing IA are evident when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>page layouts are
    inconsistent and confusing&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    labeling and
    nomenclature are not clear or meaningful for users</li>
  <li>
    the Web site
    reflects the museum&rsquo;s structure, rather than the users&rsquo; understanding of it</li>
  <li>
    content is difficult
    or impossible to find</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. to streamline workflow</h3>
<p>Museums can
make the greatest gains in workflow efficiency by adopting a CMS as part of a
redesign. CMSs come in many different varieties, ranging from open-source to
enterprise-level solutions. Empowering key staff members to input their own
content with a CMS can greatly increase the quality and quantity of content an
institution can publish to the Web. Being able to streamline workflow means
that the Web team is able to focus on new projects and respond more quickly to
emerging technologies, rather than spending all of their time on updating the
site.</p>

<h3>4. to help people find your Web
  site</h3>
<p>The way
people use the Web has radically changed since the first museum sites launched
in the mid- to late-90s. Today, the majority of people find sites via external
search engines, not by coming through the front door. A redesign offers a
perfect opportunity to &ldquo;pop the hood&rdquo; of your site and optimize it for search
engines. Changes can be made to your underlying code, metadata, page copy,
links, and file names to ensure that your content is more discoverable by
search engines, ranks higher in results, and is crawled more often.</p>

<h3>5. to align the digital and
  physical brands</h3>
<p>Given that
many museums&rsquo; sites are sometimes over ten years old, institutions may find
themselves with a site that is dated and looks nothing like the rest of their
brand. Redesigns are often undertaken to bring the visual design up-to-date and
into alignment with the character and mission of the institution. This
realignment can also extend beyond the visual design to include functional
enhancements to the site and new features.</p>

<h3>6. to plan for sustainability
  and refreshment</h3>
<p>Redesigning
allows the opportunity to plan for long-term maintenance and refreshment. Since
it could be another five to ten years before your next redesign, this is a
critical time to ask yourself some key questions about your site&rsquo;s future. </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    How will your
    institution need to maintain the site after launch? </li>
  <li>
    What types of content
    and features will you need to plan for over the next several years? </li>
</ul>
<p>By keeping
these questions in mind as you build out your new site, you can ensure a more
flexible system with easier maintenance.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<h3>Know your audience </h3>
<p>The first step of any redesign effort should be learning
who your users are. A redesign is a key opportunity to establish a framework
for understanding your users and how you can best meet their needs. Building a
strong connection between your on-line audience and your museum requires a
clear and nuanced understanding of your users' motives and interests. In
understanding the makeup of your audience, you can make informed decisions
about designs and potential features, set institutional priorities, and build
internal consensus.</p>

<p><b>NGA,</b> after
realizing that taking a purely demographic approach to understanding its
audience offered only limited insights, decided to map its target demographics
to attitudinal traits: that is, how people feel about NGA. These traits were
identified through a series of surveys and focus groups which uncovered
audience motivations for visiting nga.gov. Five attitudinal audience types,
such as the &ldquo;Culture Seeker&rdquo; and &ldquo;Local Advocate,&rdquo; emerged from the research. </p>

<p class="caption"><img src="burnette.fig8-thumb.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="500" height="297" /></p>

<p class="caption">Fig 8: A Persona developed for the National Gallery of Art's Web site, <a href="http://www.nga.gov">http://www.nga.gov</a> </p>

<p>It became clear during&nbsp;NGA&rsquo;s research that these
&ldquo;attitudes,&rdquo; rather than the demographic profile, played a greater role in
users&rsquo; appreciation of nga.gov and their overall satisfaction with the
experience.</p>

<p><b>SFMOMA</b> learned,
through an intensive user research project conducted with Hot Studio (Mitroff
and Alcorn, 2007), that their users were not fully aware of SFMOMA&rsquo;s range of
on-site public programming, and that they wanted the museum to contextualize
its collection more explicitly. To this end, the new SFMOMA Web site provides
easy and seamless access to information about museum programs, and contextual
information&nbsp;focusing on artworks and artists in the collection.</p>

<p>Early in their project, MoMA decided to feature different
audience perspectives, such as filmgoers or educators, within the content
organization of their new site. This direction was later confirmed through a
series of focus groups and evaluations. What began as audience-specific portal
pages gathering the content together for different audience types eventually
took the approach of a &ldquo;social bar&rdquo; which permeates personalization features
throughout the site and offers content suggestions based on a selected
perspective. </p>

<p>Regardless of the size of your museum, there are many
methodologies you can use to understand your audience and shape the big picture
of your redesign goals. Tools such as focus groups, in-person surveys, on-line
surveys, and site statistics can give you valuable insight into your users.</p>

<h3>Know your brand</h3>
<p>Evaluating the museum&rsquo;s brand or overall identity, together
with learning how that plays out in the institution&rsquo;s existing on-line
presence, was a key part of each of the four redesign projects described here.</p>

<p><b>The&nbsp;National Gallery</b>,
working with brand consultancy The Partners, expressed the&nbsp;institution&rsquo;s&nbsp;brand
with four key tonal values: Eminent, Elegant, Inspiring, and Inclusive. These
tonal values, along with the goal of engaging the public in
the&nbsp;experience&nbsp;of the art, became the drivers against which all
aspects of the project were measured.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>NGA f</b>ound
through their studies that the NGA brand was effectively deployed across a variety
of media - except in the on-line environment, where they identified a need to
maintain the museum&rsquo;s existing quiet authority while making the voice stronger,
richer, and more personally engaging to the on-line visitors.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>Both SFMOMA and MoMA</b>
conducted studies about visitors&rsquo; perceptions of their museums. SFMOMA found
that their visitors - while supportive of the museum and enthusiastic about the
exhibitions - felt an absence of emotional engagement and connection. Through
studies organized by the education and marketing departments, MoMA learned that
while they had a strong reputation for having a first-class collection, it was
only those people who had some kind of deeper connection with the museum - whether
through experiencing an educational program or exploring the interpretive
materials - who had a strong emotional attachment to it, regarding it as a
place of inspiration and refuge. As an outcome in both cases, capturing the
experience of the museum on their redesigned Web sites became more central than
representing the physical place.</p>

<h3>It&rsquo;s About the People More Than the Technology</h3>
<p>As with most projects within an organization, it&rsquo;s about
the people, not the technology. You can have the best systems on the market,
but if the people working on the project don&rsquo;t truly understand the problems
you are trying to solve, your project will suffer. Three months into
production, <b>SFMOMA </b>had to make the
painful choice to change CMS vendors and start over because the vendor&rsquo;s team
had underestimated the complexity of their system. The vendor they ultimately
chose had a small, local team that was so smart, creative, and assertive that
their technology solution became secondary to how their developers approached
the design challenges inherent in the Web site.</p>

<p>For <b>MoMA,</b>
experience on a previous project ultimately&nbsp;led to the decision to build
the new Web site primarily in-house. A few years earlier, MoMA had called a
halt to an on-line calendar project&nbsp;because the consultants ultimately did
not understand the complexities of representing the variety of the museum&rsquo;s
programs. The internal team, realizing that they were best positioned to
understand the needs of the museum, decided to develop the project themselves.
That project, which launched in 2006, laid the technical groundwork for the
current Web site project and helped shape the museum&rsquo;s approach to the redesign
implementation, where the base site was built internally with additional
components developed by key consultants. </p>

<p>In addition
to the system implementation, the sustainability of a new Web site is defined
by the people involved. For <b>MoMA,</b> this meant building a set of custom tools in-house so that the team would have
true system ownership and would develop institutional knowledge about how to
manage it. For <b>SFMOMA</b>, this meant
literally working side-by-side with local vendors who could train their
in-house team during the development process, and building an ongoing relationship
with local vendors whom they could call upon as members of an extended team.</p>

<h3>Everyone Has an Opinion</h3>
<p>One of the
most difficult things to manage during the course of any project, especially
those that are heavily design-led, is the desire of a broad range of interested
parties to express their own opinions. Sometimes this input can be extremely
valuable and can produce highly creative solutions; however, it can also be
poorly timed, random in nature, or unhelpful if not managed effectively.</p>

<p>Since the
Web is a highly visual medium that all staff members use in their everyday
lives, an unspoken assumption has developed that everyone represents a typical user,
and therefore everyone&rsquo;s thoughts and experiences constitute &ldquo;user feedback.&rdquo;
The trick here is to separate the various stages of the design process into
discrete packages that enable those managing the project to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Actively solicit
    input at the stages of design development where it will be most useful </li>
  <li>
    Set expectations,
    define and stick to agreed roles and responsibilities </li>
  <li>
    Manage the input of
    others in terms of feedback, comment, and criticism, while ensuring they don&rsquo;t
    try to come up with the solution - that&rsquo;s the designer&rsquo;s job! </li>
  <li>
    Make effective use
    of audience research data when addressing issues of functionality, usability,
    or aesthetics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are
some high-level strategies, employed by all four organizations, which were
found to be most effective in ensuring a positive design outcome:</p>

<p class="MsoListContinue"><b>Gather evidence</b>:&nbsp; Know your target
audiences and their behaviors, goals, and abilities. This will ensure design
decisions can be made in the best interest of the user rather than the
organization or individual staff members. This might take the form of on-line
surveys, interviews, user tracking, statistical data, or focus groups.</p>

<p class="MsoListContinue"><b>Seek staff input early in the
process</b>:&nbsp;
Internal stakeholder meetings are vital in establishing a shared understanding.
Use the outcome of meetings, coupled with your user data, to refine your brief.</p>

<p class="MsoListContinue"><b>Make it personal</b>: Terms like &ldquo;user,&rdquo;
&ldquo;visitor,&rdquo; and &ldquo;audience&rdquo; are too vague when trying to determine if a design is
going to work or not. Develop personas that represent the &ldquo;real&rdquo; people who
will be using your site, and use these to test whether a solution is the right
one. </p>

<p class="MsoListContinue"><b>Test for success</b>: However short on time,
budget, or resources you may be, it&rsquo;s vital to test your design on others. </p>

<h3>Keeping Momentum and Enthusiasm Is Crucial</h3>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ve
defined your project, procured the funding, and assembled your team. Now the
leadership aspect of the job really begins. The success of any project is never
solely about the choice of technology or the elegance of your design: it rests
on the people involved in its creation. Their combined skills, ability to work
as a team, and ongoing enthusiasm and commitment to the project (through good
times and bad) are essential for its overall success.</p>

<p>Here are
some of the main leadership techniques that were employed at the National Gallery,
MoMA, and SFMOMA: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Defining and
    articulating a shared vision for the project, and then keeping everyone focused
    on it over the lifetime of the development (Kotter, 1996) </li>
  <li>
    Building a
    &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; project team that mixed skill sets, personalities, and traits (Belbin,
    1993;&nbsp;Barr, L. and Barr, N., 1989) </li>
  <li>
    Avoiding
    micro-management and establishing a state of &ldquo;distributed leadership&rdquo; whereby
    all staff involved are encouraged to lead within their own areas </li>
  <li>
    Taking advantage of
    learning opportunities reflected throughout the life span of the project, and
    embedding that learning within the team (Argyris, 1999) </li>
  <li>
    Establishing a
    sense of urgency by setting mini-deadlines to focus the team, and recognizing
    successful completion of phases&nbsp;(Kotter, 1996) </li>
  <li>
    Providing some
    &ldquo;quick wins,&rdquo; and recognizing what has been accomplished along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>As it could be months, perhaps even years, before you
cross the finish line for your project, learning to keep yourself and your team
focused and motivated will be vital for success. If you treat a Web site
redesign as something akin to running a series of back-to-back marathons, you
begin to understand the kind of commitment required on everyone&rsquo;s part in order
to reach your end goal.</p>

<h3>Specify, Specify, Specify</h3>
<p>Developing specifications for your new site is an
extremely important - and often painful - part of the process. It represents
the training sessions before you run the first marathon. Whether you develop
all of your specifications in-house, or rely on external consultants to guide
you through the process, doing as much up-front planning as possible is
critical. From auditing all of your existing assets and content to developing
the metadata schemas to accompany that content, the more you can document and
specify, the easier your implementation will be.</p>

<p>Whether you choose to develop your specifications in-house
or work with outside consultants is determined by a combination of factors,
including your budget, timeline, the size and experience of your internal team,
and the culture of your organization.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>MoMA</b> found that
providing their consultants with preliminary specifications and having them, in
turn, develop the final detailed specifications, while adding a bit more to the
expense, was a useful technique in determining if there were any
misunderstandings or areas of confusion, and ensured that both sides had
thought through and explored any major issues.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>SFMOMA</b> chose to
develop all of the specifications in-house and spent several months developing
a suite of extremely detailed documentation ranging from an XML schema to an
extensive content inventory.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>The National
Gallery </b>also developed their specifications&nbsp;solely&nbsp;in-house, in
large part due to budget&nbsp;restrictions, but in retrospect they would have
benefited&nbsp;from a specialist consultant working as a bridge between the
internal team and the CMS vendor.&nbsp;The most significant challenges have
all&nbsp;arisen&nbsp;from gaps or ambiguity in the specifications.&nbsp;This,
coupled with an&nbsp;underestimation by the vendor of the&nbsp;complexities
involved in moving large amounts of static content to a dynamic system, has
significantly impacted on the overall timeline for the development. </p>

<p>At the outset of their project, NGA established a vendor
procurement strategy that would allow them a fast and smooth transition from
Request for Proposal (RFP) to signed contract. They spent several months
developing an extremely detailed RFP, complete with deliverables and background
materials. This RFP essentially transitioned smoothly into a contract, and
allowed them to move from vendor selection to contract signing in less than a
month&rsquo;s time.</p>

<h3>Evaluate All Technology Options to Find the Best Fit</h3>
<p>When shifting from static, brochureware Web sites to
dynamic, database-driven ones, the choice of back-end technology becomes a key
component to the success and longevity of the Web site. Each of the museums
that have reached or passed the development phase of their projects spent
significant time researching different CMSs, including existing, off-the-shelf
solutions, open-source software, and custom solutions.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>NGA </b>is currently examining mid-tier open-source and commercial
off-the-shelf CMS solutions&nbsp;that will integrate with a new calendar,
search feature, and visit planning system, so that the main Web site content
and the calendar can be updated at the same time via the CMS.</p>

<p>For <b>SFMOMA,</b>
because their IT department had limited staff and resources and there were no
plans to expand their Web team, one of their main requirements was to use an
existing CMS from a company that could provide them with ongoing support. After
changing initial vendors, they ended up with a solution built on open-source
technologies but containing all the features of an enterprise-ready CMS, and
included an annual support contract with the vendor. &nbsp; </p>

<p><b>MoMA,</b> on the
other hand, decided to build the specific required components themselves on a
Ruby on Rails open-source platform. While the MoMA Web team&nbsp;also&nbsp;was
not expanding, the existing staff had the knowledge needed to take this
approach, and flexibility and customizability were high priorities when
analyzing the different possible solutions. Outside consultants provided both
the on-line collection section and the &ldquo;social bar&rdquo; components to the site. </p>

<p><b>The National Gallery</b>
decided early on in the procurement process to select a CMS vendor who would
partner&nbsp;closely&nbsp;with&nbsp;them, in order to augment the internal
team&rsquo;s&nbsp;experience and skills. The system itself had to be cost effective,
due to the fixed procurement budget, and sustainable, with a lifespan of three
to four years. With limited&nbsp;in-house&nbsp;programming resources, they
required a mid-range off-the-shelf solution that the vendor could customize. An
open-source solution was deemed potentially too difficult to support in the
long term. However, most importantly, like NGA and SFMOMA, they wanted a
partner to aid them throughout the whole process.&nbsp; </p>

<p>While there is not one solution that works for all
museums, the lesson learned from these institutions is to look at your existing
team and resources carefully and think about how the different technological
solutions support or integrate with them. Prioritize what is required and look
at the tools and consultants that best meet those priorities. Avoid the trap of
trying to fit your project to a solution, and look instead for the solution
that best fits your project. You&rsquo;ll have to live with the outcome for a long
time, so think through the options carefully!</p>

<h3>Be Flexible and Realistic</h3>
<p>When you first start a major redesign project, throw open the
doors and consider all ideas, big and small. But at some point, the realities
of budget, staffing, and scheduling hit, and you need to balance and prioritize
the wishes and dreams.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>SFMOMA</b> worked
with outside consultants who led them through a formal feature prioritization
workshop as part of the strategy phase. They gathered together their
stakeholder team and went through every potential feature on the table,
prioritizing features and functionality based on institutional needs, user
needs, and technical feasibility. They then ranked features in a matrix, and
used this matrix to develop their requirements and project phases. While some
features were pushed into phases two and three, other features - while worthy
and valid - were dropped.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Both MoMA
and the National Gallery undertook similar exercises, which were managed by the
internal Digital and New Media teams. The National Gallery, after carrying out
their stakeholder meetings, assembled a cross-departmental team to brainstorm
ideas and then reviewed them in light of their user personas. Creative
suggestions were rated to identify which ideas were most suitable for each persona
while doing the least &ldquo;harm&rdquo; to others. This methodology was adapted from one
demonstrated by Neilsen Norman Group (<a href="http://www.nngroup.com">http://www.nngroup.com</a>);  it was felt to be a valuable tool
when attempting to balance the&nbsp;organization's aspirations, creative ideas,
and user needs.</p>

<p>While <b>SFMOMA</b> had outside consultants lead
them through the process, both MoMA and the National Gallery did this
internally using the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying the
    internal stakeholders&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    gathering a list of
    all the ideas that people came up with</li>
  <li>
    sifting through
    those ideas, removing overlap </li>
  <li>
    prioritizing based
    on the overall goals of the museum and the redesign project</li>
</ul>
<p>The objective is to come up with a cohesive vision for the
Web site and the project rather than a constellation of ideas. This approach
can be applied to museums both large and small. The ultimate goal is to ensure
that you end up with a solid foundation on which to develop your ideas over a
longer timeframe. You can&rsquo;t do everything at once, but you want to ensure that
you avoid limiting your options by your choice of CMS, structure, or design.
And be aware that no matter how realistic and well-defined your project is,
something will always arise to cause scope creep or a necessary shift. The need
to be flexible and realistic while keeping the end goal in focus is one of the
biggest challenges of a redesign project. The only thing you can be sure of
going into the project is that you will discover something during the process
that you didn&rsquo;t anticipate when you began. </p>

<h3>Deadlines Are Good</h3>
<p>Despite extensive planning and&nbsp;preparation, all four
redesign projects have had their project schedules shift at least once. In the
case of <b>SFMOMA</b>, they decided to
change their CMS vendors midway through the project, <b>MoMA </b>had to&nbsp;rework some of the design and structure of their
site to accommodate a change in the overall museum branding approach and the
introduction of a new marketing advisory group. The <b>National Gallery</b> had to spend more time addressing&nbsp;technical
issues in order to integrate their Web site CMS with their collection management
system.  <b>NGA </b>lengthened their
schedule to allow for more creative design development.&nbsp; </p>

<p>These types of delay are not atypical when undertaking such
complex projects, and it&rsquo;s important to be flexible and adapt to changes during
the course of any development. However, it is still vital to ensure deadlines
are defined, agreed upon, achievable, and preferably &ldquo;real.&rdquo; Having a &ldquo;real&rdquo;
deadline forces you to make choices and get the project done.&nbsp;Deadlines
also provide for all involved a sense of urgency that is necessary for such an
ambitious undertaking. Where possible, it&rsquo;s&nbsp;beneficial&nbsp;to
establish&nbsp;a number of mini-deadlines (that you don&rsquo;t let slip along the
way), as they give a sense of progress toward your end point, and ensure that
the final launch date is realistic.&nbsp; Many different factors can drive an
end date. For example, SFMOMA&rsquo;s relaunch&nbsp;was tied to the opening of a
major exhibition for which the Web was a key component.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In order to
collaborate and communicate as effectively as possible during the course of the
project, all four of our organizations made as much use as possible of sharing,
tracking, and communication tools such as project wikis, bug trackers, and
collaborative workspaces. These tools were also helpful in mitigating the
concept of &ldquo;museum time&rdquo; as much as possible. To safeguard your&nbsp;relationship&nbsp;with
your vendor, it may be important to introduce them to this concept early on. &ldquo;Museum
time&rdquo; is the time it takes an organization to approve something and turn it
around. Many vendors are used to accelerated schedules and quick feedback, but
most museums&nbsp;just can&rsquo;t move that quickly due to their discursive
decision-making, complex approval processes, and  need to establish buy-in.
Feedback for a deliverable may take two weeks when the vendor is used to two
days. If this is the case, you should determine the budget implications for a
longer project schedule as a result of extended turn-around times. Setting up
parallel rather than iterative deliverables may also be useful so that &ldquo;museum
time&rdquo; does not derail your project. </p>

<h3>The Launch Is the Beginning, Not the End</h3>
<p>The paint never dries on pixels, and that&rsquo;s both a
blessing and a curse. Because of this, you can choose to deploy additional
features post-launch, and iterate new functionalities as you develop them. This
is a blessing for&nbsp;under-staffed and
under-resourced&nbsp;museum&nbsp;teams&nbsp;in that you can phase in features
over time,&nbsp;but it&rsquo;s also a curse in that when we tell our users or
colleagues that something is &ldquo;coming soon,&rdquo; we really are expected to deliver. </p>

<p>Unless you have the luxury of doubling your in-house
resources and securing funding for everything in one fiscal year, don&rsquo;t try to
do everything at once. Break your project into pieces, and then budget for them
accordingly. MoMA, SFMOMA, NGA, and the National Gallery identified the
&ldquo;must-have&rdquo; features for launch, and then documented which features would be
rolled out later. Formally documenting which feature goes into which phase
allows you to factor in future developments and to be clear about your priorities.
It also reminds staff that version 1.0 is not the end. SFMOMA launched their Web
site with over 100 open bugs, some 30 incomplete features, and the knowledge
that they had two more phases ahead.</p>

<p>Despite its inherently unfinished nature, deploying a
tangible new site will go a long way to boosting team morale and building
confidence within the organization. However, be prepared for
the&nbsp;inevitable&nbsp;feedback and requests for even more features and new
&ldquo;toys&rdquo;: when people in your museum see it, they will think of all sorts of
other things you could add!</p>

<h3>Be Ready to Evaluate and Respond to Feedback</h3>
<p>When your new Web site goes live, you will become
painfully aware of what is and is not working. Despite your best intentions to
design a user-centered Web site, it&rsquo;s inevitable to discover some issues
post-launch. Because the Web site is such a highly visible and public tool, users
and staff will not hold back in telling you what they think.</p>

<p>The SFMOMA team was confronted with
the&nbsp;reality&nbsp;of this when issues with their navigation came to light.
Complaints to the Web master and the&nbsp;museum&rsquo;s&nbsp;front-line staff
alerted the team to the fact that people were struggling to find
the&nbsp;museum&rsquo;s&nbsp;opening hours and that there were missing links to key
top-level pages. This problem was confirmed when they&nbsp;analyzed&nbsp;the
traffic statistics and reviewed their log files. The solution: a quick modification
to the navigation and the addition of the opening hours to the footer of every
page.&nbsp;E-mails about this problem decreased to zero, searches for hours
dropped by 79%, and traffic to the top-level pages via the navigation increased
by 50%. </p>

<p>Alongside user feedback, formal evaluations can be critical
in uncovering issues. It&rsquo;s a myth that you need a large budget to conduct an
evaluation. Inexpensive on-line survey tools, free services such as Google
Analytics, and interviews with users can all be used to assess your site. At
the time of writing, SFMOMA is conducting a summative evaluation through on-line
surveys and user interviews.</p>

<h3>Look Beyond Museums</h3>
<p>It would be&nbsp;disingenuous&nbsp;to deny that museum Web
sites are competing with all forms of on-line cultural engagement. To
be&nbsp;competitive and relevant within this arena, it&rsquo;s vital that we look for
inspiration and innovation as widely as possible. There are pertinent lessons
to be learned from sites as diverse as NetFlix (<a href="http://www.netflix.com">http://www.netflix.com</a>)
and immersive 3D environments. The emergence of on-line&nbsp;communities and
networks like Facebook (<a href="http://www.facebook.com">http://www.facebook.com</a>)
and Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com">http://twitter.com</a>)&nbsp;also
affords us opportunities to build&nbsp;loyalty&nbsp;beyond our own Web sites.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Web site redesign can be greatly enhanced by a bit of
&ldquo;horizon scanning&rdquo; as early on in the process as possible. To aid in this, The
Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project is a useful resource for following
trends (<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org">http://www.pewinternet.org</a>).&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>From the
need to enhance the on-line visitor experience to streamlining the
infrastructures, there are many reasons to undertake a Web site redesign
project. No matter which combinations of factors conspire to initiate the
project, they all represent a significant opportunity to instigate change,
whether personal, team based, or organizational. </p>

<p>This paper,
focusing on the experiences of four leading institutions, has highlighted a perhaps
surprising number of similarities between their projects, regardless of the
specific technologies they used, the type of CMSs they ultimately selected, or
the size and make-up of their teams. Reviewing the lessons learned illustrates
that there are no absolute rights or wrongs when attempting to develop a new Web
site for a museum. They do, however, offer valuable insight into some
potentially winning formulas. Reflecting on these projects has shown that even
the best-laid plans often need to be revised once projects are up and running. </p>

<p>In
conclusion, whether you are in the discovery phase or weeks away from launch,
there are real opportunities to benefit from the experiences of those that have
gone before. It&rsquo;s reassuring to know that you are not alone in the challenges
faced in planning, developing, and deploying your new Web site. </p>
