	    <h2 class="PaperTitle">Festival Karsh</h2>
	    <p>December 23, 2008 marked the 100th anniversary of the birth
		    of Yousuf Karsh (Fig. 1), widely recognized as Canada&rsquo;s leading
	    portrait photographer of the 20th century.&nbsp; </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="rahim-fig01-yousuf-karsh-500px.png" alt="figure 1" width="500" height="399" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig. 1: Yousuf Karsh. Photo &copy; Lois Siegal</p>
	    <p>To celebrate this milestone, the Portrait Gallery of Canada
		    (PGC) <a href="../http://www.portraits.gc.ca/">http://www.portraits.gc.ca/</a>, in collaboration with the Canada Science and
		    Technology Museum (CSTM) <a href="../http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/">http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/</a>, will present
	    Festival Karsh in Ottawa from June 12 to October 12, 2009. </p>
	    <p>Festival Karsh includes a major exhibition at the CSTM, the
		    Karsh Trail of locations significant to Mr. Karsh&rsquo;s life and work, the Web site
		    <a href="../http://www.festivalkarsh.ca/">http://www.festivalkarsh.ca/</a>, and a roster of special events and programming.
		    The exhibition will then be available for circulation to museums and galleries
	    until 2012.</p>
	    <p>Karsh photographed heads of state, celebrities, producing
		    iconic portraits of some of the most notable figures of the 20th century
	      &ndash; Winston Churchill (Fig. 2),
		    Andy Warhol, Nelson Mandela, Marshall McLuhan, Audrey Hepburn, Benazir Bhutto
		    and many more. However, throughout his career, he was also known as &lsquo;Karsh of
	    Ottawa&rsquo; both as a local photographer and a community leader. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="rahim-fig02-winston-churchill-500px.png" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="620" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig. 2: Winston Churchill</p>
	    <p>By the time he closed his studio doors at Ottawa&rsquo;s downtown
		    hotel, the Ch&acirc;teau Laurier, for the last time in 1992, Yousuf Karsh had created photographic portraits of more than 11,000 leading local, national,
		    and international sitters that spanned six decades. He also welcomed sittings
		    of ordinary residents of the region, such as portraits of debutantes, children,
		    weddings and soldiers, and made passport photos and advertising photographs.
		    His proper name was colloquially transformed into a verb, as his subjects and
	    sitters spoke of &lsquo;being Karshed&rsquo;.</p>
	    <h2>Opportunity</h2>
	    <p>Aware of the importance of Mr. Karsh&rsquo;s work to the social
		    history of Ottawa, the exhibition team was very interested in seeing images
	    that might not have been included in the Karsh Fonds at the Portrait Gallery of Canada. </p>
	    <p>Outreach objectives for both partners included the desire to
		    actively engage the public in Festival Karsh, and to build interest in the
	    exhibition and programming coming in 2009.</p>
	    <p>The solicitation of personal images for potential inclusion
		    in the exhibition had been part of the exhibition concept from the beginning;
		    however gaining access to numerous private holdings and developing effective
	    procedures to review them presented challenges.&nbsp; </p>
	    <h2>Challenges</h2>
	    <p>Given the photographer&rsquo;s sixty-year career, many of his
		    subjects are now quite elderly, which raised the team&rsquo;s concerns about their
		    comfort level with new technologies. The invitation to Karsh&rsquo;s subjects, or
		    their descendents, to share their Karsh portraits and to recount the experience
		    of being photographed must necessarily respect their preferred means of
	    communication.</p>
	    <p>Another challenge was the desire to find a solution that did
		    not unduly weigh down the collaborative teams already committed to developing
		    the main Web presence, the Karsh Trail with its multiple partners, the major
	    exhibition and programming and activities. </p>
	    <p>Due to the collaborative nature of the initiative, a
		    distinct and autonomous entity presence was desired, clearly associated to the
	    two institutions yet with its own distinct branding</p>
	    <h2>Solution</h2>
	    <p>Flickr (Fig. 3), the user engagement Web site specifically conceived to allow
		    people to share images and content, provided the most appropriate means to
		    address these considerations. Establishment of a Flickr Group named My Karsh
		    has allowed people to look at Karsh images and read stories, to comment on
	    these images and stories, and of course to make contributions of their own. </p>
	    <p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.flickr.com/groups/mykarsh-monkarsh/"><img src="rahim-fig03-my-karsh-screen-capture-500px.png" alt="figure 3" width="500" height="684" /></a></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig. 3: Flickr group screen
	      capture<br />
	      <a href="../http://www.flickr.com/groups/mykarsh-monkarsh/">http://www.flickr.com/groups/mykarsh-monkarsh/</a></p>
	    <p>Four images and stories were used to &lsquo;seed&rsquo; My Karsh,
		    providing a model for people and an inspiration for their own contributions (Fig. 4). The initiative was launched with a media event on November 27, 2008, where the
	    first four images and stories were shared (Fig. 5).</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="rahim-fig04-lilly-koltun-500px.png" alt="fig 4" width="500" height="666" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig. 4: One of the four images Dr. Lilly Koltun</p>

	    <p class="caption">Fig. 5: Media
        event at the Portrait Gallery of Canada</p>
	    <p>Multiple methods for participation were devised to ensure
		    equitable access to the experience. Instructions were kept deliberately simple
	    to encourage people to choose among three ways to contribute:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Those
		      with a Flickr account can add their image and story directly to the My
	      Karsh group. </li>
      <li>People
        can email their image and story to <a href="mailto:mykarsh@technomuses.ca">mykarsh@technomuses.ca</a>; an
        administrator adds them to the My Karsh Flickr group. </li>
      <li>People
        less accustomed to the practices of Web 2.0 can telephone the Portrait
        Gallery of Canada or send an e-mail to portraits@lac-bac.gc.ca; a staff
        member contacts the individual directly to follow up and ensure that the
        submitted image is catalogued, scanned, optimized for Web and posted to
        the Flickr Group.</li>
          </ul>
	    <p>To ensure appropriate access to both of Canada&rsquo;s official
		    language communities, both English and French interfaces were created, and the
		    group can also be accessed as Mon Karsh; all Festival Karsh contributions are
		    posted in both official languages and images are tagged in both; individuals
	    engage or comment in the language of their choice.</p>
	    <h2>Results</h2>
	    <p>Within two weeks, 24 people had responded to the call by
		    sharing 60 images. In most cases, the photographs were accompanied by personal
		    memoirs of the experience, or anecdotes about the significance of the portrait
	    within their family histories. </p>
	    <p>The methods selected to provide materials show a significant
		    preference for using e-mail with attachments. Despite the expectation that
		    traditional communication would be the preferred option, to date less than a
	    third choose it.</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Ten
	      percent used Flickr directly.</li>
      <li>Two-thirds
        used e-mail to send images that were then posted by the administrator. </li>
      <li>The
        rest selected the more traditional methods of phoning or writing.</li>
          </ul>
	    <p>Several typologies can be identified among the My Karsh
	    subjects</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>many
	      subjects commissioned their photographs to advance (Fig. 6) or to celebrate their careers (Fig. 7), as a mark of their achievement or their potential</li>
          </ul>

	    <ul>
	      <li>several
	        people have shared images made over a period of decades, representing
	        multiple generations of their family who have had their portraits made by
          Mr. Karsh (Fig. 8)</li>

	    <p>Some unanticipated contributions have complemented the
		    expected portraits by Yousuf Karsh. These
		    contributions and the comments are evidence that the Flickr encourages the
		    creation of genuine communities, each of which interprets the invitation in
	    their own way.</p>
	    <p>Professional photographers recount their meetings with Mr Karsh as being significant moments that inspired their
		    own careers. The images they have uploaded are their portraits of the great
	    photographer (Fig. 9).</p>

	    <p>Students of black and white portraiture techniques practice
	    their craft by replicating Karsh&rsquo;s style in their own work (Fig. 10).&nbsp; </p>

	    <p>The BE LIKE KARSH meetup has been
	      particularly active, making and sharing pictures that demonstrate that
	      imitation is the sincerest form of flattery (Fig. 11).</p>

	    <p>By the end of January, 92 items had been added by thirty
		    contributors. With the early February launch of the Web site, and the
		    visibility and cross-promotion in the coming months, it is anticipated that
		    Festival Karsh will produce more waves of interest and contributions to My
		    Karsh. The My Karsh community, born on Flickr, continues to grow and evolve,
		    and the user generated content from the virtual exercise will be integrated
	    into the real space exhibition.</p>
