		<h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
		<p class="AbstractText">The Gemeentemuseum in The Hague is a museum for
    contemporary art and the applied arts. &ldquo;Down To Earth&rdquo; presents a case study of
    the museum&rsquo;s recent project, a five-month survey, in which various staff
    members were interviewed about their knowledge, level of participation,
    attitude and opinion regarding new social media and community centered
    projects. Those interviewed included directors; curators; some collections
    workers, including restorers; some of those involved in documentation, in
    education, in exhibitions, in ICT; some marketing staff and some in public
    relations. </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">The data collected was used to identify five different
    user types: lecturers; educators; presenters; interactors and connectors. On
    the basis of these types, a viable and differentiated approach to social media
    could be planned and put into practice. Central to this approach is a focus on
    the development of sustainable solutions that fit the museum and its staff. The
    paper shows how a rather traditional, conservative museum can create its own strategies
    for dealing with new media in this way. </p>

	    <h2>Introduction </h2>
	    <p>We are living in a time of a &ldquo;digital revolution&rdquo; engendered
		    by information technology and characterized by functions and processes that are
		    increasingly organized around networks: open, highly dynamic and interconnected
	    systems of information.</p>
	    <p>Since the mid 1990s, museums have been influenced by this
		    revolution in profound ways, not only because of the new possibilities
		    sophisticated technologies offer in day-to-day work, for instance in the
		    registration of collections, but also, and more importantly, because these
		    technologies provoke profound change, both within museums and in their
		    relations with the public. One important part of that change is to be seen in
		    the shift in power, no longer held only within the museums; the interaction
		    with the public using new technologies means that the public also has a say in
		    the activities of the museum. Regarding public institutions in general and
		    museums in particular, this means that their role in society is under
		    discussion, that activities within the walls of museums are changing, opening
		    up to the outside, and that from without the patterns of expectation regarding
	    museums are developing. </p>
	    <p>In this context, the Web offers unlimited possibilities for
		    engaging and interacting with different sectors of the public: there is a culturally
		    interested public; a public specifically focused on a museum or museums in
		    general; a public interested in a particular theme; and the expert public, the
	    latter often highly knowledgeable in a specific field.</p>
	    <p>The European Union supports efforts to make
		    use of new technologies to offer these different sectors greater access to what
		    were once called by the Union &ldquo;Europe&rsquo;s warehouses of cultural content&rdquo;. The
		    Gemeentemuseum, an art and applied arts museum situated in The Hague, aims to
		    take advantage of this support; that is, to expand its current applications and
		    to find ways of using new media, both within the museum and in its
		    relationships to the different sectors of the public. The ultimate aim is to
		    build up, from the museum itself, a living, on-line community, whose members &#8211;
	      generalist and specialized alike &ndash; are concerned with the experience and
	    knowledge of the collections in the museum.</p>
	    <p>At the start of this project there are two main questions.
		    First, how can a medium-sized, traditional art museum integrate new
		    technologies? Secondly, how can a museum find solutions that fit the 
	    staff using present limited financial resources?</p>
	    <p>To answer these questions, the Gemeentemuseum consulted
		    various external experts. One of the most valuable answers they gave was the
		    suggestion to stop talking exclusively with people outside the museum and start
		    discussing the various issues with the people within it. The Gemeentemuseum
		    should create a low-profile on-line platform where ideas on new media could be
		    discussed and experiments could be undertaken. This platform for discussion
		    would first involve the staff and then, by degrees, be extended to include
		    external experts. But first and foremost, the staff within the museum should be
	    made &ldquo;owners&rdquo;, both of the problems and of the possible solutions.</p>
	    <p>The Gemeentemuseum asked the so-called Catch-team, a group
		    of researchers from the University of Amsterdam, to establish this on-line
		    platform for discussion. The team works together with the museum on the MuSeUM
		    project as part of the Continuous Access To Cultural Heritage (Catch) program
	    of The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). </p>
	    <p>As a working title for the project the term GEMEEN was
		    chosen, a Dutch word for <b>common </b>in
		    both its English senses; that is, in the sense of things we have in common and
		    in the sense of low-profile. In Dutch <i>gemeen </i>also has another meaning besides these two; <i>gemeen</i> is the word for mean in the sense of nasty, often
	    unexpectedly so.</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="Deiser.fig1.jpg" alt="figure 1" width="250" height="83" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 1: <i>Logo</i> GEMEEN</p>
	    <h2>GEMEEN</h2>
	    <p>The project objectives for GEMEEN are as follows: </p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>To set up an experimental
		      on-line platform within the museum for inventing, sharing and discussing
		      ideas, established and innovative, about information exchange. <i>Exchange</i> here means both the
		      exchange of information within the museum and the exchange of information
	      between the museum and the public.</li>
      <li>To establish the concrete
        means towards (1), that is, an easily accessible, laboratory-like
        situation, computer based, in which experiments can be made and discussion
        can be conducted.</li>
      <li>To use the platform to develop
        projects and applications in relation to information exchange based on the
        daily experience and work of the museum staff, using easily available
        software, preferably free or low-cost. </li>
        </ol>
	    <p>In order to develop useful applications of new techniques
		    that fit the special needs of the museum and its staff, the project was divided
	    into four main phases. </p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>For phase one there were three
		      aims: to understand the museum staff and their work; to research the
		      different technological possibilities that could be used in the future;
	      and to start building the on-line platform for discussion.</li>
      <li>In phase two, the platform is
        to be used within the museum. The museum staff is already involved in
        working groups and in testing applications. The staff will be invited to
        offer their feedback on the success of the platform. This should help to
        gain support for the project within the museum.</li>
      <li>In the third phase, external
        experts for museums and IT-specialists will be invited to offer their
        comments and critical advice, thus contributing to the development of the
        platform.</li>
      <li>In the fourth phase the
        platform will be opened up for the use of a wider public.</li>
        </ol>
	    <h2>Knowing Your Position: Survey And Mapping </h2>
	    <p>The first step on the way to building the GEMEEN platform
		    was to gain more knowledge about the attitude of the museum staff. A survey was
		    therefore conducted, using interviews, to evaluate how much the staff knew
		    about new media, how much they used such media, and the extent of their
		    participation in such media. At the same time, the staff were asked to express
		    their opinions about new media projects relating to the public. Another
		    objective was to introduce the idea of building an experimental on-line
		    platform and to investigate the levels of interest, enthusiasm and cooperation
		    the platform would engender in museum staff. The data collected was then used
		    to define different groups of users at the Gemeentemuseum. Based on these definitions,
		    some further strategies of implementing new media into the museum were
	    developed.</p>
	    <h3>Research method</h3>
	    <p>During a two-month period, interviews were conducted with
		    eighteen representatives (nine women and nine men) of the staff of the
		    Gemeentemuseum. They included directors, curators, those working with the
		    collections, including restorers, those in documentation, in education, in
		    exhibitions, in ICT, the marketing staff, and others involved in public
		    relations. Each interview lasted at least fifty minutes, in most cases
	    one-and-a-half hours.</p>
	    <p>The interviews started by outlining the rationale for the
		    survey &ndash; the idea of building an on-line platform for the Gemeentemuseum
		    to conduct experiments with new media.  After this opening, the interviewee was
		    asked about his or her education, function at the Gemeentemuseum, and previous
		    job history. This was followed by specific questions on the use of media in
		    general, as well as new media technologies and the person&rsquo;s particular use of
		    the Internet and Web, both at home and at work. Next, the interviewee was asked
		    to perform a search on community Web services such as Flickr, You Tube and
		    Wikipedia, and to comment on the results. The subject of the search was chosen
	    by the interviewee. </p>
	    <p>The main focus in the second part was the presentation of
		    interactive on-line projects of other museums such as the Community Area of the
		    Brooklyn Museum, New York; the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London; and the
		    Powerhouse Museum, Sydney. The interviewees were asked to give their opinions and
	    comments about the various Web sites of these institutions.</p>
	    <p>The whole session ended with brainstorming about the ideas
		    and wishes of the interviewee with regard to the experimental on-line platform.
		    The person was asked to imagine how he or she could take an active part in the
	    platform.</p>
	    <h2>Research Process and Findings: The Five User Types </h2>
	    <p>The interviews allowed the eighteen persons to be divided
	    according to two main parameters:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>communication style and
	      orientation towards the community;</li>
      <li>knowledge and use of new
        media.</li>
        </ol>
	    <p>The communication style and community
		    orientation of those interviewed varied from a strong interest in two-way
		    communication between the museum and its public though feedback, engagement and
		    inclusion at one extreme, and an orientation towards a mass-media communication
		    style, seeing the museum as the active sender of information and its public as
		    passive receivers of that information at the other. The positions of the
		    interviewees with regard to this parameter reflects both their general attitude
	    towards the public and their way of cooperating within the museum.</p>
	    <p>The second parameter, the person&rsquo;s knowledge and use of new
		    media, ranged those interviewed from those with only a superficial knowledge
		    and a distanced attitude to new media at one extreme, to those with a positive
	    attitude with a highly active use of the new media at the other.</p>
	    <p>By using the two parameters, five user types could be
	    identified. These are now described in turn.</p>
	    <h3>Lecturers</h3>
	    <p>The Lecturers are characterized by a strong focus on
		    content with an almost vocational drive to tell their story to the people
	      &ndash; or lecture. They see themselves as experts who pass on their knowledge
		    and are not much interested in contributions from the public. They are one-way
		    communicators, the message being transmitted from a sender (the museum) to a
		    receiver (the public). Lecturers find interactive, public-orientated projects
		    amateur and exhibitionist. Their knowledge and use of new media, especially the
		    Internet, is basic and distant: they use e-mail and check Web sites to search
		    for information but see no need to raise their level of interaction. Lecturers
		    favor &ldquo;old, traditional&rdquo; media like books, magazine and the radio and perceive
		    the computer as &ldquo;a better typewriter&rdquo;. Still, even Lecturers recognize that new
		    media are important for the future of museums. Lecturers nonetheless represent
		    a group that is generally skeptical about the reliability and quality of Web
		    information and are hostile to increasing open access to museum information.
	    Lecturers fear a &ldquo;total sellout of museum knowledge&rdquo;.</p>
	    <h3>Educators </h3>
	    <p>The main intention of Educators is to &ldquo;educate&rdquo; people in a
		    traditional way: they want to pass on knowledge, communicate on a
		    well-informed, theoretic level, and make sure that the visitors get the
		    message. They are interested in the voices and feedback of their public  mainly
		    to evaluate if they accomplished this aim. They are also willing to offer the
		    public a &ldquo;look behind the scenes&rdquo;; for example, by showing photos of how an
		    exhibition is made or what museum storage looks like. Educators do not want to
		    let the public contribute to the work of the museum. Educators tend to
		    distinguish &ldquo;high art&rdquo; from &ldquo;low art&rdquo; or &ldquo;real art&rdquo; from &ldquo;amateur art&rdquo; and are
		    not eager to allow these two domains to mingle. The interaction level of
		    Educators with the Internet is intermediate: they use e-mail and check Web sites
		    for information but also surf for fun or shopping. Still their attitude towards
		    the Web and new media is indifferent, and they do not use the possibilities in
		    a creative way. As with the Lecturers, they in general prefer old to new media
	      &ndash; but they use both without a feeling of special allegiance to the old.
		    They know of the importance of new media for museums. Educators realize the
	    gaps in their own knowledge and are willing to fill them.</p>
	    <p>Educators are nonetheless skeptical about the reliability,
		    value and quality of Web information and are wary of increasing public access
		    to museum information. Their main belief is that museums are cultural
		    institutions with an independent public contract, and as such they have to keep
		    their distance from the mass of commercial enterprises and their application of
	    new media.</p>
	    <h3>Presenters</h3>
	    <p>Members of this group like to present &ndash; and the bigger
		    the audience, the better. This motto also determines their relationship with
		    new media. They mainly have very precise ideas about how media can help them to
		    reach their objectives; even if they see risks in using media in the museum
		    environment, their priority is nonetheless to reach as many people as possible.
		    If one of the media, for instance the Internet, helps to reach more people, it
	    has to be used.</p>
	    <p>Presenters are advanced in their interaction with the Internet,
		    they use e-mail, surf and shop, skype and blog, and are members of networking
		    sites. As a result they are active users with a positive and open attitude towards
		    new media and the opportunities  they offer. This attitude is paired with a
	    strong interest in the possibilities and techniques of new media. </p>
	    <p>The interest of Presenters in audiences is average: they may
		    want to hear, but mainly they want to tell. In this regard they resemble
		    Educators; they also want to give the public a look behind the scenes but do
		    not want any interference or active contribution from the public. Presenters
		    make the same distinction between real and amateur art and also want to keep
	    the two realms apart.</p>
	    <h3>Interactors</h3>
	    <p>Interactors are community driven: they have an above-average
		    interest in people and the public. They want two-way interaction between the
		    museum and its public in order to bring the museum closer to the people and to
		    integrate museum themes and issues into their lives. Interactors believe that
		    people and visitors should be stimulated to tell their own stories, give their
		    points of view, and share their experiences with others, and feel that the
	    museum must offer a platform for this. </p>
	    <p>Interactors use the Internet in an intermediate way. They
		    use e-mail, do Web site searches and surf for fun or shopping. Like Educators,
		    however, they have an uncommitted and indifferent attitude towards new media.
		    They are not creative nor highly motivated in their use of new media and prefer
	      &ldquo;old&rdquo; to &ldquo;new&rdquo; ones. They use both happily, however, and they are also willing
		    to learn more about the interesting possibilities new media offer. This group
		    is nonetheless indifferent to, or lacks awareness of, the problems of new media
	    use, such as copyright, open access, data security or interoperability.</p>
	    <h3>Connectors</h3>
	    <p>Connectors combine developed skills in using new media with
		    a high level of awareness of the possibilities of intercommunication and are
		    orientated towards exchange between the museum and the public. They thus have a
		    positive, open and informed attitude towards new media with strong interest in
		    the possibilities and techniques new media offer. Connectors make advanced use
		    of new media: they use e-mail, they surf, shop, skype, blog, and are members of
		    networking Web sites. Connectors are able, active and creative users of new
		    media and have an informed, critical awareness of problems regarding
	    information and authority, copyright, open access, and data security. </p>
	    <p>The survey showed that of the staff at the Gemeentemuseum
		    working with the collections, exhibitions and education, the majority are
		    Educators. The next largest group is Presenters. Lecturers, Interactors and
		    Connectors each comprise a small number. With regard to the new media, this may
		    be seen as a positive result because the very skeptical group, the Lecturers,
		    does not comprise a large number. Nevertheless, the groups most open to the new
		    developments, Interactors and Connectors, also comprise small numbers. These
		    results thus indicate that while a majority is at least open to new
		    developments, interest in new media and active participation in using those
		    media, together with an awareness of the importance of the development of
		    interaction between the museum and the public, to the benefit of both, will
		    require considerable stimulation and support within the museum in the immediate
	    future.</p>

	    <p class="caption">Fig 2: Gemeentemuseum Staff Mapping</p>
	    <h2>Future Strategies and Recommendations </h2>
	    <p>The final report of the survey concluded with a series of
		    suggestions for the next stages of the development of the GEMEEN on-line
	    platform. These are discussed next.</p>
	    <h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop GEMEEN from inside to outside</h3>
	    <p class="MsoListParagraph">Before opening up to a wider public, the museum
		    should invest time in developing the museum staff&rsquo;s awareness of the platform.
		    The aim should be to involve a high proportion of the staff &ndash; including
		    departments that were not included in the survey &ndash; in thinking about the
		    implications of the information age, the network culture, and the possibilities
		    and consequences of new media for museums in general and this museum in
		    particular. This can be achieved in the first place by stimulating discussion
		    of the subject matter across a broad spectrum of those working in the museum,
		    thus building a network of people from all sectors who work actively on the
		    project. Another aim is to ensure that more museum workers develop an
		    understanding of how new media, including the Internet and Web 2.0, can
		    actually be applied at the museum, including in this practical awareness an
	    understanding of the possible risks involved and how these could be managed.</p>
	    <h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Address common barriers &ndash; be transparent</h3>
	    <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">Throughout the interviews, potential
		    barriers to the project became apparent. These must therefore be addressed if
	    the opening up to new media is to succeed. </p>
	    <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">The barriers became apparent in general
		    questions like: &ldquo;Why does the museum have to take part in this development at
		    all?&rdquo; This very fundamental question must be seen as a reaction to the fact
		    that new technologies challenge the museum in everything it is &ndash; from its
		    practices to its self-conception. Other concerns play a considerable role here
		    too; for instance, museums are often not in the habit of generally opening up
		    their collections and resources to the public; they are used to consumer
		    audiences, not to a public that would like to take part in the museum&rsquo;s
		    activities, to share their knowledge and opinions with the museum - in short,
		    to interact with the museum. In this respect it is probably the curators in
		    particular who are concerned that the authority of the museum will be
		    undermined if such interaction were to become a way in which the museum
	    functioned.</p>
	    <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">From the point of view of the museum&rsquo;s
		    identity in the public domain, marketing and communication staff is averse to
		    the idea of external parties adding, editing or changing the image of the museum.
		    Other barriers are less obvious: some information is more or less confidential,
		    and opening up the resources of the museum might be seen to pose a threat to
		    that confidentiality: opening up the resources and contents of the museum
		    through new media is predicted to swamp the museum with demands for access,
		    threatening the quality of the services offered by the museum. Other typical
		    questions that were raised involved costs. For example: &ldquo;Why should we make our
		    knowledge accessible for free?&rdquo; Others involved legal questions concerning
		    privacy and liability:  the Web is well known for the dissemination of
		    information without formal contractual agreements regarding, for instance,
	    authorship or copyright.</p>
	    <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">For all these questions there are no automatic
		    answers. Instead, the issues have to be tested in practice and if they are
		    found to be real issues rather than imagined fears, solutions that fit the
		    museum must be found. Central here is the necessity for discussion on these
		    issues among the museum staff: the need for their concerns to be heard and
		    addressed actively. In the meantime, an open and transparent attitude on the
		    part of those promoting the new media, especially with regard to such issues as
		    those described here, will build trust and confidence, and replace an
		    understandable lack of confidence in the new with a curiosity and willingness
	    to take part.</p>
	    <h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let staff members inform each other</h3>
	    <p class="MsoListParagraph">The survey reveals a large group of self-identified Educators,
		    people with medium interest in public interaction and average knowledge about
		    new media. This is the group that has the most questions about the use of new
		    media in the museum and at the same time is a group badly informed of the
		    possibilities new media offer. In order to make the on-line platform
		    successful, special attention has to be paid to this group to allow them to
		    keep up with the development and take an active part in it. In this context,
		    other groups, those of the Connectors and Interactors, both concerned with
		    public interaction with the museum and interested in interpersonal
		    communication, could stimulate an interest in those aspects among the
		    Educators. Similarly, the Presenters and Connectors could stimulate an interest
		    in the more technical aspects. Through interaction among the different groups,
		    the Educators and Lecturers may thus be stimulated to relinquish their
		    positions as cautious onlookers (or even as skeptics) and be given the
		    necessary confidence to join the project actively. The pleasure of acquiring
		    skills and insight into the rewards involved should help to improve the necessary
	    cohesion within the museum for the success of the project. </p>
	    <h3>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build project groups</h3>
	    <p class="MsoListParagraph">An important part of the process of cohesion can be
		    the creation of project groups that work together on different issues and
		    assignments. These groups canbe built within the existing departments, or
		    according to strategic considerations, or because of shared interests. These
	      &ldquo;communities of practice&rdquo; (a term introduced by Etienne Wenger (Wenger, 1999)) comprise<span
class="MsoCommentReference">&nbsp;</span> groups of people who share a
		    passion or work (or both) and regularly meet, discuss, work and learn together,
		    thus sharing their experiences and problems and finding solutions to those
		    problems. In this way, communities of practice can be central in the
		    development of knowledge. Different groups of this type may be formed to
		    address specific issues pertaining to the platform. Curators or conservators,
		    for instance, could form such a group to find ways to share knowledge of the
		    collections with the public in a two-way process of interaction. Those in the
		    education department could form groups to develop interactive educational
		    programs for special target groups. Those in the ICT department could form a
		    group to facilitate the technical planning of the on-line platform. The
		    marketing representatives could think about strategies to introduce and promote
		    the platform to a larger public and, together with those from the department of
	    communication, encourage and promote active communication with the public.</p>
	    <h3>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make the platform part of an overall Gemeentemuseum Web concept</h3>
	    <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">To be sure that the platform has its place
		    in the more general Web policy of the museum, several steps have to be taken.
		    First, the Gemeentemuseum should start to build an active Web 2.0 presence
		    within diverse Web services such as Flickr, You Tube, my space or Wikipedia.
		    This means that while different people &ndash; visitors, artists, members, etc.
	      &#8211;are already adding museum content to these sites, museum staff should in
		    the future claim an active role in collecting, moderating and presenting these
		    contributions. For example, a Flickr account could be created where those who
		    have photographed the museum during their visit could post their contributions.
		    The existence of a Gemeentemuseum Flickr group could be communicated in at
		    least three ways: via information boards in the museum building; via the newsletter
		    of the museum; via the Web site. The same can be done with other sites such as
		    You Tube, my space, Wikipedia, Facebook or Hyves. These are also simple and
		    cost effective solutions for a museum with a limited budget that wants to take
		    part in the world of social media and make its collections, exhibitions and
	    discussions available to a wider public.</p>
	    <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">A second important contribution to an overall
		    Web concept is the building of an interactive, community relevant
		    Gemeentemuseum Web site. This Web site should offer different layers of
		    information, communication and entertainment. A range of tools could be
		    implemented quickly to help to create a more lively Web site and could easily
		    be integrated into day-to-day museum practice. Blogs can be made as permanent
		    information tools but can also be made by different members of departments for
		    more specific or temporary ends; that is, for exhibitions or other special
		    events, and also for research results, for restoration projects and for
		    documentation. Photos of new exhibitions, the ways they are made, when they
		    open, as well as visitors&rsquo; impressions of such museum events could enrich the
	    museum&rsquo;s existing on-line presence and thus draw people to the museum.</p>
	    <h2>Down To Earth </h2>
	    <p>Based on the recommendations in the final report of the
		    survey, in fact the results of the initial research into the attitudes of those
		    who work in the museum, the Catch team developed the first draft of the GEMEEN
		    platform. The first tests are done with current, suitable issues. A curator
		    wants to publish conservation details on-line; the exhibition department wants
		    to professionalize its working methods and information system; the management
		    is approached by a supplier of downloadable audio guides and wants to discuss
	    the technical and organizational impact of this proposal.</p>
	    <p>These pilot projects are published on the
		    platform and the colleague who has the most interest in finding a solution for
		    the problem is assigned as moderator. He or she writes the mission
		    statement and plans the steps that have to be undertaken to bring the project
		    to a satisfactory conclusion. The moderator can ask colleagues to make special
		    contributions to the discussion. An overview of the work that has to be done by
		    the documentation department for digitalizing the collection of conservation reports
		    or an overview of existing software for exhibition planning are two good
	    examples.</p>
	    <p>Other colleagues may be included in the
		    discussion as interested readers. They follow the subject from a
		    somewhat greater distance and may comment on the contributions whenever they
		    like. If the right expertise for a contribution or comment is not available in
		    the museum, the moderator can make use of outside networks and invite an
	    external contact to join the discussion.</p>
	    <p>Of course the first moderators need a lot
		    of support to use the platform in the best possible way. The mission
		    statement needs to be precise and clear, the planning of the various steps in
		    the project smart, and the right colleagues invited for contributions and
		    comments. As the platform grows and the users become familiar with its
	    possibilities, this support can slowly be diminished. </p>
	    <p>There are many possible scenarios for the
		    future development of GEMEEN. We could easily describe a bright future
		    in which everybody in the museum happily co-operates and exciting new
		    experiments are undertaken. Specialists from different museums  work together
		    on interesting projects and students can be asked to design software or Web sites
		    based on the requirements of various projects. But that would not be in step
		    with the title of this contribution. So let&rsquo;s get down to earth, start with institutional
	    change, and slowly work from there.</p>
