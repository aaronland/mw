		<h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
		<p class="AbstractText">A prototype system that allows the
		  aggregation of data from museum and related Web sites, including object and
		  event records, was rapidly developed. By screen-scraping the existing pages of
		  17 Web sites, tens of thousands of data records were collected without any technical
		  agreement, investment or consent from the participating institutions. In this
		  paper, we examine the reasons and benefits for aggregating this type of data,
		  how our approach differs to other funded projects that have similar
		  aspirations, and the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. An analysis of
		  the data is presented, showing how the aggregate data set varies by assorted
		  parameters, including location and date. Our work is related to the bigger
		  picture of on-line data publishing, such as Semantic Web technologies, and some
		  suggestions are presented as to  how the grand vision of the Semantic Web may
	    be achievable without the complexity.</p>

	    <h2 class="PaperTitle">Introduction</h2>
	    <p>This paper, and the
	    work behind it, starts with a Big Hairy Audacious Goal. </p>
	    <p>It&rsquo;s not a new goal. </p>
	    <p>It&rsquo;s not a particularly original goal. </p>
	    <p>It&rsquo;s a goal that museums have striven for
	    since they started distributing collections content on the Web.</p>
	    <p>The goal is this: </p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">To provide cross-collection,
		    cross-museum and cross-subject access to the biggest set of collections data
		    possible, and to do this in a way which carries minimal inertia, minimal cost
	    and minimal effort from all contributing institutions. </p>
	    <p class="BlockQuoteAuthor">Furthermore, we believe that access
		    should be provided via a simple, transparent and open API, to maximise re-use
	    and innovation around our collections.</p>
	    <p>Hoard.it - as we&rsquo;ll demonstrate in this
		    paper - does not answer this BHAG. It does, however, take an existing set of
	    assumptions and reassesses these in as realistic a light as possible.</p>
	    <p>Where academic commentators hold up RDF,
		    the Semantic Web and &quot;bottom-up&quot; collaborative projects, we instead
		    look to our Hairy Goal and ask: &quot;what is realistic? What gives us the most
		    impact for the minimum effort?&quot; We take the realities we all understand in
		    our institutions - little money, no time, high levels of inertia - and ask what
		    we can do to overcome these, or at least side-step them in the short-to-medium
	    term. </p>
	    <p>Hoard.it is not a perfect answer, as we&rsquo;ll
		    see below. It&rsquo;s a technology which generalises, both with regard to the on-page
		    templating system it uses, and also in the way we&rsquo;ve had to normalise data.
		    Many information professionals or curators will find this normalisation
	    difficult to accept. </p>
	    <p>We suggest, however, that in a world where
		    Google (a non-metadata-driven search engine) dominates, and museums are desperate
		    to make their collections more &quot;real&quot; to younger, faster, more fickle
		    audiences, that perfection really is the enemy of the good. Quantity, speed,
		    openness - the ability to take our data and re-work it into other things:
		    mobile applications, map mashups, timelines - these are what will ultimately define
	    the impact of our collections on-line.</p>
	    <h2>Existing Cross-Collections Projects</h2>
	    <p>It is staggering to think how much time and
		    money has been spent on largely comparable cross-collection projects globally
		    (including similar projects, e.g. federated searching), and how this trend
	    appears to be continuing despite the ever-growing number of existing projects.</p>
	    <p>A cursory search in Google reveals a
		    variety of large-scale projects that have already launched: Cornucopia (<a
href="../http://www.cornucopia.org.uk/">http://www.cornucopia.org.uk/</a>), Europeana (<a href="../http://www.europeana.eu/">http://www.europeana.eu/</a>), Michael (<a href="../http://www.michael-culture.org/">http://www.michael-culture.org</a>), People&rsquo;s Network (<a
href="../http://www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk/discover/">http://www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk/discover/</a>), Collections Australia Network (<a
href="../http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/">http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/</a>), Virtual Museum Canada (<a href="../http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca</a>), and many more. Between them, these have accounted for many tens -
		    or possibly hundreds - of <i>millions of
        dollars</i> of investment, and an untold amount of time. </p>
	    <p>Even still, institutions continue to pour
		    money and effort into yet more similar projects that provide centralised
	      &lsquo;portal&rsquo; access to cultural data: National Museums Online Learning Project (<a
href="../http://www.vam.ac.uk/about_va/online_learning/">http://www.vam.ac.uk/about_va/online_learning/</a>), BBC CenturyShare (<a href="../http://tinyurl.com/centshare">http://tinyurl.com/centshare</a>), and SPIRIT (Aberdeen University; no URL yet) are just some in the
		    UK that we are aware of. Each of these is likely to cost hundreds of thousands
	    or (in some cases) millions of dollars more.</p>
	    <p><b><i>Before we know it, we may have as many &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo;
	    centralised portal sites as individual institutional sites</i>.</b></p>
	    <p>Although we were unable to identify traffic
		    or unique visitor statistics for these Web sites, it is highly likely that they
		    attract a relatively small audience after their initial launch. Our opinion is
		    that too much investment to-date has been spent on the obvious technical
		    challenges of such projects (e.g. implementing OAI-PMH or OpenSearch at each
		    participating institution), with very little innovation in end-user experience
		    and how added value/context can be extracted and delivered through the newly formed
	    aggregate data set.</p>
	    <h2>The Problem</h2>
	    <p>As a starting point, let&rsquo;s examine the
	    issues from the very highest level:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>Museums and cultural institutions around the
	      world have collections data on millions of objects;</li>
      <li>There have been (and continue to be) large-scale
        moves to digitise at least some of these objects and put them on the Web;</li>
      <li>Ergo, there are currently hundreds of thousands
        of museum digital objects on-line;</li>
      <li>These objects are often related - between institutions
        - in some conceptual or semantic way. Well known artists, for example, may
        produce works which are distributed around maybe tens or even hundreds of
        museums worldwide.</li>
          </ol>
	    <p>Now let&rsquo;s take a use-case. In this
		    scenario, a user wants to know everything there is to know about Leonardo Da
		    Vinci. She wants to see (for example) all the pictures, all the institutions
		    that house Da Vinci material, a timeline of Da Vinci artwork from institutions
	    worldwide.</p>
	    <p>Working on the assumption that this user
		    doesn&rsquo;t know which institutions to go to or the names of the artefacts she&rsquo;s
		    interested in (and bear in mind that most current projects fail here), the
		    digitisation projects outlined above then become entirely reliant on effective
		    search engine optimisation, given that this user is likely to go to Google
	    first rather than to any of the contributing organisations.</p>
	    <p>Google doesn&rsquo;t do this job well - try
		    searching for &quot;da vinci paintings&quot; and note both the lack of
	    structured results and the lack of coherent museum collections returned. </p>
	    <p>If Google can&rsquo;t do this well, museum
		    digitisation projects are destined to remain as niche silos, undiscovered by
	    the audiences we&rsquo;re so desperate to reach.</p>
	    <h2>Cross-Collections Access</h2>
	    <p>As museums have recognised for some time,
		    the answer to this kind of problem lies in finding ways of gathering
		    collections data into one place, harnessing the <b>quantities</b> of collections and attempting to capitalise on this for
	    increased search engine optimisation and hence increased user access. </p>
	    <p>This kind of cross-searching is not an
		    unrealistic user expectation, and yet it is held up as a holy grail in museum
		    circles, for very real reasons that are clear to anyone working in the field of
	    cultural heritage:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>We&rsquo;d need a (worldwide) cross-museum agreed-upon
	      standard for collections access</li>
      <li>We&rsquo;d need to find the time and money to provide
        this data in a compatible format</li>
      <li>We&rsquo;d need to overcome considerable
        organisational inertia and politics </li>
          </ul>
	    <p>None of this is news for anyone working
		    with cultural collections. Time (as well as vast quantities of budget, as
		    outlined above) has been spent on attempting to get these standards agreed and
		    deliver &quot;portal&quot;-like access into the collections of small
		    collaborations of museums. Most recently, for example, is the high-profile <b>Europeana</b> project which, according to
	    ZDNet UK (<a
href="../http://news.zdnet.co.uk/itmanagement/0,1000000308,39460406,00.htm">http://news.zdnet.co.uk/itmanagement/0,1000000308,39460406,00.htm</a>) is likely to have <b>&pound;120m</b> allocated to it over the coming years.</p>
	    <p>The problem with these kinds of projects
		    (even providing we&rsquo;ve overcome the points outlined above!) is that because of
	    their scale they are by definition inertia-ridden, expensive and slow-moving. </p>
	    <p>Consider this: There are 17,500 museums in
		    the United States alone (<a
href="../http://www.aam-us.org/aboutmuseums/abc.cfm">http://www.aam-us.org/aboutmuseums/abc.cfm</a>). A consortium of 5 museums (a standard sized cross-collections
		    project group) therefore represents 0.02%. Extending this - a consortium of 500
		    museums (imagine the politics!) is <b>under
        3%</b> of US museums. </p>
	    <p>Even if this consortium of museums could
		    orchestrate a digitisation project, agree the standards, get the funding and
		    launch, the output would still represent a tiny drop in the ocean when you
		    consider our user looking for material on-line. The reality, of course, is that
		    a consortium of 500 museums wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance of getting the
		    representatives into a meeting room, let alone running any kind of coherent
	    project.</p>
	    <p>To be very clear - this is <b>not a criticism of the institutions or
		    projects involved</b>. The end results of existing digitisation projects are
		    sometimes beautiful, and - once you have found them - sometimes reasonably
		    satisfying. In the general scheme of things, however, they don&rsquo;t - can&rsquo;t - make
		    use of the lightweight, rapid, agile approaches that define successful Web
		    offerings today. They can&rsquo;t provide the kind of true cross-collection searching
		    that our fictional (and yet, highly probable) user requires. What&rsquo;s more, very
	    few of them have an API, so re-use is extremely limited.</p>
	    <p>There is a fundamental problem with the
		    bottom-up basis upon which these projects are run. As well as being too
		    expensive and cumbersome, they also ignore a huge issue: <b>what about the existing projects?</b> What about the hundreds of
		    thousands of digitised objects from museums, large and small, already on the Web?
	    Are these just lost projects, budgets spent and data ignored? </p>
	    <p>What we need is a solution that could in a
		    matter of <b>weeks rather than decades</b> collect and provide access to object data from <b>every museum in the world</b>. This hypothetical ambition (our BHAG!) will
		    not come from the bottom up in the form of large, sprawling and expensive
		    collaborations. It will come from the top down, as recent history has shown in Internet
		    development. This is the only way that we can ensure that our digitisation work
		    has maximum impact, embraces the so-called &quot;Network Effect&quot; or
	    Metcalf&rsquo;s Law of network scale (<a
href="../http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law</a>).</p>
	    <h2>The Semantic Web, APIs and Programmatic
	    Access </h2>
	    <p>The idea of the Semantic Web - a common
		    framework that allows data to be shared and reused across the Web - has been
		    around for a number of years. Many advances have been made, not least the
	    development of working groups, design principles and other technologies.</p>
	    <p>Theoretically, of course, the exposing of
	    semantic data would solve many of the problems outlined above.</p>
	    <p>However, notions of the Semantic Web have
		    been challenged by many commentators. While the &quot;lightweight&quot; Web has
		    seen the evolution of, for example, RSS as a commonly accepted standard and
		    REST-ful APIs as the means of sharing data between sites, RDF (the underpinning
		    technology behind most formal Semantic Web systems) has lagged behind. There
		    are very few sites (fewer still mainstream ones) which use RDF in any
	    fundamental, semantic way.</p>
	    <p>It is very clear to the authors of this
		    paper (and many other commentators) that for the near future at least these
		    standards will remain as niche, academic notions of a perfect world of
		    connected data, and not implemented in real world mainstream scenarios. RDF is
		    too big, the benefits are too intangible, the chicken-and-egg of take-up is too
		    small. Institutions, least of all cash-and time-poor cultural institutions,
	    simply will not invest what is required.</p>
	    <p>Simplistically, the &lsquo;second best&rsquo; option to
		    the &quot;capital S and W&quot; of the Semantic Web is a Web where data can be
		    accessed by machines as well as by humans. The connections aren&rsquo;t intelligent
		    in the way they should ultimately be with the Semantic Web, but this
	      &quot;connected Web&quot; is nonetheless an incredibly powerful indicator of
	    the shape of things to come.</p>
	    <p>On the Web, these technologies have gained
		    a huge amount of traction, particularly around Application Programming
		    Interfaces (API&rsquo;s). They are one of the most important aspects of Web2.0 - an
	    underlying interface layer which allows sites and services to query each other.</p>
	    <h3>Why programmatic access is important</h3>
	    <p>Perhaps the easiest way to explain this is
		    to examine the current content and technology landscape outside the museum
	    sector. </p>
	    <p>It is here - particularly among technology
		    startup companies and other young, content-rich sites - that we see real,
		    tangible evidence of the creativity and content exposure which springs directly
	    from the exposure of machine-readable data.</p>
	    <p>Here are some examples, taken from Dion
	    Hinchcliffe&rsquo;s ZDNet blog (<a
href="../http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=215">http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=215</a>):</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>eBay, who provide access to all their listings
		      data via a feature-rich API, receive over 6 billion API calls per month. Over
	      60% of listings come from their API</li>
      <li>Twitter, whose API receives 10 times the traffic
        of their Web site. Their open API has allowed numerous applications, sites and
        services to access the power of the Twitter social graph</li>
      <li>The Flickr API, which provides the content for
        hundreds of mashups</li>
      <li>Other extremely high profile projects, including
        Google maps, the Yahoo! API, BBC Backstage</li>
          </ul>
	    <p>Hinchcliffe goes on:</p>
	    <p class="BlockQuote">Growth and innovation are both direct
		    outcomes of APIs since it allows others to connect their audience to your
		    products elsewhere on the Web (growth) and it allows products and services to
		    be re-imagined and transformed into entire new products, services, and
	    especially mashups, using ideas from across the network. </p>
	    <p>APIs power the world of the
	      &quot;mashup&quot;, where services and systems are brought to bear on common,
		    otherwise complex problems. They also allow freeform building of creative tools
		    on top of rich data, the embracing of the true power of &quot;the network
	    effect&quot; and considerable advantages when it comes to future-proofing.</p>
	    <h2>Sharing of Museum Data - the Landscape</h2>
	    <p>Given these considerable cultural and
		    financial advantages, the public exposing of data in programmatic ways is not
		    common among museums and cultural institutions. Although there are no metrics
		    around data provision of this kind, we believe that only a handful of museums
		    worldwide are making use of these tools. Although RESTful approaches, for
		    example, are deeply embedded in nearly every new Web2.0 startup, this is
	    clearly not common ground for cultural institutions. </p>
	    <p>Some museums are making use of RSS feeds to
		    expose data beyond simple event and news information - OpenSearch (<a
href="../http://www.opensearch.org/Home">http://www.opensearch.org/Home</a>) is probably the most commonly used lightweight data-sharing
		    mechanism. A few other institutions are running beta systems which use RDF or
		    micro-formatting as a way of signposting granular content blocks within content
	    pages. For the most part, however, this is not common practice. </p>
	    <p>Reasons for this lack of take-up vary. On
		    the one hand, these are reasonably new approaches, especially in a sector that
		    has never been rich enough or inclined to be &quot;bleeding edge&quot;. On the
		    other, museums still have a tendency to be cautious when it comes to exposure
		    of raw data into the public domain. Finally, of course, there are matters of
		    data standards and - not least - the communication of why data sharing is
	    important. </p>
	    <p>There is an obvious chicken-and-egg
		    scenario here: until more museums commit to exposing their data in these ways,
		    metrics will not be available; until metrics are available, museums are
	    unwilling to commit.</p>
	    <h2>Hoard.it: The Top-Down Approach</h2>
	    <p>With hoard.it, we took a completely new,
		    completely realistic approach to collections searching. We started with several
	    core principles:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li> The Web as it is today contains many hundreds of thousands of
	      (cultural) resources</li>
      <li>These resources are valuable, but there is little/no consistency in
        the way they are presented.</li>
      <li>There is absolutely no guarantee that...
        <ol class="list-letters" type="a">
          <li class="list-letters">these resources are marked up semantically</li>
          <li class="list-letters">there are programmatic ways to get at the underlying data</li>
          <li class="list-letters">the markup is valid or otherwise &quot;correct&quot;</li>
          <li class="list-letters">there are any standards at all being employed consistently</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
          </ol>
	    <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system should allow for the fact that these resources may become
		    better represented on-line in the future via Semantic Web technologies,
		    microformats, API&rsquo;s and so on. The system should not in any way preclude
	    development in these directions.</p>
	    <p>With these in mind, we set about designing
	    a system which followed these principles:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>We should be able to rapidly gather data from a variety of (museum)
	      data sources using the &quot;visible&quot; Web - i.e. Web pages</li>
      <li>The system should provide a powerful API to ensure the maximum
        possible re-use of any data collected</li>
      <li>The system should demonstrate the value of aggregated collections
        data in a way that no system has previously</li>
      <li>The system should be agile and lightweight by...
        <ol class="list-letters" type="a">
          <li class="list-letters">not requiring any changes to be made to the source sites or the
            markup on those sites</li>
          <li class="list-letters">not requiring any consent from the source sites</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

	    <h2>Technology Overview</h2>
	    <p>As one of the main goals of the project is
		    to demonstrate that other &lsquo;formal&rsquo; projects are over-engineered - and hence
		    overly resource intensive - our system is built using simple technologies, with
		    just enough functionality to achieve simple tasks, and no more. It is
		    essentially a non-robust proof of concept, but one that attempts to match or
	    exceed the results of many other larger projects.</p>
	    <p>A configuration file is created for each Web
		    site, one that defines how to crawl the Web site and where relevant data can be
		    found on the page. Each Web site is crawled, and a rudimentary screen-scraping
		    engine used to extract the data from each page. As only a single configuration
		    file is defined per site, it is assumed that the &lsquo;data fields&rsquo; exist in the
		    same position on each page; i.e. that all pages on the site are built using a
	    consistent template.</p>
	    <p>The main platform is built with open source
		    technologies: Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP; often referred to as LAMP. The core
		    component is a simple PHP spider, which uses the inbuilt cURL library to spider
		    each target site. A site is scanned for other valid pages to spider (e.g.
		    collections database search results), and any valid URLs that could contain
		    data (e.g. a page that displays a museum object or work of art); patterns that
		    define the structure of valid URLs are specified in the configuration file for
	    each site.</p>
	    <p>A second simple spider then crawls each
		    data page. The page is downloaded, and normalized: converted to valid XHTML/XML
		    using HTML Tidy, all URLs made absolute (i.e. changing relative URLs so that
		    they contain the full address), and converted to a common character encoding
	    (UTF-8).</p>
	    <p>The page is then parsed to extract the
		    individual data fields; e.g. for an object, these could include attributes such
		    as name, date, location, description and dimensions. In the configuration file
		    for the site, a variety of different patterns can be used to identify the
		    fields: metadata tags, xPath expressions, regular expressions and CSS
	    selectors.</p>
	    <p>Once the data is extracted from the page,
		    it is stored in a central database alongside a common label for the field -
		    usually Dublin Core style labels, such as &lsquo;title&rsquo;, &lsquo;description&rsquo;, &lsquo;identifier&rsquo;,
	      &lsquo;date created&rsquo;, etc. This ensures that data from all Web sites can be mapped
	    and compared.</p>
	    <h2>The Data</h2>
	    <p>To date, we have collected data from 17 Web
		    sites. This includes 68,000+ objects from 12 museum Web sites and 2 art
		    galleries, 4,000+ museum details from 24 Hour Museum, 1,500+ artist details
		    from Wikipedia, and 1,200+ historical events from Freebase. Of the museums,
		    nine were from the UK, three from North America and two from Australia. We
		    would like to include more non-UK museums/galleries in the dataset, but
		    unfortunately the technical suitability - for screen scraping - of on-line
		    collections seems to be higher in the UK than elsewhere, for Web sites we have
	    tested to-date.</p>
	    <p>For the purpose of this project - and for
		    the sake of expediency - we chose to collect a selection of data from each
		    museum Web site, rather than each collection in its entirety. On average, about
	    5,000 objects were spidered from each Web site.</p>
	    <p>For each object, we collected a set of core
		    fields: URL, identifier (unique ID), title (name), and description. Where
		    possible, we collected other useful data, including image, creator, dates,
	    copyright, dimensions, subject, location and materials.</p>
	    <p>About 50% of objects had creator
		    information, 75% included date (created) information, slightly under 50%
		    specified copyright information, 65% subject, 85% an image, 45% a location, and
	    65% a list of materials. </p>
	    <p>Mark-up and links were removed from all
		    text, and other related information (including any other images or multimedia)
	    ignored.</p>
	    <h2>Difficulties and Limitations</h2>
	    <p>As this project has no pre-arranged
		    agreements with data providers, and no ability to alter the format or
		    availability of data, there are a number of difficulties associated with our
	    approach:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>
	        A provider&rsquo;s collection must already be digitised
	      and publically available on-line</li>
      <li>Performance is not optimal: screen scraping
        relies on downloading the entire page - rather than just object data - and
        system throughput is limited by the response speed of the Web site; we had to
        discount some museums from our dataset due to poor response times.
        </p>
        </li>
      <li>
        A Web site must use a template for presenting
        each object page, such that the various data fields are marked-up or located in
        a consistent style across pages.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>There are still a surprising number of on-line
            collections that do not use any kind of semantic mark-up for their collections.
            From our research, art galleries seem to be the worst offenders, often
            concatenating a large number of separate fields (title, artist, date,
            copyright) into a single plain-text paragraph.
            </p>
              </li>
          <li>Over longer periods of time, changes to Web site
            templates will prevent the screen-scraper from detecting changes or new data
            until the configuration for the site has been updated.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>There is significant variety in how each Web site
        adheres to standards, document type, character encoding, use of HTML entities,
        etc.
        </p>
        </li>
      <li>As the prototype spider is fairly rudimentary,
        it currently only crawls pages that it can find in the HTML of a page.
        Therefore, pages that are only accessible by &lsquo;Post&rsquo;-ing a form or through a
        JavaScript action are &lsquo;invisible&rsquo; to the spider. Considering that many search
        engine spiders could face similar barriers, it is surprising how many large
        institutions implement these technologies, potentially blocking large sections
        - possibly all - of their collections from search engine users.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Similarly, images and data hidden inside Flash
            applications (such as Zoomify) are invisible to the spider.
            </p>
              </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
          </ul>
	    <h2>Normalization</h2>
	    <p>The most interesting difficulty - which
		    also applies to the majority of other formal aggregation projects - is that of
	      &lsquo;normalization&rsquo;; converting incoming data from different sources into the same
	    units and format, so that it can be easily compared and mapped. </p>
	    <p>We normalized two of the incoming data
		    fields: location and date. For location, we used the Yahoo! GeoPlanet API (<a
href="../http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/">http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/</a>),
		    which can convert most textual descriptions of places (cities, countries,
		    landmarks, postal codes, etc.) into longitude, latitude and a single standard
	    geographic taxonomy (country, administrative region, city).</p>
	    <p>We developed our own API for normalizing
		    dates (<a href="../http://feeds.boxuk.com/convert/date/">http://feeds.boxuk.com/convert/date/</a>), which converted approximately 95% of all incoming date formats we
		    recorded (e.g. &lsquo;circa 19<sup>th</sup> century&rsquo;, &lsquo;1960s&rsquo;, &lsquo;2008-01&rsquo;, &lsquo;1 Jan 52&rsquo;,
	      &lsquo;2000 BC&rsquo;), although some fuzziness exists where international differences
		    cannot be calculated (e.g. 04-05-78; the order of the day and month are not
		    certain). From the relatively small selection of Web sites we included in our
		    survey, we detected nearly 50 different formats for specifying date
	    information.</p>
	    <p>Although normalization of the &lsquo;subject&rsquo;
	      (keywords) has not yet been attempted, a service such as the Calais API (<a
href="../http://www.opencalais.com/calaisAPI">http://www.opencalais.com/calaisAPI</a>)
	    could be used to map disparate objects and taxonomies to a common vocabulary.</p>
	    <h2>Data Analysis/Mining </h2>
	    <h3>Location</h3>
	    <p>As perhaps is inevitable from the geography
		    of the museums included in the survey, nearly 20% of the objects recorded
		    originate from the United Kingdom (cf. 65% of the museums in the survey are
		    located in the UK), with only 14% originating from North America (cf. 20% of
		    the museums in the survey) and 2% from Australia (cf. 15% of the museums in the
	    survey).</p>
	    <p>The figures are even more stark when viewed
		    by continent: 65% of objects originate from Europe, 15% from Asia, 14% from
		    North America, just over 4% from Oceania, just under 2% from Africa, and a very
	    small amount from South America.</p>
	    <p>Although we do not currently include enough
		    non-European museums to provide particularly significant results, it is also
		    interesting to examine similar statistics based on location of museum. European
		    museums are sometimes accused of being Euro-centric, so it&rsquo;s surprising to find
		    that although about 75% of objects from European museums do originate from
		    Europe, and only 65% of objects are &lsquo;local&rsquo; in Oceania museums, North American
		    museums appear to be the least &lsquo;global&rsquo; of our survey with approximately 85% of
	    their museum objects originating from North America.</p>
	    <h3>Date</h3>
	    <p>From the museums and galleries included,
		    there is a strong leaning towards modern history: 25% of all objects are from
		    the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, and another 22% are from the 19<sup>th</sup> Century. In fact, 70% of objects are from the last 500 years, even though the
	    records in the database cover a range of over 4000 years.</p>
	    <p>If we examine how museums from different
		    locations collect objects by date, then we see a fairly predictable trend:
		    European museums have a larger percentage of their collection dedicated to
		    older objects, whereas North American - and particularly Oceanic - museums
	    contain a larger proportion of modern objects, focused around the 20<sup>th</sup> Century.</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="ellis.fig1.png" alt="figure 1" width="500" height="286" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig 1: Date of objects by location of
	    collecting museum</p>
	    <p>We can also examine how the date and the
		    location of origin of each object are related. For African and South American
		    objects, a larger than average number of the items from these regions are dated
		    to Before the Common Era. Asian and African objects have slightly more of their
	    collection dated to the Middle Ages. </p>
	    <p>Most continents clearly have the majority
		    of their collection from the last few hundred years, with nearly 85% of Oceanic
		    objects dated after 1900, over 70% of North American objects after the same
		    date, and - perhaps surprisingly considering the long history of such a region
	    - nearly 50% of all South American objects in our survey being made after 1900.</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="ellis.fig2.png" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="285" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig. 2: Date of objects by location of
	    object creation</p>
	    <p>If we examine how material usage changes
		    over time, we find that a greater proportion (than average) of clay and stone
		    items are dated from the Middle Ages (5<sup>th</sup>-16<sup>th</sup> Century),
		    and a far larger than average amount of the silver and gold collection dates to
	    the Renaissance period (14<sup>th</sup>-17<sup>th</sup> Century).</p>
	    <p class="caption"><img src="ellis.fig3.png" alt="figure 3" width="500" height="286" /></p>
	    <p class="caption">Fig. 3: Date of objects by material</p>
	    <p>As we are able to collect and map
		    non-object data in our survey too - museums, painters and historical events -
		    we can also begin to provide enhanced context for objects. For example, we can
		    extract all objects made in Germany during World War II: this results in 19
		    objects, including toys and navigational globes. Note that many more objects
		    probably should be included in this selection, but the Web sites we spidered
	    did not publish location or creation date information on the object page.</p>
	    <p>Similarly, we can easily extract the eight
		    objects in our collection that were made in Florence during Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s
		    childhood (age 5-15); these include five plaster cast statues, two oil
		    paintings and a figurine, made respectively by Mino da Fiesole, Apollonio di
	    Giovanni, Andrea della Robbia and Luca della Robbia. </p>
	    <h3>&quot;Hoard.it labs&quot;</h3>
	    <p>We are continually adding to the various
	    ways of mining and displaying hoard.it data. See <a
href="../http://hoard.it/labs">http://hoard.it/labs</a> for examples, including timeline, mobile version, object quiz, etc.</p>
	    <h2>Legalities</h2>
	    <p>We have - as the title of our paper indicates
		    - taken a &quot;just do it&quot; attitude to the hoard.it project. No consent
		    has been requested from the museums which have been spidered; however, we have
		    mentioned the project to many museum colleagues and they have all been
	    supportive of the approach.</p>
	    <p>We believe that provided we continue to
		    give end users a link through to the originating object record (i.e. to the
		    museum Web site itself), we will not in any way adversely affect either traffic
		    to the museum site nor any aspect of the individual museum brand. In fact,
		    ultimately we believe that this kind of approach will drive traffic to and
	    between museum Web sites extremely effectively.</p>
	    <p>In a world where Google, Google Images and
		    the Internet Archive (to name but a few) contain spidered content from millions
		    of sites, including our own, we consider hoard.it to be a drop in the ocean. We
		    are aware, however, that museums may not wish to be spidered for whatever
	    reason and provide an &quot;opt out&quot; option on the hoard.it Web site.</p>
	    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
	    <p>We have a number of ideas on our roadmap
	    for hoard.it development:</p>
	    <h3>Continued expansion </h3>
	    <p>First and foremost, we intend to continue
		    expanding the hoard.it database with more object records, more museums and more
	    collections types. </p>
	    <h4>Template Mapping</h4>
	    <p>The most obvious of these is looking at
		    ways in which we can improve the way in which the system maps page structure to
		    content. As mentioned above, this is currently carried out using a simple
		    configuration file for each template type. This makes several assumptions about
	    the site which are not necessarily correct. </p>
	    <p>Building in further flexibility in the way
		    this mapping relationship is defined is therefore a key part of fine-tuning the
		    hoard.it spidering process. We are working on several ideas whereby this
		    mapping could be defined not on the hoard.it side of the process tree but
	    instead by the site owners themselves.</p>
	    <p>The obvious way of doing this would be
		    allow site owners to define a &lt;rel&gt; link in the HEAD of their object
		    pages which pointed to an external file hosted on the same site as the object
		    pages. This file would contain a simple mapping language based on mapping the
		    DOM to an easy to understand language (possibly even a variation of CSS). This
	    would relate the on-page content to a pre-defined normalised field.</p>
	    <p>So for example, if the page contained the
		    object name in the first &lt;h1&gt; tag on the page and a description in the
	    second paragraph, the language might look like this:</p>
	    <blockquote>
	      <p>h1[1] &gt;
	        dc.title<br />
	        p[2] &gt;
          dc.description</p>
          </blockquote>
	    <p>The hoard.it spider would be automatically
		    configured to look for this particular &lt;rel&gt; tag, follow the URI and from
		    there determine how the template page was mapped. The spider would (as now) be
		    able to continue gathering page content based on <b>other</b> mappings should it not find this &lt;rel&gt; tag. Rather more
		    interestingly, you could potentially <b>crowdsource</b> the definition mappings, allowing site users to do the work of mapping the
		    relationships, or have a whole range of different mappings for different
	    audiences or systems.</p>
	    <p>There is some ongoing work which is similar
		    to this, in particular RDFa (<a
href="../http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/</a>) and RDF-EASE (<a
href="../http://buzzword.org.uk/2008/rdf-ease/spec">http://buzzword.org.uk/2008/rdf-ease/spec</a>). These, however, require well-formed X(HT)ML on the input side and
		    some fairly serious changes to existing markup, thus, in our opinions, removing
	    the appeal we believe there is in a lightweight approach.</p>
	    <h4><b>Microformats and &lt;META&gt;
	    tags</b></h4>
	    <p>Some work has already been done on
		    Microformats (<a href="../http://microformats.org/">http://microformats.org/</a>) for museum
		    objects (<a href="../http://www.google.com/search?q=museum+microformat">http://www.google.com/search?q=museum+microformat</a>),
		    and there is a continuing debate about whether this is a worthwhile route for
	    museums to explore.</p>
	    <p>Hoard.it could certainly easily be configured to look for
		    specific microformats (whether object, event or otherwise) or metadata in the
	      &lt;head&gt; of the page (see above): &lt;head&gt; data has been used on a
		    number of sites (notably NOF digitise) and certainly is more abundant currently
	    than any other method of representing metadata on-page. </p>
	    <p>The easy configurability of hoard.it means that as trends
		    come and go, we can adjust the mapping algorithm (or let the site owner adjust
	    it!) as required.</p>
	    <h4>Other ideas, APIs and contextual linking</h4>
	    <p>Once the core data from a page has been
		    mapped and successfully imported into the hoard.it system, it is exposed as a
		    RESTful API to anyone who wants to consume it. This of course means that
		    rendering the object content into any format becomes trivial: text only,
	    mobile, kiosk-friendly, large print, etc. </p>
	    <p>One idea we are working on is an embeddable
	      &quot;widget&quot; which any museum could include by pasting a line of
		    JavaScript code into a Web page. This widget would take the current page URI,
		    map this to hoard.it and return a &quot;you may also like&quot; list of object
	    records, either from the same domain or from the entire hoard.it database.</p>
	    <p>In the same way, exposing an on-page link
		    to &quot;view this page as XML&quot; (or RSS, or potentially RDF) becomes
	    trivial. </p>
	    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
	    <p>The hoard.it prototype system we have
		    developed is a lightweight alternative approach to the typical
		    resource-intensive cross-collections aggregation project, though it is not
		    necessarily as accurate. However, because it is easy, fast and cheap to set up,
		    it can run alongside the larger scale projects and developments; it doesn&rsquo;t
	    necessarily replace them. </p>
	    <p>As the system is not &lsquo;object data
		    specific&rsquo;, it is capable of including any type of structured data into the same
		    central database (such as people, events, and buildings), allowing us to
		    eventually provide the end-user with far greater context around their
	    particular area of research.</p>
	    <p>This mapping of arbitrary data sets to one
		    another provides a straightforward method for &lsquo;bootstrapping&rsquo; the Semantic Web;
		    building up an ever-growing set of interconnected data objects, but without any
		    technical changes to participating systems or knowledge of Semantic Web
	    technologies.</p>
	    <p>Above all, we believe that the museum
		    community should consider this type of &lsquo;top down&rsquo; approach to the complex
		    problems it faces: creating small, cheap systems that fulfil &lsquo;just enough&rsquo;
        requirements and can be used on a large scale.</p>
