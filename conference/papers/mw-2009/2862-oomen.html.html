  <h3 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h3>
  <p class="AbstractText">Images for the Future is the largest digitization effort in Europe to date. A
    consortium of 6 partners (including three archives) is migrating a substantial
    part of the Dutch audiovisual heritage to a digital environment. The project
    has three objectives: safeguarding heritage for future generations, creating
    social- economical value, and supporting &nbsp;innovation in cultural
    infrastructure. Much is to be expected from recent developments in computer
    science, especially in the areas of data-mining, information retrieval, and user-audience
    participation capabilities. </p>
  <p class="AbstractText">To
    achieve these objectives, the cultural heritage sector is challenged to
    re-evaluate its business models. This article presents the theoretical
    framework in which Images for the Future is operating, and substantiates this
    framework with concrete examples of results.</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Audiovisual
        material is a vital component of our heritage, collective memory and identity
        &ndash; all our yesterdays. But in its current analogue format, it is difficult
        to access. Unlike documents which may last for centuries or even millennia,
        audiovisual recording materials have a life expectancy best measured in
        decades. Digitization of analogue carries will ensure future access. Over the
        past years, technologies for large-scale migration have matured. The same is
        also true for thinking about migration projects in terms of their efficiency
        and the workflow models they could follow. Although the process is far from
        complete, approximately 10 million hours of European audiovisual material has
        already been digitized (Wright, 2008). Recently, the audiovisual production
        process shifted from analogue to digital. This so-called &lsquo;born digital&rsquo; content
        is directly ingested in asset management systems and will also be kept for
        posterity as electronic files. Due to digitization and digital production,
        audiovisual content collections are transforming from archives of analogue
      material into very large stores of digital data.</p>
      <p>Digitization
        is also a driver to establish new services. Distribution over networks,
        interoperability with other collections, and flexible integration in other
        environments are just a few of many properties in this new era of enormous
        potential for audiovisual archives. Therefore, large-scale digitization efforts &nbsp;not only ensure long-term access, but also have the potential to reveal the social
        and economic value of the collections. This paper focuses on the latter: the
        types of services that can be created as a result of large-scale digitization
      efforts, and the social and economical benefits they bring. </p>
      <p>Value
        creation is a key notion, as it determines the factors that legitimize (and
        determine the level of) investments by the government and funding programs. The
        case of Images for the Future is exemplary: cultural heritage organizations
        around the globe are currently reinventing their business propositions. In Sections
        2 and 3 this notion is examined using the &quot;business model canvas&quot;, a
        model developed by Alex Osterwalder. In Section 4 we&nbsp; examine the
        dimensions of business models for cultural heritage and the derived value for a
        heterogeneous constituency of users, using the &quot;Accumulation, Archiving and
        Construction&quot; model by Mirko Tobias Schaefer. With
        this user-centric approach in mind, we look at some examples of services that
      we have developed in the past year. This lays the foundation for further work. </p>
      <h2>2. Unlocking Value</h2>
      <p>The
        collections of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision in Hilversum, the
        National Filmmuseum in Amsterdam, and the National
        Archive in The Hague safeguard the memory of the Netherlands as captured in
        moving images over the past hundred years. As is demonstrated below, the
        collections represent great social and economic value &ndash; if and when they
      become accessible.</p>
      <p>Large-scale
        migration of analogue audio-visual material for preservation and access is
        exceptionally expensive. For Images for the Future it involves the selection,
        restoration, digitization, encoding and storage of 137,000 hours of video, 20,000
        hours of film, 124,000 hours of audio and more than three million photographs.
        And this is only the beginning. To truly make the material useful, investments
        will have to be made to enrich the existing metadata so that they can meet
        requirements for use. Also, services will have to be developed to make the
        material meaningful and useful for a variety of user groups. Educational
        institutions, students, teachers, publishers, television and film makers, Web
        designers, graphic designers, artists, software developers, Internet providers,
        museums, theatres, heritage institutions, libraries, etc. will all profit from
      digitally available and accessible content over networks.</p>
      <p>The total
        investment of this initiative sums up to 173 million
        Euros: not an insignificant sum by any means. A strong business model is
        necessary to support this kind of investment and prove that such an investment
        will result in long-term socio-economic returns. To substantiate this
        assumption, the research institute SEO Economisch Onderzoek executed an analysis of costs and benefits of the
        Images for the Future project (SEO, 2006). This analysis followed the &quot;Research
        into Effects on Infrastructure&quot; framework defined by the Dutch Ministry of
        Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Transport (Eigenraam,
        2000). This framework shows how the costs and benefits of infrastructural
        investments such as roads, railways etc. can be determined. In addition to
        &lsquo;hard&rsquo; numbers, environmental and other &lsquo;soft&rsquo; effects are an intrinsic part of
        the analysis. The socio-economic returns of these structural investments are
        calculated over a substantial period of time: in the case of Images of the
      Future, this period was set at 30 years.</p>
      <p>The outcome
        of the Cost-Benefit analysis was positive: &quot;The total balance of costs and
        returns of restoring, preserving and digitizing audio-visual material
        (excluding costs of tax payments) will be between: 20+ and 60+ million&rsquo;&rsquo; (SEO,
        2006). The &quot;plus&quot; represents non-quantifiable indirect effects and social
        benefits that go beyond the users&rsquo; benefits. Direct effects concern the market
        for culture and heritage, and the market for information. The project is
        financed through the Economic Structure Enhancement Fund. This fund is used to
        finance large-scale infrastructural investments. Direct effects of the
        investment are revenues from sales, access for specific user groups, copyright fees
        for the use of the material, and so on. The indirect effects concern the
        product markets and labor market. Within the duration
        of the project (2007-2014), Images for the Future will generate an equivalent
        of 300 man-years of work. Social benefits take place outside the markets. For
        Images for the Future these benefits involve effects like the conservation of
        culture, reinforcement of cultural awareness, reinforcement of democracy
        through the accessibility of information, increase in multimedia literacy, and
      contribution to the Lisbon goals set by the EU.</p>
      <p>It is
        important to note that much of the material kept by the archives is
        copyrighted. Images for the Future collaborates closely with this important
        stakeholder group to ensure that the material is used in accordance with
        predefined arrangements. The underlying assumption is, &quot;everybody wins&quot;;
        material is made accessible to end users in a
        meaningful way, and rights holders receive their fair share of the income
      generated. </p>
      <p>Although some of the predicted economic effects are debated, this
        analysis is in line with other prominent studies on the subject of the effects of
        digitization, most recently demonstrated in a study on the effects of file
        sharing in the entertainment industry (Huygen,
        2009). Large private enterprises such as Google have signed off on business
        plans the same underlying assumption (Hal, 2009). Most authors agree that while
        the new business models have yet to prove durable, it remains crucial to create
        an environment in which our heritage becomes part of modern intellectual
      discourse, and that it will create economic value in some form or other.</p>
      <h2>&nbsp;3. Business Models</h2>
      <p>The
        question remains <i>how</i> to maximize the
        socio- economic impact of the project. When examining the potential positive
        return of an investment, it is useful to have a tested model as a starting
        point. In this case we use the business model canvas, developed by Osterwalder and Pigneur, that has
      become a popular reference point (Osterwalder, 2003).</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="oomen.fig1.jpg" alt="figure 1" width="500" height="157" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 1: Business Model Canvas. Osterwalder/Pigneur 2003</p>
      <p>In this
        context a business model is based upon the logic of an organization to achieve
      its (financial) goals, using nine interrelated building blocks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The value proposition of what is
        offered to the market;</li>
      <li>The segment(s) of clients that are
        addressed by the value proposition;</li>
      <li>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The communication and distribution
        channels to reach clients and offer them the value proposition;</li>
      <li>The relationships established with
        clients;</li>
      <li>The key resources needed to make the
        business model possible;</li>
      <li>The key activities necessary to
        implement the business model;</li>
      <li>The key partners and their
        motivations to participate in the business model;</li>
      <li>The revenue streams generated by the
        business model (constituting the revenue model);</li>
      <li>The cost structure resulting from
        the business model (Osterwalder, 2003).</li>
    </ol>
      <p>It is
        important to note that &ndash; using this model &ndash; not only the revenue
        sources have to be taken into account, but also the relationships between the
      different building blocks that will change as one of the elements changes.</p>
      <p>In our case,
        the value proposition of the archive changes while artefacts are being migrated
        from analogue carriers of information to digital assets. With this migration,
        the variable cost of distribution decreases tremendously, in turn opening up
        ways to reach many new client segments that were previously difficult or very
        expensive to reach. Whereas the main client segment of organizations in the
        cultural heritage domain used to be limited to professional researchers and
        program makers who would come to the physical location to conduct research, a
        larger public can now be engaged in using parts of the archive that have
        specific interest to them. Naturally, this new group has its own specific
        requirements and therefore will not necessarily be reached using the same
        channels and services as the professionals. In table 1, the user groups of Sound
      and Vision are listed.</p>
      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tr>
          <th><p class="TableText" align="left" style='text-align:left'>User Groups:

      </tr>
        <tr>

            organizations (for reuse on DVDs, CDs, internet, for commercial screenings
          and so on)</p></td>
      </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><p class="TableText" align="left" style='text-align:left'>3. Non-Profit
          (use in museums, filmfestivals, and so on)</p></td>
      </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><p class="TableText" align="left" style='text-align:left'>4. Education
          (primary, secondary, higher)</p></td>
      </tr>
        <tr>

          General Public</p></td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      <p class="captionTable">&nbsp;Table 1. Classification user groups, Sound and Vision</p>
      <p>The
        organization&rsquo;s &lsquo;relation&rsquo; with its user groups is shifting, and will often take
        place inside an on-line environment, which in turn changes the nature of the relationship
        with this group. Instead of a relatively intense, enduring relationship with
        customers who frequent the building, we are now engaging with a group that may
      hardly be aware of the institution hosting the content. </p>
      <p>Similarly,
        a completely different type of organization will be required to support this
        new value proposition. Instead of a physical building at the centre of the cost
        structure, we will quite likely see a shift towards a more platform-driven cost
      structure.</p>
      <p>On an
        organizational level, different skill sets will be required to support the new
        value proposition. Such organizational change will call for new consideration
        of questions surrounding outsourcing and in-house development. Thus the
        business model canvas consists of two distinct parts, the back end that defines
      the cost structure, and the front end that defines the revenue structure. </p>
      <p>The
        business model canvas defines how institutions can capitalize on the new value
        proposition of digitized audiovisual material. It defines the socio-economic
        benefits to new client groups in a structured way. With this model as a
        starting point, we have set out to investigate what could be the most
        successful value propositions for the client groups that have a vested interest
        in the content the project is making available. This has resulted in a
      collection of services that we describe in Section 4.</p>
      <p>Obviously,
        Images for the Future does not operate as an island. The project is constantly
        on the lookout for inspirational business model innovations inside and outside
        the heritage realm. One interesting example particularly worth mentioning is
        Saatchi Gallery. Saatchi provides a free on-line platform on which artists can
        promote their work to a global audience. Painters, photographers, sculptors, graffiti
        specialists and video artists post high-resolution images of their work,
        provide details of their biographies and future shows, link to their friends&rsquo;
        sites, and &quot;chat&quot; with other artists and art lovers. Collectors can browse,
        comment on what they find, and buy works they are interested in by contacting
        the artist, without dealing with a gallery or auction house. Saatchi Gallery
        succeeded in changing their business model: they reach new and larger user
        groups via their on-line platform. In numbers: 600,000 visitors used to visit
        the Thames-side gallery each year; now the on-line platform receives 70 million
      views per day (Edgecliffe, 2007).</p>
      <h2>4. User-Centric Approach</h2>
      <p>One of the
        guiding principles of service development at Images for the Future is that it
        follows a user-centric approach. The consortium believes that value creation
        always starts with the user - in Osterwalder&rsquo;s model,
        the &lsquo;front end&rsquo; of the diagram. Everything else is derived from there. The
        &quot;Accumulation, Archiving and Construction&quot; model proposed by Mirko Tobias Schaefer is used to measure/analyze the
        activities of users. Schaefer defined this model for structural mapping of the
        user activities that are often summarized as user-generated content,
        convergence, collective production and so on. Schaefer divides the model into
        three domains; Accumulation, Archiving/Organizing, and
      Construction. This notion is represented in figure 2 below.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="oomen.fig2.jpg" alt="figure 2" width="500" height="224" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 2:
      Value creation always starts with user</p>
      <p>Schaefer
      defines the three domains as follows:</p>
      <p><b>Accumulation </b>describes all activities that revolve around
        popular media content and products, for the most part initially developed by
      corporate companies.</p>
      <p><b>Archiving/Organizing &nbsp;takes</b> place on several levels. On an
        active and intrinsic level, users store artefacts, build archives and
        reorganize cultural resources and knowledge bases. On a more passive level,
        archiving work is done by the multitude of fan sites that organize links to
        related content or the many Web logs and Web forums that share content
      originally produced by corporate companies.</p>
      <p><b>Construction</b> is production occurring outside established
        culture industries. It describes the emergence of new distribution and
        production means that are not institutionalized and not necessarily controlled
        by an owner, but generally are at the user's disposal. It describes the
        production of new content and new technologies, as opposed to media that
      comment on or relate directly to popular media productions (Schaefer, 2008).</p>
      <p>He writes:
        &quot;These three domains are not mutually exclusive and overlap to a certain
        extent. The logic of electronic distribution and the copying of files applies
        to all of them.&quot; This model puts users in the centre of the analysis. It needs
        to be noted that, to a certain degree, the use of the model is an arbitrary
        exercise. Nevertheless, it provides a way to map differences and similarities
        between the services offered. In section 4.2 we use this model to analyze the
        way users interact with the Images for the Future services described in section
      4.1. </p>
      <h3>4.1 Cases</h3>
      <p>Digitized
        (or born-digital) collections can be put to use as educational material, as
        sources for television programs, in Web applications, in games, and so on. The
        starting point is the realization of the broadest possible access to the
        content, both for developers and end users. As already mentioned in Section 2,
        it is of vital importance to make arrangements with rights holders regarding
        the reuse of copyrighted material. Various services were set up after Images
        for the Future was launched in the summer of 2007. Below, the most significant
      services are described. </p>
      <h3>ED*IT and Academia: video
      in the classroom</h3>
      <p>The
        educational sector is the most important target group for Images for the
        Future, also in terms of revenue; 60% of the income generated from the project
        is expected to come from services aimed at this market. Using digitized
        heritage as flexible learning objects is a very promising development and is
        beneficial for learners of all ages (Mizuko, 2008). Images for the Future provides access to the content of existing
          services, such as Teleblik and Academia (<span
class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="../http://www.teleblik.nl/">http://www.teleblik.nl</a></span>, <a href="../http://www.academia.nl/">http://www.academia.nl</a>, platforms for
            primary/secondary and higher education respectively) and also develops new
      services, ED*IT being the flagship initiative.  </p>
      <p>ED*IT (<a href="../http://www.ed-it.nu/">http://www.ed-it.nu/</a>) is a
        multi-media educational platform that can be fully integrated into existing
        learning environments. The service will be used for the first time in the
        2009-2010 school year and will offer content from Sound and Vision, the Filmmuseum, Public Broadcasters, Nationaal Archief (the National Archive of the Netherlands),
        and four museums within the fields of technology, national history, history and
        ethnography. This includes thousands of written sources, tens of thousands of
        video clips, and hundreds of &nbsp;thousands of stills. The editorial board is made up of
        experts from the educational broadcasting and library sector. This way, ED*IT
        can guarantee that metadata and contextual information is fully in line with
        current educational practice and timely subject matters. Teachers can create
        their own lesson templates, use already existing ones, or collaborate with
      peers to co-create material. </p>
      <p>The foundations of ED*IT lie in existing and
        widely adopted services for authentication and metadata management operated by Kennisnet. Its design and applications are developed in
        such a way that it can be used next to, or as substitute for, existing learning
        materials. The platform offers the ability to search, edit and create on-line
        lessons, papers and presentations, timelines, and so on. Finally, the ED*IT
        platform also allows users to upload their own material so it can be integrated
        into presentations. In a separate project, &quot;Les 2.0&quot;, ready-to-use lessons are
        created using ED*IT material. Schools register for ED*IT and pay an annual fee
        based on the number of students accessing the service. In February 2009, this
        fee was set at &euro;1.85 per student in primary education for a two-year contract. The
      fee for secondary education is one Euro higher.</p>
      <h3>Open Images</h3>
      <p>Sound and Vision and Knowledgeland are developing <b>Open
        Images</b> (<a href="../http://www.openimages.org/">http://www.openimages.org</a>). The aim of this platform is to offer on-line
        access to a selection of archive material to stimulate creative reuse. Reuse
        includes remixing of archive footage into new videos. The selection will be
        based on certain properties. For example, excerpts of already distributed DVDs
        that make use of archival content will be included to act as teasers. A similar
        business model is used by Prelinger Archives. This
        footage agency offers free, high quality downloads of over 2,000 items through
        the Internet Archive and still generates revenue from this material. In a
        recent keynote address, Rick Prelinger (director of Prelinger archives) asks the fundamental question: &quot;How do
        you give away something and sell it at the same time?&quot; He proposes two levels: free
      and fee. </p>
      <p class="BlockQuote">At the free level, you can download everything
        you want from the Internet Archive. But use is at your own risk and there is no
        detailed contract concerning copyrights. At the fee level, you can get physical
      materials and written license agreements with your name at the top.</p>
      <p><span>&nbsp;</span>This strategy has proven to be very successful for Prelinger Archives and serves as an example for others to
        follow. A recent example is provided by Monty Python.
        After the launch of their YouTube channel, sales of their DVD&rsquo;s increased by
      23,000 % (Mashable, 2009).</p>
      <p>Open Images supports interlinking with other
        data sources (like Wikipedia),
        allowing the easy creation of mashups between data
        sources. Access to the content is based on the Creative Commons model,
        which proposes a middle way to rights management, rather than the extremes of
        the pure public domain or the reservation of all rights (Lessig,
        2006). The &lsquo;open&rsquo; nature of the project is underscored by the adaption of open video formats (notably Ogg) and the use of open source software
        (MMbase) for its infrastructure. Software resulting
        from Open Images will also be released under an open source license. To
        stimulate the uptake of the philosophy behind Open Images, Sound and Vision
        joined the Open Video Alliance, an ad-hoc group of organizations dedicated to
        fostering the growth of open video. As one of the first public results, a
        comprehensive list of open source video software has been created by
        researchers at Sound and Vision and is now being updated continuously by
        members of the Alliance. The Open Images platform will contain hundreds of
      items when it is launched in June 2009. </p>
      <h3>Sound and
      Vision Wiki</h3>
      <p>Although annotations (metadata)
        created by cataloguers provide key knowledge of the collection of Sound and
        Vision, they also have fundamental limitations. For example, given the
        substantial amount of time it takes to generate them, they will not provide a
        lot of detail; they are also bound to be subjective and only cover one
        interpretation, where there are many. In short: manual annotations often lack the
      contextual knowledge required by value content.</p>
      <p>The aim of the Sound and Vision Wiki (<a href="../http://www.beeldengeluidwiki.nl/">http://www.beeldengeluidwiki.nl</a>) is to
        add contextual information to the collection of Sound and Vision by inviting
        &quot;The Commons&quot; to document and share their knowledge about programs, media
        personalities and media related topics. This is not restricted to universities
        or journalists: a broad constituency of enthusiasts should be encouraged to
      contribute to their heart's content.</p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="../http://www.beeldengeluidwiki.nl/"><img src="oomen.fig3.jpg" alt="figure 3" width="500" height="326" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 3: Sound and Vision Wiki
        &ndash; biography template <a href="../http://www.beeldengeluidwiki.nl/">http://www.beeldengeluidwiki.nl</a></p>
      <p>The Sound and Vision Wiki was launched in February 2008.
        Currently, this semi-curated wiki (people have to
        register) features over 2.000 articles related to Dutch television programs and
        400 biographies of media-personalities written by students, academics,
        curators, and other enthusiasts. The eventual goal is to have 50,000 lemmas by
        2014. Offering provenance and reliability are two preconditions to the success
        of the project. First, two staff members of Sound and Vision continuously
        monitor the contributions. They are assisted by a larger
          so-called &quot;expert council&quot;. Second, the Wiki uses the MediaWiki platform used by Wikipedia. Contributors are
        required to register to the site first, and by doing so, to the use of the
        Creative Commons &quot; Attribution-Share Alike 3.0&quot; license, allowing others to use
        the articles in new publications (Beeldengeluidwiki,
      2009).</p>
      <p>This resource exists next to the institutional
        catalogue governed by professional cataloguers. Within the BRIDGE project, the Wiki
        will be linked to this catalogue, and to other sources on the Web that are
        centred on entities, themes and events (Bridge, 2009). These activities will
      improve access to the collections, and subsequently income generated for reuse.</p>
      <h3><i>Nationaal Archief on Flickr The Commons</i></h3>
      <p>Within the project Images for the Future, 1.2
        million photographs will be digitized. One of the main goals of the project is
        that the material be broadly accessible. However, a lot of the items in the
        collections (in this case from the Nationaal Archief) lack adequate metadata. At present, professional
        cataloguers and a relatively small group of dedicated volunteers add metadata
        and contextual information. Given the vast quantity of stills that need to be
        annotated, the Nationaal Archief realized they needed a broader public to help them and decided to join The
      Commons initiative. </p>
      <p>The Commons was launched early in 2008 as a collaboration between the Library of Congress (LoC) and Flickr. The LoC had been
        looking for a Web 2.0 partner for its digitized collection. On Flickr, 3
        million photographs are uploaded daily. Currently, over 3 billion photographs
        are available through Flickr, and there are 25 million unique tags (Flickr
        2008). Flickr&rsquo;s community of passionate photography
        lovers, its availability in eight languages, and approval of the infrastructure
        of the site led to the Library&rsquo;s decision to collaborate on this with Flickr.
        In the course of 2.5 days, the photos of the Library of Congress were supplied
        with 20.000 tags. To quote Clay Shirky, adjunct professor at NYU: &quot;Metadata has
        been democratized&quot; (Shirky, 2008). Metadata belongs no longer only to
        professionals, but to everybody. Currently, twenty archives contribute to The
      Commons, a number that will steadily increase.</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s important to note that participating
        institutions only publish material that is free of copyright restrictions under
        a &quot;no known copyright restrictions&quot; rights statement (Flickr, 2009).
        In November 2008, the Nationaal Archief (together with their partner Spaarnestad Photo)
        released a collection of several hundred photos. In the first two weeks, the
        photos of the Nationaal Archief had already received 400,000 views, and hundreds of comments and tags had been
        added, an overwhelming success. Currently, the Nationaal Archief investigates how these tags can be used to
        enrich their exciting catalogue, a timely research topic (Trant, 2008,
      Weinberger, 2007). </p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="oomen.fig4.jpg" alt="figure 4" width="500" height="342" /></p>

      <h3>Video Labeling Game</h3>
      <p>Researchers of the Telematica Institute have listed incentives of users to tag video content. These include
        future retrieval, contribution and sharing, attracting attention, play and
        competition, self-presentation, and opinion expression (Velzen,
        2008). Flickr The Commons already covers some of the incentives. To turn the
        incentive &quot;play and competition&quot; into the foundation of a new service, Sound
        and Vision has taken the initiative to develop a video tagging game, in close
        collaboration with software developer Q42, KRO broadcasting, and VU University
      Amsterdam </p>
      <p>Inspiration for this game came from the ESP
        Game (<a href="../http://www.gwap.com/">http://www.gwap.com/</a>), originally conceived by Luis von Ahn of Carnegie
        Mellon University. The rules of this game are simple. A user can chose from
        different channels (newsreels, talk shows, reality TV, documentaries etc.) on
        which videos are running consecutively. The user is automatically matched with
        a random partner. The partners do not know each other's identity and they
        cannot communicate. Once matched, they will both be shown the same video. Their
        task is to agree on a word that would be an appropriate label for what is
        visible on-screen. They both enter possible tags, and once a
          tag is entered by both partners (not necessarily at the same time), that
        tag is agreed upon. Players receive points, based on the temporal agreement
        with other users. User participation is vital to the success of the video
        tagging game, so a lot of attention is given to providing attractive game play,
      i.e. the experiences during the interaction with the game. </p>
      <h3>YouTube Branded Channel</h3>
      <p>In 2007, Sound and Vision was one of the first
        archives in Europe to offer access to a selection of their collection though a
        branded channel on YouTube. Currently, over 200 items can be viewed on-line:
        most of them originate from the newsreel collection. The clips have been viewed
        a stunning 1.2 million times, making the YouTube branded channel one of the
      most visited in The Netherlands.</p>
      <p class="caption"><img src="oomen.fig5.jpg" alt="figure 5" width="500" height="410" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 5: The most popular clip: the
      Beatles visiting the Netherlands in 1964 <a href="../http://www.youtube.com/beeldengeluid">http://www.youtube.com/beeldengeluid</a></p>
      <p>With this collaboration, Sound and Vision
        reaches a broad audience. Interestingly, 1,100+ users have registered to the
        feeds of the Branded Channel, and many of them add comments. Sound and Vision
        also uses the channel to promote events and (more recently) to promote the use
      of the Sound and Vision Wiki.</p>
      <h3>Filmotech.nl</h3>
      <p>&quot;Filmotech.nl&quot; is the working title of a soon-to-be-released
        video-on-demand platform. Initiated by the Association of Dutch Feature Film
        Producers (NVS), Filmotech.nl is a collaborative effort of the Dutch film industry,
        including three partners from Images for the Future: Sound and Vision, the Filmmuseum and Knowledgeland. The platform aims to provide access to the complete
        Dutch film repertoire and to a substantial selection of European content:
        feature films, television dramas, shorts, documentaries and animation. It will
        be unprecedented in size and depth, and enriched with metadata, context and
        historical background information. Filmotech sets out
      to be a service in the consumer market</p>
      <h3>Work in progress</h3>
      <p>The &quot;creative industry&quot; is an umbrella term for
        companies that include publishers, television and film producers, distributors,
        broadcasters, Internet providers and so on. Next to the education sector and
        the general audience, the creative industry is the third target audience for
        Images for the Future. Services are still in the developmental stage, but will
        include an on-line <b>footage sales
      platform</b> aimed at the international professional market, for example.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, negotiations are ongoing between
        the Images for the Future consortium and rights holders about the possibility of
        offering <b>access to our collections in
          libraries</b> through existing services operated by the Netherlands Public
        Library Association (VOB), notably its common catalogue Bibliotheek.nl. This would
        be a major step forward in reaching out to a wider audience. In parallel, the
        VOB will introduce so-called Web 2.0 functionalities on Bibliotheek.nl,
      allowing users to tag, review and rate the library&rsquo;s contents.</p>
      <p>Finally, the consortium is working on a number
        of so-called &quot;Gems&quot;: relatively small-scale campaigns aiming to present the
        outcomes of the project in innovative ways. They include <b>Celluloid Remix</b>, a competition where clips from the earliest
        decades of Dutch cinema are published and presented as building blocks for new
        videos. The Gem <b>Pinkpop</b><b> Time Machine</b> uses the most recent
        developments in visual and audio data mining technology so that 40 years of Pinkpop, the oldest annual festival in the world, can be
      accessed and explored in an experimental manner. </p>
      <h3>4.2 Accumulation, Archiving and
      Construction model</h3>
      <p class="caption"><img src="oomen.fig6.jpg" alt="figure 6" width="500" height="309" /></p>
      <p class="caption">Fig 6: Accumulation, Archiving and
      Construction</p>
      <p>If we try to plot the cases on the &lsquo;Accumulation,
        Archiving and Construction&rsquo; map, it becomes clear that Images for the Future
      already offers various value creations by users.</p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, the three domains can
        overlap. YouTube and Flickr provide platforms for the storage, annotation and
        distribution of videos. These services combine professional and
        non-professional content, and also serve as a platform for community
        involvement. Although content can be placed on other platforms, most activities
        take place on the institutionalized platforms. ED*IT combines institutional-
        and user-generated content and offers the possibility for users to create new
        productions (i.e. lesson templates, timelines, presentations and so on).
        Construction takes place outside of the professional realm, so ED*IT is
      positioned towards Construction.</p>
      <p>Open Images is based on a completely &lsquo;open&rsquo; philosophy.
        The platform encourages users to remix content and distribute these new
        productions on whatever channel they prefer. Open Images uses Creative Commons licenses so that people will be obligated
        to mention the source of the material they use from contributing archives.
        Several services are placed between the nodes Construction and Archiving. The
        Sound and Vision Wiki, for example, is used primarily as a platform to gather
        contextual information on the collection collectively. The initiative that aims
        at providing access to audiovisual content in libraries is positioned near the
        Archive node, as its goal is to structurally access heterogeneous sources
        (books, magazines, videos, CDs), using Web 2.0 to add valuable information to
      the catalogue.</p>
      <p>The Footage Library is the only service in the
        model that mainly targets professionals. A fee needs to be paid to rights
        holders to repurpose (remix) archive holdings. Filmotech.nl has the same
        business proposition, but aims (primarily) at the consumer market. Here
        Accumulation relates to the way this platform allows users to watch archive
      content next to more current releases.</p>
      <p>The Video Labeling game will result in tags that relate to visual concepts in videos. In a second
        phase, these will be used to provide users with more fine-grained search
      capabilities. Therefore, it is placed close to the Archiving node.</p>
      <p>The table below is a summary of the value
        proposition for each of the services, as well as a classification of the nature
        of participation by users. The relative significance of an activity in a given
      service is represented by its font size. </p>

      <p class="caption">Table 2:&nbsp; Value proposition and Creation</p>
      <p>The table shows how value is created in
        different ways. The current portfolio of services already covers the three
        corners of user-centered value creation.
        Interestingly, ED*IT, Footage Sales Platform and Filmotec (that generate direct revenue, measured in Euro&rsquo;s) are all tied to
        Accumulation. Schaefer notes how &quot;this domain [&hellip;] has considerable potential
        for confrontations between users and copyright holders&quot; (Schaefer, 2008).
        However, Images for the Future approaches the relationship between users less as
        a confrontation between conflicting interests. Copyright holders are by
        definition an integral part of the business model, as a constituent in the
      &quot;Partner Network&quot;, so new services also benefit them.</p>
      <h2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Concluding
      Remarks</h2>
      <p>A myriad of services can be created as cultural
        heritage splashes into the digital age. Due to user-demand, growing
        availability of digital collections, increased connectivity, maturing of data
        mining and semantic Web technology (to name just a few), thinking about
        services is evolving at an increasingly rapid pace. There is clear interest in
        well-documented and tested services that add value to digitized collections
        that can serve as best practices. New value propositions are key in giving
        organizations the perspective, the confidence, the contacts,
        the tools and the funding to launch major digitization projects (Blue,
      2008). </p>
      <p>In this article, the notion
        of service development by cultural heritage institutions has been linked to
        value creation by users. Perhaps not surprisingly, business models can
        be based on a variety of value creations, from subscription-based models (i.e.
        ED*IT) to completely free services (i.e. Open Images). This exercise proved to
        be insightful. It provides proof that digitized cultural heritage can be used
        in endless ways and within various contexts, meeting expectations of a
      heterogeneous group of users.</p>
      <p>Obviously, a lot more research is required to
        precisely supervise the return-on-investment of digitization efforts, be it
        &quot;hard numbers&quot; or social benefits. This work is conducted by organizations in
        the cultural heritage field across the globe. [ The Research Blog (<a href="../http://research.imagesforthefuture.org/">http://research.imagesforthefuture.org</a>/)
        maintained by the project will continuously report on developments in this
      area.]</p>
      <p>Initial findings are encouraging. In
        the Netherlands, for example, organizations working within Images for the
        Future have recently witnessed a steep rise in requests by professionals, in consumer
        sales, and in the utilization of material in education. Also, public-private
        partnerships are being forged and will certainly increase the impact of the
        project through (for example) its employment over new distribution channels and
      devices.</p>
      <p>As we increasingly live our lives
        on-line, we need to be sure cultural heritage stays paramount. Images for the
        Future aims to create a framework for action that will advance thinking in this
      area to make this a reality.</p>
