	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
	  <p class=normal>A day in Cape York, in the far north east of Australia, 
		can change the life of a modern Australian. In that time, one can see 
		hundreds of examples of rock art that are up to 36,000 years old, sharply 
		contrasting the history of Indigenous people and the immigration of Europeans. 
	  </p>
	  <p class=normal>One such visit led to a proposal for collaboration between 
		the Quinkan Culture Elders and a team of metadata researchers<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> 
		<![if !supportFootnotes]>
		[i] 
		<![endif]>
		</a>. The researchers proposed a Qualified Dublin Core style<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> 
		<![if !supportFootnotes]>
		[ii] 
		<![endif]>
		</a> catalogue to be used to identify and record examples of Quinkan Culture 
		so Elders could at last gain access to information needed to manage the 
		proliferation of unauthorised publications about Quinkan culture, and 
		to 'bring back home' cultural representations. In addition, the catalogue 
		would allow the Elders to make decisions about publishing their own representations.</p>
	  <p class=normal>In the nearest city (200 miles away), Elders attended a 
		computer workshop and accessed the Web. Most exciting was the viewing 
		of a recent video of some Elders talking about a honey tree. They enjoyed 
		sharing their stories of collecting honey. They decided a multimedia catalogue 
		would make it easy to prompt new stories and explanations without the 
		need to travel far out into the country.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Meanwhile, working with the Dublin Core Metadata Element 
		Set (DC) has been found by the authoritative museum community to lack 
		much of the richness that is valued by curators. CIMI<a
href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> 
		<![if !supportFootnotes]>
		[iii] 
		<![endif]>
		</a> several years ago energetically investigated the possibilities and 
		found it necessary to modify and extend DC. This work was done with early 
		versions of DC, however. Recently, DC has gained from experience and changed 
		so that it may, indeed, now perform more usefully in this role. The Quinkan 
		researchers are investigating this.</p>
	  <p class=normal>This paper describes a journey undertaken in a university 
		office by some researchers through a myriad of disciplines as they have 
		sought, through literature and so far a very few interactions with Indigenous 
		Elders, a way of using Qualified DC metadata (QDC) to describe, collect, 
		and represent Quinkan Culture. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Of interest in this paper is how developing a QDC representation 
		has led to questions of cultural definition. This is not a paper about 
		how Indigenous people have worked on their cultural interests. It is about 
		how the questions being asked by the researchers have changed. In fact, 
		these questions appear as indicators of the change in their understanding. 
		Why such changes are reported here is because they seem to offer a way 
		of thinking about the use of metadata-based technologies to explore the 
		nature of tools that may be useful to those working in cultural contexts.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Context</h1>
	  <p class=normal>We held a series of meetings and exploratory visits to the 
		far north east of Australia, where the communities are small and Indigenous 
		people have been involuntarily scattered. We, a small group of European 
		Australians, proposed a project that we hoped would serve as a useful 
		resource for our Indigenous colleagues and help them repatriate their 
		heritage. We are not experts in such matters, with the exception of one 
		of us who is a specialist in the archaeology of the region.</p>
	  <p class=normal>To us novices, it seemed that a catalogue of cultural heritage 
		would make it easier for the Indigenous people to control their heritage. 
		There was a rewarding workshop in which Indigenous Elders showed their 
		pleasure in sharing interpretations of events and objects, and we assumed 
		from this that a catalogue might be a good organising tool and stimulus 
		for gathering such stories.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Naively, perhaps, we thought Quinkan culture would somehow 
		be amenable to being catalogued. It seemed that all that would be required 
		was something like an extension of an archaeological catalogue. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Sadly, there no longer are rock artists, and relevant cultural 
		practices are scarce. Today, Elders tell stories of hunting, of gathering 
		bush tucker, of lives in which they have unfortunately been victims of 
		the invasion of their country. They gather to celebrate their dance culture. 
		They take people to see some of the many Rock Art paintings. There has 
		been carbon dating of some paintings, scores of anthropological, geological, 
		and many other forms of study of the region, and there are data in many 
		forms and locations world-wide. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The government is building an 'interpretive centre' 
		in the region, but what is to happen there is unclear. This 'open' museum 
		may be a collection of tangible and intangible assets, a presentation 
		site, a meeting place. Whatever, it is in its infancy as a cultural institution. 
		One idea is that the Quinkan catalogue will be a living exhibit, an environment, 
		in this small space, and possibly a cultural heritage management tool. 
	  </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The First Question</h1>
	  <p class=normal>Given that the most obvious 'cultural assets' 
		in the region are Rock Art paintings and petroglyphs, our focus naturally 
		gravitated towards these. This is not all there is in the region, of 
		course, but such a vast number in apparently original condition is attractive 
		as a 'collection', a set of objects that can be identified, 
		described, possibly even quantified. It is also interesting to note that 
		these paintings are fixed; their location is stable and discernible in 
		great detail using modern geo-spatial tools and techniques. At first glance, 
		it might seem that the first question would be how to describe the location 
		of the paintings, and then everything would follow.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Quinkan Rock Art occurs in what have been called galleries, 
		usually open shelters high up on steep overhanging rock outcrops. The 
		areas are appealing because of their aspect, catching the breezes and 
		providing shelter, and frequently also having good views of the surrounding 
		country. Galleries contain as many as hundreds of paintings, often superimposed 
		on one another, with remarkably fresh-looking paintings in abundance. 
		Fortunately, although there are almost no resources available to protect 
		this heritage, it is isolated and has not suffered, as it might, from 
		extensive tourism. Like the flora and fauna of Australia, the Rock Art 
		sites are geologically frail, and human visitations cause significant 
		damage to the sites themselves, as well as to the paintings.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Not all paintings or galleries have been identified and 
		had their location recorded. Some have had minute details recorded about 
		them, while others are known to be sort of 'over there'. But 
		the idea of a stable identification system with descriptions of material 
		culture is attractive, and modern technology offers great precision to 
		the task of recording relevant locations.</p>
	  <p class=normal>So using location with sufficient detail to develop a geo-spatial 
		topology could solve our problems. This is, after all, a typical approach: 
		every resource in our collection could have the location of its content 
		so well specified that it would only need to be differentiated from others 
		that are related to <i>exactly</i> the same location. Trouble is, Elders 
		do not want their paintings, or presumably their culture in general, identified 
		in this way. The way we want to describe locations is, a matter of cultural 
		preference, and geo-spatial science is not a traditional way. In Australian 
		Indigenous cultures, land is not just a commodity, and location is not 
		just a number. The sites where paintings are located are the same places 
		where sacred objects and spirits are likely to be found. People and their 
		country, locations as others think of them, are inextricable intertwined. 
		Access is often limited to a few people, and the rules for access are 
		not published. </p>
	  <p class=normal>For non-Indigenous researchers who work on Indigenous cultural 
		heritage in the area, recording and revealing locations has no more interest 
		than for their Indigenous colleagues. The paintings are in remote country, 
		perhaps several days' walking time from the nearest accessible track, 
		and that might be several days' driving from the nearest town. Small 
		helicopters can sometimes land directly near sites. But site visitation 
		is always at a cost, and sadly, it is the condition of the paintings that 
		suffers most when dust is disturbed by visitors and abrasion wears out 
		yet more of the precious images, or when ancient meeting places are disturbed.</p>
	  <p class=normal>What if we were dealing with a Rock Art painting, a chart, 
		a photograph, a scanned image, etc and all were at exactly the same place? 
		The geo-spatial information would not be sufficient to distinguish among 
		the objects just listed. The differences among the objects would be of 
		form, perhaps ownership, possibly content as viewed by different people, 
		and more. Recording these differences, or identifiers, is the primary 
		work of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES). Every object described 
		by DCMES has a unique resource identifier (a URI) and a range of other 
		identifiers. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Seeking Answers to the First Question</h2>
	  <p class=normal>So the first question was: how should the objects to be 
		catalogued be described using a DC-based system?</p>
	  <p class=normal>Starting in what seemed the obvious place, the team consulted 
		the resident archaeologist who, as an archaeologist, has focused on particular 
		examples of material culture, paintings. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Typical archaeological work describes in detail some aspects 
		of the paintings and has at times depended upon descriptive vocabularies 
		that allow for classification of aspects of paintings. A good example 
		is the use of colour classifications that allow archaeologists to make 
		comparisons of the colouring of paintings. Given that all the paintings 
		are in the open air, the time of day makes a significant difference to 
		their appearance. Observations of colour need to be time-stamped and seasonally-marked 
		as part of their codification if they are to be useful. The development 
		of useful colour classifications has therefore been of interest to archaeologists, 
		and there are specialised and idiosyncratic classification schemata. </p>
	  <p class=normal>So to classify all the Rock Art paintings by colour should 
		be a relatively objective activity, and there are established criteria. 
		The same is true of other aspects of the paintings: the date, the location, 
		the shapes of the objects within the paintings, even photographs of the 
		paintings, drawings of them, stories about them, everything could be described. 
		Not all the items would be paintings, of course. In fact, we anticipate 
		stories about paintings and stories about those stories, something like 
		annotations of interpretations or descriptions. But still these objects 
		can be described. Each one is a unique object and with a good description, 
		can be identified.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The information scientist in the team is versed in metadata 
		and had no trouble building a metadata profile that provided for elements 
		and sub-elements, with controlled vocabularies, specialised formats, etc. 
		This work made good sense and could be neatly represented in a hypertext 
		Web page with pull-down menus and active buttons. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The 'describing process' was reduced to the 
		filling in of a form. The description would be more or less useful depending 
		upon how well the elements and qualifications of them were chosen. The 
		metadata application profile (MAP) for each item in the catalogue had 
		be developed in the light of experience over many years, even centuries, 
		on the part of museums, libraries, scholars and others.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Describing objects in this way has been, for a long 'Web' 
		time, the primary use of metadata, particularly of Dublin Core (DC) metadata. 
		Finding the criteria that make it possible to distinguish an object from 
		all other objects with which it might be confused is a primary role for 
		a metadata profile. If a system can use the description of each item in 
		an appropriate way, it will have a handle by which it can perform functions 
		and provide services, such as discovery.</p>
	  <p class=normal>A good example is provided by a resource that is a photograph. 
		If the description is complete, it will be clear not only who and what 
		are in the photograph, the 'aboutness' of the photograph. 
		It will also be discernible which version of the photograph it is, where 
		it is, and so on, and the photograph will be distinguishable from another 
		that looks similar but is, in fact, a second print from the same negative.</p>
	  <p class=normal>We have come to think of this as a first dimensional activity. 
		Unless an item can be uniquely identified, nothing more is possible, so 
		its description is the crucial first requirement, its DNA. The description 
		that we produce for items in Matchbox can be represented completely in 
		Hypertext Markup Language (HTML<a href="#_edn4"
name="_ednref4" title=""> 
		<![if !supportFootnotes]>
		[iv] 
		<![endif]>
		</a>). It is capable of being written in plain text with tags to show 
		what each bit means, and it can easily be read and understood by humans. 
		Significantly, the tags can be read by machines so they too can tell what 
		bit goes where. The meaning of what is between the tags, the content that 
		is added to the MAP, is, of course, opaque to the machines.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">The First Question Leads to the First Dimension 
	  </h2>
	  <div> 
		<p class=normal>So working on the first question leads to a set of textual 
		  statements that are meaningful to humans and computers and can isolate 
		  a chosen object from others. </p>
		<p class=normal>First dimension mapping (filling in of a MAP) is primarily 
		  for discovery. It can also be used to do simple things like pointing 
		  to links between objects. In other words, first dimension maps can be 
		  used in a first dimension way, for discovery, because they can be used 
		  for matching and thus for filtering, and so they can support discovery.</p>
	  </div>
	  <p class=normal>An object might have the special DC tag that contains information 
		about how one object relates to another. Suppose this digitised photograph 
		is of a painting that records a visitor in a gallery that contains a Rock 
		Art painting. The digitised photograph can be linked syntactically (by 
		a machine) to the photograph of the painting if both objects are registered 
		in the same catalogue: the digitised photograph will have the relationship 
		'is format of' to the photograph. Significantly, the relationship 
		is between one object and another; for instance, a digital file and the 
		photograph that was scanned. There is no machine-readable mechanism for 
		recording the semantic link between the photographs. That is, that the 
		two photographs and the chart are all of the same Rock Art painting is 
		not machine accessible information. The relationship of the semantics, 
		or content, is not expressed in HTML although by filtering the HTML an 
		application could get access to information to make this link. (The important 
		thing to note is that HTML does not convey the link. It is not a part 
		of the description of the photograph, but rather a connection that has 
		to be made somehow.)</p>
	  <p class=normal>It is critical that the object's description contain 
		the necessary information and that the information be in good form and 
		understandable, with ways of deciphering it where necessary, such as dependence 
		on a documented controlled vocabulary. It is not critical, however, that 
		the information be in a simple form such as the proposed HTML version 
		(referred to above). It may be in a more complex form, expressed in eXtensible 
		Markup Language (XML<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"
title=""> 
		<![if !supportFootnotes]>
		[v] 
		<![endif]>
		</a>) or even using the Resource Description Framework (RDF<a
href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> 
		<![if !supportFootnotes]>
		[vi] 
		<![endif]>
		</a>). Where this is the case, there is generally also a human-readable 
		version made available by the system responsible for the representation 
		because, although the text content is within the XML or RDF, it is surrounded 
		by a lot of other syntactical clutter that may make reading it difficult. 
		The form of expression is not important for its first dimensional use, 
		for discovery that is based on unique identification, for example. Whether 
		the additional information contained in the XML or RDF format is a problem 
		or not depends upon the system using it.</p>

	  <p class=normal>The second question relates to how the semantics of the 
		descriptions can be made to carry information about the structure of the 
		descriptions. How can it be made known to a machine that this object is 
		a scanned version of that object? It turns out that finding a way to represent 
		structure is the next problem. </p>
	  <p class=normal>If I am looking for something and do not know its DNA, or 
		MAP values, I may want to 'browse' through what is available 
		until I find something that will do for me. This is the typical position 
		of many users of Web navigation; they know they want something but either 
		have not spent the time or do not know how to frame a discovery question 
		that will guide them to a satisfactory object (containing the required 
		information). This user is doing something quite different from those 
		who know exactly what objects they are looking for - the user 
		in this case is usually looking for information about something but not 
		sure what form that information will take (and maybe does not care anyway). 
		The mapping that will provide this user with what is wanted will have 
		to be used somehow to link objects in some hierarchy that will lead the 
		user towards material satisfactory for the purpose. In fact, often the 
		user likes to vary the discovery process and tries at times to narrow 
		the field with a search during the browse, but inasmuch as he or she is 
		using a browse navigation system, the object's description MAP will 
		be essential. It will be used to show that this is a scanned version of 
		that, for instance, because the two objects will be identified as having 
		a relationship to different parts of a single hierarchy of production 
		of digitised images.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Question Two Works to the Second Dimension</h2>
	  <p class=normal>In the Matchbox case, it is not clear how users will want 
		to browse, or, more correctly perhaps, what they will expect to find as 
		the underlying structure of a browsing activity. Users do not always see 
		the structure, but it is important that they learn to 'drive' 
		it, and this usually comes from the effective development of a structural 
		representation in the users' minds. Users do not like suddenly being 
		jumped to a resource or set of resources that do not have what appears 
		to them as a logical connection with what they thought they were asking 
		for, or the resources they thought they were already viewing.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Some Matchbox users do act in predictable ways: those who 
		work within established disciplines usually have learned to respond to 
		the disciplinary taxonomies and terminology and can make fairly accurate 
		guesses about what will happen if they are browsing up or down a hierarchy 
		of criteria. It is also fairly predictable what type of criteria they 
		will use: title, format, aboutness, authorship, etc., in many cases. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The Dublin Core Metadata Application Profile captures this 
		information well. Once there is more specificity, qualifications to the 
		DCMES can focus the mind appropriately, especially if there are additional 
		elements that are useful in the context (for instance, the CIMI profile 
		for museums). But in order to be machine readable, this structure must 
		be declared in syntax that makes it accessible to machines. So the team 
		has to express its qualified, extended Dublin Core-based metadata application 
		profile for Matchbox in a way that will convey the relationships. XML, 
		as recommended for the DCMES, makes it possible to declare both the relationships 
		and the data. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The photograph of the person referred to above might contain 
		information such as that the person 'is the child of xx' and 
		'is the parent of yy'. This is interesting but not readable 
		information if it is expressed in HTML: the semantics are opaque. But 
		if the semantics are expressed in a machine-readable way, the photograph, 
		upon inclusion in the collection, can be linked by a set structure such 
		as a family tree to pictures of the parent and child if they are in the 
		collection.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Ideally, where elements are found useful and derived from 
		established metadata application profiles, it should be easy and most 
		accurate to simply import them into a new, combined, in this case Quinkan, 
		profile. eXtensible Markup Language (XML) makes this possible, so instead 
		of recording the maps of resources in HTML, it becomes necessary to record 
		them in XML so their structures will also be recorded and thus decipherable.</p>
	  <p class=normal>XML is such a versatile language that many people can be 
		using compliant, valid XML, and recording the structure of their information 
		about their resources, and not be constrained by having to use the same 
		way of representing their information. If MAPs from different sources 
		are to be combined, however, there will be a problem with also conveying 
		the structure that is associated with those MAPs. XML does not provide 
		an easy way to solve this as the structure needs to be declared in advance, 
		and it may be broken by the process of combining bits and pieces. In other 
		words, the structure and the information are so closely coupled in XML 
		that there is a risk the coupling will be broken when the XML is fragmented.</p>
	  <p class=normal>In the Matchbox case, this means recombining the pieces 
		of others' MAPs with the new, special Quinkan pieces, to work in 
		an integrated structure to be provided by the team. This structure, or 
		taxonomy as we refer to it, will determine the browse structure. In fact, 
		we may provide more than one to suit more than one group of predictable 
		users. Some taxonomies, particularly those that are established elsewhere 
		as useful to disciplined users (archaeologists, anthropologists, etc.), 
		have already been identified and will be used to organise the semantic 
		content of the resource maps, but they will need to be augmented by more 
		general user-oriented taxonomies.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Just as HTML was closely related to the opening up of the 
		first dimension of discovery, eXtensible Markup language that provides 
		structure has made possible the second level. Without a structured description, 
		there is not the control required. But once in XML, it does not matter 
		if there is more structure than is necessary. For instance, if the mark-up 
		complies with the Resource Description Framework (RDF), it is XML and 
		useful at both the first and second level but may have added advantages.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Pre-determining the structure of the resources unfortunately 
		does not work well in the Matchbox context. Our major challenge is not 
		to find how to catalogue resources so that those who work within well-defined 
		disciplines can find them, but to extend the opportunities for use of 
		the resources and particularly to find ways of making them useful to the 
		Traditional Owners of the Rock Art. We had no idea how such people would 
		want to classify information about their heritage.</p>
	  <p class=normal>So we moved to question three.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Question Three</h1>
	  <p class=normal>As soon as we asked how the resources should be organized, 
		we found ourselves asking what they would be used for. If Matchbox is 
		a cultural heritage tool, it should do things for its users. The problem 
		is, we don't know what they will want to do. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Perhaps users will just want to find a resource or find 
		if a resource exists. Perhaps they will want to know how it came to be 
		in the form it is in. But what if they want to do with resources something 
		like they do everyday: i.e., use resources in a cultural practice?</p>
	  <p class=normal>It is a well-known activity to try to find a link through 
		friends of friends from one person to another: 'I know Mary and 
		she knows Tom'. 'I am the daughter of Fred and he is the son 
		of Mabel, so Mabel is my grandmother.' These are examples of the 
		sort of relationships that people make between information, of cultural 
		practices. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Australian Indigenous people often have long histories of 
		their family in their memory, and they can relate these to people with 
		whom they are interacting. They also have kinship structures that are 
		different from the standard atomic family groupings that characterise 
		modern western society. Linking people in photographs in some ways associated 
		with indigenous kinship structures might prove to be of interest to Matchbox 
		users in the future. So far, such structures are not defined for use in 
		Matchbox, but they may be in the near future.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">The Third Dimension</h2>
	  <p class=normal>A simple example follows. It is not something that the Indigenous 
		people have said they want to d,o but it is proposed as typical of something 
		that might be of interest, so it can be presented to them.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Libby Miller and colleagues have developed Co-Depiction<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> 
		<![if !supportFootnotes]>
		[vii] 
		<![endif]>
		</a>, an RDF system that takes a photograph, with the e-mail addresses 
		of those in the picture, and uses this information to map from one person 
		in that picture to a person in another picture by working on the friends-of-a-friend 
		principle. If I am in a photo with Mary and Mary is in a photo with Jack, 
		then two photos can be used to automatically link me to Jack. </p>
	  <p class=normal><span class="normal">In the Matchbox example, the idea is 
		that as Indigenous people often use their genealogy to identify themselves, 
		it might be interesting to use a yet further constrained friend of a friend 
		principle to link photographs as they are placed in a collection. This 
		could be achieved by having a structure, as described before, and having 
		the new photograph deliberately located in relationship to that structure, 
		each photo being described as containing an image of a person in a particular 
		position in a family tree. But suppose we don't know the structure 
		or family-tree equivalent when we start collecting the photographs? Suppose 
		that the families are intermingled in ways that are not usually documented 
		in western family trees? Suppose the kinship structure requires quite 
		different sorts of connections to be made? All of these suppositions are 
		probably not far from the truth. So we need a way of dynamically associating 
		people and letting the structure emerge. We cannot be tied to a pre-determined</span> 
		structure.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Describing resources in the way prescribed by RDF leaves 
		open the opportunities we need. If we say of any resource, <i>only something 
		that can be said in the 'triple' format</i> <i>of this resource 
		(x) has this property (y) with this value (z)</i>, then we can make associations 
		as the photos are added to the collection. Instead of prescribing the 
		associations, we are choosing to leave them open but at the same time 
		provide enough structure for them to have the potential to be used. We 
		provide the simple triple structure in the place of a predetermined more 
		complex structure, and let that be defined later on.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusion</h1>
	  <p class=normal>At last we feel we are beginning to address the requirements 
		at the level at which they make some sense in our context. Matchbox needs 
		to use RDF because it is a requirement for the sort of 'doing' 
		that a cultural heritage tool can offer its users. We cannot predict what 
		our users will want to do, and we certainly realise now that we will not 
		be satisfied if all we offer them is a catalogue for discovery by search, 
		or even by browsing. We want to offer a cultural heritage tool, something 
		that does things for them, or with which they can do things. We are aware 
		that we will have to provide some means of accessing the power we provide, 
		but the interface issue is not of concern here.</p>
	  <p class=normal>This paper has worked through three levels of questions 
		that have emerged for the research team associated with the Quinkan Matchbox 
		project. The questions parallel the freedoms offered by the advances in 
		the relevant technologies.</p>
