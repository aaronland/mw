		 <p class=PaperTitle>White Gloves and the Web: Collections in the Classroom</p>
	 <p class=Author>Karen Elinich, The Franklin Institute Science Museum, USA</p>
	 <p class=URL><a href="http://www.fi.edu/" target="_blank">http://www.fi.edu</a></p>
	 <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>
	 <p class=AbstractText>By inviting teachers to put on white gloves and step 
		inside the collections, the online exhibition and interpretation process 
		becomes most meaningful for education. Museum professionals have ideas 
		about how teachers want to use primary objects in their classroom practice, 
		but the reality often departs from the expectation. Involving in-service 
		educators in the process maximizes the impact of the effort. </p>
	 <p class=AbstractText>Practicing teachers have helped The Franklin Institute 
		Online develop an educational context for two- and three-dimensional objects 
		from its collection of historical science artifacts. Currently, a new 
		initiative is underway, motivated by teachers' expressed needs to personalize 
		the historical objects. The Franklin Institute Awards program assembles 
		case files for every nominee. To date, over two thousand case files have 
		been created and preserved. Each case file represents a microcosmic portrait 
		of scientific achievement. </p>
	  <p class=AbstractText>Teachers are supporting the digitization prioritization 
		process, helping to identify the cases that have strongest value for classroom 
		usage and connections to standards-based curriculum. The list of possibilities 
		includes most every noteworthy scientist of the past 175 years including 
		Marie Curie, Alexander Graham Bell, Orville Wright, Albert Einstein, Stephen 
		Hawking, and Thomas Alva Edison. Each case file includes letters, journals, 
		diagrams, drawings, and a concise account of a life spent in service to 
		scientific achievement. </p>
	  <p class=keywords>Keywords: education, collections, historical science artifacts, 
		teachers, classroom, practical application, science inquiry. </p>
	  <p class=BlockQuote><span class="SubHeaderSmall">&quot;The worth of a museum 
		is in its use.&quot;<br>
		<i>John Cotton Dana</i></span></p>
	  <p class="normal">The usefulness of museum collections for K-12 education 
		is often most clear in curricular areas related to the humanities. For 
		the sciences, the practical application is sometimes less evident. In 
		fact, the difference actually lies in the interpretive process rather 
		than in the nature of the collection. </p>
	  <p class="normal">At The Franklin Institute Science Museum, a steam-powered 
		coining press had been on public display for years. This coining press 
		holds the distinction of being the first &quot;powered&quot; press used 
		in the United States. I had walked past it every day, noting its significance 
		in the evolution of the currency production, but never detecting a practical 
		application for classroom teachers. I had seen school groups walk past 
		and barely notice this large artifact.</p>
	  <p class=normal align="center"><img src="elinich.fig1.jpg" width="320" height="240"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption><span>Fig.1: </span>The first &quot;powered&quot; coining 
		press to be used in the United States. Thonnelier invented the press in 
		France in 1833. It was operated by steam, while earlier presses were operated 
		by hand. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Today, I have a totally different perspective on the steam-powered 
		coining press, thanks to the interpretation provided by Patricia Knox, 
		a teacher from North Canton, Ohio. When we invited Pattie to help us develop 
		an online interpretation for an artifact from the collection, Pattie immediately 
		selected the steam-powered coining press. Perplexed, I asked if she was 
		sure after all, it's not the most visually interesting device. Pattie 
		persisted, explaining that she knew exactly how the press would connect 
		with curriculum for early elementary school teachers and students. Pattie 
		capitalized on the odd appearance of the press to engage her students' 
		natural curiosity and to invite their guesses about its function. Pattie 
		then developed activities that connect the press with math, science, and 
		language arts. Basically, the press becomes the thematic centerpiece for 
		a few days of cross-curricular learning in her classroom. </p>
	  <p class=normal align="center"><img src="elinich.fig2.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Fig.2: This activity encourages inquiry about metals 
		and conductivity. http://www.fi.edu/pieces/knox/hotmoney.htm</p>
	  <p class=normal align="center"><img src="elinich.fig3.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Fig.3: This activity connects the science with language 
		arts as kids practice spelling the names of the coins. http://www.fi.edu/pieces/knox/coinspell.htm</p>
	  <p class="normal">Pattie's interpretation of the steam-powered coining press 
		has become a benchmark for our decisions about online presentation of 
		artifacts. Before our experience with Pattie, we prioritized high-profile 
		areas of the collection and focused effort on offering deep access. After 
		working with Pattie, we shifted our strategy, placing importance instead 
		on the breadth of our holdings. Pattie didn't need every coin-related 
		artifact; after the successful completion of her unit, she was ready to 
		move on to the next idea. What she and other teachers did value, though, 
		was an object for every idea. </p>
	  <p class="normal">This idea fundamentally parallels the average school visit 
		experience to our physical museum. Teachers or adult chaperones skim the 
		exhibits, selecting sometimes deliberately, often at random just a few 
		places to linger before moving on to the next exhibit. Teachers are the 
		curators both during the physical visit and, back in the classroom, while 
		using our online resources. It follows naturally to invite teacher participation 
		in the online museum interpretation process. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Of course, Pattie's interpretation is not the only possible 
		classroom application. An interesting step would be to have other teachers 
		suggest their own ideas for using the coining press in their classroom 
		activities. Unfortunately, we haven't yet found another teacher who wants 
		to work with the coining press. </p>
	  <p class="normal">We have, however, had a team of teachers &quot;adopt&quot; 
		our collection of historical timepieces, developing online educational 
		connections between the artifacts and current classroom needs. This gave 
		us the opportunity to observe multiple teachers working with the same 
		objects. Interestingly, the teachers expressed some level of concern that 
		they would be &quot;competing&quot; with one another and that they would 
		be &quot;repeating&quot; what someone else was already doing. While we 
		encouraged a collaborative solution, we also offered assurances that we 
		actually did want to see repetition because it provides multiple perspectives 
		on the same object.</p>

	  <p class=MsoCaption>Fig.4: &quot;Clocks Teaching Time&quot; is a gateway

		connect the objects with classroom use. http://www.fi.edu/qa00/attic3</p>

	  <p class=BlockQuote>&quot;Helping children at a level of genuine intellectual 
		inquiry takes imagination on the part of the adult.&quot; <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor"><i>Dorothy 
		H. Cohen</i></span></p>
	  <p class="normal">Both the Benchmarks for Science Literacy (1993) and the 
		National Science Education Standards (1996) suggest that students learn 
		both through inquiry and about inquiry. Inquiry and the National Science 
		Education Standards: A Guide for Teaching and Learning (2000), in particular, 
		encourages science educators to create environments for learning in which 
		students are prompted to wonder about some aspect of the world around 
		them, challenged to develop specific questions, and then allowed to gather 
		evidence that will help them formulate ideas and understanding. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The dynamic intersection of standards-based learning and 
		high bandwidth access to the web in classrooms provides both a challenge 
		and an opportunity for museums. Can the museum meet the challenge of providing 
		digital access to the breadth of its collection not just the most popular, 
		famous objects? If the museum can meet the challenge, though, then the 
		opportunity is vast for interpretation, education, and outreach. In fact, 
		the museum can re-establish itself as a vital community resource where 
		students learn both about someone else's scientific inquiry and also through 
		their own personal inquiry. Through imaginative use of the web, museums 
		can become present in every teacher's classroom and present in every student's 
		inquiry.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Historical science artifacts offer a rich context for 
		inquiry. Each object holds an encapsulated story of science or engineering. 
		By learning the story behind the object, students uncover the human side 
		of science. The cumulative collection of artifacts within a museum's holdings 
		represents a diverse portrait of scientific endeavor. By learning about 
		an object in a museum, students learn about inquiry. Since the museum 
		elected to receive the object, it is fairly safe to assume that the story 
		behind the object is of some significance. While teachers are essentially 
		the curators of their own classroom collections, they ultimately place 
		their trust in the museum and conclude that objects on display are worthy 
		of student inquiry.</p>
	  <p class=BlockQuote><span class="SubHeaderSmall">&quot;The world looks so 
		different after learning science.&quot; <i><br>
		Richard Feynman</i></span></p>
	  <p class="normal">Museum objects are often conceptually opaque, and, as 
		a result, the common reaction from students is &quot;what's that?&quot; 
		or &quot;what did that do?&quot; In other words, every student begins 
		to inquire when they encounter a curious object. The science museum collection, 
		therefore, is a treasure trove filled with inquiry starters exactly what 
		teachers need in today's standards-based science classroom.</p>
	  <p class="normal">An award-worthy scientist is likely to be a character 
		study of inquiry. When students learn about an individual's journey through 
		science, including the mistakes, side-steps, and breakthroughs, they learn 
		about inquiry and the real process of science.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Since 1832, The Franklin Institute has recognized over 
		two thousand individuals for their scientific achievement. Each of the 
		awardees has an associated case file. Efforts are underway to provide 
		online access to these cases as they represent a tremendous educational 
		resource. The case files contain two-dimensional documentation of the 
		nominee's worthiness including letters of recommendation, biographical 
		sketches, pictures, drawings, pamphlets, scientific articles, patent applications, 
		etc. Online access to these documents will provide teachers with the stories 
		behind the science. The connections between the museum and the curriculum 
		will be seamless. </p>
	  <p class="normal">With so many stories from which to choose, prioritization 
		becomes critical. We are involving teachers in the process, helping us 
		to determine the most useful resources. The case files call for a new 
		balance between breadth and depth of presentation. Would teachers find 
		it more useful to have a little information about a lot of scientists? 
		Or would it be more useful to have the complete story for fewer scientists? 
		A complete presentation of a case file would be an extensive exhibition, 
		thoroughly detailing the scientist and the scientific process. </p>
	  <p class=BlockQuote><span class="SubHeaderSmaller">&quot;Who dares to teach 
		must never cease to learn.&quot;<br>
		<i>John Cotton Dana</i> </span></p>
	 <p class="normal">Those of us who provide services for teachers often hear 
		that teachers are misunderstood and that outsiders don't fully understand 
		or appreciate their profession. This may or may not be true. What's more 
		certain is that teachers don't understand or appreciate the fine points 
		of museum curation and interpretation. So, when we invite teachers to 
		come behind the scenes at the museum with us it is usually quite an eye-opening 
		experience for everyone. </p>
	 <p class="normal">Once the white gloves are on, the challenge of keeping 
		the teachers &quot;on task&quot; begins. As with any educationally curious adults, 
		a visit to the museum's collections storage area becomes a &quot;candy shop&quot; 
		experience for the teachers and they are inclined to wander and gape. 
		Our strategy has been to have a focused task and an ambitious timetable. 
		For example, we may have just two hours to photograph every aspect of 
		a few objects. The teachers' tasks are always self-determined by their 
		pre-selection of objects that interest them. We always want them working 
		in areas that interest them and have relevance to their classroom practice. 
	 </p>
	 <p class="normal">The teachers understand their role to be supportive of 
		the museum staff during the digitization process, with museum staff being 
		responsible for the actual digital presentation of the object and its 
		story. </p>
	 <p class="normal">After the object encounters, we ask the teachers to &quot;take 
		the objects home&quot; with them and think about how they will use them in 
		their classrooms and to be alert to moments during the school day when 
		the objects come to mind. Subsequently, the teachers develop activities, 
		lesson plans, online interactives, and other classroom-ready resources 
		that they want to use in their own circumstance.</p>
	 <p class="normal">During this phase of resource development, the role shifts 
		and the museum staff become supportive of the presentation of the teachers' 
		educational resources.</p>
	 <p class="normal">The end result is a collaborative presentation of museum 
		piece and classroom resource. While not always aesthetically perfected, 
		the presentation is certifiably useful for education, since it results 
		from in-classroom testing and development. With the web, the museum's 
		worth is guaranteed when, as in this case, it becomes so decidedly useful.
