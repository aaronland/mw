	  <p class=PaperTitle>A Whale of a Web-site</p>
	  <p class=Author>Anne Karin Hufthammer, Natural History Museum, Bergen and 
		Joan C. Nordbotten, University of Bergen, Norway</p>
	  <p class=URL><a href="http://www.uib.no/info/general/" target="_blank">http://www.uib.no/info/general/</a></p>
	  <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>
	  <p class=AbstractText>The Natural History Museum at the University of Bergen 
		has a unique collection of 24 whale skeletons on display that is believed 
		to be the largest of its kind in the world. The museum wishes to make 
		this collection, which literally fills 2 rooms, accessible to the international 
		community through a Web exhibit. Our principle challenges include a limited 
		budget, selection of appropriate filming techniques, and content presentation 
		to a varied public that includes both researchers and school children. 
		Our goal is to provide an exhibit that can support both the in-depth and 
		broad overview interests of our anticipated users. </p>
	  <p class=AbstractText>The whale skeletons in our collection are large objects 
		&#151; up to 24m (80ft). We are therefore exploring alternatives for inclusion 
		of video presentations in the exhibit design. One option is to use an 
		overview video and develop a two-level interface in which images, video, 
		and audio clips of the whales with maps and stories are linked at the 
		surface level where we expect the general public will browse, while research 
		data that supports study of skeletal material is linked at a deeper, zoom 
		level. An alternative is to use an architectural sketch of the physical 
		exhibit as the interface and focus on development of item videos for presentation 
		of the individual skeletons of each species. </p>
	  <p class=AbstractText>In this paper, we present an evaluation of alternative 
		uses of video and zoom technology for exhibits of large-scale objects. 
		We demonstrate that adequate video quality can be within the economic 
		reach of low-budget museums.</p>
	  <p class=keywords>Keywords<b>: </b>Web-Exhibits, Web design for large-scale 
		objects, video applications, whale exhibits.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Whale exhibit </h1>
	  <p class="normal">Since the late nineteenth Century, whale skeletons have 
		been the dominant zoological objects in the exhibitions of the Natural 
		History Museum at the University of Bergen. In two halls, of more than 
		300 m<sup>2</sup> (3267 ft<sup>2</sup>), 22 complete skeletons and 2 crania, 
		representing 18 whale species are permanently exhibited. When a new exhibit 
		of the Greenland whale opens, primo 2003, the whale exhibit will contain 
		all of the North Atlantic species.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The exhibition was mounted over a period of approximately 
		30 years and was completed in the 1920s. At that time it was regarded 
		as one of Europe s best exhibitions. During most of the 20<sup>th</sup> 
		century, the Hall of the Whales was kept undisturbed and after some years 
		it got a neglected and somewhat dusty appearance. This neglect has probably, 
		in some sense, saved the collection, as a renewal would most likely have 
		resulted in a demounting of most of the skeletons. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The largest skeleton in the collection is that of a 24 
		metre (80ft) long blue whale and ten of the skeletons are more than 6 
		meters (24ft) long. The skeletons hang close together, the tails of some 
		under the head or within the ribs of another. When looking into the Hall 
		of the Whales one might get the impression of a room filled with large 
		hanging bones in which it is difficult to separate one skeleton from the 
		other.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Systematically whales can be separated in baleen and toothed 
		whales. From a pedagogical point of view, it would be an advantage if 
		the whales were exhibited according to their zoological system, i.e. the 
		toothed whales separated from the baleen whales. However, in this exhibit 
		toothed and baleen whales hang side by side, reflecting the fact that 
		literally each whale was mounted in the exhibition as it was acquired. 
		In fact it seems that the exhibition was regarded complete when the rooms 
		were packed. </p>
	  <p class="normal">A museum has obligations to the general public, including 
		small children, school children and adults as well as to the scientific 
		community of students and researchers. These groups have very different 
		requirements as to how the exhibition should be presented. A child might 
		look for huge animals, an artist for strange and beautiful structures, 
		while a scientist probably would like to look into scientific features, 
		to study morphological and systematic questions. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Scientific zoological collections are normally not on 
		public display rather they are stored and made available to scientists 
		and students only by request. However, the whale skeleton collection is 
		on display in addition to being part of the scientific collection of the 
		Zoology section at the natural history museum in Bergen. In general, small 
		to medium sized skeletons can be borrowed and are sent to research institutions 
		all over the world. However, both the display status and size of the whale 
		skeletons make it impossible (impractical) to disassemble and send a whale 
		skeleton to an interested researcher. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Today the collection is believed to be the largest of 
		its kind in the world, offering researchers, students, and the general 
		public a unique opportunity for morphological, molecular, and general 
		study of whales. The study of whales requires a high degree of international 
		cooperation, since both skeletons and live animals are relatively few 
		and spread throughout the world. This collection lies in a small city, 
		geographically far from other marine study centers and museums. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Since travel is expensive and the exchange of whale skeletons 
		is not practical, the museum is exploring possibilities of using the Internet 
		as a tool to present the collection to an international audience, support 
		research, advertise the collection and hopefully to substitute for some 
		of the current travel to the sites of the skeletons. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Design framework for the Virtual Whale Exhibit <i> 
		</i></h2>
	  <p class="normal">The basic objective for the virtual exhibit is to present 
		the historic exhibit and provide both pedagogic and research presentations 
		of the individual whales in the collection to a wide audience that includes 
		researchers, students, and the general public.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Filming the whale collection for Web presentation is a 
		challenge, due to the size of the skeletons and the physical layout of 
		the whale collection, which includes overlapping skeletons and shares 
		space with specimens of seals, fish and marine invertebrates. As shown 
		in Figure 1, only part of the exhibit and/or part the larger skeletons 
		can be captured in one image. In the center-left of this image, we see 
		the head and ribs of the 24m (80ft) blue whale, while on the right we 
		can see the ribs and fins of a 18.5m (62ft) Fin whale followed by the 
		tail of a 13.5m (45ft) Humpback whale. Therefore, some form for video 
		will be necessary for presentation of the largest skeletons.</p>

	  <p class=SubHeaderSmall>Anticipated users for a whale exhibit </p>
	  <p class="normal">We anticipate that the user groups will have overlapping, 
		but distinct usage profiles. </p>
	  <p class="normal"><i>Researchers (including university students) </i>may 
		be interested in various aspects of the physical exhibit, particularly 
		its contents, but are expected to be primarily interested in examining 
		the skeletal material and its documentation for support in their work 
		on identification and classification of their own material.</p>
	  <p class="normal"><i>Students (grades 1-12) </i>are expected to be interested 
		in general descriptive information &#151; size, speed, food, range, and 
		special characteristics of a specific (set of) species. Assuming that 
		they are working on projects, it will be necessary to give them sufficient 
		material for comparison among species.</p>
	  <p class="normal"><i>Causal or general public</i> users are expected to 
		use the site for answering specific questions that have arisen during 
		a conversion or when reading material related to whales. For example, 
		which are the longest whales (implying identification of the longest whale 
		species) or what is the population of the most numerous whale species? 
		These questions will commonly require calculation and comparison of the 
		underlying data in the system. </p>
	  <p class="normal">In addition artists, in particular sculptors and painters, 
		frequently visit the physical exhibition for inspiration. For this group, 
		the web presentation can advertise the existence of the hall and be an 
		invitation to visit.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Table 1 outlines Web-usage characteristics expected for 
		the users. One can also anticipate that the attention spans for the different 
		users will vary from hours to seconds depending on the information need. 
		General public users can be expected to have a significantly shorter attention 
		span the either the research or educational users (Nordbotten, 2000).</p>

	  <p class="normal">The central item for the whale exhibit is the skeletal 
		collection. As noted above, the physical layout of the whale collection, 
		as well as the size of the individual skeletons makes filming the collection 
		difficult. Ideally, the skeletons should be presented as 3D objects that 
		can be rotated so that various perspectives could be presented. Given 
		the current resources, the layout of the physical exhibit, and the capacity 
		of scanning equipment, this is not a viable option. Since it is not possible 
		to capture the large skeletons in a single image or construct 3D images 
		of them, some form for video representation is required.</p>
	  <p class="normal">In addition to the skeleton collection, there is a varied 
		collection of data about the species in the whale collection, including 
		video and audio clips of live animals, drawings and images, text documents, 
		as well as research data detailing both the species and the skeleton collection. 
		Table 2 presents the data to be included in the site and gives the current 
		status of its collection. The data are being stored in separate Oracle 
		9i databases to allow maximum flexibility for the site design.</p>

		to all anticipated users, than our site should provide ample supplemental 
		material for the video components.</p>
	  <p class="SubHeader">Using Video for Presentation of Large Objects</p>
	  <p class="normal">The physical size of the whale skeletons indicates that 
		some use of video presentation will be important. Video and audio material 
		of live whales is also part of the collection, in addition to more standard 
		document and image materials. The goal is to present this material in 
		such a way that most of the desired users will be able to gain maximal 
		information from the exhibit. </p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Video s place in Web exhibits</h3>
	  <p>Video is a relatively new element in Web exhibits, not least because 
		it can be expensive to produce and requires that users have high-end equipment 
		for good viewing. Currently, video has been used mainly for virtual tours 
		of the physical museum and/or special exhibits. We can identify 3 different 
		video types that can be employed in an exhibit:</p>
	  <p>1. The <i>overview video</i>, or film, can be used as an introduction 
		to the physical museum. These videos frequently provide a rotational view 
		of a room that can be stopped at an interesting item and the zoomed to 
		get a closer / enlarged image of the object. Links can be inserted to 
		support passage to another room (another video sequence) with the same 
		rotational presentation. Links can also be added to switch to a more detailed 
		presentation of the selected item. The trade offs here are between download 
		time and zoomed image quality. Good quality zoomed images require high-density 
		images.</p>
	  <p>Examples of uses of overview videos can be found at:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>The natural history museum in Maastricht at <a href="http://www.nhmmaastricht.nl/" target="_blank">http://www.nhmmaastricht.nl/</a> exhibits /virtual tours.</li>

		  (outside).</li>
		<li>The Hermitage Museum at http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/ virtual tours.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p>2.<i> Topic videos</i>, including animation, can be used to tell a 
		  story. Typically, the viewer can view the video and interact with it, 
		  but cannot query for information outside of its scope, for example from 
		  the underlying museum collections. Exhibit videos of this type have 
		  been used for:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class=Section1>The Sport of Life and Death: The Mesoamerican Ballgame 
			at <a href="http://www.ballgame.org/" target="_blank">www.ballgame.org/</a> 
		  </div>
		</li>
		<li>Voices of the Colorado Plateau at <a href="http://archive.li.suu.edu/voices/" target="_blank">http://archive.li.suu.edu/voices/</a> 
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>3. <i>Item videos</i> can be used as exhibit items to show detail in 
		a stationary or motion item such as a statue or dance respectively. These 
		videos can be linked to the overview video, or collected as exhibit items. 
		Examples can be found in the video collection in the Bhutan &#151; Fortress 
		of the Gods at www.bhutan.at / the objects / Vienna exhibition / Video. 
		Here video objects are presented as a collage. </p>
	  <p>The video type chosen for an exhibit needs to match the anticipated use 
		of the exhibit. Table 4 presents a mapping between video types and the 
		users information requirements shown in Table 1 above.</p>

	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Using video for the exhibit overview</h2>
	  <p>Given the size of the whale skeletons, it is tempting to consider use 
		of an overview video for the exhibit map. Since one implementation of 
		zoomed images is actually a switch to another image at greater detail, 
		links can be hooked at various image depths, thus providing support for 
		both broad and deep interest levels in the user population.</p>
	  <p>Our initial video set was made by professional photographers who used 
		360 rotational (VR) filming techniques. Five films were required to capture 
		the whale collection within the context of the exhibit hall. An informal 
		evaluation of four quality levels &#151; pixel density &#151; for one 
		of these videos is given in Table 5 below. The videos show the Humpback 
		and Sei Whales on the left and right respectively. The recorded down-load 
		times are reported for comparison only. They were recorded between 18-18:30 
		on a high-end machine connected to the Internet using a 2000k broadband 
		connection. All of videos can be viewed using QuickTime<sup>TM</sup>. 
		The 1<sup>st</sup> 3 have QT zoom technology implemented, while the 4<sup>th</sup> 
		requires the Zoomify<sup>TM</sup> technology (<a href="http://www.zoomify.com/" target="_blank">http://www.zoomify.com</a>). 
		Unfortunately, the Zoomify video was incomplete at the time of this writing.</p>

	  <p class=normal>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p class=normal>The videos give a &#145;true&#146; representation of the 
		physical exhibit and the zoom function can be used to help isolate individual 
		skeletons for study. However, multiple videos are required to capture 
		the whale collection and the presentation maintains the visual &#145;chaos&#146; 
		of the overlapping skeletons, while also capturing the other specimens 
		on display in the rooms. The fixed camera position used gives a single 
		angle perspective of each object in the room distorting both the room 
		and the proportions of the large skeletons.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Production costs for rotational video are high in both time 
		and money, since this presentation approach requires advanced technical 
		skills and equipment when the rooms are literally full of the exhibit 
		items. This results in less flexibility for adaptation to changes in the 
		exhibits. Finally, for good visual quality, the user must have high-end 
		technical presentation equipment, which limits the potential audience.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Given these negatives, we have found that rotational video 
		does not give a satisfactory or economically accessible overview of our 
		exhibit.</p>
	  <p class=SubHeaderSmall>Using video for individual skeletal presentation</p>
	  <p class=normal>Another use of video for presentation of individual skeletons 
		is to develop a set of item videos, as defined above, for each species. 
		There are several options, a video along the length of the skeleton &#150; 
		a track video &#150; or some form for 3D imaging. A track video preserves 
		the proportions of the skeleton and can give a visual experience of the 
		length of the large animals, which we believe will be an effective way 
		to present the large scale of the skeletons.</p>
	  <p class=normal>We have experimented with use of a high-quality, though 
		generally available, digital camera with &#147;movie&#148; functionality. 
		Our Nikon Coolpix 4500 digital camera, is an unsophisticated model that 
		probably most museums can afford as standard equipment. The movie function 
		of this camera takes 15 high resolution, 320x240 pixel, images per second, 
		in QVGA format that is compatible with most video presentation systems 
		such as Quick TimeTM. The film (video) is comparable to animated films 
		and is sufficient for filming inanimate objects. A 20 second track video 
		is adequate for presentation of the 14m (45ft) humpback whale skeleton. 
	  </p>
	  <p class=normal>The principle advantage of this approach is the quick and 
		inexpensive production of each item video. Museum staff should be fully 
		capable of producing good quality videos using the fairly standard technical 
		equipment, thus eliminating expensive contracts to professional photographers 
		and the necessity of using advanced technical equipment. Production of 
		the item videos is time efficient, requiring only a few minutes for filming 
		to Web presentation. </p>
	  <p class=normal>A problem with filming museum specimens is the bleaching 
		caused by using flood lighting. We have experienced that, for our camera, 
		the shooting of single images without a tripod demanded extra lighting 
		while fairly good video sequences can be produced in normal daylight or 
		with only a little extra light.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The principle problem we experienced was that the small, 
		9.5*7cm (3 _ * 2 _ inch), images blurred at double presentation size and 
		thus do not support the zoom quality required for researchers.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Using a collage for skeletal presentation</h2>
	  <p>Smaller scale skeletons, less than 5m (17ft), that have free space around 
		them can be captured in a single image and thus do not require video representation. 
		However, photographing these single images (with our camera) required 
		both a tripod and delayed shutter function or a lot of extra light. A 
		less laborious technique, that will give single images of similar quality 
		as the video, is to use the Ultra High Speed functionality of the Nikon 
		camera. This function takes up to seventy 320 240 pixel images in video 
		quality in approximately 2 seconds. The demand for light for this function 
		is approximately the same as for video with the same camera. </p>
	  <p>Only a very small wide-angle lens can be used with the Ultra HS functionality 
		of this camera. Therefore images must be taken at quite a long distance 
		in order to capture the whole whale skeleton in one image. For example, 
		a distance of 6.5m (22ft) was needed to capture the complete skeleton 
		of the 5m (17ft) killer whale and 4.7m (16ft) was needed for the 4.4m 
		(15ft) beluga (numbers 19 and 21 in Figure 4). The killer whale is in 
		fact the largest skeleton that can be pictured in one image with this 
		camera. </p>
	  <p>The Ultra HS technique is intended for filming objects in motion. If 
		we move the camera instead, we can produce up to 70 rather good quality 
		and slightly different single images. For comparison with the videos listed 
		in Table 5, </p>
	  <p class="normal">Figure 2 shows the first and the two last images of a 
		69 image Ultra HS sequence of the head of the humpback whale. The quality 
		and variation of these images can make them useful for both researchers 
		and students in an initial study of the skeletons. </p>
	  <p align="center"><img src="nordbotten.fig2.jpg" width="363" height="274" /></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 2: Humpback head collage</p>
	  <p class=normal>Unfortunately, the Ultra HS images are not good enough for 
		advanced morphological investigations. For that kind of study probably 
		only single images with good zoom quality will be adequate. Nor do we 
		find the HS technique suitable for the general public who will probably 
		find an assembly of 70 very similar images uninteresting or even irritating. 
		However, elements of the series have adequate quality for single image 
		presentation.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">An initial architecture for the Whale exhibit</h1>
	  <p>As any exhibit, the Whale exhibit can be thought of as having three parts: 
		an introductory page presenting the source and intention of the exhibit, 
		an overview map of the whale collection that supports selection of the 
		information about the various species, and a set of species presentation 
		pages. Our current work has been focused on determining the best, in quality 
		and accessible cost, use of video for presentation of the large skeletons 
		in our physical exhibit.</p>
	  <p>When choosing video presentations, a trade-off is required between video 
		quality and the resources required to attain it. As noted above, it has 
		proved both difficult and expensive to capture the Whale Hall of the Natural 
		History Museum in a rotational video, since the physical exhibit has so 
		many large and overlapping specimens. We have also experienced that acceptable 
		quality videos of the individual skeletons can be made quickly by the 
		museum curator using a relatively inexpensive digital camera with film/video 
		functions. Though zoom functionality is not ideal with this option due 
		to the low pixel density of the images.</p>
	  <p>Therefore our initial plan to present the collection using rotational 
		video has been abandoned. Instead, we have chosen a more conventional 
		exhibit design, based on a site-map which presents the Whale Hall as an 
		architectural sketch. Item videos will be used to present both skeletal 
		and live images of the individual whale species.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Exhibit design</h2>
	  <p>Our current exhibit design, shown in Figure 3, is a standard multiple 
		story architecture. Standard html technology will be used to connect images, 
		video and audio clips of live whales, maps and stories for each whale 
		species to the exhibit map shown in Figure 4 below. This fan architecture 
		has been shown to fit well with general usage of web exhibits (Nordbotten, 
		2000). Users with basic technology will be able to view the image and 
		text based content illustrated on the left side of the design figure, 
		while users with more advanced technology will be able to view all parts 
		of the exhibit.</p>
	  <p align="center"><img src="nordbotten.fig3.jpg" width="368" height="237" /></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 3: Exhibit design</p>
	  <p class=normal>Each species story will be presented with either one or 
		more track item videos of its skeleton(s) or an image from the ultra HS 
		sequence for the 10 small skeletons with free access (#13-20 in figure 
		4 and the appendix). Collages constructed from a HS sequence of the skeletons 
		will also be included to support research use. The track videos will have 
		a presentation time proportional to the length of the whale to help communicate 
		the size aspect of the animal. </p>
	  <p class="normal">In addition to zoom functions, introductory images will 
		have embedded links supporting more detailed presentations and queries 
		to the research databases. As specified in Table 4, we also need an advanced 
		query facility that can support comparative and calculation searches in 
		both the text and image material in both the prepared story pages as well 
		as in the underlying databases. There will also be information inserted 
		to the researcher about how s/he can request that specific new video-clips 
		be posted to the web-site. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">An architectural sketch for the exhibit map</h2>
	  <p class="normal">The architectural sketch of the Whale Hall, shown in Figure 
		4, has been chosen for the exhibit map. In this sketch, the gray tones 
		identify the two major categories of whales: light gray &#151; baleen 
		whales, dark gray &#151; toothed whales. The number key identification 
		is given in the appendix.</p>

	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 4: Sketch of the Whale exhibit</p>
	  <p class="normal">Each whale functions as a link to its species story. Using 
		the html pass-over function, the whale s name and skeletal length will 
		be given as an aid to location of the desired species story. The exhibit 
		map page also includes a set of links to frequently asked questions as 
		well as an invitation to enter a question to the system. In a future version 
		of the exhibit, calculation queries, such as which are the largest whale 
		species, will be supported.</p>

		video as the exhibit map for this exhibit gives a number of advantages. 
		Visually, the sketch provides an easily interpreted overview of the physical 
		exhibit, showing both the category and relative sizes of the whale species. 
		Navigation is intuitive and simple as standard Web structures/links are 
		used. Standard side bar navigation will support quick return to the exhibit 
		map reducing the lost in space feeling of the viewer. Finally, the gray-tone 
		sketch can be represented as a small file, supporting quick download and 
		presentation times.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Project status</h1>
	  <p class="normal">We are currently developing a set of track videos for 
		the skeletons in the collection that are<i> </i>timed so that video length 
		is proportional to the length of the skeleton and have begun to explore 
		further the opportunities supported by different video techniques for 
		presentation of the large objects. In parallel, we are adding research 
		data, images, and text and video stories to the underlying databases and 
		exploring alternative Web presentations. A demonstration of the exhibit 
		will be available by mid-March 2003 at <a href="http://nordbotten.ifi.uib.no/VirtualMuseum/WhaleExhibit/demo.htm" target="_blank">http://nordbotten.ifi.uib.no/VirtualMuseum/WhaleExhibit/demo.htm</a>.

	  <p class=small>The Whale exhibit is an application of some of the techniques 
		being developed in a joint research project with Bergen Museum, Virtual 
		Exhibits on Demand . The project, presented at <a href="http://nordbotten.ifi.uib.no/VirtualMuseum/VMwebSite/VEDweb-site.htm" target="_blank">http://nordbotten.ifi.uib.no/VirtualMuseum/VMwebSite/VEDweb-site.htm</a>, 
		is funded by a grant from the Norwegian Research Council. Nine students 
		and several researchers and museum staff are or have been working on aspects 
		of this project and have contributed to the ideas presented in this paper.
