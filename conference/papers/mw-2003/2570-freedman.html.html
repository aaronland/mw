		<p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>
		<p class=AbstractText>The Web's use in general promotion, showcasing permanent

		<h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
		<p class="normal">The Web's use in general promotion, showcasing permanent 
		  and temporary exhibits, and providing access to catalogs of material 
		  <span class="normal">i</span>s well documented. Less obvious is the 
		  power of the Web to show permanent exhibits in a new light. While engaging 
		  museum-goers with the permanent collection is always important, this 
		  capacity is perhaps even more valuable to museums in a time of reduced 
		  budgets for temporary exhibits. The development of provocative online 
		  exhibits can create compelling narratives by juxtaposing objects from 
		  the permanent collection that are not usually seen together. Curators 
		  and Web developers can work together to recontextualize objects and 
		  help audiences see them and experience them differently. In addition, 
		  multiple stories can be told within the online exhibit built from the 
		  permanent collection, leveraging existing material housed as digital 
		  assets. This approach not only creates new learning opportunities for 
		  visitors, but also represents a way to recoup prior investment in digital 
		  assets management. It is also a way to build patron knowledge and support 
		  of the broader collections of a museum. </p>
		<p class="normal">For example, a history museum that exhibits various 
		  items of clothing from different periods in various places throughout 
		  the museum can create a Web-based exhibit that showcases changes in 
		  fashion over time. This exhibition, while virtual, can also directly 
		  connect to offline artifacts by providing users with a map of the museum 
		  to let them see the various objects from the collection in varying contexts. 
		  The visitor gains a new understanding of the collection, and has a reason 
		  to return to the museum to see and explore through additional items 
		  and narrative themes.  </p>
		<p><span class="normal">In this paper, we will first describe theoretical 
		  underpinnings for creating combined online/offline exhibits based on 
		  the permanent collection, and then provide high-level practical guidance 
		  for implementing such an application. Throughout the paper, we will 
		  provide case examples of completed projects and works in progress for 
		  nationally known museums.</span> </p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Theoretical Underpinnings</h1>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Visitors As Self-Directed Learners In The Museum 
		  Experience</h2>
		<p class="normal">Today, museums are understood to be places where visitors 
		  seek and engage in a transformative learning process (Lord and Lord, 
		  2001). This self-directed learning is sometimes called "free choice 
		  learning" (Falk and Dierking, 2000; Institute for Learning Innovation, 
		  2003). What visitors learn is influenced by the context created by the 
		  exhibit and the artifacts themselves, and also by the interests and 
		  ideas each visitor brings to the process. As the relationship of museum/audience 
		  has evolved, the avenues and opportunities for a museum to serve as 
		  an educational force have also expanded. Many museum educators have 
		  adopted a focus that "prioritizes the experience and learning needs 
		  of the learner" (Hooper-Greenhill, 2000: 3). The result is the creation 
		  of formal and informal learning experiences that are more personally 
		  meaningful and relevant to museum visitors.</p>
		<p class="normal">Online and interactive exhibits naturally feed into 
		  this philosophy, especially if crafted to have dynamic interfaces and 
		  user-driven choices. With guidance from the curatorial staff and design 
		  team, an online exhibit can support multiple contexts and can guide 
		  users to discover more individualized, personal meanings from previously 
		  static permanent collection holdings.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Contextual Learning Enhances Understanding 
		  Of Objects And Their Complexity </h2>
		<p class="normal">Current thinking in the study of material culture provides 
		  additional support for this approach, as individual objects are thought 
		  to have multiple meanings. Individual objects have shifting and ambiguous 
		  meanings; their significance is open to interpretation by the viewer 
		  and is highly sensitive to context (Hooper-Greenhill, 2000; Pearce, 
		  1994; Gilbert and Stockmayer, 2001). The "contextual learning" that 
		  occurs in a museum, as described by Falk and Dierking (2000), combines 
		  a viewer's personal context, physical context, and sociocultural context 
		  over time. The time element is very important to a museum and to an 
		  online exhibit because it can support and explain how repeat visits 
		  or experiences can enhance viewer understanding.</p>
		<p class="normal">Besides the obvious complexity surrounding an object 
		  (a china plate can at once be a functional item and a thing of beauty), 
		  the significance of an object is open to both individual and/or curator 
		  interpretation as well as the context in which it is presented. For 
		  instance, the plate may have sentimental value because it is "like Grandma's", 
		  or it may be displayed in a sociopolitical light if it is part of a 
		  Great Depression-era collection, or it may depict an Art-Deco pattern 
		  representative of its age (Pearce, 1994). In a static display, it can 
		  be difficult to present the visitor with all the relevant connections 
		  that a single item embodies.</p>
		<p><span class="normal">With curatorial aide, objects in museums can become 
		  visual narratives that guide the viewer through a storyline. In theory, 
		  the more flexible these narratives are, the more meaningful they can 
		  be to each individual visitor. While it may be foolhardy to try to serve 
		  an individually crafted story to each patron, the ability to create 
		  multiple storylines and to support the multiple meanings around objects 
		  is a powerful concept. The possibility for using combined online and 
		  offline exhibits/stories can both foster education and create excitement 
		  for the museum visitor. </span> </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">Online Exhibits: Making Connections Real</h2>
		<p class="normal">In the effort to make context and complexity of permanent 
		  collections more accessible and dynamic, online exhibits can be part 
		  of the solution. If the exhibit is crafted thoughtfully and with flexible 
		  information architecture, then many multiple meanings can be catalogued 
		  and accessed for the viewer. In addition, objects can be connected with 
		  other objects to create stories. The common traits and themes among 
		  items can be shown, tapping into the complexity of individual items 
		  and their interconnectedness to others. </p>
		<p class="normal">To date solutions rely on the translation of the real 
		  museum environment into the virtual world. The web, however, is different&#151;relational, 
		  freeform, multi-dimensional offering ways to enliven users about museum 
		  objects through the creation of serendipitous thematic possibilities. 
		  (Cameron, 2001:310)</p>
		<p class="normal">The threat of information overload, though, is a real 
		  one. Insightful curation and good interface design are critical to creating 
		  an effective offline/online exhibit. The museum curator's role as editor 
		  and filter of its own museum holding and institutional knowledge is 
		  as critical as ever. Structured narratives, even simple ones, are needed 
		  to guide users to get the most out of a searchable browse interface 
		  and thematic online exhibits. Good information design can create user 
		  interfaces that balance the amount of information available with the 
		  best way to display the multiple choice and threads.</p>
		<p class="normal">While often seen as separate skills or software packages, 
		  recent advances have fueled increased cross-over between collection 
		  management systems and interactive multimedia exhibition packages (Besser, 
		  1997; Cameron, 2001; Dyson and Moran, 2000). Examples of this, which 
		  Cameron calls second generation and future generation online museum 
		  collections, can be seen in the exciting projects hosted by the world's 
		  major museums. Examples include The Smithsonian Institute's online projects, 
		  such as History Wired (<a href="http://www.historywired.si.edu/" target="_blank">www.historywired.si.edu</a>); 
		  The Metropolitan Museum of Art (<a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/" target="_blank">www.metmuseum.org</a>), 
		  and The HyperMuseum Collaboration of European Union Museums (<a href="http://www.hypermuseum.org/" target="_blank">www.hypermuseum.org</a>). 
		  The promise of this concept, though, has yet to be extended to the hundreds 
		  of other smaller museum, science, and history center collections. </p>
		<p class="normal">Nimble creation of context and narrative surrounding 
		  individual items can be crafted combining interactive interface design 
		  and collections management. Software applications such as Thinkmap&reg; have 
		  made it possible to combine compelling narratives with robust, dynamic, 
		  database-driven collections systems (Andolsek and Freedman, 2001; Cameron, 
		  2001). The Experience Music Project Digital Collection (<a
href="http://www.emplive.com/digitalcollection/index.asp" target="_blank">www.emplive.com/digitalcollection/index.asp</a>) 
		  and the Smithsonian Institute's "Revealing Things" Exhibit (<a href="http://www.si.edu/revealingthings/" target="_blank">www.si.edu/revealingthings/</a>) 
		  both use Thinkmap to provide a dynamic interface in which context and 
		  narrative can be changed by the user. A visitor can search and browse 
		  these collections guided by connections among themes, objects and ideas 
		  that are integral to the museum's holdings. </p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Exploring Narrative in Offline and Online Exhibitions</h1>
		<p class="normal">Many museums have both elaborate permanent or semi-permanent 
		  exhibitions along with a rich collection of material that is not available 
		  to be shown to the general public. Permanent exhibitions typically will 
		  either showcase the most important artworks in a museum, or in the case 
		  of a history or science museum, provide a series of objects that together 
		  tell a meaningful story. These exhibits are often developed at great 
		  cost and become singular defining experiences for museum-goers. Although 
		  new objects may be added to the shows, the exhibitions often stand virtually 
		  unchanged for many years. We will briefly examine several aspects of 
		  the physical museum exhibits to discuss ways in which online exhibitions 
		  can enhance a visitor's experience of both the Web site and the physical 
		  museum.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Museums' Physical Exhibits are Structured to 
		  Relate a Narrative</h2>
		<p class="normal">Typical permanent collections are designed to tell a 
		  story through bringing a visitor in close proximity to a number of objects 
		  that are related in various ways (frequently chronologically or by geographical 
		  proximity). The manner in which a visitor walks through the exhibit 
		  determines the pace and structure of the story. Visitor may follow their 
		  interests examining objects that draw the eye, or may move from one 
		  item to the next, in order, examining each one. Good physical museum 
		  design allows museum-goers to gain insight from either path. </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Juxtaposition of Objects Tells a Story</h2>
		<p class="normal">A museum designer will typically place objects next 
		  to each other to create a narrative. For example, in an exhibit on the 
		  Civil War, a visitor may see uniforms from both the Union and the Confederate 
		  army side by side. The juxtaposition of the more formal Union garb with 
		  the clothing of a Confederate army solider immediately gives insight 
		  into what is a fairly profound concept about the Civil War. From the 
		  juxtaposition of just two items, a user learns about the manufacturing 
		  capacity, wealth, and organizational distinctions between the two sides. 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">Obviously, in comparison to the Web, items in a physical 
		  collection are static. Once the curator has placed an object in proximity 
		  with another object, it will remain in one place. To go back to our 
		  Civil War example, the two uniforms can be used to tell the story of 
		  the distinctions between the two opposing forces during the Civil War, 
		  but would have to be taken out of the permanent collection to be used 
		  for a new exhibit on the History of Warfare.  </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">Online Interfaces to Collections Management</h2>
		<p class="normal">Web designers have taken a number of approaches to showcasing 
		  permanent exhibitions online. Typically, museum Web sites either showcase 
		  already existing exhibits or enable unrestrained exploration through 
		  the museum collection. For special exhibitions, major museums sometimes 
		  produce full interactive online features, such as the Metropolitan Museum 
		  of Art's, <i>In the Footsteps of Marco Polo</i> (<a
href="http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Marco/index.html" target="_blank">www.metmuseum.org/explore/Marco/index.html</a>). 
		  We will discuss these common approaches and suggest two new ways to 
		  interface permanent collections online: the multiple narrative approach 
		  and ongoing online storylines or narrative capsules.  </p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Ongoing Highlights</h3>
		<p class="normal">The first approach is to create a few pages that market 
		  either a special exhibition or a featured artist/artifact that encourages 
		  Web site visitors to visit the museum. Most museum Web sites have some 
		  form of ongoing highlights that are accessible from the home page, although 
		  some museums provide more material and background activities related 
		  to the featured items than do others. The Metropolitan Museum of Art 
		  in New York features a new item daily (<a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/" target="_blank">www.metmuseum.org</a>), 
		  while the Brooklyn Museum of Art (www.brooklynart.org) and many others 
		  simply list the ongoing, past and upcoming exhibitions. This type of 
		  presentation has two primary advantages. Most museums already have marketing 
		  material that describes exhibits. This marketing material can be repurposed 
		  for the Web without a tremendous amount of effort. Because only a subset 
		  of the collection is actually displayed, the effort involved in securing 
		  licenses for online promotion is significantly reduced.</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Full Searchable/Browseable Catalog</h3>
		<p class="normal">The second approach allows visitors to the Web site 
		  to look at all of the items in a permanent exhibition, perhaps through 
		  stepping through a well designed exhibition or through a search interface 
		  to a collections management tool. Though it is costly and time-consuming, 
		  many major museums have invested in putting access to their collections 
		  online. This approach also has a number of advantages. A visitor has 
		  access to many or all of the items in a collection, and can explore 
		  by following his or her interests. A fully searchable catalogue is especially 
		  useful to researchers and archivists. Since the collection is nearly 
		  complete, scholars can find information and images without the necessity 
		  of traveling.</p>
		<p class="normal">Some museums have created guided tours online through 
		  a themed subset of their digital collections. There is a wide range 
		  of complexity in these online, curated tours. The Getty (www.getty.edu/art/collections/), 
		  for instance, takes a relatively simple approach, allowing viewers to 
		  search the collection by several themes, including animals, people, 
		  and culture. Yet these broad themes are not always effective search 
		  tools. The themed search for a specific animal may yields over 100 items, 
		  many of which do not clearly display an animal. (The animal may be hidden 
		  in the pattern of a dish, for example.) Rather than enhance the viewer's 
		  experience, this type of interface may prove frustrating. At the other 
		  end of the range, The Metropolitan Museum of Art presents an ambitious 
		  and elaborate Timeline of Art History (<a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/" target="_blank">www.metmuseum.org/toah/</a>) 
		  which gives narrative structure and browse capability among many of 
		  the items in the collection.  The Met exhibit is stunning, but it represents 
		  a very expensive and time-consuming endeavor. It would be impractical 
		  for a smaller museum to undertake such a project. </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">The Multiple Narrative Approach</h2>
		<p class="normal">There is a middle ground between these approaches, one 
		  that can create a more satisfying experience for museum patrons and 
		  curators.</p>
		<p class="normal">At Plumb Design, we have often taken another approach: 
		  to create an exhibit that can be browsed in multiple ways by users. 
		  In other words, we structure the online experience to support many individualized 
		  stories, or multiple narratives. By using Thinkmap and other techniques, 
		  we let Web site visitors explore themes and personal interests that 
		  are evoked by objects. These themes determine the objects that are juxtaposed, 
		  and through the information architecture and taxonomy, a myriad of different 
		  paths through an exhibit is possible. </p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Thinkmap Allows for Browsing Approach to Large 
		  Collections</h3>
		<p class="normal">There are a number of advantages to a Thinkmap approach 
		  to online exhibition. Thinkmap provides a relational structure through 
		  which large amounts of data, or museum objects, can be searched and 
		  browsed. New items can be added without a requirement to redesign an 
		  exhibition. New exhibits can be designed simply through emphasizing 
		  different taxonomy facets or themes. </p>
		<p class="normal">In addition to regular search and Thinkmap-based browsing, 
		  there are opportunities for guided search and additional curation. In 
		  the EMP Digital Collection, for instance, a viewer can use the "Gallery 
		  Views" option while visiting the museum to find the physical location 
		  of similar objects. Or the "EMP Suggests" feature provides expert advice 
		  and guidance to jump-start or re-engage visitors in themes and ideas 
		  they may not have come up with on their own. Allowing considerable flexibility, 
		  the EMP Suggests feature can be tied in with local regional events or 
		  current happenings in music, such as the Grammy Awards.  </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">The Ongoing Online Exhibition:  Navigating 
		  The Collection One Story At A Time</h2>
		<p class="normal">One of the exciting characteristics of Thinkmap is that 
		  it can create a wealth of interesting narratives at will. Hundreds of 
		  potential storylines can be explored and tracked in depth, with immediate 
		  results. The connections and narratives are not random, but determined 
		  by the wealth of information in the collection and in the taxonomy of 
		  the items. </p>
		<p class="normal">Another approach, which can achieve the same goals, 
		  is to tease out individual narratives that can be followed one at a 
		  time. On a regular basis (monthly, semi-monthly), a museum can publish 
		  new online exhibitions that are designed to provide additional insight 
		  into permanent collections</p>
		<p class="normal">Working in partnership with the Atlanta History Center, 
		  Plumb Design is currently using this methodology and technology to create 
		  ongoing narrative exhibitions online.  With the system, Atlanta History 
		  Center curators and other experts can create narrative pathways through 
		  the permanent collection material and present the storylines online 
		  as regular features. A more journalistic approach to the material than 
		  typical exhibits, the online narratives will encompass a gradual release 
		  of relevant themes on a timely basis. It is Thinkmap-type exploration 
		  in slow motion. (A status report on the Atlanta History Center project 
		  will be presented at the March 2003 conference.)</p>
		<p class="normal">Plumb Design specializes in creating easy-to-use administration 
		  tools and graphical displays that can transform digital assets into 
		  effective online experiences. These interfaces make it possible for 
		  a curator to browse the collection, create a meaningful narrative from 
		  items in it, and make publication-ready the online material in a systematic 
		  and timely way. </p>
		<p class="normal">An effective online exhibit can be built if a museum 
		  has only three key elements: </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class=listwithnumbers> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a good understanding 
		of the collection, </div>
	  <div class=listwithnumbers> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a way of generating 
		extremely high-quality digital images, and </div>
	  <div class=listwithnumbers> 
		<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a good story to engage visitors. </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class=Section1>
<p class="normal">Every museum has at least one curator or librarian with 
		  vast knowledge of the collection. Digital images, fueled by advances 
		  in digital photography, are becoming more affordable. Connecting these 
		  in-house assets with a good narrative is the first step in creating 
		  the capacity for multiple narratives to entice and engage museum visitors.  
		</p>
		<p class="normal">These ongoing online exhibits are different from traditional 
		  exhibitions precisely because of their impermanence. Museums can offer 
		  their online visitors provocative juxtapositions of objects and can 
		  encourage the type of creative experimentation that might not be possible 
		  in a high-stakes and expensive permanent exhibition. We encourage our 
		  customers to look for themes that are topical and incite debate. </p>
		<p class="normal">It is important to note that these online exhibits are 
		  meant to be used in conjunction with a visit to the actual museum. Visitors 
		  are provided with maps that highlight where discussed items are located. 
		  Guests planning a visit to a museum can print out a provocative, narrative 
		  based guide to objects that are displayed, and revisit their favorite 
		  permanent exhibits in a new light. </p>
		<p class="normal">In addition, these exhibits can bring to the fore items 
		  that are not on display in the museum, but that are in the Museum's 
		  collection. Kiosks in the museum can also be used to generate personalized 
		  maps or to provide a way for patrons to see relevant collection items 
		  not on display. Learning Guides can be generated so that patrons can 
		  study in-depth stories behind a theme, a particular item, or an aspect 
		  of an exhibit that it not fully explored in the physical display.</p>
		<p class="normal">As current events change, these ongoing exhibits can 
		  be extremely topical. Artifacts that are relevant to a specific current 
		  event can be brought into an online exhibit in a way not possible for 
		  a physical exhibit. An online exhibit at the Atlanta History Center 
		  might compare the life of a soldier in several different periods, including 
		  present-day stories, such as stories from local National Reservists 
		  who have been called to duty. Some of the material may be located in 
		  the permanent exhibit on the Civil War, some in the exhibit on the History 
		  of Atlanta, and some in the museum collection storage. </p>
		<p class="normal">Unlike the constraints of a costly physical exhibit, 
		  these online features allow more experimentation. A particular storyline 
		  can be an opportunity to take risks with the material and to try unusual 
		  juxtapositions and stories related to artifacts. The choice of narrative 
		  themes can also be shaped by patron interaction. Popular online narratives 
		  can spark new stories, and give curators an idea about the level of 
		  community interest in a particular subject.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Practical Issues</h1>
		<p class="normal">Plumb Design works with our customers to develop a workflow 
		  for implementing these online exhibits, which are analogous to publications 
		  or newsletters. In addition, we provide a technology and design for 
		  the ongoing delivery of such exhibitions. We feel that there are a number 
		  of essential elements in any such system to ensure that it is used and 
		  maintained.</p>
		<p class="normal">In order to achieve effective online/offline strategy 
		  based on the permanent collection you need:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets>  
			On-going commitment from the museum</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets>  
			A system for developing online exhibits</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets>  
			A good story: multiple narratives and learner-directed experiences 
			must be a valued part of the museum's mission</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Commitment from the Museum</h2>
		<p class="normal">For such a system to work, the museum must make a commitment 
		  in staffing to support the ongoing need for content and creativity. 
		  Typically, for online exhibitions we advise clients to pick a schedule 
		  and scope that is achievable and that leads to success. Typically we 
		  recommend one person to own the process and to work with curators from 
		  different departments to assign" upcoming editions". The creation of 
		  multiple narratives requires sustained commitment to develop stories 
		  and online modules over time.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">A system for developing online exhibits</h2>
		<p class="normal">From a technical perspective, we design a system for 
		  publishing, archiving, and searching these exhibits. The system includes 
		  an administration tool that can be used by writers and editors to test-drive 
		  exhibitions before publication. The exhibits are stored in a database 
		  where they can be accessed, even after the actual Web site has been 
		  taken down. </p>
		<p class="normal">The actual system requirements are not large. The digital 
		  collection can evolve and grow with each new online exhibit; a full 
		  classification system and catalog of every collection item is not necessary 
		  prior to beginning an online exhibit. It is helpful, obviously, for 
		  curators to bring their own personal knowledge of the collection to 
		  bear on the effort. Curators can choose themes and stories that well 
		  match both the holdings of the permanent collection and the needs and 
		  interests of museum patrons. </p>
		<p class="normal">There are also some advantages in utilizing the power 
		  of collections management tools such as Willoughby and Gallery Systems. 
		  By integrating these tools, curators and editors can quickly draw imagery 
		  and information from the museum's collection management system to be 
		  used online. This can improve data integrity and save time in the publication 
		  process.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">A good story</h2>
		<p class="normal">The value of the narrative itself cannot be underestimated. 
		  A good story matters. In order to attract and create interest, the museum 
		  Web site must have compelling content, both stories and artifacts. Curators 
		  and other experts must make the editorial choices and create the stories 
		  that will both interweave the artifacts and connect to the community. 
		  A commitment to the value of multiple narratives and learner-directed 
		  experiences ideally will be part of the broader mission of the museum. 
		  "Contextualizing objects according to ideas rather than physical or 
		  functional taxonomies...represents a significant paradigm shift." (Cameron, 
		  2001) </p>
		<p class="normal">As Cameron and others have noted, this is new and potentially 
		  challenging area for museums. It is also a fruitful and exciting way 
		  for museums to build membership and patron loyalty. As the museum supports 
		  this new relationship between patrons and the permanent collection, 
		  curators can balance the "visceral thrill" of being with objects with 
		  more in-depth information that is housed in the collections system. 
		  Online narratives can allow for broader interpretationsand deeper understandingsof 
		  the collection, within the constraints of today's budgeting.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusion: Online/Offline Exhibits as an Exciting, 
		  Cost-Effective Model </h1>
		<p class="normal">As online exhibits and digital collections management 
		  have evolved, so can their curatorial power. The significant investment 
		  made by museums in these systems can be recouped as they support the 
		  generation of cost-effective exhibits. New thematic ideas, current events, 
		  and individual visitor interests can all be more readily tapped and 
		  developed into combined online/offline experiences. Flexible, relatively 
		  quick new programs and exhibits can generate visitor interest and patron 
		  loyalty to the permanent collection, even in times of downsized exhibit 
		  budgets.</p>
		<p class="normal">"[There is] No substitute for looking....the demand for 
		  the original work will increase rather than decrease, following repeated 
		  exposure at an institutionally authorized site on the World Wide Web." 
		  (Jones-Garmil, 1997: 19)</p>
		<p class="normal">Museums are in the position to use the World Wide Web 
		  not only as a traditional marketing tool but also to build loyalty, 
		  to generate interest, and to deepen the learning experiences of patrons. 
		  An effective interface to the permanent collection can fuel multiple 
		  repeat visits to a museum over the years, both on- and offline. </p>
