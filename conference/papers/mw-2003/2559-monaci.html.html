		<p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract </p>
		<p class=normal>The MultiMuseum is a multi-channel prototype, with different 
		  technological accesses. It has a mission: to open the museum to the 
		  public in an integrated way. It is an interactive, flexible and personalized 
		  tool, which allows the Museum to give information and services to cinema 
		  fans and to all potential visitors.</p>
		<p class=normal>The aim of the project is integrating three fundamental 
		  aspects:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li><span class = "normal"> to widen the access to the Museum heritage;</span></li>
		<li><span class = "normal">to enrich the visitors experience both inside 
		  and outside the National Museum of Cinema;</span></li>
		<li><span class = "normal">to give knowledge personalized tools.</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class=normal>The MultiMuseum is a highly developed platform including 
		  applications  commonly used on the web, expressively customized for 
		  the communicative needs of the Museum, and specific original software, 
		  like HyperFilm, which allows to insert images, videos, QTVR, HTML pages 
		  as hyper textual links connected to a main video.</p>
		<p class=normal>The prototype deals with three experimentation areas:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li><span class = "normal">the advanced Web channel, characterized by 
		  a strong graphic element, including not only the presentation of the 
		  Museum and of its charming dressing, but also of the collections, of 
		  the institutional activities and of the films planning of Cinema Massimo;</span></li>
		<li><span class = "normal">the PDA channel, conceived to implement the 
		  access to the contents, both inside and outside the Museum, by using 
		  handheld devices;</span></li>
		<li><span class = "normal">the Reseau channel, devoted to the wide band 
		  net (VDSL) created by Telecom Italia and Telecom Italia Lab. </span></li>

		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p class="normal">The MultiMuseum<b> </b>project started in spring 2001 
		  as a result of the collaboration between the National Museum of Cinema 
		  and the CSP, an ITC (Information and Communication Technology) Research 
		  Centre recognized by the Ministry of Public Instruction, of  the University 
		  and of the Scientific Research. CSP is a non-profit society created 
		  by local bodies (CSI- Piedmont and the City of Turin), Universities 
		  ( the Polytechnic school and the Public University) and industrial associations 
		  (Industrial Union and Federpiemonte).</p>
		<p class="normal">The National Museum of Cinema of Turin is a project 
		  created in 1941 by Maria Adriana Prolo, a collector and historian. Since 
		  1953, the Museum has been a member of the FIAF (F&#233;d&#233;ration Internationale 
		  des Archives du Film) and in 1992 it became a Foundation. Nowadays the 
		  Mole Antonelliana, the city symbol monument, houses the Museum, which 
		  was inaugurated in July 2000. Thanks to the fantastic dressing of the 
		  architect Fran&ccedil;ois Confino, the Mole Antonelliana has been turned 
		  into a vertical museum unique in the world, which has received, until 
		  now, almost one million visitors.</p>
		<p>For the National Museum of Cinema, the MultiMuseum represents the beginning 
		  of an important journey in the world of the new media and of the advanced 
		  telematics networks. The project offers both the visitor <i>in<span class="normal"> 
		  </span>loco</i> and the visitor on line innovative opportunities of 
		  knowledge, interaction and sharing of experiences. In fact, it allows 
		  to have access to the information on the collections of the museum, 
		  on the films planning, on the institutional activities and so on.</p>
		<p class="normal">Thanks to the partnerships created by the National Museum 
		  of Cinema and the cooperation of CSP, Telecom Italia, HP (Hewlett Packard) 
		  and Netbrain for this project, the MultiMuseum has become an example 
		  of synergy between the world of art and technology, culture and innovation 
		  both on the urban and the national territory. It is a communication 
		  model suitable to different settings of use and it can involve many 
		  political and cultural actors among with museums, cultural bodies, research 
		  centres and the Public Administration.</p>
		<p class="normal">Moreover, to understand the importance of the MultiMuseum 
		  project, the particular national and urban setting in which it is inserted 
		  is to be underlined. Italy can boast of its prime position about the 
		  width and the richness of its artistic and cultural heritage. During 
		  these last years, the importance of the cultural domain has become a 
		  precious resource from a social and economic point of view.</p>
		<p class="normal">As regard as Turin, this city is the Italian industry 
		  symbol and for many years its identity has been considered related to 
		  Fiat Auto image. As a place in the northwest of Italy where the productions 
		  of vehicles was the first thing coming to everybody's mind. Nowadays, 
		  Turin is in a period of deep change and the metal and mechanical industry 
		  is less present in the economic and social life of the city. Even if 
		  for more than one hundred years, Turin has been the capital of the industrial 
		  production of vehicles in Italy and also in Europe, today it is asserting 
		  its presence in the field of the new technologies and it has already 
		  won international fame in the field of <i>Information and Communication 
		  Technology.</i> In fact, Turin has become one of the so-called hi-tech 
		  cluster, the last generation of technological districts created by the 
		  digital revolution, as for the United States, Israel, France, Switzerland 
		  and Germany. Many investments have been made to carry out the research, 
		  to develop ideas, business, innovative finance indispensable to give 
		  birth to new firms.The XX Winter Olympic Games of 2006 will also give 
		  great opportunities to the city, which has been always engaged with 
		  these sports thanks to the mountains of its surroundings.</p>
		<p class="normal">With public and private investments and the international 
		  attention they will bring, the Games are an opportunity without equal 
		  to transform and renew urban areas. Moreover, in this phase of deep 
		  transformation of the city, a new identity linked to the tourist and 
		  cultural development is making its way. Turin's goal is to become "the 
		  city of cinema". This is why the re-opening of the National Museum of 
		  Cinema is so important. This goal has its source in the city history: 
		  not only the first real Italian cinema industry has born in Turin, but 
		  also the world one. In fact, in the film library and in the collections 
		  of the Museums the visitors can find the great heritage of silent films. 
		  Thanks to the support of local and European bodies, many projects have 
		  been carried out to promote the cinema production.</p>
		<p class="normal">So, the use of new technologies in the field of cultural 
		  domain and in particular in cinema represents an important occasion: 
		  the possibility to widen the access overcoming the geographical borders 
		  and to spread a cultural heritage without moving. </p>
		<p class=BlockQuote>"The need, for such a museum, and for all the museums 
		  in general, to be equipped of a communicational tool which makes it 
		  accessible and immediately available for its users through different 
		  technologies. [...]</p>
		<p class=BlockQuote>Museums have to deal and will always have to deal 
		  with the problem of spreading their resources to a widen public; and 
		  to do so they have to ask themselves which could be the most suitable 
		  vehicles to reach this public and to offer adequate services."</p>
		<p class="normal">Communicating about the National Museum of Cinema is 
		  a complex operation. Producing the Museum website means creating an 
		  innovative communication tool having the characteristics of flexibility 
		  and <i>appeal</i> necessary to attract the Museum visitor, but also 
		  creating a familiar environment in which emotions and information become 
		  a unique resource and an irreplaceable advantage to increase the number 
		  of Museum visitors. This could be an advantage also for all the people 
		  who have worked and are still working at the Museum and for the city 
		  that houses it.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Goals of the MultiMuseum communication model</h1>
		<p class="normal">The MultiMuseum is a communication model conceived for 
		  a virtual museum which can be available from many places, in different 
		  moments and with different media. The main priority of the project is 
		  to create innovative technological solutions and contents focused on 
		  widening the Museum and its experience to the visitors, to the potential 
		  public and, in particular, to the city. In fact, the museum experience 
		  is not to be seen only in a sense of space, inside a place; but also 
		  in a sense of time, before and after the visit.</p>
		<p class="normal">The MultiMuseum goal is to widen and to enrich the visitors 
		  experience through portable communication technologies: the web, which 
		  allows a constant access to information  and services, a PDA channel 
		  (Personal Digital Assistants) conceived for a <i>mobile</i> access through 
		  a wireless technology, a broad band channel to use <i>in loco</i> the 
		  multimedia applications thanks to a high speed network. Technologies 
		  are the strategic point of the MultiMuseum project even if contents 
		  and services are the determining factors to widen the experience of 
		  the users to different spatio-temporal environments and to different 
		  ways of interaction. The web environment is mainly focused on recalling 
		  the Museum atmosphere involving the user in a virtual tour thanks to 
		  interactive images and film sequences.</p>
		<p class="normal">The on line Museum tour is composed by film sequences 
		  showing the setting of the Mole Antonelliana, the Cinema Archaeology, 
		  the Cinema Machine, the Posters Gallery and the Temple Hall: the Museum 
		  core surrounded by ten <i>chapelles</i> on the main subjects about the 
		  Seventh Art, Love and Death, the Absurd, True and False and the Caff&#233; 
		  Torino, the chapel dedicated to the city, once The Cinema Capital.</p>
		<p class="normal">The MultiMuseum offers very rich practical information 
		  on organizing visits and a presentation of the activities for the public 
		  and for schools, which, through the site, can plan a programme of workshops 
		  for students and teachers. Before and after the visit, the visitor can 
		  have information on future events and thanks to the e-mail or consulting 
		  the handheld device (PDA) or the channel Avant-GO, he can receive further 
		  services. This technology allows the local memory of the handheld device 
		  to store the <i>quick </i>Museum information, which can be updated by 
		  synchronising the PDA with the PC: each user can have on his PDA <i>the</i> 
		  <i>Pocket-size Museum</i>, a pocket museum immediately available everywhere.</p>
		<p class="normal">Thanks to the wireless technology, the MultiMuseum gives 
		  the visitors the opportunity to interact with its space during the visit: 
		  in fact, inside the Mole Antonelliana, a Wireless LAN conceived for 
		  the use of PDA as multimedia guide to the Temple Hall is available. 
		  Every visitor equipped with a PDA can follow a personal route through 
		  the <i>chapelles</i> and can consult the "guide" explaining the setting, 
		  enriching the experience of the visit by videos, texts and original 
		  sequences.</p>
		<p class="normal">Dedicated to all the visitors of the Mole is the environment 
		  Reseau: this channel can be reached from multimedia stations in the 
		  welcome area for the public attending <i>The Cinema of the Future Workshop, 
		  </i>a multimedia work on cinema techniques.</p>
		<p class="normal">Besides the traditional channels like the catalogue, 
		  the guided visit, the material shown in the exhibition, today the visitor 
		  can imagine a sort of MultiMuseum, a virtual museum on different temporal 
		  dimensions more and more in the hands of the users.</p>
		<p class="normal">As well as the visit, there is the on line access, through 
		  wireless technologies, keeping the visitor in contact with the contents 
		  of the site during the visit. It allows to superimpose the physical 
		  space of the Museum upon a virtual space, available thanks to a handheld 
		  device, a sort of personal digital assistant (a PDA, in fact), that 
		  the visitor can always keep with him. This virtual space is independent 
		  from the place the visitor is in; it is a kind of flux, a <i>space of 
		  flux</i>, constantly available at any time. In fact, the <i>wireless</i> 
		  technology allows us to support the web information space within the 
		  physical space of the Museum visit: the information space of the virtual 
		  museum with the physical one, compared to the active experience of a 
		  visitor of the Mole Antonelliana. The wireless communication model supports 
		  and replaces the network model: a network made by cables and desktop 
		  terminals can be replaced by the wireless technology of the WI-FI nets 
		  which are perfectly suitable to the environment and to the use of handheld 
		  devices more and more light. </p>
		<p class="normal">Just think about the historical buildings and about 
		  their structural and architectural problems which influence not only 
		  the people physical accessibility but also the introduction of telematics 
		  technologies focused on opening a virtual access to our museums heritage.The 
		  Wireless communication model is an innovative solution. In particular, 
		  it isn't intrusive towards monuments or historical buildings and the 
		  net set at the Mole Antonelliana is an important example: a facility 
		  made by an integrated WI-FI network, which allows to involve a monument 
		  of 167 metres in an information flux reachable from every place through 
		  stations, notebooks or PDA.This means not only different services and 
		  contents according to different terminals (audio and wide band video 
		  contents on multimedia Desktop-PC, rapid information services for internet 
		  terminals and <i>informative pushing </i>about the setting of mobile 
		  devices), but it also means to enrich the visitors experience inside 
		  and outside the Museum by the use of personalized tools.The charming 
		  web site is supported by the possibility of having  the same contents 
		  on a  mobile device and even on a last generation mobile phone: with 
		  <i>the Pocket-size Museum</i> each visitor can enter the Mole Antonelliana 
		  and follow a personalized journey or the hypertextual links of the guide 
		  on the Museum PDA.The wireless communication does not represent a revolution: 
		  every kind of information media, from the radio to the news on TV, has 
		  always been "wireless".</p>
		<p class="normal">The absolutely new aspect of the recent "new media" 
		  is that, for the first time, people can have just the information they 
		  want, when and where they want by pocket terminals.This change has been 
		  possible because the media have progressively become digital, and also 
		  because of the technical research in the field of the mobile communication 
		  networks, which have introduced handheld devices more and more powerfull 
		  in terms of data processing and multimedia functions.So, the innovation 
		  is not only in the technology but also in the communication model, which 
		  emphasize the terminal-user capabilities: in the possibility to personalize, 
		  to inform about the contents according to personal needs or to original 
		  mental paths, thanks to light devices as notebooks or as Personal Digital 
		  Assistants.Today, we are facing the event called <i>information on demand</i>, 
		  where people can be free from institutions (Publishers, Training Bodies, 
		  Mass Media) and from the traditional physical places of cultural contents 
		  exchange.</p>
		<p class="normal">The means and the process of the production and distribution 
		  of knowledge have deeply changed, and with them also the meaning of 
		  book, catalogue, magazine or audioguide.In particular, the cultural 
		  institutions and the Museums have been asked to meet the individual 
		  requirements and the interests of their public.The information on the 
		  single works can be shared through a digital multichannel communication 
		  model which allows tourists to make a personal edition of the texts, 
		  of the audios and videos about a particular subject or exhibition.Infact, 
		  more and more, the tourists desire to go into the catalogue and the 
		  other informative resources according to their interests as they prefer 
		  to follow a personal path inside the Museum.For the first time, the 
		  cultural tourists can have a guide working out again the contents of 
		  the different sources through different media but having the digital 
		  language in common.For the Museums, this is an important opportunity 
		  to offer the visitors of today, and the future ones, different information 
		  according to the several targets and to insert their cultural contents 
		  into a network at local and urban level.Infact, we would like to imagine 
		  the communication model the MultiMuseum as a model to be used in other 
		  urban or regional occasions: we will obtain a net of <i>Multi...</i> 
		  where every single part communicates and offers services, both inside 
		  and outside, to tourists and citizens, presenting different contents 
		  (information on the city transports, museums opening hours, restaurants, 
		  shops etc..).The result will be a great information about the city which 
		  could be available from every mobile terminal speaking a digital language.</p>

		<p class="normal">The Web channel has two different kinds of navigation. 
		  The first one has been defined "Browsing the Museum". It has been realised 
		  with Flash and allows the visitor to make a virtual tour of the Museum. 
		  It is sufficient to use the small Mole Antonelliana placed on the left 
		  of the screen, each floor of the Mole contains a small photo gallery. 
		  The second one is a more traditional thematic navigation. It provides 
		  general information on the Museum, on the events and on the exhibitions, 
		  but also information on future and past activities, on the visits and 
		  the schedule of the "Massimo" multi-screen cinema that is part of the 
		  museum system. There is also a press area where newspapers, press offices 
		  and journalists can enter in a dedicated mailing list, a newsletter, 
		  a page with links to other museums of cinema in the world and a section 
		  for activities, guided visits, school workshops, with their relative 
		  cards. </p>
		<p class="normal">In the web channel there is also a very innovative presentation 
		  of the National Museum of Cinema, realised with a licensed software<i>, 
		  </i>HyperFilm, that allows the insertion of images, videos, 360&deg; 
		  views obtained with QTVR, HTML pages as the links to a main video. The 
		  images shown in this video are: the interior part of the Mole, the <i>Temple 
		  Hall, </i>which is the centre of the Museum, the elevator that brings 
		  up to the edge of the Mole and the view of the different levels. While 
		  the main video is going on, on the right, some links to various levels 
		  of deepened investigation appear. </p>
		<p class="normal">The PDA channel has been conceived to widen the access 
		  to contents, both on the exterior than on the interior of the museum, 
		  thanks to handheld devices. It allows people having their own palm desktop 
		  to enter in the AvantGO channel and receive some information on the 
		  National Museum of Cinema: a brief presentation of the Museum, how to 
		  reach it, news, events, the weekly schedule of the cinema Massimo. In 
		  the PDA channel, you can furthermore see a presentation of the wireless 
		  Museum experimentation, which has been a fundamental part of the project 
		  and whose aim is to identify the best way to enjoy the contents, through 
		  the use of handheld devices as an help during the visit of the museum. 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">Finally, the Reseau channel is dedicated to the Telecom 
		  Italia Lab broad band (VDSL net) of which the National Museum of Cinema 
		  and the CSP are part; it is an area that offers the possibility to the 
		  network of experimenters to get audio and video contents. The project 
		  is based on a high performances network structure and its aim is to 
		  demonstrate, even if only experimentally, innovative applications for 
		  business and home users. </p>
		<p class="normal">The network is already present in three metropolitan 
		  areas (Turin, Milan and Rome) that are linked by a national <i>backbone. 
		  </i>The net is realised with innovative techniques, such as optical 
		  transportation DWDM, high speed access Gigabit Ethernet and VDSL, advanced 
		  IP networking and added value services on IP. The Reseau network is 
		  a real workshop for technologies and services through the two Multimedia 
		  Services Centers; it offers integrated widespread and integrated interactive 
		  applications of high quality on a IP broadband platform. The Reseau 
		  net will be available next spring for the Italian institutes that have 
		  asked for it.Through the Reseau channel, the National Museum of Cinema 
		  offers the Workshop on the Cinema of the Future. It is an experimental 
		  area by which one can explore some of the features of the digital cinema. 
		  Virtually following the course of the <i>Cinema Machine</i>, that shows 
		  the different elements of its language (edition, setting, special effects 
		  etc.) it is possible to interact with the Museum and compare some "digital 
		  interpretations". It is a demonstration of the fact that the cinema 
		  could reach new poetry and new trials through digital systems and their 
		  peculiar linguistic solutions (frame, link, windows, banner, animations). 
		</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Wireless Museum experiments</h1>
		<p class="normal">Inside the MultiMuseum you can find Wireless Museum, 
		  aiming to the use of palmtops during the visit. Concerning this kind 
		  of trials, it is one of the first in Italy but certainly the first in 
		  Turin. According to the researches, analysis and tests of CSP started 
		  in the summer 2001, mobile technology has been seen as a model of innovation 
		  to try inside a museum. Handheld devices satisfy our daily fundamental 
		  needs: they are flexible, have a good memory and are a perfect multimedial 
		  supports for audio and video contents in hypertexts created for this 
		  purpose. They furthermore allow the integration in a local network, 
		  offer the possibility of streaming and sharing the information inside 
		  a group. The PDA, providing the visitor with more additional information 
		  about the museum, is the evolution of the audioguides, with the good 
		  quality of being also easier to update thanks to the wireless connection. 
		  For this reason they have been defined "Ciceros in the palm of an hand".</p>
		<p class="normal">The first phase of the Wireless Museum experiment begun 
		  in spring 2002 and finished in October. Its aim was to test five iPaq 
		  3850 in a Wi-Fi network with audio and video streaming and hypertext 
		  contents. The test was focused on four of the chapelles surrounding 
		  the Temple Hall: Cappella Torino, Cappella Cabiria,  Cappella degli 
		  Specchi and Cappella Horror. The aim in this first phase is to find 
		  a model of enjoying these added contents through a palmtop, to find 
		  checkout parameters and to tests its use inside this environment. </p>
		<p class="normal">From December 2002 until April 2003 there was the second 
		  phase: tests and analysis of the results through groups of 10-15 elements. 
		  These people had been given a set of questions to verify what people 
		  thought about the amount of information, the interaction, the contents 
		  and the ergonomics of iPaq. After this phase, the handheld devices will 
		  be lent to the visitors of the National Museum of Cinema, the contents 
		  of the Temple Hall will be widened to other parts of the Museum, and 
		  the contents on the iPaq will be integrated with the web platform of 
		  the Museum. We are really interested in the more innovative forms of 
		  information pushing, so that visitors will receive the information directly 
		  from the server, avoiding the direct interaction with the device. This 
		  is for an easier and more advanced service.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">The MultiMuseum multi-channel system: technical 
		  specifications</h1>
		<p class="normal">As we have said the MultiMuseum offers different channels 
		  and different languages of communication to the visitor of the Museum. 
		  The web is the environment of these channels' evolution, even though 
		  they are completely independent in their design and structure. the MultiMuseum 
		  is therefore a web container that offers three different channels/tools 
		  to enjoy the contents; they have been realised with applications which 
		  are usually used on the web, even if customised according to the needs 
		  of the Museum, and evolved application that have property formats<i>.</i> 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">The main web channel is characterised by a strong graphics 
		  in a driven data base. The PHP language, coming from the Open Source 
		  and scalable on the basis architecture has been chosen to realise the 
		  main data base structure (archives, user interaction forms and update 
		  and "back office" interaction forms) to allow the best efficacy and 
		  quickness inside a web container characterised by graphics. The web 
		  channel contains the presentation of its collections and two innovative 
		  applications:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <span class="normal">Hyper Museum: it is a multimedial 
			hypertext made with a HyperFilm technology (<a
href="http://www.hyperfilm.it/">www.hyperfilm.it</a>). HyperFilm is a software 
			based on well known standards. It works on every platform that support 
			free Macromedia ShockWave&#174; and Apple QuickTime&#174; plug-in. The hypertext 
			presents videos (with Quick Time 5) and some QTVR with a main video 
			made for the MultiMuseum;</span>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <span class="normal">Browsing the Museum: it is 
			an hypertext realised with Macromedia Flash&#174; 5 by which the user can 
			navigate inside the Mole Antonelliana and the Cinema Massimo.</span>
		</li>
	  </ul>

		<p class="normal">The direction of the MultiMuseum is mainly appointed 
		  to web interfaces directly linked to a MySQL database; they can be easily 
		  updated by the staff of the Museum. The databases used in the container 
		  are thought for a continuous updating also by no-expert persons, for 
		  researches in the archives and to make the structure scalable towards 
		  community services an easy achievement of community services. The architecture 
		  of the system has been thought for future layouts and to grant high 
		  performances with numerous visitors, even with a delicate hardware.</p>
		<p class="SubHeaderSmall"><b>The Reseau Project: technical specifications</b></p>
	
	  <p>RESEAU is a Telecom Italia experiment, that foresees the development 
		  of a broad band pilot network and internet services of new generation. 
		  Today, the RESEAU platform makes it possible to test the following services:</p>

	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> <span class ="normal"><i>Solutions for virtual communities:</i> 
		  virtual multimedial environments fostering aggregation on internet through 
		  audio/video communication, enjoyment and sharing of multimedial contents

		<li class="normal"> <span class ="normal"><i>Interactive multimedial applications: 
		  </i>or multimedial web pages in which the user can interact. The "workshop 
		  on the cinema of the future" could be an example. It has been developed 
		  with the National Museum of Cinema, where some of the edition techniques 
		  are shown with a comparison between cinematographic space (real videos) 
		  and digital space, allowing the user to deepen some aspects of cinema 
		  edition.<i></i></span></li>

		<li class="normal"> <span class ="normal">
		  <i> videostreaming live and on-demand: </i>audio-video 
			contents with TV quality broadcast also on-demand;
		</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class ="normal"><i>games on-demand:</i> games on the net, monoplayer or multiplayer;</span></li>

		<li class="normal"> <span class ="normal">e-learning applications: based on a distant teaching-learning relationship 
		  through the net.</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class="normal">For what concerns the net services here we have listed 
		  the more important among those being tested with RESEAU:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li><span class = "normal"> <span class=normal> <i>IPv6 with access to

		  taking the most of network facilities;</span> </span></li>
		<li><span class = "normal"> <span class=normal> <i>IP services for QoS 
		  (Quality of Service), CoS (Class of Service), Traffic Policy</i>, allow 
		  to make different profiles of the user, to grant the effectiveness and 
		  the quality of the services offered;</span> </span></li>
		<li><span class = "normal"> <span class=normal> <i>optical storage networking 
		  services </i>and<i> disaster recovery </i>allow to manage data banks 
		  and to restore the information in case of problems on local storage 
		  systems.</span> </span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<h1 class="SubHeader">WiFi network at the National Museum of Cinema: technical 
		  specifications </h1>
		<p class="normal">A Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), based on the IEEE 
		  802.11 standard, is a system that gives the possibility to make a real 
		  LAN Ethernet "wireless" with Access Point (AP) and mobile devices Wireless 
		  Terminal (WT). The Access Points are bridges that link the wireless 
		  subnet with the hardwired one, while the Wireless Terminals are devices 
		  that permit to use net services wherever they are. The Access Points 
		  can be implemented both in hardware (with particular devices), and in 
		  software, with a PC or a notebook provided with wireless interface and 
		  ethernet card. The Wireless Terminal can be any device such as for example 
		  a notebook, palmtop, pda, mobile phones, or equipment that interface 
		  standard IEEE 802.11, or consumer systems on Bluetooth technology.</p>
		<p class="normal">There is no doubt of the advantages obtained by using 
		  this technology. Installations, harness and maintenance are considerably 
		  reduced. The architectural ties which are imposed in historical buildings 
		  that, for example, host museums, congress centres and libraries can 
		  be respected. The problems of entering the network in areas where many 
		  other users are operating (airports, hotels, universities), or when 
		  we rapidly change our position, are solved. Then in this way we cut 
		  the amount of money spent to renew or increase the number of PC for 
		  visitors or for our staff.Furthermore wireless technology opens the 
		  way to new services characterised by a strong interaction with the outer 
		  environment.</p>
		<p class="normal">We can then make the idea of a personalised museum come 
		  true. A museum that communicates with the visitor, that recreates the 
		  environment in which the object shown have been thought, and that offers 
		  sounds, images, different sensations. There will not be anymore an established 
		  way; the visitor will be free to create its own journey in the world 
		  of cinema.</p>
		<p class="normal">The system planned for the Mole Antonelliana permits 
		  staff </p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li><span class = "normal"> <span class=normal> to use localisation (detection) 
		  systems based on Access Points, inside the halls of the museum, that

		  </span></li>
		<li><span class = "normal">to enter in the LAN of the museum which is
