		<p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>
		<p class=AbstractText>As museums throughout the world enter the interactive 
		  arena of digital communications, a need has emerged to access strategies 
		  of program development that seamlessly interface with existing missions 
		  and resources. This paper describes how Project VIEW, a US Department 
		  of Education Technology Innovation Challenge Grant, collaborates with 
		  major museums - the Guggenheim (NY) Museum, the Whitney Museum, the 
		  Philadelphia Museum of Art, and others - to create templates for developing 
		  point-to-point interactive videoconferences with asynchronous web-based 
		  resources that enhance student learning. Underlying the work of VIEW 
		  is the premise that, to achieve the promise of interactive technologies, 
		  it is necessary to change educational pedagogy. To accomplish this, 
		  Project VIEW employs multi-phase integration techniques that bring together 
		  the needs and missions of diverse yet intersecting educational delivery 
		  systems at museums and schools. While the development of a model for 
		  sustainable program development and content integration a core component 
		  of Project VIEW, the primary goal of VIEW is to deliver instruction 
		  that produces evidence of higher student learning and academic performance. 
		  Interim evaluation by an external reviewer (The Evaluation Consortium, 
		  University at Albany, State University of New York) indicates evidence 
		  of enhanced student learning among students who participate in Project 
		  VIEW programs. Importantly, evidence confirms that outcomes for students 
		  are the result of VIEW training and development processes in which both 
		  schools and museums are transforming the way that they deliver education 
		  and through integrated, interactive videoconferencing and web-based 
		  learning.</p>

		<h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
		<p>Project VIEW, based in the Schenectady City School District, NY, is 
		  midway through a federal technology innovative challenge grant that 
		  is changing the way that Museum Educators and Schools interface in the 
		  classroom. To accomplish this, Project VIEW has effectively created 
		  a consortium of over 500 demographically varied school districts and 
		  diverse, content-rich education providers from across the nation who 
		  are pursuing a shared common goal: To develop and use interactive educational 
		  programs that expand traditional school communities and bring unique 
		  resources to students who may not otherwise have access to them.</p>
		<p class="normal">From its inception, Project VIEW has recognized the 
		  critical need to prepare students with the high degree of literacy needed 
		  to succeed in the 21st Century information age (Project View, 1999). 
		  &nbsp;To meet this need, Project VIEW has built a constructivist inquiry-based 
		  environment for developing innovative educational resources. </p>
		<p class="normal">VIEW utilizes the unique expertise of both museums and 
		  participating teachers to create content which facilitates seamless 
		  integration of video programming and supporting web-based resources 
		  into curriculum delivery. Participating museum educators and teachers 
		  are merging their educational methodologies into a student-centered, 
		  constructivist reality in which literacy is built on multi-media foundations, 
		  and individual learners create meaning from digital content formats. 
		  (Meuwissen &amp; Geehan, 2001) What follows in this paper is a brief 
		  overview of the VIEW model and preliminary data on the effectiveness 
		  of the model for both schools and museums.</p>
		<h1 class="Header">PHASE 1 - ESTABLISHING A FOUNDATION FOR PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT.</h1>
		<p class="normal">There are multiple components that are essential for 
		  engaging in the VIEW Development process. These components are not linear 
		  but rather occur in a constructivist environment, emerging both in real 
		  time and asynchronously, as needed.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Program Prerequisites</h2>
		<p class="normal">VIEW has identified four essential components needed 
		  for the development of all programs &#151; collaborating teams, multi-disciplinary 
		  instructional expertise, internal institutional commitment, and content 
		  standards alignment. These components are constructed on the firm foundation 
		  of evidence and experience documented in the Schenectady City School 
		  District formal program evaluations (Evaluation Committee, Title III, 
		  1997-2002) .</p>

		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=Section1> 
			<p><b><i>C<span class="normal">ollaborating teams</span></i></b><span class="normal">: 
			  In developing programs, study has shown that collaborating building-based 
			  teams of at least 3 or 4 teachers are required to create a sustainable 
			  community of users. Three or four teachers in a single location 
			  can support each other and disseminate the program to their peers. 
			  Further, they are likely to continue to engage with a program with 
			  energy even if one team member moves on to another location. </span></p>
		  </div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=Section1> 
			<p><span class="normal"><b><i>Multi-disciplinary instructional expertise</i></b>: 
			  Including multiple curriculum areas in building a team is an important 
			  requisite for program success because our experience has shown that 
			  such content diversity creates a breadth of vision and usability 
			  in programs that facilitates sustainability. In addition, the curriculum 
			  products and models created by multi-disciplinary teams have broader 
			  and deeper applicability for use in a variety of settings.</span></p>
		  </div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=Section1> 
			<p><span class="normal"><b><i>Content provider institutional commitment 
			  and synergy</i></b>: It its essential that development of interactive 
			  videoconferencing programs and supporting content be aligned with 
			  the mission and expertise of the content provider. Without this 
			  important requirement, the program will have no roots or continuity 
			  within the institution, and would most likely lack the content underpinning 
			  which forms the core of a successful project. </span></p>
		  </div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=normal> 
			<p><span class="normal"><b><i>Content standards alignment</i></b>: 
			  Alignment with content standards is essential if a program is to 
			  offer substance that supports and expands classroom mission and 
			  practice. Furthermore, in order for schools to continue to participate 
			  in programs, the programs must meet mandated educational needs.</span></p>
		  </div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Pre-Development Preparation and Planning</h2>
		<p class="normal">Before proceeding with development, VIEW requires a 
		  series of collaborative planning sessions to ensure that an adequate 
		  foundation for development exists. These sessions are designed to create 
		  a basis through which a program can be constructed. Focus for such sessions 
		  (as needed) may include:<b><u></u></b></p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=Section1> 
			<p><b><i><span class="normal">Capacity and connectivity of the provider 
			  and/or participating classroom</span></i></b><span class="normal"><i>s</i>: 
			  The core of the VIEW model is built on a philosophical and pedagogical 
			  foundation for interactive and sustainable interactive videoconferencing 
			  and web usage. In designing programs that facilitate engagement 
			  with interactive technology, it is essential for all partners to 
			  have a baseline technological capacity (hardware, software and connectivity) 
			  to fully participate in the development process. To ensure that 
			  the infrastructure is in place for all participants, Project VIEW 
			  staff meets separately, through a Collaborative Visioning process, 
			  with provider and school technical staff to identify equipment and 
			  connectivity needs, and to fill baseline gaps where they are identified.</span></p>
		  </div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=Section1> 
			<p><span class="normal"><b><i>Training and experience of participating 
			  provider and school staff:</i></b> While VIEW programs are created 
			  so that they can be expanded and/or solidified as technology and 
			  technological skills improve, it is crucial that all participants 
			  in development have an essential baseline of training and experience. 
			  Such basic technological literacy ensures that participants can 
			  fully contribute to the interactive process of creating content 
			  and delivery modes. To enable hands-on participatory development, 
			  VIEW facilitates a constructivist Collaborative Visioning process 
			  with participating teachers and museum staff. Technological learning 
			  tutorials are offered, as needed, to provide appropriate skills 
			  for content development. This process creates a self-motivated assessment 
			  and understanding of capacity and readiness among participants.</span></p>
		  </div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=Section1> 
			<p><span class="normal"><b><i>Content focus aligned with provider 
			  institution mission, goals and collections</i>:</b> Prior to beginning 
			  the collaborative development, Project VIEW staff meets with the 
			  museum to establish a program content focus that is aligned with 
			  the provider institution. Programmatic options and preferences of 
			  the institution are reviewed, and a general focus for the program 
			  is collaboratively chosen. Target grade levels and possible curriculum 
			  specialties appropriate for the content are also suggested. </span></p>
		  </div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=Section1> 
			<p><span class="normal">It is essential that the content of the program 
			  be aligned with collections. Without this foundation, the program 
			  would be an empty shell, failing to utilize the unique capacities 
			  of the museum. In addition, it is necessary that content be aligned 
			  with institution mission and goals to make certain that it can be 
			  sustained over time. Such alignment helps to make it likely that 
			  the expertise and focus of the institutional programming will continue 
			  in the program content area and facilitate sustainability. </span></p>
		  </div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=Section1> 
			<p><span class="normal"><b><i>Selection of teacher team members aligned 
			  with content focus</i>:</b> Project VIEW collaborates with schools 
			  to select participating teacher teams based on content focus, target 
			  grade levels and possible curriculum specialties. In this process, 
			  Project VIEW records suggestions from schools regarding content 
			  appropriateness, standards interface and teaching applicability. 
			  If necessary, Project VIEW meets with content provider to collaboratively 
			  consider comments and make adjustments are made to initial content 
			  focus, as appropriate. </span></p>
		  </div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=Section1> <span class="normal"><b><i>Pre-program orientation 
			of teachers and/or provider staff</i>:</b> Pre-development orientation 
			and/or introduction sessions are offered separately to participating 
			teacher teams and provider staff. As needed, Project VIEW brings introductory 
			presentations and videoconference demonstrations to participating 
			sites to help establish the baseline of programmatic understanding 
			needed to adequately participate in the development process.</span></div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Phase2: Exploring Content and Developing a Program</h1>
		<p class="normal">Developing project content and ensuring that the content 
		  is useful in enhancing education delivery are among of the central activities 
		  of Project VIEW. There are multiple components to these activities, 
		  and most of them occur in a sequential timeframe.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall"> Content Immersion</h2>
		<p class="normal">Teachers and museum educators joining VIEW collaborations 
		  are expected to use their unique and diverse expertise in VIEW program 
		  development. Specifically, teachers are expected to be leaders in the 
		  area of classroom curriculum and school-based academic pedagogy, while 
		  museum personnel are expected to be specialists in the specific content 
		  areas of museum collections and archives (Note, (while this paper refers 
		  primarily to Museums and Museum education, Project VIEW has done its 
		  work with a spectrum of content providers including Museums, Zoos, Historical 
		  Societies and Libraries). Yet, as the Project VIEW model has developed, 
		  it has become apparent that when there is a constructivist blending 
		  and/or interface of the competencies of the participants and participating 
		  communities, the development of sustainable programming is more effective. 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">The constructivist blending is based on a theory that 
		  meaning more profound when it is constructed, not transmitted. Participants 
		  use their own expertise to collaborate with each other to construct 
		  methods and models based on intersecting missions and competencies.</p>
		<p class="normal">To facilitate this process to the greatest degree for 
		  each project, the VIEW program development begins at the provider institution 
		  with a full day session of content immersion. Participating teachers 
		  receive an introduction to collection artifacts and resources from the 
		  content provider staff as well as an overview of the proposed program 
		  content focus. General responses and discussion of the applicability 
		  and utility of the content for classroom use take place and a basic 
		  framework for the program development is discussed. Teachers also reflect 
		  on grade-appropriateness of the proposed content focus, and relevance 
		  to learning standards and the curriculum. </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Development Sessions </h2>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmaller">Constructivist Activities</h3>
		<p class="normal">Within two weeks of the <b><i>Content Immersion </i></b>session, 
		  participants come together again at the Project VIEW Laboratory to engage 
		  in a constructivist process that contributes to development of a replicable 
		  videoconference program with supporting resources and activities. Collaboratively, 
		  participants review the <b><i>Content Immersion</i></b> experience and 
		  begin to select key concepts that can expand and enhance student learning 
		  and achievement. Often during this phase of the development, the content 
		  focus narrows and tangential areas of exploration are tagged for program 
		  enrichment and/or exploratory study. Throughout this process, it is 
		  important to remember that "Different perspective, interpretations and 
		  criticism must be shared and creative conflicts (that lead to new discourse 
		  and new knowledge) must be engendered." (Jeffers 2003)</p>
		<p class="normal">The process of creating the project varies from program 
		  to program, but a template for effective development methodology is 
		  emerging. </p>
		<p class="normal">In its developing form the VIEW model includes the following:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class=normal> Facilitated constructivist discussion of all participant 
			points of view on content applicability and presentation;</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=normal> Structural outline of videoconference presentation 
			and identification of experiences and resources need to support and 
			deliver the content; and </div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=normal> Self evaluation of program and process and self assignment 
			of specific tasks for independent work.</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class="normal">At the conclusion of the first three development sessions, 
		  participants identify areas of content that are needed for program completion 
		  and they collaboratively designate team members to gather and/or create 
		  that content. </p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Independent development by teachers and museums</h3>
		<p class="normal">Following the <b><i>content immersion</i></b> and <b><i>development 
		  sessions</i></b>, participants and museum specialists spend the next 
		  8 to 10 weeks pursuing their team designated development tasks. These 
		  tasks vary with the competencies and interest of the participants. 
		  In general, museum staff focuses on the collaboratively determined program 
		  content, gathering and sharing resources with participants, and authoring 
		  a videoconference presentation that enhances understanding of some key 
		  aspect(s) of the content. Teachers construct pre- and post-visit activities 
		  and resources to support the anticipated videoconference. All participants 
		  are encouraged to use technology to interact digitally with each other 
		  and to share and pilot parts of the program as they are developed.</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmaller">Reflection and Completion of Development</h3>
		<p class="normal">After the independent component of the collaboration, 
		  the teams are reassembled for a final two days. They conduct a review 
		  of their collective efforts including revisiting their goals and evaluating 
		  the results of their independent work (curriculum, resources, lesson 
		  plans, etc.). The content provider presents the videoconference that 
		  they have created and teachers critique it. Gaps in the program are 
		  identified and the group collectively works to fill them as appropriate. 
		  VIEW criteria for high quality programs are emerging as a result of 
		  this process. Benchmarks for program excellence are currently being 
		  created. However, early review suggests the following may central be 
		  among them:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> <span class="normal"> Seamless curriculum 
			interface;</span></div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> <span class="normal"> Effective use of interactive 
			media; </span></div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> <span class="normal"> Strong use of supporting 
			interactive technologies;</span></div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> <span class="normal"> Alignment of program 
			elements with institutions missions. </span></div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="normal">At the conclusion of the two days, participants schedule 
		  test dates with the provider for field testing the program in the classroom.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Phase 3: Field Testing of Program</h1>
		<p class="normal">An important component of Project VIEW is to provide 
		  an educational reality for laboratory field testing of programs that 
		  are developed. This occurs in two stages.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Field Testing with Participating Program Developers 
		</h2>
		<p class="normal">Following the development phase, programs are piloted 
		  in the schools of the teachers who helped develop them. Imbedded in 
		  those pilots are a commitment among all participants to provide constructive 
		  feedback on the effectiveness of the program in the classroom with students. 
		  After responses are gathered, the provider is charged with retooling 
		  and/or revising programs as needed.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmaller">Field Testing with VIEW Trainees</h2>
		<p class="normal">The second stage of field testing takes place in the 
		  context of training sessions conducted by project VIEW staff to prepare 
		  teachers to be users and consumers of the programs that are developed. 
		  As teachers learn how design integrated classroom modules using interactive 
		  video programs and technologies, they are charged with piloting the 
		  programs developed by VIEW collaborations. Their commitment includes 
		  developing integration plans for their classrooms and providing candid 
		  responses regarding the effectiveness and utility in the classroom of 
		  the programs. The feedback is shared with the providers and the process 
		  of improving programs continues.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Phase 4: Assessing Progress and Moving Forward</h1>
		<p class="normal">Key to reaching and validating Project VIEW goals is 
		  the constant reflection on and realignment of components of the project. 
		  To engage in this process, Project View is involved in a continuing 
		  multiphase, mixed-methodology evaluation which includes both formative 
		  and summative evaluation constructs. </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Formative Evaluation</h2>
		<p class="normal">Part of the evaluation is integrally woven into the 
		  evolution of the VIEW models on an on-going basis. Reflections and findings 
		  of the evaluators are discussed and integrated into evolution of the 
		  development models and program structures. Reflections on methodology 
		  and content integration occur on a regular basis and have resulted in 
		  the following outcomes (Newman, D.L., Smith, J. &amp; Geehan, M.M., 
		  2000).</p>
	
	  <ul>
		<li class=normal> More effective organization of development model procedures 
		  to allow for different teaching styles of participants including structural 
		  integration of interactive collaborative planning and delivery of programs 
		  and mission alignment between school and museum educators. </li>
		<li class=normal> More effective documentation of curriculum projects 
		  through a better organized web representation that includes pre- and 
		  post- program activities and resources to enhance videoconference content. 
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Summative Evaluation</h2>
		<p class="normal">Summative evaluation has helped to create benchmarks 
		  of achievement and signposts of productive directions. Among the trends 
		  beginning to emerge are the following findings:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li>
		  <div class=normal> 
			<p>Increasingly, museum personnel appreciate videoconferencing as 
			  not something that is in competition with the museum, but something 
			  that supports current museum efforts. </p>
		  </div>
		</li>
		<li>
		  <div class=Section1>Participating 
			schools perceive that educational videoconferencing serves to benefit 
			students in their classrooms by increasing their access to authentic 
			and exceptional resources, from historic and scientifically unique 
			locales and classrooms in other areas to experts in various fields 
			and celebrated artifacts.</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Concluding Comments</h1>
		<p class="normal">VIEW's emerging model of collaborative development is 
		  changing the way that both museums and schools deliver content in the 
		  classroom. By creating a process to merge discrete missions and goals 
		  of participating institutions, Project VIEW has achieved success in 
		  designing and modeling key components required to establish a productive 
		  interactive multimedia collaboration among museums and schools. The 
		  constraints of schoolhouse walls are melting away as programs reach 
		  out to bring museum expertise into the classroom through interactive 
		  videoconferencing. </p>
		<p class="normal">Using interactive videoconference programs and supporting 
		  web-based resources, VIEW makes new and innovative use of museum expertise 
		  and collections while structuring content delivery so that it can be 
		  seamlessly integrated into curriculum delivery. Museums are realigning 
		  their content presentation to interface and enhance classroom curriculum 
		  presentation and content requirements. The result is a new, emerging 
		  reality in classroom pedagogy and a new, exciting extension of interpretive 
		  activities of museums.</p>
