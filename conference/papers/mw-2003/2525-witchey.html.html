		<p class=PaperTitle>Are Art Museums Serving Our Targeted Audiences?</p>
		<p class=Author>Holly Rarick Witchey, Cleveland Museum of Art, USA</p>
		<p class=URL><a href="http://www.clevelandart.org/" target="_blank">www.clevelandart.org</a></p>
		<p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>
		<p class=AbstractText>Children &amp; teenagers, 18-35 year olds, minorities, 
		  the disabled&#151;every group on this list is considered an important 
		  audience by art museums. What are we doing to serve them? What benefits 
		  have accrued after years of educational and cognitive theory and with 
		  the advent of new tools and technologies? Art museums have reached all 
		  new highs (and lows) in their approaches to underserved communities. 
		  This paper looks beyond our best intentions to actual outcomes. What 
		  does the content we choose to display on the web reveal about our commitment 
		  to certain audiences? How do special audiences discern the differences 
		  between commitment and special-project pandering? Have we failed audiences 
		  by judging our best efforts according to low standards? Few art museums 
		  have the money, staff, skill-sets to serve all these special targeted 
		  audiences effectively. What best practices guidelines exist outside 
		  of the museum field for serving children, minorities, and the disabled 
		  on the web? Improved content, decreased legal liability, greater audience 
		  reach&#151;these are just a few of the benefits that result when our 
		  web sites are made more accessible. This paper charts where art museums 
		  have been and where they are going in terms of four targeted audiences: 
		  children, minorities, and the disabled. </p>
		<p class=keywords>Keywords: Education, children, accessibility, minorities, 
		  disabled, African-American, audiences</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Are Art Museums Serving Our Targeted Audiences</h1>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Which Came First: Changing Technologies? Changing 
		  Audiences?</h2>
		<p class="normal">In 1996 the California Governor's Conference on the 
		  Arts and Technologies hosted a panel discussion entitled "Virtual Museums&#151;Companions 
		  or Competitors." Argument was running fast and furious against the idea 
		  of virtual museums&#151;how they would destroy attendance at traditional 
		  museums, how virtual presences were a waste of time and money, how they 
		  would breed a future population with even less understanding of art 
		  than currently.</p>
		<p class="normal">At this point, Ken Hamma got up to speak. Ken is currently 
		  Assistant Director of the J. Paul Getty Museum in charge of Information 
		  Technology. In 1996, however, he was the Associate Curator of Ancient 
		  Art at the Getty and just beginning the transition from curator to technologist. 
		  He gave an inspirational talk on the history of the rejection of new 
		  technologies as a typical manifestation of the normal fear of change. 
		  For those of you who were not at the conference, I include a portion 
		  of his comments here, reproduced with his permission.</p>
	  </div>
	  <blockquote> 
		<div class=Section1> 
		  <p>I am here representing to some small extent the point of view of 
			a traditional museum where real not virtual (as we understand that 
			today) objects predominate, where ineffable qualities of the physical 
			thing-in-itself are highly valued </p>
		  <p>To hold and preserve these things for the sake of our own memory 
			is a fundamental cultural necessity. In this perspective there is 
			no reason to discriminate against one medium of interpretation and 
			presentation because it poses new difficulties (digital delivery and 
			virtual reality) and new opportunities (digital delivery and virtual 
			reality, again). If we can remain focused on mission we should be 
			able to calmly ask ourselves <b>"Does this help us do what we want 
			to do and more or less have always wanted to do?"</b> And we will 
			probably find that the answer eventually is, yes it does, but in ways 
			we can only begin to imagine today.</p>
		</div>
	  </blockquote>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class="normal">That was 1996; this is now. The question he poses remains 
		  the <b>third</b> most important question responsible museum professionals 
		  can ask, "Does this help us do what we want to do and more or less have 
		  always wanted to do?" The first two questions ought to be "What do we 
		  want to do?" and "Why do we want to do it?" Perhaps these questions 
		  seem obvious but as funding gets tighter museums are more and more increasingly 
		  motivated by practical questions like "I found this great grant opportunity, 
		  what kind of projects can we think up to get this grant and make sure 
		  we have jobs for the next six months or two years?" Museums in general, 
		  and art museums in particular, seem to be moving farther and farther 
		  away from first principles as established in mission statements. </p>
		<p class="normal">While most museums no longer fear new technologies, 
		  they are slow to embrace all the opportunities offered by new technologies. 
		  With regard to our web sites, our goals are either impossibly broad 
		  or ridiculously modest These goals are based on any number of factors 
		  including: available resources, the perceived utility or non-utility 
		  of web sites in general by administration, and the status of employees 
		  working on the web, either within the museum structure or as outside 
		  contractors. Hovering nebulously in the either and haunting us in the 
		  belief that&#151;given the potential of the web&#151;there ought to 
		  be a way to please and attend to the needs of all of our audiences.</p>
		<p class="normal">Museums are facing tremendous budget cuts. Developers 
		  observe an ever-dwindling pool of clients with less money than before. 
		  Everyone is being held more strictly accountable and the need to focus 
		  on strictly mission critical projects is already close at hand. After 
		  several good years, the new, leaner, Post-September 11 years are hard-going. 
		  Many of us may well not be in the same job, or even the same field, 
		  two years from now. Many jobs that currently exist will cease to exist.</p>
		<p class="normal">I would like to suggest in this paper that now, more 
		  than ever, art museums need to take a more serious look at the audiences 
		  we serve and decide who we can best serve and how we can best serve 
		  them. It is probably possible to serve everyone, but it is surely impossible 
		  to serve everyone well. For those of us in charge of web sites it is 
		  time to acknowledge and be more proactive about serving targeted audiences&#151;something 
		  the web can do quite effectively. Four audiences seem to be of particular 
		  interest to art museums: children (of all ages), the much-desired 18-35 
		  demographic (representing the promise of a future for non-profits), 
		  minorities, and individuals with disabilities. This paper will look 
		  in-depth at only one of these audiences, children.</p>
		<p class="normal">For years new technologies have been touted as the way 
		  to enlist the interest of new/changing audiences. Art museums have clearly 
		  bought into the need to incorporate new technologies into their arsenal 
		  of interpretive devices&#151;witness the plethora of sound and audio 
		  guides, hand-helds, interactives, and Web sites that have multiplied 
		  in the decade. In difficult financial times it is hard to predict if 
		  museums will continue to invest in technologies unless they can prove 
		  that the content is important, relevant, and necessary to their audiences. 
		  And the four audiences designated in the above paragraph account for 
		  a tremendous amount of cultural and economic clout. </p>
		<p class="normal">This paper looks beyond our best intentions to actual 
		  outcomes. What does the content we choose to display on the web reveal 
		  about our commitment to certain audiences? How do special audiences 
		  discern the differences between commitment and special-project pandering? 
		  Have we failed audiences by judging our best efforts according to low 
		  standards? Improved content, decreased legal liability, greater audience 
		  reach&#151;these are just a few of the benefits that result when our 
		  web sites are made more accessible. This paper looks at where art museums 
		  are and where they seem to be going, web wise, in terms of a major targeted 
		  audience: children. What are art museums doing to make a difference? 
		  What can they do to make a difference? </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">Targeted Audiences</h2>
		<p class="normal">This paper is an offshoot of a review of important issues 
		  surrounding the existence and development of new media in museums in 
		  the last decade. Presented in Toronto at the annual meeting of the Museum 
		  Computer Network in the Fall of 2002 (Witchey, <i>Whither New Media</i>, 
		  MCN 2002), audience response to the targeted audience section of the 
		  paper&#151;particularly the discussion of children-- caused the most 
		  comment and this paper goes into greater detail on that issue.</p>
		<p class="normal">Audience development&#151;an important topic for museums&#151;if 
		  it weren't there wouldn't be so many sessions on children's education, 
		  distance learning, lifelong learning, interactivity, accessibility, 
		  survey software, newsletters. Everyone talks about special audiences, 
		  but how are museums specifically using their web sites to reach out 
		  to these audiences?</p>
		<p class="normal">The Cleveland Museum of Art began looking at this topic 
		  during a private exercise to benchmark our museum against museums of 
		  similar size, collections and resources as well as a few museums in 
		  our local region. This exercise of looking at our peers has occurred 
		  in stages, as new features were developed for the CMA Web site (www.clevelandart.org). 
		  In the last quarter of 2002 and the beginning of 2003 the benchmarking 
		  group was enlarged slightly and targeted for an informal user review. 
		  Matthew Asti, a student at Oberlin College, help was critical in gathering 
		  data his work is incorporated into this paper.</p>

		  </div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="normal">In terms of regional museums, we looked at the web sites 
		for </p>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class=Section1> The Detroit Institute of Art, Detroit, MI (<a href="http://www.dia.org/" target="_blank">http://www.dia.org</a>)</div>

		<li> the Minneapolis Museum of Art, Minneapolis, MN (<a
href="http://www.artsmia.org/" target="_blank">http://www.artsmia.org</a>), 
		  <div class=Section1>although Minneapolis, because of its size and level 
			of activity in this field really place it in both categories. </div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1>
		<p>It goes without saying that many other museums in the United States 
		  and internationally are doing projects targeting these audiences, but 
		  we had to start somewhere. Colleagues across the country are doing interesting 
		  projects but did not have the right benchmarking characteristics for 
		  this review. </p>
	
		
		<p class="normal">One last caveat&#151;we may well have missed something 
		  on a web site, something wild and wonderful, however if we missed it 
		  and we were consciously looking for it, what are the chances that your 
		  targeted audience will find it? </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">The Good News: Resources for Students K-12, What 
		  Adults See</h2>
		<p class="normal">The good news: there are some excellent K-12 resources 
		  out there. Predictably all of the museums in our group listed activities 
		  for the K-12 audiences on their websites. Most of these listings relate 
		  to programs that occur within the actual physical confines of the museum. 
		  Large museums have a significant number of online activities with our 
		  colleagues at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery 
		  of Art leading the way. The Minneapolis Institute of Art has extensive 
		  online activities and&#151;what's most impressive&#151;some of them 
		  are geared to high school age students and not just the coloring book 
		  set. </p>
		<p class="normal">Cleveland has an online space for children but most 
		  of the activities need to be downloaded and printed and are not interactive 
		  in the more exciting sense. The Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Philadelphia 
		  Museum of Art, and the J. Paul Getty Museum did not dedicate any part 
		  of their web site specifically to children's online activities, but 
		  in some cases, specifically the Getty, these are in the works. In terms 
		  of the Midwest, The Detroit Institute of Art had a few children-related 
		  activities but they were difficult to find. [Everything Between Earth 
		  and Sky: Student Writings About Art, Detroit Institute of Arts, <a href="http://www.dia.org/studentwriting/pages/poems.html" target="_blank">http://www.dia.org/studentwriting/pages/poems.html</a>] 
		  and we could find nothing at all on the Toldeo Museum of Art's site.</p>
		<p class="normal">Art museums have been a little lazy in terms of development. 
		  Run-of-the-mill online items embraced by museums seem to fall into three 
		  categories: coloring books (print out), detail treasure hunts (find 
		  the detail in the larger picture), and concentration games. Though not 
		  entirely static, these online items are primarily web extensions of 
		  techniques museums have embraced for years to engage children. While 
		  momentarily engaging, their long-term educational value is debatable. 
		  The web effectiveness of these devices is surely more dependent on the 
		  content than on the device and, in some cases, on the fact that there 
		  is just not an over-whelming amount of interesting content for kids 
		  on art museum web sites. What is interesting, pales in comparison to 
		  the flashy animations and shallow activities offered by the commercial 
		  sites for kids: <a href="http://www.candystand.com/" target="_blank">www.candystand.com</a>, 
		  <a
href="http://www.shockwave.com/" target="_blank">www.shockwave.com</a>, <a href="http://www.zoogdisney.com/" target="_blank">www.zoogdisney.com</a>, 
		  <a href="http://www.nickolodean.com/" target="_blank">www.nickelodean.com</a>;

		  <a href="http://www.divastars.com/" target="_blank">www.divastars.com</a>; 
		  <a href="http://www.lego.com/" target="_blank">www.lego.com</a>.</p>
		<p class="normal">In general, art museums aren't thinking about children 
		  as a major audience, if we did, we'd have something for them on our 
		  homepage. We apparently don't expect them to arrive and navigate within 
		  our museum site any more than we expect them to get into cars and drive 
		  to our physical facilities. The National Gallery of Art in Washington 
		  D.C. has a graphic link for children on their homepage "NGAkids (See 
		  Figure 1This is the exception rather than the rule for art museums. 
		  In the other sites kids activities were embedded, either in education, 
		  or in another portion of the site, although the Art Institute of Chicago 
		  has a text link at the bottom of their home page "kids and families.").</p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"><img src="witchey.fig1.jpg" width="400" height="418"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption> Figure 1: The National Gallery of Art, Homepage, 
		  <a href="http://www.nga.gov/" target="_blank">http://www.nga.gov/</a></p>
		<p class="normal">The National Gallery's prominent labeling is clearly 
		  a plus for parents, teachers, and students&#151;particularly the latter 
		  who have little patience for wading through wordy or static graphic 
		  pages. To be fair, art museums aren't making their physical front entrances 
		  any more fun either&#151;the difference is, museum's could easily provide 
		  enticing child-friendly portals for their information, or at least a 
		  cheerful graphic on the homepage. </p>
		<p class="normal">When you do click thru to NGA Kids there are a series 
		  of thumbnails of artworks and the activities are all based on the thumbnails 
		  but not listed. The activity a child chooses is determined by their 
		  aesthetic preference rather than a verbal description f what they are 
		  going to get when they click through.</p>

		</p>
		<p class="normal">In addition, all links within NGA activities were pop-up 
		  windows so the activity was not completely interrupted. A particularly 
		  fine activity was organized around their Martin Johnson <i>Heade, Cattleya 
		  Orchid and Three Brazilian Hummingbirds</i>.[http://www.nga.gov/kids/heade/heade1.html] 
		  This exploration leads a young student through active looking and association 
		  exercises, including sound, and ends with a word search that can be&#151;with 
		  difficulty&#151;accomplished online or printed out.</p>
		<p class="normal">As might be expected, the Metropolitan Museum of Art 
		  has several activities directed towards children. Their <u>Timeline 
		  of Art History</u> is well laid, out, sometimes sparse on information, 
		  but with the potential to be scalable. <u>The Timeline </u>also takes 
		  advantage of the idiom of the internet so a visitor can navigate chronologically 
		  or geographically and not just linearly. In terms of diverse content, 
		  the timeline is highly concentrated on European and Asian objects with 
		  rather less attention paid to Africa and Asia. The potential is there 
		  to create an even more outstanding resource than already exists.</p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"><img src="witchey.fig3.jpg" width="400" height="402"></p>

		<p class="normal">The Metropolitan Museum of Art is good at balancing 
		  being interactive with encouraging good looking habits and active viewing 
		  as opposed to passive dispersal of information. An example is the Met's 
		  <u>Carpet Hunt</u>. Click on a detail and you are asked a question that 
		  encourages you too look at it and then leads you to another part of 
		  the picture, thus helping the visitor create a narrative. </p>

		<p class="normal">Many museum sites have generic games that art content 
		  is grafted onto, momentarily interesting perhaps but ultimately pointless 
		  (concentration games frequently fall into this category). </p>
		<p class="normal">The Minneapolis Institute of Arts is clearly the most 
		  innovative, experimental, and ambitious institution in the group we 
		  looked at. "The Playground" which is part of the ArtsConnected project 
		  and is joint project with the Walker Art Center has a wide range of 
		  projects for students of all ages broken up into the categories of "Make 
		  It," "Find It," "Explore It," "Watch and Listen." </p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"><img src="witchey.fig5.jpg" width="400" height="348"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 5: Minneapolis Institute of Arts, "The Playground,"http://www.artsconnected.org/playground/index.shtml].</p>
		<p class="normal">MIA's "KidsWorld" portal to activities for smaller children 
		  features requires some finding. To get to this from the home page you 
		  need to search or know to choose "Interactive Media." Once there though, 
		  children see a kindly alien creature in a small space ship. Children 
		  can choose from the traditional art museum activities for kids: treasure 
		  hunt, concentration, and coloring book. </p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"><img src="witchey.fig6.jpg" width="400" height="236"></p>
		<p class="MsoCaption"> Figure 6: Minneapolis Institute of Arts, "KidsWorld", 
		  <a href="http://www.artsmia.org/kidsworld/" target="_blank">http://www.artsmia.org/kidsworld</a></p>
		<p class="normal">The activity "Fabric Factory" gave a textile twist to 
		  normal online coloring books by allowing children to fill in images 
		  with a pre-set selection of stitches, instead of simply colors.</p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"><img src="witchey.fig7.jpg" width="400" height="301"></p>

		<p class="normal"> Their approach to "Concentration" is, again from a 
		  grown-up's point of view, innovative. In order to reveal the art work 
		  underneath, children must match descriptive statements about the work 
		  they are going to see.</p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"><img src="witchey.fig8.jpg" width="400" height="288"></p>
		<p class="MsoCaption">Figure 8: Minneapolis Institute of Arts, <a href="http://www.artsmia.org/playground/concentration/random.cfm" target="_blank">http://www.artsmia.org/playground/concentration/random.cfm</a></p>
		<p class="normal">Minneapolis, as many of us know, has traditionally been 
		  a leader in this area. Blessed with the talents of the Interactive Media 
		  Group and consistently well-funded, their projects consistently display 
		  careful attention paid to interaction, graphics, and content. </p>
		<p class="normal">Targeted content for children is out there, but you 
		  have to look for it. Art museums, in general, are not willing to compromise 
		  that "stately pleasure palace" home page by littering it with an icon 
		  that would be attractive to younger audiences. Perhaps this is not as 
		  important as it might seem. What all these successful projects do have 
		  going for them is tie-in to curricula&#151;whether general or specific. 
		  As long as an activity is tied to a lesson plan, or a lesson plan can 
		  be built around it&#151;the interpreters (teachers, family, adult friends, 
		  community groups) will find it. But what do the young audiences themselves 
		  think of all this content?</p>

		<p class="normal">In 1560, the Netherlandish artist Pieter Bruegel painted 
		  <i>Childrens Game. </i>A seemingly endless hoard of children swarms 
		  across the large surface of this painting, mimicking the faults, habits, 
		  and quirks of their elders. For Bruegel children represented the human 
		  condition and he was trying to point out to his adult viewers that, 
		  like children, we jump, run, play, and follow our own foolish inclinations. 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">At professional conferences (MW, EVA, MCN, ICHIM, AAM) 
		  we talk the talk about educational programming and projects for children 
		  online, but we don't seem to listen much to children. Because so many 
		  of the projects we create are so much better than anything we had as 
		  children, we think today's children&#151;given a few extra bells and 
		  whistles&#151;ought to be impressed with our efforts. Children are born 
		  critics and we are surprised when they criticize, or worse yet, pay 
		  no attention at all to our best efforts. Furthermore, today's children 
		  are also canny consumers of what the internet offers and they do not 
		  spend much time or effort on activities or sites that bore them.</p>
		<p class="normal">My own son, Nicholas, is 9 years old. When he was four 
		  we took him to Sea World. The big event was, of course, to end up at 
		  the Shamu extravaganza. When we were finally seated and the show had 
		  begun, I noticed that Nicholas was not watching the gigantic aquatic 
		  mammal 20 feet in front of him; he was concentrating on the even more 
		  gigantic screens behind Shamu televising whale's every move in triplicate 
		  behind the real thing. This event has been eating at me for five years 
		  and finally, as I began to think about this research last year, I brought 
		  this event to my son's notice. His 9 year old reply, "What's the big 
		  deal, Mom, one's dots and one's not." That is a wake-up call. Their 
		  reality is not our reality.</p>
		<p class="normal">The vast majority of children are reluctant visitors 
		  to museums and museum web sites. Few children choose, on their own initiative 
		  to visit either a museum or a museum web site. When they come to a physical 
		  museum, they come with interpreters (teachers, parents, guardians, friends, 
		  community groups). Someone has made the decision that it is important 
		  for the child to visit. Web visits have generally the same conditions 
		  behind them&#151;children have been directed to visit or have been given 
		  a topic that ultimately leads them to a museum site. </p>
		<p class="normal">To try to woo this crowd with their own vocabulary is 
		  a recipe for disaster. Art museums, in general, don't have the time, 
		  money, resources, or inclination to do this. It would be foolish of 
		  us to try and fight Disney or the Cartoon Network on their own terms&#151;they 
		  have their demographic targeted, mapped, and dancing to whatever tune-of-the-day 
		  they desire. One of my original goals in writing this paper was to illustrate 
		  to museum professionals exactly where kids are going, and even as I 
		  write this paper, my information on current trends is quickly creeping 
		  out of date. A few examples should suffice:</p>

	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class="normal">With the exception of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, 
		  museums are seldom brave enough or fool hardy enough to try to woo the 
		  teenager. This is as it should be because neither the museum nor the 
		  museum web site is the natural habitat for the typical teenager&#151;except 
		  for the rare few who are headed for careers in the field. They come 
		  into the museum accompanied by adults, primarily on school field trips, 
		  and are set free to explore&#151;sometimes with targeted activities 
		  to provide structure, sometimes not. </p>
		<p class="normal">In school, they are directed to museum web sites to 
		  do research or write papers. They participate in distance learning projects 
		  or in special groups as museum ambassadors. They build content sights 
		  about art and around art but it is neither museum nor web site is a 
		  typical first choice entertainment.<b> </b>The challenge of art museum 
		  programming&#151;web or otherwise&#151;for children and teenagers is 
		  to provide both a relaxed learning experience and a social experience. 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">More than twenty years ago the Brooklyn Museum sent 
		  a questionnaire to 520 teenagers, and interviewed a Peer Advisory Council 
		  of 12 high school students. Despite the age of the survey, and given 
		  that priorities of students may have changed slightly, the results of 
		  the survey are well worth repeating. The teens top three priorities 
		  were: good grades, good jobs, and socializing with friends. Three additional 
		  items also seem warranted for inclusion in the discussion.</p>
	  </div>
	  <blockquote> 
		<div class=Section1> 
		  <p>Data revealed that teens' negative attitudes about museums stemmed 
			from past unhappy experiences with museum staff, coupled with the 
			perception that their ideas would not be taken seriously.</p>
		  <p> Despite their interest in creating personal collections of objects, 
			the students were not able to see museums' collections as sources 
			of wonder and knowledge about human creativity. </p>
		  <p>They thought of museum objects in purely functional terms.</p>
		</div>

	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p><span class="normal">The conclusion: museums are only tangentially 
		  and occasionally relevant to teenagers</span>.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusions</h1>
		<p class="normal">Art museums have ever been aware that children are one 
		  of their most important audiences. So, to return to questions posed 
		  at the beginning of this paper. </p>
		<p class="normal"><b><i>What do art museums want to do?</i></b> Educate 
		  children about art.</p>
		<p class="normal"><b><i>Why do art museums want to do that?</i></b> Because, 
		  the staff at art museums believe that art enriches lives and children 
		  who understand and appreciate art have better lives. </p>
		<p class="normal"><b><i>Can web features targeted at children and teenagers 
		  help us do what we want to do and more or less have always wanted to 
		  do? </i></b>The answer must be a resounding YES. </p>
		<p class="normal">Today's audience&#151;particularly children and teenagers 
		  are used to technology and expect interactivity. They don't want to 
		  be spoon fed information&#151;they want to be spoon fed candy-coated 
		  bits of information from which they can choose the bits they are interested 
		  in and create their own meaning, not have it created for them. This 
		  situation poses two more questions that art museums are struggling with: 
		  <b>Who</b> <b>creates meaning and how do we in art museums interpret 
		  this issue and provide a real venue for education</b>? </p>
		<p class="normal">Art Museums can best serve targeted audiences of children 
		  and get the biggest return on their investment by working with the interpreters 
		  (teachers, parents, guardians, community groups) to provide information 
		  on relevant topics: art, art history, culture, social issues in art, 
		  language. And, when applicable, to gather and disseminate viewpoints 
		  and perspectives in addition to those traditionally put forth by the 
		  museum. An art museum web site is the ideal mechanism for connecting 
		  with children before, during, after, or&#151;when an actual visit is 
		  impossible&#151;in place of the physical visit. To quote Ken Hamma, 
		  once again:</p>
	  </div>
	  <blockquote> 
		<div class=Section1>there is no reason to discriminate against one medium 
		  of interpretation and presentation because it poses new difficulties 
		  (digital delivery and virtual reality) and new opportunities (digital 
		  delivery and virtual reality, again). </div>
	  </blockquote>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class="normal">Art Museums need to expand any opportunities they have 
		  to reach children via the WWW. Right now we need to be active in defining 
		  content, and once the content is defined, we need to be studying every 
		  type of web site targeted at children. Once the content has been defined, 
		  the language and the look of the content needs to be age appropriate 
		  and engaging. We cannot and presumably do not want to compete with Disney 
		  but, at least on the web, we can learn from Disney, Nickelodeon, and 
		  Cartoon Network interactive techniques and design styles which will 
		  make a required trip to a museum web site more enjoyable and less of 
		  chore. Art museums need to be much more proactive in terms of targeting 
		  programs for children on their web sites. This then is not the time 
		  to circle the wagons, but is the time to experiment and expand our reach. 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">The words of Elizabeth Ross Kanter, author <i>of evolve! 
		  Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow</i><b>, </b>will suffice 
		  for a closing admonition to art museum web professionals:</p>
	  </div>
	  <blockquote> 
		<div class=Section1>When the correct direction is hard to discern, action 
		  is better than hesitation. That doesn't mean heedlessly making sweeping 
		  changes, but rather than freezing in the headlights of oncoming change, 
		  you can at least explore, experiment, and perhaps learn what's coming 
		  down the pike...rather than waiting for differing factions to reach 
		  consensus, innovators pressed forward anyway. Leaders must establish 
		  themes, set goals, identify priorities, and assess results. They must 
		  seed new projects and weed out others ... wise leaders embrace the chance 
		  to explore forks in the road. One of them could be the next major highway.</div>
