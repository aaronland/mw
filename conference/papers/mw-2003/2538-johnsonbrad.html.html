	  <p class=PaperTitle>Disintermediation and the Museum Web Experience: Database 
		or Documentary-Which Way Should We Go?</p>
	  <p class=Author>Brad Johnson, Second Story Interactive, USA</p>
	  <p class=URL><a href="http://www.secondstory.com/" target="_blank">http://www.secondstory.com</a></p>
	  <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>
	  <p class="AbstractText">The Web is a communication medium that caters to 
		an individual's every desire. It empowers audiences to get exactly what 
		they want, when they want, and how they want it. It provides a direct 
		connection between buyers and sellers, between information consumers and 
		providers-without traditional intermediaries like brokers, dealers, or 
		agents. Now we help ourselves. </p>
	  <p class=AbstractText>Why should art and artifact be any different? Some 
		Museum Web sites provide austere library-science-like access to information, 
		while others have documentary film-like storytelling qualities. For some 
		curators, the Web is an opportunity to get out of the way and give visitors 
		free access to all that is hidden in their physical museum; for others, 
		they see the multimedia possibilities as a way to enhance their controlled 
		presentations and add on even more interpretive accessories. Some sites 
		provide unmediated direct access to their entire collection, while others 
		provide carefully curated presentations. What do users want? Is the Web 
		a tool for audiences to go beyond the exhibit walls and explore, sort 
		and search collections themselves, or is it an opportunity for richer, 
		more immersive interpretive presentations? </p>
	  <p class=AbstractText>In this talk we will examine a variety of museum-related 
		sites that explore each extreme and all in between-from database-driven 
		sites to rich-media documentary-like approaches-and evaluate what components 
		worked and what didn't. We will look at the relative costs associated 
		with developing either direction, and by analyzing the traffic reports 
		and user feedback from hybrid sites that incorporate each extreme we will 
		explore which components were ultimately more popular, which proved easier 
		to update or maintain, and which cultivated repeat traffic. </p>

	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">While the Web does cater to the culture 
		of individuality, immediacy, and disintermediation, its enhanced multimedia 
		capabilities and rich interpretive potential are still something many 
		visitors crave. Sometimes storytellers open up new doors, and other times 
		they get in the way. Ultimately the most successful Web sites are those 
		that balance both approaches, empowering individuals to control the degree 
		of mediation in their own customized experience.</span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">Before we can assess the relative 
		merit of the mediated Web experience, let's look at where it came from. 
		In its infancy, the Web medium was about providing access to information: 
		through page-based containers cross-linked with hypertext, users could 
		find information, view images, read papers, and conduct research. It was 
		not an entertainment medium, but rather an information retrieval medium 
		for academics, researchers and geeks. Graphical browsers were introduced 
		at the same time the CD-ROM craze was beginning to wane, and soon, displaced 
		multimedia developers were redirecting their talents with interactivity 
		online, in turn relieving Webmaster's of architecting, designing and producing 
		Web sites. The Web began to change.</span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">Information retrieval was not enough. 
		What was going to define the look of the site? How was it going to feel? 
		What sort of stylization or shtick was going to differentiate the information 
		that was being presented? The explosive popularity and craze of the medium 
		was drawing ever more diverse talents, each bringing with them the trajectory 
		of the tradition they left. Print designers brought richer graphical sensibilities. 
		Architects and information designers introduced new dimensions to structure. 
		Web sites now had motifs and metaphor, and became "experiences." </span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">With each revolutionary release of 
		Netscape and Internet Explorer, developers exploited every new functionality 
		they found, making Web sites look less and less like the sort of things 
		they started out as. As sites became ever more enchanting, the medium 
		attracted ever wider pool of creatives, and soon musicians, writers, game 
		designers, filmmakers, and exhibit designers lent their hand in making 
		these experiences more 'immersive,' more cinematic and more narrative. 
		Motif inspired metaphor, which paved the way for <b>story</b>.</span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">With hysterical pop culture rage 
		and seemingly limitless venture capital thrust on the adolescent medium, 
		new technologies, faster computers and fatter connections encouraged developers 
		to keep dreaming and keep pushing the frontier. No longer confined to 
		the page-based information retrieval model the Web was based on, big budgets 
		and broadband dreams inspired and commissioned the sort of stuff investors 
		thought would further popularize the Web experience. </span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">First there was data, and then there 
		was a presentation layer for the data. Over time the presentation layer 
		got a little salt and pepper, then some spice. It became more flavorful, 
		and soon it was a rich thick sauce smothering the data. The user experience 
		has crept from one extreme to the other. From the Webmaster's directory 
		structure full of data, to the documentary filmmaker's online QuickTime 
		narrative, the brief history of the Web has offered users the full spectrum 
		of intermediation. </span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">We have all learned the importance 
		of narrative, and the value storytelling has contributed to the medium. 
		In the real world, some museum goers take the narrated headset tour and 
		don't wander off the path, others browse through galleries randomly, and 
		others head to the research library to find exactly what they are after. 
		How can we accommodate all these experiences simultaneously online? </span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">Whether a Web project begins with 
		an idea in need of assets, or assets in need of an idea, sooner or later 
		assets are amassed. As our studio was concepting the user experience of 
		the Pearl Harbor site for National Geographic, we were simultaneously 
		acquiring hundreds of historical images from the Naval Archives, the National 
		Archives and the Library of Congress. While browsing all the image thumbnails 
		and thinking about how the content would be organized on the site, it 
		struck me what a wonderful experience I was having. I was looking at ALL 
		the original images that we had access to, and the raw, random access 
		to them was empowering. How would the story of Decemer 7, 1941 be told? 
		How would all these assets be held together? As these big folders full 
		of wonderful pictures became organized into hierarchical directories and 
		widdled down to "image selections," I was reminded of the saying documentary 
		filmmakers have that it isn't so much what you put in the film as it is 
		what you don't put in it. </span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">As objective, neutral and unbiased 
		as anyone can hope to be, the editorial decisions they make invariably 
		posit a subjective viewpoint that reflects their worldview, their culture 
		or the age in which they live. Another person, a different group of people 
		or someone in the future would make different selections. A different 
		telling of Pearl Harbor will be more meaningful to a different age, and 
		from the same pool of assets at their disposal, a different perspective 
		will be defined. The assets that were not selected by our team are not 
		part of the final presentation, and the ones that were are now glued together 
		and inextricably bound together in our mediated "story." </span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">If we care about creating interactive 
		projects that can withstand shifts and changes in technology, why wouldn't 
		we care about creating projects that can withstand shifting points of 
		view? Museums and cultural institutions would like to think their efforts 
		will be accessible, viewable and of value to users in the future. Adhering 
		to industry standards and separating data development from technology 
		development goes a long way towards insuring against technological obsolescence. 
		While there are obviously no curatorial or editorial 'industry standards,' 
		there are ways to segregate presentation layers, accommodate different 
		experience types and build extensible properties.</span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">Working on the National Museum of 
		American History's "A More Perfect Union: Japanese Americans and the U.S. 
		Constitution" gave us an opportunity to look at the aftermath of Pearl 
		Harbor from a different perspective. It also gave us the chance to rethink 
		what we were learning from previous projects. Again, we had a story to 
		tell and we started with many assets but this time there were thousands 
		of images to select from. Oral Histories, photographs and artifacts were 
		curated for the story based on themes in the physical exhibition. Unlike 
		Pearl Harbor, the images that were not used were not gone for the story 
		was just one of the presentation layers, not the only presentation layer. 
		Every asset used to tell the story is an invitation to the collection 
		database where all the assets can be found. In essence, the collection 
		section of the site is where all the raw materials can be found, where 
		users can browse or search and access anything they want as they want 
		it. The building blocks of story are organized by the database, not trapped 
		in the narrative. More records can be added to the database over time, 
		and other tellings of the story can come out of it.</span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">"Jasenovac: Holocaust Era in Croatia" 
		for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum works very similarly: there is 
		a collection and a history component. Artifacts from the collection illustrate 
		the story of the holocaust in Croatia, and the story invites exploration 
		in the collection. The artifacts are presented in context with the history, 
		and stripped of context and catalogued. The site offers multiple presentations 
		with varying degrees of intermediation. </span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">Similarly, MoMA's "Artists of Br 
		cke" site provides both a curated thematic track and a user controlled 
		filter or browse mode. In the curated mode, visitors choose between 8 
		themes where 50 comparative groupings are accessed in a linear progression. 
		In the browse mode, users virtually go behind the exhibition walls and 
		filter the artwork according to their own criteria as if they were shuffling 
		slides on a curator's light box. Browsing is enhanced without interference 
		by the fact that users can select different criteria that affects which 
		assets are displayed (show all "woodcuts" by "Nolde" for example).</span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">Let's contrast two very different 
		projects addressing the same subject matter: Egyptian tombs in the Valley 
		of the Kings. In "Unwrapped: the Mysterious World of Mummies" we were 
		after an experiential quality that immersed visitors in the diversity 
		and mystery of the subject through rich-media narratives and exploratory 
		experiences. There are twenty different mummies that are presented in 
		over 40 different linear narrative segments, and one mummy presented in 
		a navigable 3D tomb recreation. These documentary inspired narrative threads 
		are interlinked, promoting user-defined pathways that serve each individual 
		user's curiosity. The 'interactivity' in the site is in the way a user 
		chooses to weave together the passive narratives, and what enhanced peripheral 
		information they select along the way. While the experience of the site 
		makes a powerful impression and can inspire further interest in the subjects 
		presented, there is little reason to revisit the experience. Robust narratives 
		modeled after historical documentaries are inherently more passive, less 
		interesting after one viewing, expensive to update or modify, and are 
		based on mediated, traditional one-directional storytelling models. </span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">By contrast, the Theban Mapping Project 
		provides many different presentation layers for the same content from 
		each end of the mediation spectrum. Where the Mummies site was like a 
		movie that had a few interesting tools within it, the Theban Mapping Project 
		is a tool with a few interesting movies in it. TMP is not itself a mediated 
		experience, but it reflects the understanding that there is value in mediation 
		and offers it as a mode. </span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">Built on the most comprehensive archeological 
		and image databases on the Theban necropolis, the TMP site offers the 
		same data through two main technology/presentation layers. There is a 
		searchable quick-access, ADA compliant HTML presentation and a rich-media 
		Flash presentation, both accessing the same dynamic content. Within the 
		Flash presentation, users can elect to experience the content through 
		65 distinct guided tours in which Dr. Kent Weeks takes users through each 
		and every tomb, one right after the next. Another mode allows users to 
		explore the tombs themselves through interactive axonometric drawings 
		which display images and information in context to the active selections. 
		Another mode gives Egyptologists and advanced enthusiasts access to the 
		database records and measured drawings of each tomb in context. All the 
		pieces of the project are bound together by the database, and the mediated 
		tours are a different dimension of the presentation layer. If you remove 
		the mediation, everything still works. In the Mummies' heavily mediated 
		model, all the components of the experience are held together by the presentation 
		itself: if you remove the mediation, there is nothing.</span></p>
	  <p class="normal"><span class="normal">We have learned that our most successful 
		projects are those that embrace the original purpose of the Web information 
		retrieval balanced with rich media storytelling presentations. All the 
		components of the narrative are independent pieces organized through a 
		database backend so that the stuff of stories is accessible for as many 
		different arrangements as there are perspectives. The next steps of interactive 
		storytelling are exciting. When mediation is not an on or off kind of 
		thing, but is rather adjustable on demand, and when the user can modify 
		it qualitatively by selecting from multiple viewpoints including ones 
		they themselves have assembled and contributed, then we will get a taste 
		for how revolutionary the Web can be.</span></p>
