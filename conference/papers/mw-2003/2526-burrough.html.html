	  <p class=PaperTitle>A Rolling Evaluation Gathers No Moss</p>
			  <p class=Author>Lee Anne Burrough, DuPage Children's Museum; Lorrie 
				Beaumont, Independent Evaluation Consultant; David Schaller and 
				Ethalinda Cannon, Educational Web Adventures, U.S.A.</p>
			  <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>
			  <p class=AbstractText>Continuous, formative evaluation, from inception 
				to completion, with rapid revisions, was key to the successful 
				development of Kids Design Network (KDN) by the DuPage Children's 
				Museum (DCM). Although a thorough evaluation plan was developed 
				at the beginning of the project, it soon became apparent that 
				additional strategies were necessary to insure success. As new 
				issues were identified and planned techniques were found inadequate, 
				new evaluation techniques were developed and implemented. The 
				development of KDN illustrates the importance of flexible, formative 
				evaluation from the inception of a program to its completion.</p>
			  
	  <p class=AbstractText>KDN is an interactive Internet-based learning program 
		for elementary aged students. Using the KDN Web site <a href="http://www.dupagechildrensmuseum.org/kdn" target="_blank">(http://www.dupagechildrensmuseum.org/kdn</a>), 
		students work collaboratively with an engineer (via real-time communication 
		on the KDN Engineer Chatboard), their classmates and teacher to design, 
		build and test a gadget that meets an engineering challenge. Interactive 
		portions of the Web site include a drawing program where students draw 
		a design for their gadget and a whiteboard with chat where children and 
		engineers can mark on the student's design and communicate via text chat.</p>
			  <p class=AbstractText>DCM brought in an evaluation consultant in 
				the very early stages of KDN development. The evaluator became 
				an integral part of development and continuously collaborated 
				with the team. The collaborative nature of the evaluation and 
				the fluidity of the plan ultimately produced a workable, user 
				friendly Web site consistent with the museum's mission.</p>

	  <span class="SubHeader">Introduction </span> 
	  <p class="normal">The Internet's potential for linking students to experts 
		in a field has long been recognized. Many museums and government agencies 
		(including the DuPage Children's Museum) have outreach programs based 
		on a Web site where information is presented by the institution and/or 
		the students, and students and experts communicate via e-mail. Kids Design 
		Network (KDN) takes the important next step and makes this two-way communication 
		<i>live</i>, <i>secure</i>, and <i>integral to the learning process.</i> 
		The DuPage Children's Museum (DCM) conceived KDN as a way to encourage 
		and facilitate the incorporation of design technology, open-ended problem 
		solving, and engineering and computer skills into elementary school classrooms. 
		Basing KDN on the Web extended the Museum's reach well beyond the Chicago 
		area.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Working with young children as DCM does has shown the 
		importance of continuous evaluation of new programs in scenarios as closely 
		approximating actual use as possible. When one combines the unpredictability 
		of children with the wide variety and constantly changing nature of classroom 
		settings and computer technology, flexibility in this continuous evaluation 
		becomes of paramount importance. Continuous, formative evaluation with 
		rapid revisions from inception to completion was key to the successful 
		development of KDN.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The basis for KDN is DCM's Kids Design Engineering (KDE) 
		Learning Lab in which students are challenged to design, build and test 
		an air (balloon) powered vehicle. Now in its seventh year, KDE has been 
		thoroughly tested and is highly successful at teaching elementary students 
		design engineering and problem solving skills. KDE is heavily facilitated 
		by DCM personnel who visit more than 60 classrooms each year, including 
		those in the local school districts where KDE is incorporated into the 
		3<sup>rd</sup> grade curriculum. The plan for KDN was to take the KDE 
		model and substitute an on-line engineer for the DCM facilitators. Using 
		the Internet, students could communicate in real-time with the engineer, 
		asking him/her questions about the design of their projects. Based on 
		this idea, DCM applied for and received KDN pilot funding from the Illinois 
		State Board of Education Center for Scientific Literacy.</p>

	  <p><img src="burrough.fig1.gif" width="400" height="320"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 1: How KDN works. </p>
	  <p class="normal">Students can consult with the on-line engineer at any 
		time during the design and building process. Many teachers have their 
		students talk to the engineer more than once. The real-time communication 
		provides students with usable information as they design and build their 
		gadgets.</p>
	  <p class="normal">.On the KDN Web site (http://www.dupagechildrensmuseum.org/kdn), 
		engineers introduce a challenge and relate it to a real-life engineering 
		challenge they have faced. Table 1 summarizes current challenges. Elementary 
		aged students work collaboratively with an engineer (via real-time communication 
		on the KDN Engineer Chatboard), their classmates and teacher to design 
		a gadget that meets the challenge. Students use KDN's on-line drawing 
		program to draw a design for their gadget. On the KDN Engineer Chatboard, 
		both students and engineer see the design, mark on it, and discuss it 
		via live text chat. Students build their gadget using materials found 
		in their recycle bins, then test and modify it with help from the on-line 
		engineer, teacher and classmates.</p>

	  <p class="SubHeader">Evaluation philosophy of DCM</p>
	  <p class="normal">All programs and exhibits are continuously evaluated at 
		DCM. Revisions are made based on the evaluation, and then are themselves 
		evaluated. No matter how small the project or how tight the budget, evaluation 
		starts at the first brainstorming session and never really ends. In developing 
		both KDN itself and its evaluation plan, we found that we were following 
		the engineering method that KDN is designed to teach: design, build, test, 
		redesign, build, test again, redesign&#8230; . In a project as complex 
		as KDN turned out to be, ongoing evaluation of both macro and micro components 
		was imperative.</p>
	  <p class="normal">This philosophy continues to permeate the development 
		of KDN, and typically includes professionals from many different backgrounds. 
		Groups involved in evaluating KDN included:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li class = 'normal'> In-house members of the KDN team and other DCM employees;</li>
		<li class = 'normal'> An Advisory Board drawn from the community and consisting 
		  of engineers; computer experts; experts in Web-based school-university-partnerships; 
		  and school district administrators, principals, teachers and curriculum 
		  coordinators;</li>
		<li class = 'normal'> 
		  <div class=Section1> Students and teachers using KDN;</div>
		</li>
		<li class = 'normal'> 
		  <div class=Section1> Web designers and programmers contracted to produce 
			the Web site;</div>
		</li>
		<li class = 'normal'> 
		  <div class=Section1> Other professional Web designers;</div>
		</li>
		<li class = 'normal'> 
		  <div class=Section1> An independent, professional evaluator.</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class="normal">The KDN team consisted of the DCM project manager and 
		  experienced KDE facilitators (including engineers, scientists, and former 
		  classroom teachers), the independent evaluator, and the contracted Web 
		  site developer's programmer and project director. This group worked 
		  closely together for 2 years to develop KDN.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">DCM Employees</h2>
		<p class="normal">In-house members of the KDN team included former classroom 
		  teachers, engineers, scientists, and exhibit and program designers. 
		  They were experienced in conducting effective science programming for 
		  elementary children, as well as expert in the development of open-ended 
		  problem-solving activities. Other DCM employees involved included facilitators 
		  of school and museum floor programs, art specialists, exhibit developers, 
		  and DCM management. They provided fresh eyes to review all aspects of 
		  KDN, and were a ready source of Web site testers. Since these people 
		  were not involved in the day-to-day development, they provided a different 
		  perspective on everything from Web site graphics to navigation to teacher 
		  guidance to ensure KDN was consistent with DCM's mission.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Advisory Board</h2>
		<p class="normal">DCM regularly uses community-based advisory boards when 
		  developing new programs and exhibits. KDN's advisory board was especially 
		  important in providing philosophical and practical guidance in the early 
		  stages of development. School officials on the advisory board helped 
		  insure that KDN would be useful to and usable by classroom teachers. 
		  Principals and curriculum coordinators helped pilot test KDN in their 
		  school's classrooms. Computer experts gave advice on available technology. 
		  Experts in school-university-professional partnerships provided information 
		  on existing collaborative networks, how these collaborations worked, 
		  and potential pitfalls KDN might face. Engineers helped provide Challenges 
		  and advice on how to staff the on-line engineer positions. Since engineers 
		  would be using the Web site, their input on the components necessary 
		  for effective communication were invaluable.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Students and Teachers</h2>
		<p class="normal">It is part of the culture of DCM that all programs and 
		  exhibits are pilot tested first in small groups and then in the setting 
		  w successful development. Because teachers are the primary users of 
		  KDN, a strong emphasis was placed on meeting their needs. Our ehere 
		  they will be used. Feedback from the users is absolutely necessary tovaluation 
		  methods needed to identify teacher concerns and ways to alleviate them. 
		  We found that teachers' opinions/reactions to KDN after using it with 
		  children were markedly different from their reactions before using it. 
		  For example, teachers greatly underestimated students' enthusiasm for 
		  talking with the engineer and the value of the building process. We 
		  therefore tested KDN in classrooms and computer labs with entire classes 
		  of children. We held preliminary briefing sessions with teachers, observed 
		  and talked with them while their students were using KDN, and whenever 
		  possible, talked with them afterwards. Ultimately, 40 classroom teachers 
		  participated in the development of KDN. Their input was a critical factor 
		  in development.</p>
		<p class="normal">We knew in advance that elementary teachers have very 
		  little discretionary time and are under constant pressure to demonstrate 
		  that their students perform well on standardized tests. We needed to 
		  ensure that teachers could see the benefits of KDN in achieving educational 
		  goals. We also needed to ensure teachers were given enough information 
		  to feel comfortable using KDN on their own. Many teachers are not accustomed 
		  to using hands-on activities in their classrooms, and many are not adept 
		  at using computers.</p>
		<p class="normal">Pilot testing with children is an absolute necessity 
		  because of their widely varying skill levels, interests, and experiences. 
		  Sometimes our hypotheses were confirmed in the tests, but frequently 
		  we were surprised. Testing with large numbers of children is critical 
		  for a program intended for use in classrooms. Children function differently 
		  in large classroom settings than they do in small groups in or out of 
		  school. Tests in schools also gave important information on Web site 
		  performance on school computers with many children (up to 30) using 
		  the site's interactive features at once. Every part of KDN was extensively 
		  child tested. with over 900 children eventually involved.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Web Site Developers and Programmers</h2>
		<p class="normal">When KDN development began, DCM had no in-house Web 
		  site development expertise. Many potential contractors were considered, 
		  with emphasis on identifying one which could provide interactive, innovative 
		  and engaging programming for children. Educational Web Adventures, LLP 
		  (Eduweb) was chosen. Eduweb worked closely with other members of the 
		  KDN team in developing the evaluation plan as well as the Web site. 
		  In addition to normal extensive preliminary testing of Web site components, 
		  Eduweb's programmer and project director were in the classroom observing 
		  children for the first full-scale test of the KDN. Subsequently, they 
		  frequently served as on-line engineers, getting first hand understanding 
		  of how the Engineer chatboard works. The programmer continues to periodically 
		  monitor engineer chat sessions and trouble-shoot as needed.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Independent Evaluato<span class="SubHeaderSmall">r</span></h2>
		<p class="normal">When given the choice, many museums conduct front-end 
		  and formative evaluation in-house and save their budgets to bring in 
		  an independent evaluator at the summative stage when the project is 
		  complete. DCM brought in an independent evaluator at the very early 
		  stages of KDN development. This designated one person as the focus for 
		  evaluation, and the evaluator became an integral part of the KDN team. 
		  <span style='color:black'>S</span>he helped define the evaluation methods 
		  used, interpreted the data, and provided detailed interim and final 
		  reports needed to satisfy grant requirements. Involvement from the beginning 
		  of the project gave her valuable longitudinal perspective on development. 
		  She offered many suggestions that were implemented as KDN progressed. 
		  Had she been brought in at the conclusion of the project (after the 
		  grant money was spent), DCM would not have been as able to take advantage 
		  of her input.</p>
		<p class="normal">Working with the KDN project manager, the independent 
		  evaluator developed a thorough evaluation plan very early in the KDN 
		  development process. The plan detailed her role in the process, the 
		  activities she would conduct, the data collection methods to be used, 
		  and a topical framework outlining the questions her evaluation would 
		  address.<span style='color:black'> The topical framework was used to 
		  focus and guide the evaluator's observations and conversations with 
		  respondents, but as important new issues emerged, these were often explored 
		  as well.</span></p>
		<p class="normal">The independent evaluator and DCM staff employed a naturalistic 
		  methodology to collect and analyze data (Lincoln and Guba, 1985). <span style='color:black'>Naturalistic 
		  inquiry is particularly useful when seeking to understand real life 
		  settings and the situations and ways in which people experience them. 
		  It begins with a focus of study, and thorough systematic collection 
		  and analysis of the data identifies and reports on issues as they emerge. 
		  Data is collected from a variety of sources. This "triangulation " of 
		  data yields the completest possible description of the setting and program. 
		  Naturalistic inquiry often includes the respondents' own language as 
		  a way of painting a rich, detailed, and meaningful picture of their 
		  experience.</span></p>
		<p class="normal">Ultimately, evaluation became a very collaborative and 
		  continuous effort. Although the independent evaluator was not present 
		  at all tests, she was present for most of the tests where major revisions 
		  to the program were assessed. She was also present at the meetings where 
		  the team took stock of the program's status and charted the course for 
		  the next stage of development and evaluation. The project manager kept 
		  her constantly informed via e-mail and phone. Information and opinions 
		  freely flowed to and from the evaluator, project manager, and Web designers.</p>
		<span class="SubHeader">The Evaluation Process</span> 
		<p class="normal">Although DCM already had an e-mail based math program 
		  on the Web and was experienced in conducting engineering programs for 
		  children, KDN was a venture into uncharted territory. Because there 
		  were so many aspects of the program to evaluate, it was helpful to isolate 
		  components and design evaluation to answer specific questions. Most 
		  components were assessed individually first and then incorporated into 
		  a trial of the whole KDN experience. For example, when the Slowly Moving 
		  Marble Challenge was being developed, DCM employees' children in the 
		  museum on a school holiday were the first to try their hands at designing 
		  and building a pathway to slow down a rolling marble. These children 
		  didn't use the computer; they simply built their pathways. A few months 
		  later, a 3<sup>rd</sup>-grade school class (taught by an KDN Advisory 
		  Board member) took on the marble challenge as part of the total KDN 
		  experience. Web site components were also evaluated in isolation first. 
		  Numerous versions of the Engineer chatboard were tested by the Web designers, 
		  then DCM staff, before children ever encountered them. The first children 
		  to see the chatboard were the project manager's children visiting the 
		  museum. Many iterations later, the first classroom trials of the chatboard 
		  occurred.</p>
		<p class="normal">At the outset, three overriding questions were identified. 
		  Evaluation would be geared toward answering these questions:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ol>
		<li class = 'normal'>Is KDN technologically feasible?</li>

		<li class = 'normal'> What, exactly, should the content of the Web site 
		  be?</li>
	  </ol>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class="normal">These questions and how we answered them are discussed

		<p class=MsoCaption>Table 2: Evaluation methods used during KDN development.</p>
		<h4 class="SubHeader">Is KDN technologically feasible?</h4>
		<p class="normal">The first question to be answered was whether live two-way 
		  communication was even technically possible <i>in the school setting</i>. 
		  Three primary concerns were quickly identified:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ol>
		<li class = 'normal'> The cognitive development of young children and 
		  their resultant ability to communicate would be key factors in determining 
		  the appropriate age to use KDN. KDN was initially aimed at children 
		  in 1<sup>st</sup> through 5<sup>th</sup> grades. The younger children 
		  in particular typically have poor typing skills, and have trouble communicating 
		  with someone not in the same room with them. The appropriate age for 
		  children to use KDN became one of the most significant questions to 
		  be answered. </li>
		<li class = 'normal'> Elementary schools typically do not have the latest 
		  in computer technology. It is not uncommon for computers to be more 
		  than 5 years old. Would KDN work on Windows 95 and Internet Explorer 
		  3.5? At the time of development, many schools didn't have Flash technology. 
		  What could be used to make the Web site look appealing to kids and teachers? 
		  A key obstacle was firewalls in schools that block the streaming data 
		  necessary for the two-way communication at the heart of KDN. Would it 
		  be possible to tunnel through the firewalls, or would KDN use be restricted 
		  to school districts without them?</li>
		<li class = 'normal'> If the first two issues could be resolved, the safety 
		  of the children and consequent security of the communication became 
		  major issues. The Museum and KDN users needed assurance that children 
		  would be protected from inappropriate communications and unauthorized 
		  users. </li>
	  </ol>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">Would kids and teachers be interested in talking 
		  to the engineer?</h4>
		<p class="normal">Assuming the technology issues were worked out, we still 
		  needed to know if students and teachers would find talking to the engineer 
		  on-line worth their time and effort. &quot;Ask the expert&quot; Web 
		  sites other than KDN are based on e-mail communication where children 
		  have plenty of time to formulate questions which are reviewed by teachers 
		  or parents who correct grammar and edit to ensure clarity. Would children 
		  be able to communicate well enough to gain usable advice about their 
		  gadgets? Finding out if students thought talking to the engineer helped 
		  them meet the challenge was a major focus of the first two field studies 
		  and a lesser focus in following studies.</p>
		<p class="normal">Because children's access to KDN, and especially the 
		  engineer, depended on the cooperation of teachers and parents, the grownups' 
		  perception of the value of talking to the engineer was important to 
		  assess. Would teachers see enough value that they would be willing to 
		  negotiate the potential maze of scheduling computer time and learning 
		  to use the Web site?</p>
		<h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">What, exactly, should the content of the Web 
		  site be?</h4>
		<p class="normal">The initial Web site concept included the challenge 
		  presented in short story format, a printable student journal, a student-engineer 
		  chatboard with only text chat, and an on-line bulletin board where pictures 
		  of gadgets could be posted. The inadequacy of these features became 
		  apparent very early in development. Identifying what was necessary for 
		  effective student-engineer communication was a focus early in the project. 
		  Programming and testing the solutions ultimately took a year longer 
		  and $70,000 more than was originally planned.</p>
		<span class="SubHeader">Phase 1: Field Studies </span> 
		<p class="normal">Evaluation techniques originally planned (based on the 
		  actual grant application)were:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class = 'normal'> 
		  <div class=Section1> Review of materials by DCM staff;</div>
		</li>
		<li class = 'normal'> 
		  <div class=Section1> Pilot tests (field studies) with small groups of 
			students in schools the first year;</div>

		</li>
		<li class = 'normal'> 
		  <div class=Section1> In-depth case studies of selected students;</div>
		</li>
		<li class = 'normal'> 
		  <div class=Section1> Collection and evaluation of student materials, 
			including journals, drawings, and video, to asses changes in the students' 
			creative problem solving skills, ability to transfer knowledge to 
			new situations, and ability to work as teams;</div>
		</li>
		<li class = 'normal'> 
		  <div class=Section1> Presentation of ongoing evaluation results to the 
			Advisory Board and consultation with the members.</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class="normal">During the first year of the project, two small field 
		  studies were conducted at schools with which DCM had a strong relationship. 
		  The purpose was to assess students' reaction to the concept of an on-line 
		  engineer, the necessary components for effective communication, the 
		  appropriate age for KDN, and the appropriateness of the first challenge. 
		  Teachers chose a few students to participate in KDN. The museum brought 
		  in their own computers and set up a closed link between the engineer's 
		  computer and students' computer. Communication was via a FileMakerPro<b> 
		  </b>database made to resemble a Web page with two-way text chat in the 
		  first field study. The second study utilized a CU-SeeMe program to provide 
		  video chat with an engineer via a local area network.</p>
		<p class="normal">Much was learned about evaluation during these studies. 
		  Written surveys, so frequently used in evaluation, yielded minimal valuable 
		  information. Parents and teachers did not take time to record the detailed 
		  observations that are needed for comprehensive assessment. The value 
		  was also limited because the people completing the surveys (parents 
		  and teachers) were not present when children were working with KDN. 
		  Direct observation of students and conversations with them yielded the 
		  most information. Student journals were collected and an extensive 
		  video record of the sessions was made. Video and journals proved less 
		  valuable for evaluation purposes, but very valuable for bringing a new 
		  project manager up to speed a few months later.</p>
		<p class="normal">A third small group trial aimed predominantly at testing 
		  a new challenge was held at the museum. No engineer was involved in 
		  this trial. A Girl Scout leader was asked to gather a group of students 
		  for this test. Children were asked to read two versions of the Puppet 
		  Challenge aimed at different age groups. The children were asked questions 
		  to see if they understood the story and its vocabulary, and if they 
		  found it interesting. The team wanted to assess the story format, the 
		  particular versions of this story, whether the challenge provided an 
		  appropriately open-ended engineering problem solving experience, and 
		  to revisit the question of the appropriate age for doing KDN. The session 
		  was videotaped and the children's journals were collected. The independent 
		  evaluator was not present. Once again, personal conversations with 
		  and observations of the children provided the most useful data.</p>
		<p class="normal">These very preliminary field studies answered some basic 
		  questions and posed new ones: </p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class = 'normal'> 
		  <div class=Section1> Kids liked talking to the engineer. They found 
			the conversation helpful.</div>
		</li>
		<li class = 'normal'> 
		  <div class=Section1> Kids in 1<sup>st</sup>and 2<sup>nd</sup> grade 
			lacked the skills necessary to communicate solely through typing. 
			Third graders were marginal. The search for a visual and possible 
			audio component to communication was on.</div>
		</li>
		<li class = 'normal'> 
		  <div class=Section1> It was going to take some fancy programming to 
			pull this off on the Web.</div>
		</li>
		<li class = 'normal'> 
		  <div class=Section1> The way the challenge was presented needed work 
			in order to make it clear and understandable. At that time, challenges 
			were presented in a short story format involving a girl and boy and 
			their teacher, Ms. Curious.</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class="normal">Results of the field studies were presented to the Advisory 
		  Board. They felt that the potential impact of KDN on science and engineering 
		  education was huge, and that there were still a lot of questions to 
		  be answered. Extensive discussions occurred about the best form of 
		  communication best (email, video, live text chat, voice, fax, or phone), 
		  the focus of KDN (science, computers, or engineering), and the importance 
		  of addressing teachers' needs.</p>
		<p class="normal">A big meeting was held that included the newly hired 
		  Web site designers (Eduweb), the independent evaluator, the old and 
		  new project managers, and most of the DCM staff who had worked on KDN 
		  to date. A free flowing exchange of ideas made sure everyone was on 
		  the same page regarding where the project had been and what needed to 
		  happen in the near future. Eduweb presented information of the most 
		  appropriate technology available. An understanding of two overarching 
		  types of problems emerged from the meeting: technology problems and 
		  people problems.</p>
		<p class="normal">Eduweb focused on finding technology that could provide 
		  the best communication, could tunnel through school firewalls, and was 
		  compatible with the typical aging computer systems common in elementary 
		  schools. Making the site user-friendly - in both graphic design and 
		  navigation - and compatible with school computers also became a focus. 
		  DCM would review everything and try out all interactive components of 
		  the site.</p>
		<p class="normal">DCM focused on the people problems. Most of the team 
		  had already concluded that 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> graders 
		  were too young to use KDN effectively. However, the Museum felt that 
		  additional data was needed to support this conclusion for the Illinois 
		  State Board of Education (the funder). It was important to make the 
		  teacher, parent and child user interested in and comfortable with KDN. 
		  This would be addressed through both the content of the Web site, and 
		  Eduweb's work on the graphic design and navigation. Finding and training 
		  on-line engineers continued to be of concern. DCM was also responsible 
		  for coordinating with schools which had volunteered to participate in 
		  the second round of field studies.</p>
		<p class="normal">Over the next few months the first version of the KDN 
		  Web site was developed in preparation for the 1<sup>st</sup>full-fledged 
		  classroom tests. During this period, the DCM project manager served 
		  as the internal evaluator. Eduweb posted pages on the Web for the project 
		  manager to review. She typically reviewed the first few iterations 
		  of a Web page or design element, and then asked for opinions from other 
		  DCM staff. Preliminary assessment of firewall tunneling technology 
		  was tested on a few local school computers before being incorporated 
		  into the site. Any DCM staff children visiting the museum were pressed 
		  into service as voluntary evaluators. They tried out the functionality 
		  of the Engineer chatboard and drawing program, critiqued the graphics, 
		  and were usually the first to try their hands at a new challenge.</p>
		<p class="normal">Because the site was to be accessed by entire classes 
		  of children at once, DCM staff participated in group tests of the drawing 
		  program and the Engineer chatboard. We found again and again that even 
		  if it works on the programmer's computer and even the project manager's 
		  computer, that does not mean that 10 or 20 or 30 computers could draw 
		  or use the chatboard at once. The programmer would access error logs 
		  and make adjustments, and we'd try again another day.</p>
		<p class="SubHeader">Phase 2: Classroom Tests</p>
		<p class="normal">Scheduling classroom tests proved to be complicated; 
		  school calendars and schedules are generally very rigid. An extraordinary 
		  amount of accommodation was necessary on the part of the school. The 
		  whole school was often affected because computer lab time and frequently 
		  library time were adjusted so that the classes using KDN had access 
		  to the computers.</p>
		<p class="SubHeaderSmall">What we did right in these trials</p>
		<p class="normal">Administrators at the participating schools were on 
		  the KDN Advisory board, so they were familiar with the concept behind 
		  KDN. These schools and administrators had, for the most part, been 
		  selected because DCM conducted many programs there and had a good relationship 
		  with the teachers and administrators.</p>
		<p class="normal">Students from 1<sup>st</sup> through 4<sup>th</sup> 
		  grade were involved in this phase of testing, allowing collection of 
		  data on the age issue. Also important were the responses of teachers 
		  and students of different ages to the challenges and their presentation, 
		  the KDN student journals, and students' desire, ability, and willingness 
		  to talk to the engineer.</p>
		<p class="normal">To address 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> graders' 
		  communication difficulties, a drawing program and whiteboard with chat 
		  component (Engineer chatboard) had been added to the site to provide 
		  a visual component. Children and engineers could both see the child's 
		  design and mark on it. Cell phones were used with and without the whiteboard 
		  to talk to the engineer as the children were building.</p>
		<p class="normal">Three very different schools were chosen: a suburban 
		  school in a middleclass neighborhood (School 1), a rural, smalltown 
		  school (School 2), and a suburban school with a large Spanish-speaking 
		  population in a low income neighborhood (School 3).</p>
		<p class="normal">DCM provided a Spanish-speaking facilitator for the 
		  bilingual classes at School 3. This allowed us to ensure students understood 
		  KDN as well as allowing DCM to receive feedback from the students.</p>
		<p class="normal">Although facilitation was by experienced DCM personnel, 
		  classroom teachers were present for all KDN sessions and actively participated 
		  in the KDN experience. DCM and the independent evaluator chatted with 
		  teachers before and during KDN sessions to find out what teachers wanted 
		  and needed before using KDN. Informal conversations allowed us to see 
		  how revolutionary open-ended, child-centered problem solving is to some 
		  teachers and what type of background information on the philosophy behind 
		  KDN would be needed on the Web site. For example, one 2<sup>nd</sup> 
		  grader making a bell puppet asked a DCM facilitator for help early in 
		  the process, and was later helped by her teacher. At the end of the 
		  session, the DCM facilitator asked her how her bell turned out. The 
		  girl said, &quot;It's not a bell anymore. My teacher changed it.&quot; 
		  It was clear the Web site needed specific guidance on how teachers could 
		  help <i>children</i> solve their problems instead of taking over their 
		  project.</p>
		<p class="normal">Eduweb's project manager and the computer programmer 
		  were present at the first school where testing occurred. Although both 
		  are experienced specialists in children's Web sites, they agreed there 
		  was no substitute for seeing children actually trying to use the site 
		  <i>en masse</i> in the school. It gave them a new appreciation for 
		  the state of technology in the elementary school, and of the problems 
		  of Web site functionality with young children.</p>
		<p class="normal">Eduweb's computer programmer and project manager both 
		  played the role of engineer several times during this phase of testing. 
		  This gave them first hand knowledge of the difficulties of using the 
		  engineer's communication tools. The programmer reported that this experience 
		  was extremely valuable. For example, being limited to only the student 
		  whiteboard chat for communication, the engineer didn't know what was 
		  happening in the classroom during a long period of inactivity. Had 
		  the students all left for lunch? The solution was to add a separate 
		  chat component enabling a private channel of communication with the 
		  teacher.</p>
		<p class="normal">Major revisions to the drawing program and the Engineer 
		  chatboard were made after each school participated.</p>
		<p class="normal">The independent evaluator was present for most of the 
		  session at all three schools. She carefully observed all aspects of 
		  the sessions, chatted with students and teachers during the sessions, 
		  and asked follow-up questions at the end. For those sessions not attended, 
		  the project manager provided detailed notes and comments. Following 
		  the evaluator's model, the project manager asked students and teachers 
		  follow-up questions at the end of their KDN experience.</p>
		<p class="normal">After School 1 tests, the team completely revised the 
		  challenge format to make it clearer. After in-house evaluation at DCM, 
		  the new format was tested at School 2, revised slightly based on teacher 
		  comments, and tested again at School 3. This format is still used today.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">What we did wrong in these trials</h2>
		<p class="normal">The schools had been chosen because their administrators 
		  were on the KDN Advisory Board, but without regard for the state of 
		  their computer systems. A few weeks before the first tests, we found 
		  out School 1 had very old computers that simply could not handle even 
		  the most basic aspects of the KDN site. Eventually, the district computer 
		  expert borrowed a portable iBook lab from the junior high and set it 
		  up at the elementary school for the KDN tests. Consequently, the children 
		  were learning to use a new computer and the KDN Web site at the same 
		  time.</p>
		<p class="normal">Because the administrators, rather than the teachers, 
		  had made the decision to participate in KDN development, many teachers 
		  were less than enthusiastic. Many, but not all, were not adept at computer 
		  use and did not see the value of hands-on activities. However, one 
		  bilingual teacher at School 3 enthusiastically reported that KDN had 
		  sparked a whole class discussion on how &quot;this concept of keep trying 
		  until you get it right&quot; applies to the rest of life, too. He said 
		  that the open-ended problem solving of KDN helps teachers see a new 
		  way of doing things, too.</p>
		<p class="normal">School 3 had no computer lab at all until two months 
		  before the KDN trial. Most of these children had no home computers 
		  and consequently very little computer expertise. This group of students, 
		  however, proved to be very excited about KDN and vividly illustrated 
		  the potential impact of KDN on traditionally underserved populations. 
		  The students thrived when building their gadgets because there was no 
		  language issue with the hands-on activity. The students easily learned 
		  to use the Web site's interactive features. They were thrilled to talk 
		  to the engineer, and the girls especially were excited to learn that 
		  the engineer was a woman. However, many of their teachers struggled 
		  with the computer. These teachers, many of whom had never used computers 
		  in their classrooms, illustrated the importance of thorough, clear guidance 
		  in using KDN and user-friendly navigation.</p>
		<p class="normal">Because of individual school scheduling constraints, 
		  the first trials were with 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> graders, 
		  the group we expected to have the most trouble with KDN in general. 
		  A more refined version of the Web site would have given us a truer picture 
		  of the children's abilities without the complications of computer bugs. 
		  However, the tests still demonstrated conclusively that these young 
		  children were not developmentally ready for KDN.</p>
		<p class="normal">Follow-up questionnaires were given to the teachers. 
		  Due to the poor return rate on written teacher questionnaires, the evaluator 
		  scheduled group de-briefing sessions. This was a more efficient use 
		  of teachers' time, and the group dynamic yielded more useful information. 
		  For example, a teacher would raise an issue, and several others would 
		  agree. This helped us see which issues resonated most with teachers. 
		  These discussions provided valuable, specific data that was used by 
		  the project manager and programmers to make major changes to the Web 
		  site and program content.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Web Site Usability Tests</h2>
		<p class="normal">After the classroom tests at the third school, the KDN 
		  team met and concluded we basically had a workable Website, albeit still 
		  with many bugs. A primary concern was that the site had become so big 
		  that navigation was a mess. The home page was overloaded with information, 
		  and there was a general lack of user-friendliness to the site, largely 
		  due to its complexity. Because the team was so accustomed to using 
		  the site, a new pair of eyes was needed for assessment. Two new evaluation 
		  strategies were adopted: teacher usability studies and review by independent 
		  Web site developers.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Teacher Usability Studies</h2>
		<p class="normal">To identify gaps in information and get teachers' perspectives, 
		  two elementary classroom teachers were brought in to look at the Web 
		  site in two usability studies. We gave the teachers very little orientation 
		  to the site because we wanted to observe them the first time they saw 
		  the Web site. Using a &quot;think-aloud&quot; protocol, the evaluator, 
		  project manager and Web developer took careful notes as each teacher 
		  navigated the site while talking aloud. This gave us specific information 
		  on where navigation and information needed revising. Following their 
		  time exploring the site, we held debriefing sessions during which teachers 
		  explained and expanded upon some of their comments. These usability 
		  studies were among the most useful techniques used in the entire evaluation.</p>
		<p class="normal">After the first teacher reviewed the site, major revisions 
		  were made. Then a second teacher was observed using the same &quot;think-aloud&quot; 
		  protocol. After a morning of learning about the site, we observed 
		  as the teacher directed six children, who were unfamiliar with KDN, 
		  in using the site, including the drawing program and talking to the 
		  engineer. As the focus of this exercise was on the Web site itself, 
		  the children did not construct their gadgets. One of the most striking 
		  observations was that, prior to observing the children, the teacher 
		  did not think they would be interested in talking to the engineer. 
		  She stated she was very surprised to see how enthusiastic they were 
		  when talking to the engineer, and this changed her opinion of KDN considerably.</p>
		<p class="normal">Both teachers pointed up a paradox the KDN team had 
		  long been wrestling with: they thought there was too much information 
		  on the site, but they wanted more information. The KDN team discussed 
		  this problem and concluded the solution must lie in presenting the information 
		  in a more eye-appealing way. Once we had a good idea what teachers 
		  needed on the site, we needed an uninitiated Web designer's opinion 
		  on how to give it to them.</p>
		<p class="SubHeaderSmall">Independent Web site Developer Reviews</p>
		<p class="normal">After extensive revisions based on the teacher usability 
		  studies, two Web site developers unfamiliar with KDN were asked to review 
		  the site. We were particularly interested in their ideas on the overall 
		  look and feel of the site - especially graphic design and navigation. 
		  Although there were some common themes in the reviewers' comments - 
		  especially the need to simplify the navigation and put less information 
		  on each page - the reviewers came up with significantly different solutions 
		  to these problems. The KDN team evaluated the reviewers' comments and 
		  used them as a starting point for major revisions to the site navigation, 
		  page layout, and site organization.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Analysis and Redesign</h2>
		<p class="normal">Much discussion occurred between Eduweb and DCM, and 
		  many prototypes were reviewed before a basic design evolved. We were, 
		  in effect, reinventing the wheel with four new visions on how to go 
		  about it - DCM's, Eduweb's, and the two reviewers'. Text on every page 
		  was revised, a new graphics shell was developed, site content was reorganized 
		  and an entirely new navigation scheme developed, colors were constantly 
		  changed, a new log-in sequence was developed, and major revisions - 
		  both functional and cosmetic - to the drawing program and engineer chatboard 
		  were implemented. Revising the KDN home page was a major effort. The 
		  home page used in Phase 2 classroom trials is shown in Figure 2, and 
		  the current home page is shown in Figure 3. There were at least a dozen 
		  interim versions. The resulting current version of the site bears little 
		  resemblance to the reviewers' suggestions or the version they reviewed, 
		  but based on feedback from teachers who have since used the site, most 
		  of the problems have been resolved.</p>

		<p class="MsoCaption"><b><i>Figure 3: The current KDN home page (<a href="http://www.dupagechildrensmuseum.org/" target="_blank">http://www.dupagechildrensmuseum.org</a></i></b>).</p>
		<p class="normal">The solution to too much information was the creation 
		  of a KDN &quot;Quick Tour&quot; that takes visitors through a virtual 
		  tour explaining how KDN works; and a &quot;What is KDN?&quot; section 
		  providing additional details.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">Phase 3 Classroom Trials</h2>
		<p class="normal">The plan for Phase 3 Classroom Trials was for classroom 
		  teachers to facilitate KDN with only e-mail and phone support from DCM. 
		  Two teachers, one in a small town near Chicago and one in an inner city 
		  Chicago school, found KDN on the Web on their own. They provided the 
		  first real test of the extensive information in the Teacher's Guide 
		  section of the Web site, and the newly revised Web site. The schools' 
		  proximity to DCM allowed the KDN Project Manager and, in one case, the 
		  independent evaluator to visit the schools and observe as students built 
		  their gadgets and talked to the engineer. The evaluator and project 
		  manager conducted an extensive interview with the teachers. Their feedback 
		  was used to further refine the Web site.</p>
		<p class="normal">We were relieved to see that these children's experience 
		  was remarkably similar to KDN activities facilitated by DCM staff. The 
		  teachers were able to glean the philosophy behind KDN from the Website, 
		  navigate the site, and use its information to produce a hands-on, minds-on 
		  learning activity for their classes. Each teacher had added an individual 
		  twist to the challenge to emphasize different concepts, but the child-centered, 
		  creativity and problem solving concepts were paramount. The teachers 
		  had successfully used KDN exactly as was intended.</p>
		<p class="normal">However, there were still problems with the engineer 
		  chatboard, most notably stemming from a modification that allowed the 
		  engineer to simultaneously chat with several students. Ultimately, 
		  this feature was disabled because it did not function reliably.</p>
		<p class="SubHeader">Conclusion</p>
		<p class="normal">Although the basic concept behind KDN has remained constant, 
		  KDN as originally envisioned by DCM was very different from today's 
		  version. From the early stages of development, the team placed emphasis 
		  on continuous evaluation and a willingness to make revisions. The collaboration 
		  in evaluation between professional evaluator, Web site developers, museum 
		  personnel and engineers resulted in a fluid development process that 
		  mimicked the engineering problem solving process KDN is designed to 
		  teach. This iterative nature of engineering design as applied to KDN 
		  development ultimately produced a user-friendly experience consistent 
		  with the Museum's mission. Our efforts were rewarded with a Gold Muse 
		  for Programs Emphasizing Two-way Communication from our peers at the 
		  American Association of Museums. However, the best rewards come from 
		  the children who say &quot;WOW! This is so cool! I wanna be an engineer 
		  when I grow up!&quot;</p>
