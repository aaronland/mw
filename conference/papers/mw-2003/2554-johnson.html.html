		<p class=PaperTitle>Integrating Databases with Maps: the Delivery of Cultural 
		  Data through TimeMap</p>
		<p class=Author>Ian Johnson, University of Sydney Australia</p>
		<p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>
		<p class=AbstractText>TimeMap is a unique integration of database management, 
		  metadata and interactive maps, designed to contextualise and deliver 
		  cultural data through maps. TimeMap extends conventional maps with the 
		  time dimension, creating and animating maps on-the-fly; delivers them 
		  as a kiosk application or embedded in Web pages; links flexibly to detailed 
		  content in Web pages and databases; connects to a wide variety of data 
		  sources, including textual databases and scanned historical maps, situated 
		  anywhere on the Internet; and allows locational data to be captured 
		  in a Web browser.This paper presents an overview of TimeMap, focusing 
		  on the flexible data model and metadata-based methodology which allow 
		  TimeMap to integrate seamlessly with existing databases and fulfil a 
		  wide range of application needs from museum kiosk to digital cultural 
		  atlas. Example applications include the Sydney TimeMap museum kiosk, 
		  MacquarieNet on-line encyclopaedia, Fairfield multicultural tourism 
		  Web site, UNESCO World Heritage Sites database, and a map animation 
		  of the Khmer Empire.</p>
		<p class=AbstractText>The paper also addresses some of the issues in handling 
		  complex datasets effectively on low bandwidth connections, and shows 
		  how TimeMap has addressed these through on-demand data loading, server-side 
		  filtering, dynamic map legends and dynamically constructed hotlinks.</p>
		<p class=keywords>Keywords: Time; GIS; Web mapping; Database integration; 
		  Java applets; e-Publishing; Animation.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
		<p class=normal>This paper is about the integration of maps and databases, 
		  and the use of maps as a front end to rich cultural information. While 
		  static maps &#151; and, to a lesser degree, purpose-built animated maps 
		  and interactive multimedia with fixed content &#151; are commonplace 
		  in museums and on the Web, the use of interactive maps built on-demand 
		  from content-rich databases and the incorporation of time as an essential 
		  element of historical maps are altogether less common. This paper will 
		  briefly review the strengths of interactive time-enabled maps and obstacles 
		  to their wider use, and outline the methods developed by the University 
		  of Sydney TimeMap Project (<a href="http://www.timemap.net/" target="_blank">www.timemap.net</a>).</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Why Maps, Why Databases?</h1>
		<p class=normal>Few people would deny the utility of maps as a means of 
		  contextualising cultural data, and fewer still would deny the utility 
		  of databases in keeping track of the vast amounts of information we 
		  all collect. Yet maps and databases are rarely integrated outside the 
		  Geographic Information System (GIS) community.</p>
		<p class=normal>While the maps we see in museums, in print, on TV and 
		  on the Web are increasingly constructed using GIS &#151; the integration 
		  of databases, maps and spatial analysis &#151; they are most often presented 
		  as static images (animated weather charts being a notable exception). 
		  Web-based mapping is becoming common for geographic and environmental 
		  data, but has been relatively little exploited for cultural and historical 
		  data. On-line databases are commonplace, but most searches are still 
		  text-based, and results are generally displayed as lists even if leavened 
		  with images or multimedia.</p>
		<p class=normal>Yet maps not only provide an effective means of delivering 
		  cultural data (Johnson 2002:1), but also provide a means of displaying 
		  lists of resources<a href="#_edn1"
name="_ednref1" title=""> 
		  <![if !supportFootnotes]>
		  [i] 
		  <![endif]>
		  </a> in a more engaging, coherent and comprehensible fashion, and an 
		  unambiguous method of searching for relevant information. As physical 
		  beings we routinely use mental and physical maps &#151;whether going 
		  on holiday to an unfamiliar place or simply fetching a spoon from the 
		  kitchen drawer &#151; to understand our surroundings and to find things 
		  of relevance to our needs or interests. In <i>On the Internet</i>,<i> 
		  </i>Dreyfus (2001:21) observes, &#8220;Our embodied concerns so pervade 
		  our world that we don't notice the way our body enables us to make sense 
		  of it&#8221;. Egenhofer points out the weakness of textual searches 
		  as providing &#8220;no support for any deeper structures that &#8230; 
		  people typically use to reason&#8221; (2002:1). Time and place are fundamental 
		  to our understanding of the world, the items it contains, the way things 
		  came about, our immediate concerns, and our future trajectories.</p>
		<p class=normal>Maps provide an interface which is more consistently understood, 
		  less ambiguous, more portable across cultures and more grounded in our 
		  experience than classification, search terms and ordered lists. The 
		  latter aim to simplify the complexity of the real world, but they are 
		  only useful to a constrained social and cultural group. On the other 
		  hand, we need only to be able to implement definitions of latitude and 
		  longitude &#151; scarcely an issue today &#151; to bring all spatially-located 
		  information into a common framework and to agree on a spatial search. 
		  While methods of representation, such as projection, symbology and choice 
		  of data, may substantially condition the message transmitted (see Monmonier 
		  1996: 94-107 on the use of maps for propaganda), maps also provide a 
		  rich and concise means of delivering large volumes of information from 
		  a database back-end.</p>
		<p class=normal><span class="normal">By building explicit programmatic 
		  methods for map construction on top of a database, rather than hand-crafting 
		  a multimedia resource from a fixed set of content, one has the flexibility 
		  to expand, enhance, redesign or even repurpose the package without starting 
		  again from scratch. Our aim with TimeMap has been to develop generalisable 
		  methods rather than specific solutions, so that a wide variety of interactive 
		  map-based kiosks and Web sites delivering historical data in spatial 
		  and temporal context can be developed with little or no programming.</span></p>
		<h1 class="SubHeaderSmall">What is a Time-Enabled Map?</h1>
		<p class=normal>There are a number of conventional mapping methods for 
		  representing change through time which can be seen in historical atlases 
		  such as the <i>Concise Atlas of World </i>History (O'Brien 2002) or 
		  the<i> Atlas of World Archaeology </i>(Bahn 2000): period maps, time 
		  symbolisation, change maps and annotation. These methods are static 
		  and have problems displaying very complex or detailed overlapping information, 
		  particularly where features undergo many small changes or change continuously 
		  through time (administrative boundaries and the extent of empires are 
		  examples of such temporally and spatially complex objects).</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeaderSmall">Date Stamping and Filtering</h1>
		<p class=normal>Computers allow us to generate maps on demand so that 
		  we can set a time range and more-or-less instantly see what falls within 
		  that range. TimeMap implements this method of time-enabled map display 
		  through a time selection bar (Figure 1) and filtering of the source 
		  data to display only those features which fall within the time range 
		  selected<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2"
title=""> 
		  <![if !supportFootnotes]>
		  [ii] 
		  <![endif]>
		  </a>. TimeMap will also step through a sequence of time ranges to display 
		  through-time changes on the map interface or to generate an animation 
		  file which can be played separately or embedded in a Web page. </p>
		<p class=normal align="center"><a name="fig1"></a><a href="johnson.fig1.html"><img src="johnson.fig5.gif" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 1: Time Selection Bar </p>
		<p class=normal>Many datasets can be handled with simple date stamping 
		  along these lines, and such date stamping is often already available 
		  within databases of historical information as start/end dates, a simple 
		  median date or an event date. Simple date stamp filtering works well 
		  for items which occur at a specific time identified by a date or date 
		  range (such as historical photographs), or exist unmodified over a period 
		  of time (such as particular administrative boundary configurations), 
		  but is less effective for items which change continuously during their 
		  period of existence (such as empires or cultural areas).</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeaderSmall">Snapshots and Interpolation</h1>
		<p class=normal align="left">In practice, our knowledge of historical 
		  data tends to be episodic and partial, so that we know the position, 
		  extent or attributes of a map feature &#151; a &#8220;snapshot&#8221; 
		  of the feature &#151; at various (arbitrary) times, but do not have 
		  specific information on what happens in between<a href="#_edn3"
name="_ednref3" title=""> 
		  <![if !supportFootnotes]>
		  [iii] 
		  <![endif]>
		  </a>. We can make some estimate of intermediate conditions through interpolation 
		  of extents or attributes between the available snapshots (Figure 2).</p>
		<p class=normal align="center">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class=normal align="center"><a name="fig2"></a><a href="johnson.fig2.html"><img src="johnson.fig2.gif" width="400" height="464" border="0"></a></p>
		<p class=normal><b><span class="MsoCaption">Figure 2: The snapshot-transition 
		  model of a feature (viewed in a 'space-time cube'): snapshots (left) 
		  and interpolated sequence (right</span></b><span class="MsoCaption"><b>)</b></span></p>
		<p class=normal >In the absence of other information, such interpolation 
		  would normally be linear between the known snapshots. However we may 
		  have enough information about the nature of the phenomenon to record 
		  a qualitative modifier, such as &#8220;increasing pace&#8221;, or even 
		  a quantitative modifier which could be used to improve the interpolation. 
		  Furthermore, the dates of the snapshots may be subject to uncertainty, 
		  as may the accuracy of the extents or attributes recorded, and all of 
		  this information should really be recorded and used in the generation 
		  of interpolations. I refer to this method of recording spatio-temporal 
		  information as a &#8220;snapshot-transition model&#8221;, and refer 
		  to the individual observations of features at arbitrary times as &#8220;instances&#8221; 
		  (Johnson 1999).</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Model-driven Interpolation</h1>
		<p class=normal>While modifications to the interpolation of features recorded 
		  using a snapshot-transition model may produce a better match with what 
		  actually occurred, such interpolations are still just mathematical transformations 
		  which take no account of what actually happened, and the degree to which 
		  they match reality can never be known. The only way to generate interpolations 
		  which approximate reality, within some quantifiable error, is to model 
		  the processes which resulted in change, taking account of factors such 
		  as landscape characteristics, social organisation, economics, communication 
		  and specific events. The model might then be tested against actual observations 
		  - the snapshot observations.</p>
		<p class=normal><span class="normal">Such an approach requires far more 
		  knowledge and far more data than is generally available for historical 
		  periods, but should not be excluded as a means of refining interpolations. 
		  The development and refinement of such a model may also be a valuable 
		  method for better understanding and interpreting the phenomena mapped, 
		  as well as delivering visualisations for explanation and education.</span></p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Map Animation</h1>
		<p class=normal>Map animations generated either by simple geometric interpolation 
		  of instances (tweening) or through a model-driven interpolation provide 
		  a powerful and engaging means of communicating information about mappable 
		  historical phenomena &#151; distributions of sites and cultural domains, 
		  trade, exploration, spread of empires, military campaigns, urban growth 
		  etc. Unlike simple time date stamp filtering, animation works best where 
		  features DO change continuously (although they can also work effectively 
		  where there is patterning in the appearance and disappearance of substantial 
		  numbers of point features).</p>
		<p class=normal>Map animation requires the interpolation of known spatial 
		  extents to generate intermediate 'frames'. For bitmap animation formats, 
		  such as AVI or MPEG, all intermediate frames must be generated, and 
		  the resulting files are very large even with compression. Our early 
		  small animations ran to tens of megabytes.</p>
		<p class=normal><span class="normal">Vector animation formats such as 
		  SVG and SWF (Flash) can be rendered by a player which interpolates intermediate 
		  frames through tweening. This closely parallels the snapshot-transition 
		  data model adopted by TimeMap, so we can export an SWF file for tweening 
		  and animation by the Flash player, which can also be imported into Flash 
		  MX for refinement (see Jesse, 2001 for a similar approach). Because 
		  frames are built on demand and based on vectors, the size of these Flash 
		  animations depends on the amount of temporal and spatial detail, not 
		  on the playing time of the animation, and good quality zoomable animations 
		  running for several minutes are typically less than 1 MByte. Example 
		  animations are available on the TimeMap Web site.</span></p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Barriers to adoption</h1>
		<p class=normal>There are cogent reasons why the integration of maps and 
		  databases has not occurred widely. The high cost of software and data 
		  preparation and the need for technical expertise and facilities have 
		  been major hurdles. These technical and financial impediments to integrating 
		  maps with databases have by now been largely eroded, and most people 
		  have come in contact with database-generated interactive maps (without 
		  necessarily recognising the essential back-end behind the visual product).</p>
		<p class=normal><span class="normal">The remaining barriers to widespread 
		  use of maps as a front-end to databases lie in awareness of non-demanding 
		  solutions and in seeing their relevance to providing more informative 
		  and more engaging interfaces for both search and display. One of our 
		  aims with the TimeMap project is to make database-driven map interfaces 
		  available, not as costly custom solutions, but as flexible search and 
		  enquiry systems which should be (almost) as easy and natural to use 
		  as images in a Web page.</span></p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Interactive Mapping Solutions</h1>
		<p class=normal>Web-based mapping is a growing field with many players 
		  and potential applications (for an overview see Kraak and Brown, 2001). 
		  At the lower end of the market there are any number of Java mapping 
		  applets&#151;many available as freeware &#151; which can be used to 
		  create interactive maps embedded in Web pages. Examples include ALOV<a
href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> 
		  <![if !supportFootnotes]>
		  [iv] 
		  <![endif]>
		  </a>, GAEA, GeoTools, JMapplet, JShape,lava, MapFactory and many others 
		  which can be located through a Web search. These applications &#151; 
		  at least in their basic form &#151; typically provide closed systems 
		  which download GIS data files stored with the applet, hold these in 
		  memory and allow various standard operations such as zooming, panning 
		  and enquiry. Like a Web page, you get all or nothing. These single-tier 
		  approaches are simple, but limit flexibility and entail heavy network 
		  traffic for rich datasets.</p>
		<p class=normal>A number of these applet developers &#151; along with 
		  digital library initiatives and mainstream commercial vendors &#151; 
		  have also pursued a multi-tier approach in which the client can request 
		  data as required from a middle-tier server application. This approach 
		  gives greater flexibility to search for data through a clearinghouse, 
		  to add and remove layers, to pull data from multiple sources and to 
		  download data incrementally as a map is panned or zoomed. By isolating 
		  the complexities of data access and error handling on the middle tier 
		  server, the client applets can be simpler, smaller and more reliable, 
		  while network traffic is minimised.</p>
		<p class=normal><span class="normal">The pre-eminent commercial multi-tier 
		  system today comes from ESRI Inc. Their Geography Network clearinghouse 
		  indexes (among other things) datasets served by their Internet map server 
		  (ArcIMS) to a variety of ESRI clients of various 'weights' (ArcReader 
		  ArcExplorer, ArcView, ArcGIS). Other vendors offer similar combinations 
		  of index, server and alternative clients.</span></p>
		<p class=normal><span class="normal">Beyond these vendor-specific solutions, 
		  however, lies the potential for interoperability based on the Open GIS 
		  Consortium (OGC) standards (see <a
href="http://www.opengis.org/">www.opengis.org</a>) which provide well-defined 
		  ways of finding, requesting and transferring data between data sources, 
		  catalogues, servers and clients. We should look beyond the traditional 
		  approach of building closed systems for specific applications &#151; 
		  often developed independently, from scratch, as one-off applications 
		  &#151; towards the building of systems which use adaptable tools and 
		  draw on external sources of rich data, such as mapping frameworks or 
		  institutional collections, and integrate them into new applications 
		  through standards-based interoperability.</span></p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">TimeMap</h1>
		<p class=normal>TimeMap is intended to contextualise and deliver cultural 
		  data through maps. It is built around metadata stored in an SQL server 
		  DBMS, which allows data to be pulled in from servers anywhere on the 
		  Internet. To that extent it is similar in concept, although not in implementation, 
		  to commercial multi-tier systems. The biggest distinction from currently 
		  available commercial solutions lies in its explicit handling of the 
		  time dimension, informed by its roots in Humanities research (Johnson 
		  1999).</p>
		<p class=normal>The implementation differences lie particularly at the 
		  metadata level. Rather than a fixed set of metadata elements hard-coded 
		  into the software, TimeMap is a soft-coded system: the element definitions 
		  are recorded in the central server DBMS and can be consulted and used 
		  by each of the TimeMap programs. The definitions in the database can 
		  be easily updated; e.g. by changing their name or description or by 
		  adding additional schemes or permitted values, and these definition 
		  changes will be reflected in the software without reprogramming. The 
		  metadata is not limited to simply describing the data, but is used to 
		  configure the software to the data, rather than requiring the data to 
		  conform to the software.</p>
		<p class=normal><span class="normal">At the core of the TimeMap system

		<p class=normal><span class="normal">TimeMap allows datasets registered

		  maps (&#8220;MapSpaces&#8221;), which are set up using the TimeMap Windows 
		  program (TMWin). TMWin will publish MapSpaces to the clearinghouse and 
		  they can then be embedded in a Web page as a fully interactive Java 
		  applet (TMJava) with a few lines of HTML. TMWin can also be used stand-alone 
		  as a MapSpace viewer or kiosk application.</span></p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">TimeMap in Practice</h1>
		<p class=normal>TimeMap is made up of a number of components which combine 
		  to deliver a complete electronic publication system for interactive 
		  Web-based or kiosk maps. The system may be best understood through a 
		  description of these components.</p>
		<p class=SubHeaderSmall><b>Serving data</b></p>
		<p class=normal>Preparing datasets for use by TimeMap can be as simple 
		  as placing a JPG image or an ESRI Shapefile on a Web server and entering 
		  metadata to register the URL in the clearinghouse. TMWin, the Windows 
		  version of TimeMap, provides wizard-driven creation of metadata, simple 
		  spatial registration of scanned images, creation of Shapefiles from 
		  spreadsheets, and loading of GIS datasets into a public domain SQL server 
		  (e.g. MySQL, available on many ISPs and university servers). This brings 
		  the creation of fully capable, Web-accessible spatial databases within 
		  easy reach of non specialists at little or no cost.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeaderSmall">The ECAI Metadata Clearinghouse</h1>
		<p class=normal>The ECAI metadata clearinghouse was developed as a central 
		  metadata reference for Internet-accessible datasets which might be accessed 
		  by TimeMap (or other) software. Currently there is only one generally 
		  accessible clearinghouse, the Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative (<a
href="http://www.ecai.org/" target="_blank">www.ecai.org</a>) clearinghouse, but 
		  the software can connect to other clearinghouses (and is used with local 
		  XML versions for standalone applications).</p>
		<p class=normal><span class="normal">The clearinghouse records three types 
		  of metadata (for more detailed discussion of these metadata categories, 
		  see Johnson, in press):</span></p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class = normal> <span class=normal> <b>descriptive metadata</b>, based

		  to tell software how to form appropriate requests to the data server. 
		  </span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class=normal>The clearinghouse can be updated through Web-based forms 
		  (implemented in Perl and Python) or through the metadata editing and 
		  registration function of the TimeMap Windows software, TMWin .</p>

		<p class=normal>The Java version of TimeMap (TMJava) is used to render 
		  the MapSpaces created by TMWin and registered with the clearinghouse 
		  (or served as files from a Web server). The clearinghouse can be searched 
		  through a Web interface (Figure 4) which includes a TMJava map built 
		  from the clearinghouse database. Datasets selected through this search 
		  can then be combined and rendered as a TMJava map (Figure 5).</p>

		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 6: Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative Clearinghouse 
		  search <br>
		  (the map is an interactive TMJava applet generated from the clearinghouse)</p>
		<p class=normal>TMJava will embed a MapSpace as an interactive map in 
		  any Web page, with most of the symbology and behaviours associated with 
		  the Windows version. MapSpaces can also be displayed directly in a TMJava 
		  applet simply by supplying the registration ID to a special URL, as 
		  in the following example: <a
href="http://www.timemap.net/clearinghouse/html/alov.cgi?id=329">http://www.timemap.net/clearinghouse/html/alov.cgi?id=329</a></p>
		<p class=normal><b><i>If the default layout of the applet is not suitable, 
		  the applet can be extensively customised</i></b> through XML layout 
		  files and applet parameters, allowing exposure of different levels of 
		  functionality and changes to the look and feel of the applet to fit 
		  with existing Web page designs. The applet can also be controlled by 
		  JavaScript, allowing complete custom applications to be built without 
		  modifying the core software. Several examples of default and customised 
		  TMJava maps, along with simple embedding instructions for user-designed 
		  Web pages, can be found on the TimeMap Web site.</p>

		<h1 class="SubHeaderSmall">Kiosk applications</h1>
		<p class=normal>It was always intended that TimeMap could function as 
		  a kiosk application, and our first kiosk (Figure 7) was installed at 
		  the Museum of Sydney in November 2000 (Johnson &amp; Wilson 2002);. 
		  This kiosk is stand-alone, using resources generated from a central 
		  database and then copied to the kiosk computer itself.</p>
		<table width="80%" border=" 0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">

		</table>
		<p class=normal align=left>Work since then has aimed at creating a distributed 
		  kiosk system which draws data dynamically from a central server. The 
		  current Museum of Sydney system was implemented inTMJava, which renders 
		  MapSpaces built on-the-fly from selections made in a ThinkMap&#8482; 
		  application connected to the central server database. Specific customisation 
		  was carried out to match the Museum's screen designs and desired workflow 
		  (Figure 9).</p>

		<h1 class="SubHeaderSmall">Hot-linked content</h1>
		<p class=normal>One of the strengths of interactive maps is the ability 
		  to use the map as a portal to more detailed information This additional 
		  information may be the attributes (database fields) associated with 
		  the objects displayed on the map, or more detailed information such 
		  as database-generated Web pages or multimedia resources. Most interactive 
		  map applications now provide a means of hot-linking objects on the map 
		  to a disk file or a URL specified in a field in the attribute data, 
		  and in some cases support macros to generate a URL dynamically from 
		  information such as attributes and text.</p>
		<p class=normal>TimeMap stores URL templates in the metadata attached 
		  to a dataset, which are then completed with attribute data when objects 
		  are selected on the map. This allows TMView and TMJava to easily hot-link 
		  to database-generated Web pages and systematically-named file resources, 
		  without the need to write macros.</p>
		<p class=normal>TimeMap also handles hot-links from multiple layers, multiple 
		  hot-links per object and multiple object selection. When multiple objects 
		  are selected, a Web page of hyperlinks is generated from an HTML template.<a
href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> 
		  <![if !supportFootnotes]>
		  [ix] 
		  <![endif]>
		  </a> The templates allow the list of hyperlinks to include thumbnail 
		  images (as illustrated in Figure 6, right-hand screen).</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Bandwidth issues</h1>
		<p class=normal>Bandwidth is a critical issue in delivery of Web-based 
		  resources. Owing to the potential size of GIS datasets, many Web mapping 
		  applications process the data server-side and deliver maps as JPG images. 
		  Each operations on the map returns to the server for a new image. This 
		  &#8220;thin client&#8221; approach can provide low-bandwidth solutions 
		  which sidestep problems with browser compatibility, but it severely 
		  limits interactivity. The TimeMap middleware can generate map images 
		  embedded in an HTML template if required for applications with minimal 
		  browser requirements or interaction.</p>
		<p class=normal>At the other end of the scale, standalone map applets 
		  tend to download all the data to memory, even though much of it may 
		  never be displayed, and manipulate the data on the client &#151; a &#8220;thick 
		  client&#8221; approach. While interactivity is enhanced, the bandwidth 
		  consumed may be out of proportion with the detail displayed.</p>
		<p class=normal><span class="normal">TimeMap employs a mid-weight client 
		  which processes and filters data server-side, so that only the data 
		  needed to display the map is transferred across the network Several 
		  different approaches are adopted to minimise bandwidth. First, as layers 
		  are switched on or the map is zoomed or panned, the client works out 
		  what additional data it needs and sends incremental requests to the 
		  server. Secondly, map layers are scale sensitive, so that high resolution 
		  layers can be set to switch on only when the map is zoomed in, so that 
		  only a small part of the dataset is ever requested. Thirdly, MrSID image 
		  layers are filterable and multi-resolution, so the client requests images 
		  which cover just the visible window at an appropriate resolution. Finally, 
		  data is efficiently compressed before transmission.</span></p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusion</h1>
		<p class=normal>In this paper I have attempted to summarise the TimeMap 
		  methodology, from its simple data model, core database and underlying 
		  metadata structure, to the practical implementation of e-Publication 
		  and Web map delivery tools. The implementation of TimeMap provides museums 
		  and other cultural organisations with a low cost, easily customised 
		  method of delivering rich content from databases, integrating external 
		  sources of data and taking advantage of spatial information and the 
		  power of maps to contextualise information.</p>
		<p class=normal>This approach contrasts at one end with user-hostile text-based 
		  searching of catalogue databases, and at the other with user-friendly 
		  multimedia systems designed for a specific and limited purpose. Some 
		  may doubt that content-rich systems are appropriate to a museum environment, 
		  where quick turnover on scarce computer terminals may be desired. But 
		  as hardware becomes more ubiquitous, and the outreach of museums to 
		  the Web increases, the arguments for content-rich, Web-accessible multimedia 
		  generated from museum resources will increase.</p>
		<p class=normal><span class="normal">TimeMap is a first, or perhaps second, 
		  generation system for delivering content-rich multimedia through Web 
		  browsers (whether on-site or viewed at home). In a few short years it 
		  will look primitive as 3D virtual environments become commonplace. But 
		  if it is built on sound database and metadata principles &#151; as we 
		  hope it is &#151; we can update the programming to integrate these new 
		  methods, rather than ditching the dated information architecture and 
		  software of a monolithic multimedia system. Our audiences may be becoming 
		  more sophisticated users of computers at break-neck speed, but that 
		  doesn't mean that their underlying questions and motivations are evolving 
		  like fruit flies: good structure and data today will be good structure 
		  and data tomorrow.</span></p>
