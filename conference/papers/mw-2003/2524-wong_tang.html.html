		<p class="PaperTitle"><b>An Affordable System for a Thematic Exhibition 
		  by Using Internet/Intranet</b></p>
		<p class="Author"><b>Loong Wing Tang, Chun Wai Cheung, Kwok Wai Ng and 
		  Chi Kin Wong, Hong Kong Science Museum, Hong Kong</b></p>
		<p class="AbstractTitle"><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p class="AbstractText">The Hong Kong Science Museum presented a special 
		  exhibition titled "Flowers in the Mirrors" in May 2002. A Chinese novel 
		  that was written in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) inspired this thematic 
		  exhibition. The exhibits were designed in a way to recreate the experience 
		  of the two main characters in the novel during their adventures in various 
		  "Countries" simply by mirrors. How were the dihedral angles of the 
		  mirrors and what were their dimensions became the critical factors of 
		  successfully reproducing the desired visual effects. Given to a basic 
		  calculation of image reflection by computer, the exhibit developer further 
		  ported the data to rendering software to visualize the reflection in 
		  full scale. To allow visitors not only saw their image reflections inside 
		  the exhibits, an Internet/Intranet Image Capturing Sub-System was also 
		  developed to provide picture records to the participants. Visitors 
		  would receive their hardcopy of images taken in the museum, they could 
		  also email or retrieve them from a web site in the Internet. This paper 
		  gives a comprehensive review of these exhibits and how the computer 
		  system worked with the Intranet / Internet.</p>

		Mathematics in nature</i>. </blockquote>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class=normal><i>Flowers in the Mirrors</i>, a Chinese novel written 
		  in the Qing dynasty, inspired the conception of the exhibition. The 
		  fascinating adventure of the main character, Tang Ao, when he has gone 
		  astray into a number of outlandish countries and the difficulties encountered 
		  by her daughter, Tang Xiao-shan, when she searched for him make up the 
		  content of the exhibition. </p>
		<p class=SubHeader><b>The Exhibition</b></p>
		<p class=normal>The exhibition included three parts: The first was the 
		  11 strange countries Tang Ao had visited. The exhibits, which made use 
		  of mirror reflections, enabled visitors to meet queer-looking countrymen. 
		  In the &quot;Country of the Three-headed People&quot;, the people with 
		  11 heads and 22 arms would greet visitors by waving their hands. In 
		  the &quot;Country of the People with Holed Chests&quot;, visitors could 
		  take a look at the people's chests and guess where their hearts were. 
		  Visitors could imagine helping Tang Xiao-shan to find her father in 
		  the hallucinating utopia  &quot;Little Penglai&quot; (Land of Immortals). 
		</p>
		<p class=normal>In the second part, visitors would be able to sit the 
		  Ministerial Examinations together with all the talented girls in the 
		  novel to see how much they knew about mirror reflections and their applications: 
		  Could you make a cube with mirrors and a tube? Could you apply multiple 
		  reflections to design the safety reflectors for cars, bicycles, and 
		  signs? Or could you design a mirror maze that dazzled the audience? 
		</p>
		<p class=normal>In the third part, visitors would have a chance to play 
		  with the 3D models and toys of symmetric structures at the &quot;Verdant 
		  Pavilion&quot;. They would be able to reveal the secrets of the magic 
		  and visualize the special effects created with the use of mirrors, learning 
		  about the living organisms and natural phenomena that demonstrated the 
		  wonders of symmetry. </p>
		<p class=normal>There were 29 groups of exhibits presented in this special 
		  exhibition. However, we would like to put more emphasis on a special 
		  group of exhibits that were heavily dependent on the effectiveness of 
		  the transmission of captured images using internet/intranet. This very 
		  group of exhibit was the "Country of Three-headed people".</p>
		<p class=SubHeader><b>Country of Three-headed people</b></p>
	  </div>
	  <blockquote> 
		<div class=Section1>"<i>This person has three bodies and one head, while 
		  that one possesses three heads and one body. May be they would envy 
		  each other should they ever meet</i>" <br>
		  <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(J. C. LI. <i>Jing Hua Yuan.</i> Chapter 
		  38)</span></div>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p class=normal>In this country there were five groups of &quot;citizens&quot; 
		with different number of heads. Upon entering each mirror group, a visitor 
		could use the barcode printed at the back of the ticket and the built-in 
		camera to take pictures of himself/herself (the citizen) there.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Computer programs "Adventures in Raytracing" (from Alfonso 
		Hermida 1993 version) and "SolidWorks" (SolidWorks 2001 plus from SolidWorks 
		Corporation) were employed in planning and designing the mirror setting 
		before the actual fabrication. This had greatly helped to reduce the production 
		time and minimize unnecessary work procedures. A table of the five Platonic 
		structures was included as follows:</p>

	  <p class="SubHeader"><b>Platform &amp; Environment</b></p>
	  <p class=normal>The system used an "IBM e-Server X232" for the Intranet

	  <p class="SubHeaderSmall"><b>Image Capturing Sub-system (ICSS)</b></p>
	  <p class=normal>The custom design embedded controller that used a Rabbit 
		8-bit microprocessor "RabbitCore Module" worked as the core of the image 
		capturing sub-system. It integrated a Barcode Scanner and an IP Camera 
		to perform login identification and image capturing function. The platform 
		of the controller used its own instruction sets that based on Z80/Z180, 
		but had been adapted to be C-friendly. The communication between the 
		ICSS and the Intranet database server was made through Telnet and FTP 
		services by using TCP/IP protocol. There were five IP cameras in total, 
		one installed for capturing real time image at each station. </p>

	  <p class=MsoCaption>Fig 14: A block diagram of Image Capturing Sub-System</p>
	  <p class="SubHeaderSmall"><b>Algorithms of operation</b></p>
	  <p class="normal">There were two major sub-systems, the Image Capturing 
		Sub-System (ICSS) and the Snowflake Design Game (SDG). ICSS created JPEG 
		format images while SDG generated transition files that could be interpreted 
		by the Flash program. Both files from ICSS and SDG would be transferred 
		to the Intranet database server by FTP service and be identified by bar 
		code. Bar code label was printed at the back of each admission ticket 
		and the identified number also served the identified key while participant 
		retrieved their images or snowflake at home through Internet. </p>
	  <p><span class="normal"> <b>Operation of ICSS:</b></span></p>
	  <p class="normal"> <b>Registration </b></p>
	  <p class=normal>To uniquely identify each visitor, a barcode label would 
		be stick to the back of the admission ticket. This barcode should be used 
		to set up database account for storing digital image taken inside each 
		station.</p>
	  <p class="normal"> <b>Taking Images </b></p>
	  <p class="normal"> Before entering the mirror exhibits, the visitor's ticket 
		will be scanned by barcode reader to retrieve the visitor's identity. 
		Based on the scanned barcode, the exhibit controller communicated with 
		the data base server via Telnet service to setup an account or add file 
		under the same barcode ID record to existing user account.</p>
	  <p class="normal"> Image capturing was triggered by pushing a start button 
		at the nearby location. Followed by an audio alarm and a blanking indicator, 
		the participant would be notified the image capture sequence. The captured 
		image file was transferred to the database server via FTP. Participants 
		were allowed to capture as many images as they wish. However, only the 
		last image captured at each station would be retained. Each new capture 
		at the same station would overwrite the previous one. Therefore, a maximum 
		total of five images would be stored for each participant.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall"> <b>Displaying Images</b></h2>
	  <p> There were two plasma monitors to display the last 15 captured images 
		from the database server. The real time images captured by the five IP 
		cameras were also displayed at the plasma monitors. Therefore, visitor 
		could preview their images and watched the actions of other visitors inside 
		each mirror exhibit. This could provide an instant feedback to all visitors 
		and enhanced their motivation to participate the game. </p>

	  <blockquote>
		<p><span class="normal">Same as the Image Capturing Sub-system.</span></p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p class="SubHeaderSmaller"> <b>Snowflake Design</b></p>
	  <blockquote> 
		<p> Each visitor could design step by step his own snowflake pattern based 
		  on the instruction at each web page in the workstation. There were 
		  2 workstations for participant to design their own snowflake. After 
		  that, the pattern file would be transferred to the database server via 
		  FTP service.</p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p class="normal"> <b class="SubHeaderSmaller">Retrieving the 
		Image and Snowflake Pattern</b></p>
	  <blockquote> 
		<p> Three Workstations were provided for retrieving their images and snowflake 
		  patterns. Each workstation was installed a barcode scanner for reading 
		  the barcode. The retrieved barcode entered into a field on a web page 
		  and was sent to the database server for searching the image taken and 
		  snowflake pattern. The images and snowflake pattern could be sent out 
		  by email or could be printed out at the two printing stations nearby.</p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p class="normal"> <b class="SubHeaderSmaller">Web pages that 
		were open to the public</b></p>
	  <blockquote> 
		<p> An external hosting server was also setup for visitors to retrieve 
		  their images that had been taken in the exhibits or their snowflake 
		  pattern through Internet by entering their barcode information on the 
		  museum homepage. The image taken and snowflake created in the museum 
		  were batch updated at interval to the Internet Server through FTP service.</p>
		<p><b class="SubHeaderSmall">Choice of equipment</b></p>
		<p>At the very beginning of the planning stage, the museum would like 
		  to develop an image capturing system installed inside the mirror exhibits 
		  to present the illusion image so as to enhance the entertainment factor 
		  of the exhibit. As the system might be required attach to the rear 
		  size of huge mirror, the equipment should be compact and flexible. 
		  Therefore, the reliability would be the primary concern because the 
		  maintenance of the system would be performed on the mirror surface and 
		  frequent repair was not allowed and not preferable. Owing to time constraint, 
		  the number of exhibits and the location could not be confirmed, we could 
		  only ensure the system to be distributed all over the exhibition area. 
		  The system should be built on the distributed platform and each controller 
		  could act as a master or a slave controller as when required. This 
		  allowed us for further development by changing or modifying the layout 
		  at any time. A Local Area Network (LAN) was also anticipated and TCP/IP 
		  was chosen as the system communication layer. Based on the above-mentioned 
		  concerns, the choices of equipment for the ICSS were summarized as follows:</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Network Camera</h2>
		<p> <span class="normal">Many people first thought to use WebCam for the 
		  image capturing function as it was easy to setup and the cost was only 
		  a few hundred Hong Kong dollars. But, the main problem was that WebCam 
		  had to be attached to a desktop computer that was always not reliable 
		  and the drivers of the WebCam adopted the proprietary graphical user 
		  interface only. As such, the integration of camera and the control 
		  system was very difficult particularly in the control or monitoring 
		  of the Webcam behavior through the Windows Operating System of the desktop 
		  computer. To eliminate this problem, AXIS 2100 network camera was chosen 
		  as it could be attached directly to an Ethernet network and no desktop 
		  computer was required. The AXIS 2100 network camera equipped a built-in 
		  web (HTML) interface for configuration and monitoring that made the 
		  management simple. The AXIS delivered compressed JPEG image at a speed 
		  of 10 frames per second that fulfilled the live video presentation on 
		  the Video Display Station (plasma monitors). The built-in I/O connector 
		  allowed controlling the camera in a straightforward and easier way. 
		  The replaceable standard CS mount lens would add the flexibility of 
		  changing view angle for different size of captured image as required. 
		  As a whole the network camera was a stand-alone unit in the whole system 
		  and could integrate to any kind of controller easily at every stage 
		  of development</span></p>
		<p><b class="SubHeaderSmall">Barcode Scanner</b></p>
		<p> The input device played an important role in the system design. Before 
		  choosing any appropriate device, we needed to determine which type of 
		  media or technology to store the visitor's identity. Smart card was 
		  one of non-contact types of media and it was very fit for our purpose. 
		  However, it was expensive and the operation costs, included the programming 
		  and production of large quantity of smart cards, were very high. Therefore, 
		  it was not a cost effective choice. Another consideration was adapting 
		  barcode to hold the identity information since the format of barcode 
		  could be programmable by in-house staff and it was compatible with our 
		  existing museum pass barcode system. The most important was the cost 
		  of barcode sticker could keep to minimum for large amount of barcode 
		  printing. After choosing barcode as the proper media, some essential 
		  features of barcode scanner should be equipped. Firstly, the barcode 
		  scanner had programmable self-holding identity function for serving 
		  as exhibit ID. Secondly, the scan pattern should be omni-directional. 
		  Eventually, we chose "IS6520 Barcode Scanner from Metrologic" as it 
		  could be embedded the programmable prefix in the barcode data for identification 
		  and its scan pattern was 5 fields of 4 parallel lines (i.e. omni-directional). 
		</p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p> <b class="SubHeaderSmall">Visitor Detection Sensor</b></p>
	  <blockquote> 
		<p> <span class="normal">To ensure the capturing of visitor image at a 
		  proper position, it was necessary to install a sensor to detect the 
		  presence of a visitor standing on a particular position. Diffuse type 
		  infrared sensor from "Omron" was used to allow the system enter into 
		  image taking state. When the visitor left the exhibit, the barcode 
		  data would be cleared. After that the exhibit controller entered into 
		  an idle loop and waited for the next visitor to present a barcode.</span></p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p class="SubHeaderSmall"> <b>Exhibit Controller</b></p>
	  <p class="normal"> The core of the image capturing sub-system was a custom 
		designed programmable controller. Theoretically a desktop computer could 
		perform the same function as the controller but there were some limitations 
		such as the bulky size, non-reliable desktop operating system and hardware 
		failure. The critical factors were listed as follows :</p>
	  <ol>
		<li> 
		  <div class=Section1> Compact size;</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=Section1> Powerful performance;</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=Section1> Flexible I/O included serial, parallel and Ethernet

		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=Section1> Master and slave control available; and</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=Section1> Reliable and easy to develop application with data 
			library support. </div>
		</li>
	  </ol>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class="normal">Based on the above concerns, we decided to use "RCM2100 
		  RabbitCore Module from Rabbit Semiconductor" as the exhibit controller. 
		  This embedded controller had additional features such as 56 programmable 
		  I/O for serial or parallel as required, integrated slave interface for 
		  exchange of data between master and slave control, generated programs 
		  that use 512K of data in SRAM and 512K of code in the flash ROM. The 
		  specific controller could act as the bridge of communication between 
		  serial or parallel and Ethernet.</p>

		<p class=normal>As the files created should be shared between the local 
		  database server and the external database server, a file synchronization 
		  process had been programmed at the local server. This process synchronized 
		  from the local server to the external server but not vice-versa because 
		  of the followings:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ol>
		<li> 
		  <div class=Section1> Only snowflake game was available at Internet. 
			No image capturing sub-system record would be created through the 
			museum homepage on Internet.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=Section1> The snowflake created at the museum homepage would 
			have an ID different from that those created at the museum for easy 
			identification.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=Section1> It was not available to login the account in museum

		</li>
	  </ol>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class=normal>Therefore, the captured images in the museum would be 
		  transferred to the external database server through FTP service and 
		  updated the Intranet database table "photo_sys' that indicated those 
		  images had synchronized. The process also updated the newest snowflake 
		  designed in the database in the museum. This synchronized process was 
		  set to carry out once per hour, or right after the printing process 
		  of that particular account. The database structure was shown as below:</p>

		<p class="normal">For the planning of the image capturing sub-system, 
		  we would like to reuse the system concept for other projects in future 
		  so there was enough space of the controller to develop applications. 
		  At the current exhibit model, the front end was the integration of IP 
		  camera, barcode scanner and sensor interface. The back end was a database 
		  server and the embedded controller performed the bridging function between 
		  the two ends. The potential improvements to the exhibit offered by the 
		  embedded controller were summarized as follows :</p>
	  </div>
	  <ol>
		<li> 
		  <div class=Section1> When there was a need to enhance the function of 
			front end interface, for example- record the audio clips or even generate 
			a video footage in a form of motion frames, we could just modify the 
			protocol slightly and reprogram the serial I/O a little bit. Alternately 
			we could change the IP camera to a higher series of model which offered 
			the audio and video output feature if required. On the other hand, 
			any change of back end from server to stand alone browser client to 
			just monitor the exhibit environment was also possible.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=Section1> If we changed the visitor detection sensor from 
			infrared to ultrasonic type, the system could perform automatic security 
			monitoring system that would transfer the captured image to a monitoring 
			station whenever an object passed through the checkpoint where IP 
			camera was being mounted on.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=Section1> We could install the spare modified unit of image 
			capturing station in some future exhibit promotion booths in museum 
			and allow visitor take photo with an exhibit backdrop as the background 
			at free of charge. The photo could be sent by email then. This 
			sort of promotion activity was at no additional cost to the museum.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=Section1> The embedded controller had a built-in web server 
			and we could modify the web page that a number of hyperlinks interact 
			with serial commands to control external device. For the existing 
			control system being used in our exhibition areas, we could install 
			an embedded controller and program it to interact with these serial 
			devices control. This would enable visitor to operate those exhibits 
			remotely through our Intranet in the museum. When coupling with IP 
			camera at nearby exhibits, visitors would even monitor the instant 
			feedback of the exhibits. Furthermore, we could extend this concept 
			to cover all the exhibits in our museum to build a virtual museum 
			on Internet. Such that, the surfers in the Internet could visit our 
			museum and operate the exhibits remotely. The costs were just the 
			embedded controller and could be programmed them to match the existing 
			control system. The Intranet inside the exhibit already existed and 
			we simply modified our web site to redirect the link to the Intranet 
			web server of each embedded controller. </div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=Section1> As the visitors could retrieve their images and 
			snowflake back at the Internet, we could design an interface allowing 
			visitors to send e-card with the their own images or the snowflake. 
			This will provide good promotion opportunity to the museum.</div>

		<p class=normal>During the planning stage, the network environment for

		  software provided by the USB client installed in a laptop computer in 
		  order to check the signal strength in our exhibition area environment. 
		  The readout showed promising and signal strength was good enough. Furthermore, 
		  Internet surfing also ran on the laptop computer and was found that 
		  the connection speed and condition were sufficient. </p>
		<p class="normal">After the exhibits installed, we found the signal strength 
		  between the desktop computer and the data base server became fluctuating. 
		  It might be due to the interference from other equipment within the

		  to revert the wireless LAN environment to wire-oriented approach for 
		  the desktop computers and controllers to ensure a proper connectivity.</p>
		<h4 class="SubHeaderSmall"><b>Timeout Problem for the IP Camera Controller</b></h4>
		<p class="normal">Before transferring the image from the IP cameras to 
		  the Intranet data base server through ftp service, the controller of 
		  the IP cameras was first telnet to this server to check if the account 
		  contained image or not. If so, the latest image would overwrite the 
		  previous one. To allow sufficient time for the server to process the 
		  request, the IP camera controller had to be set a two-second timeout. 
		  If the last telnet process was not completed within the time-out period, 
		  the controller was programmed to reset the telnet process. Then, it 
		  would retry the telnet process again. Otherwise, the telnet port might 
		  be occupied by the precedent unsuccessful process and affected the next 
		  image transmitting process.</p>
		<h4 class="SubHeaderSmall"><b>Policy Control</b></h4>
		<p class="normal">All the exhibits were placed in the public areas and 
		  a policy control should be in place for them so that visitors could 
		  interrupt, terminate or delete the programs from the workstations. 
		  Since our client programs for this project were written in Flash, the 
		  executable files were generated and the programs were set for full screen 
		  mode. Therefore, the desktop of the computer would not be accessible. 
		  Furthermore, a track ball with only left button was installed to serve 
		  as inputting device. Together with the login can only be done scanning 
		  the bar code at the back of the admission ticket by barcode scanner, 
		  the policy control could be easily accomplished as there was no keyboard 
		  and the right button of the track ball was physically not connected. 
		  This arrangement was up to our requirement at the snowflake design game 
		  and the print image workstations. </p>
		<p class="normal">However, this method could not be applied to the email 
		  sending workstations, as we had to provide keyboard to the visitors 
		  to type the email addresses. Under this circumstance, a software called 
		  SecureKeys from Tazion was applied to control which hot-keys at the 
		  keyboard were not available. For example, we disabled the Alt+F4 and 
		  Ctrl+Alt+Del hot-keys from the keyboard. We also found that SecureKeys 
		  worked well with Chinese Windows environment. </p>
		<p class="SubHeaderSmall"><b>Visitor Detection Sensor Fault Signal </b></p>
		<p class=normal>The function of the infrared sensor was to detect the 
		  presence of a visitor on the right position and the sensor was only 
		  sensitive to heat change. Unfortunately, when visitors wore black-coloured 
		  trousers would make the body temperature a little bit lower than normal. 
		  The sensor might not be able to detect the presence of visitors. Eventually, 
		  the system could not resume to the ready mode and halt the next image 
		  taking process. To solve this problem, we tuned the sensitivity of 
		  sensor to the highest and tilted the angle of sensor 60 degree upward. 
		  In this case, the beam pattern of the sensor covered the upper part 
		  of body. This would maximize the sensing area.</p>

		  for Internet, the period was between 3<sup>rd</sup> May 2002 and 21<sup>st</sup> 
		  August 2002. Below was the statistics report for the number of usage

		<p class="SubHeader"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
		<p class=normal>According to our statistic record, there were more than 
		  100 000 captured images and 20 000 snowflakes created. The Image Capture 
		  Sub-System and the Snowflake Design Game were proved to be a reliable 
		  system and they were well receiving in the "Flowers in the Mirrors" 
		  special exhibition. The systems had been designed and performed up 
		  to our expectation and no major breakdown or crash during the whole 
		  operation period from May 2002 to August 2002. The TCP/IP also served 
		  a vital part in the system. It provided a standard communication protocol 
		  and was widely applicable in the Internet by surfers around the world. 
		  With the communication protocol had been standardized and the I/O devices 
		  were TCP/IP compliance, the system development time could greatly be 
		  minimized. The hardware conflict due to the propriety configuration 
		  between different vendors could also be eliminated. Integrating the 
		  hardware and the application system was no longer dragged by the incompatibility 
		  or likewise. The time saving in production allowed the exhibit developer 
		  to have more options to change and computer programmer less complication. 
		  These advantages would eventually cut the costs down and also the components 
		  could be re-used in other projects. Nevertheless, a system like this 
		  could extend the usability of computer exhibit from the museum to those 
		  participants who connected to the Internet with minimal costs. </p>
