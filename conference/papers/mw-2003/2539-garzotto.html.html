	  <p class=PaperTitle>Designing Multi-Channel Web Frameworks for Cultural 
		Tourism Applications: the MUSE Case Study</p>
	  <p class=Author>Franca Garzotto, Politecnico di Milano; Tullio Salmon Cinotti, 
		Universit&agrave; di Bologna; and <span class=eudoraheader>Massimiliano 
		Pigozzi Casalecchio di Reno, Bologna, Italy</span></p>
	  <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>
	  <p class=AbstractText>A framework for the design of multi-channel (MC) applications 
		in the cultural tourism domain is presented. Several heterogeneous interface 
		devices are supported including location-sensitive mobile units, on-site 
		stationary devices, and personalized CDs that extend the on-site experience 
		beyond the visit time thanks to personal memories gathered during the 
		visit. The design framework is multi-layer in nature: it takes care of 
		application design both at conceptual and implementation level. At conceptual 
		level it supports content, navigation, interaction and presentation design. 
		At implementation level it includes an interface-independent execution 
		engine as well as a set of tools mapping the design into a formal interface 
		description that specifies the run-time rules-of-behavior to the execution 
		engine.</p>
	  <p class=AbstractText>The proposed framework is going to be demonstrated 
		in outstanding museums and archaeological sites in Italy. </p>
	  <p class=keywords><b>Keywords: </b> multi-channel applications design, pervasive 
		computing, cultural tourism, context-awareness, zero-interface.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
	  <p> The Information Society expects the establishment of pervasive services 
		(Abowd 1999, Weiser 1993) providing friendly and effective <i>education</i> 
		to everybody, in every place, at any time, improving the <i>mutual understanding 
		</i> between people of different countries, and impacting our approach 
		to <i>global culture</i> Cultural tourism offers a precious opportunity 
		to verify the potential and the impact of this emerging technological 
		scenario. The approach of today's tourists to culture has significantly 
		changed with respect to the past. The primary goal of the travellers in 
		the XVII century was "seeing" and "wondering". For travelers of the third 
		millennium, "learning" is usually one of the main objectives. </p>
	  <p class=normal> Information technology offers new challenges for the creation 
		of an education environment that is based on cultural heritage and addresses 
		the <i>need for knowledge</i> of cultural tourists (Oppermann 1999, Bocchi 
		1999, Guidazzoli 2000). In particular, the technology of <i>multichannel 
		Web applications</i> (MC applications for short) promises a successful 
		approach to these goals. An MC application delivers its services on several 
		stationary or mobile devices or "channels"; such as desktop PCs, notebooks, 
		mobile phones, PDAs, Web TVs and dedicated appliances. An MC application 
		relies upon a centralized application environment which manages a shared 
		information base coupled to the so-called "business logic" ( Salmon Cinotti 
		2001). On each channel, it delivers services which are <i>customized</i> 
		to the characteristics of the delivery device and of the user context 
		(Ozen 2001, Perkowitz 1999). As such, MC applications offer the possibility 
		of making cultural services available on-demand wherever fruitful and 
		convenient for a tourist, in a way appropriate to the physical and logical 
		situation of use.</p>
	  <p> The state-of-the-art technology provides a number of hardware and software 
		solutions for implementing MC applications. But few methodological tools 
		exist to help developers master the complexity of <i>designing</i> MC 
		applications. </p>
	  <p> The MUSE project - funded by the Italian government under the leadership 
		of Ducati Sistemi S.p.A., in cooperation with Cineca, Politecnico di Milano, 
		Sinet and the University of Bologna - addresses the above issue in a specific 
		domain: <i>cultural tourism. </i>One of the MUSE goals is to develop a 
		"framework" for MC cultural tourism applications. According to software 
		engineering, a framework "...provides a reusable solution for a class 
		of software applications that share a common set of requirements in a 
		given domain" (Johnson 1997). A framework can be regarded as an application 
		"skeleton", which captures the essential features of a class of applications 
		and can be "easily" instantiated to produce (some aspects of) a specific 
		application in the class (Fayad et al. 1997, Schwabe et al. 1999, Garzotto 
		et al. 1999). </p>
	  <p> The MUSE framework has different levels of abstraction. At the highest 
		level, the MUSE framework supports the <i>conceptual design </i> of MC 
		applications for cultural tourism. The MUSE <i>conceptual framework </i> 
		defines the user experience for the four MUSE channels. It provides the 
		general classes of information and navigation structures that may be shared 
		among different applications in the domain of cultural tourism, and it 
		defines the general navigation and interaction modes by which these contents 
		can be used on each different channel. </p>
	  <p> At the lowest level, the MUSE framework focuses on the <i>technological 
		infrastructure</i> , by defining the general characteristics and integration 
		features of the MUSE delivery channels. </p>
	  <p> At anintermediate level, the MUSE framework considers the <i>software 
		architecture</i> . It defines the middleware components that support the 
		communication between the different MUSE channels and the shared information 
		base. </p>
	  <p> The MUSE framework, at all of the above mentioned levels, has been tested 
		and used for the (on going) development of three MC applications for cultural 
		tourism: one concerning the archaeological site of Pompei, the second 
		concerning the Certosa di San Martino (a large museum located in an XVII 
		century monastery in Naples), and the third concerning the Florentine 
		"Museo di Storia Della Scienza" (Museum of Science History). </p>
	  <p> The development of the MUSE MC application in Pompeii is carried out 
		in co-operation with a team of archaeologists currently working in the 
		project "Pompei - Insula del Centenario (IX,8)". This project started 
		in 1999 as a co-operation between the "Dipartimento di Archeologia dell'Universit&agrave; 
		di Bologna" and the "Soprintendenza Archeologica di Pompei". Its primary 
		goal is the study and restoration of a large Roman "domus" (house), called 
		"<i>Domus del Centenario</i> ", located in the "<i>Insula</i> " (Quarter) 
		<i>IX</i> . The MUSE MC application focuses on the <i>Domus del Centenario</i> 
		, on its insula, on two routes, both including the magnificent forum, 
		which connectss the domus to the site main entrance and one of the beautiful 
		houses located along these roads. The application contents include maps, 
		audio-video material, images with their descriptions, 3D static and interactive 
		models, and virtual reconstructions of large sections of <i>la Casa del 
		Centenario</i> as it is today and as it was in 79 AD when Pompei was destroyed.</p>
	  <p class=normal> La Certosa di San Martino in Naples is a large XIV century 
		charterhouse located on top of the Vomero Hill. It was deeply modified 
		in the XVII century and it became "the Museo of the City of Naples" in 
		1867, after the abolition of all Roman Church properties ordered by the 
		government of the United Italian Nation. The museum is partitioned into 
		many sections, mostly located in the rooms where the Carthusian monks 
		used to live. The monastery includes cloisters, gardens, and a church. 
		It offers unforgettable views of the gulf, the city, and Mount Vesuvius, 
		and is one of the most beautiful monuments in Southern Italy. The Muse 
		MC application covers a museum section called "Immagini e Memorie della 
		Citt&agrave;" ("Images and Memory of the Town") as well as the areas connecting 
		this section to the main entrance. The section was chosen by the museum 
		authority because of its magnificent panorama and of its link to the city 
		and its history.<i> </i> The MUSE MC application contents include text, 
		images, and audio-video clips about paintings, historical cartography, 
		sculptures, ceramics and furniture. </p>
	  <p> The "Museo di Storia della Scienza" in Florence is the most important 
		History of Science Museum in Italy. It includes an outstanding collection 
		of instruments paving the path of science evolution in many areas, including 
		astronomy, sky physics, mechanics, optics, magnetism and electricity. 
		The Muse MC application aims to offer an engaging education experience 
		to communicate the meaning and the history of the museum exhibits, and 
		in its first version will cover two halls devoted to Galileo Galilei, 
		focusing on Galileo's instruments, his work, and his scientific achievements. 
	  </p>
	  <p> The rest of this paper will discuss the characteristics of the MUSE 
		channels and will present the main feature of the MUSE framework. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Muse Channels: General Features</h2>
	  The MUSE MC framework considers four different channels: the conventional 
	  Web channel, the on-site mobile channel, the on-site stationary channel, 
	  and the memories channel. The Conventional Web Channel 
	  <p> This channel is a conventional internet connected desktop or laptop. 
		The user experience of an MC application on this channel is typical of 
		any conventional cultural Web site - navigation based exploration and 
		fruition of cultural contents- suitable for a user who is planning a trip 
		or just wants to learn more about a cultural subject either at home or 
		in a museum entrance or reading room. </p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall"> The On-Site Mobile Channel </h3>
	  <p> The on-site mobile channel is a context aware hand-held device intended 
		to be used during the visit to a cultural site, e.g., a museum or an archaeological 
		settlement. The mobile device, called Whyre, is specifically designed 
		to act as a personal multimedia interactive guide for the visitor. Whyre, 
		shown on fig. 1, is worn with a neck strap like a camera's. It is connected 
		to a local server by air and it is equipped with a high brightness 6.4" 
		display. "Whyre" enabling technology is an Intel Architecture based platform 
		with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling developed within the Muse project 
		with the kind support of Intel Labs.</p>
	  <div align="center"><img src="garzotto_Garzotto.fig1.JPG" width="216" height="287" border="0" class="normal"> 
	  </div>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 1: Using Whyre, the MUSE on-site mobile channel</p>
	  <p class=normal> Due to the screen and performance limitations of the device, 
		communication effectiveness is based on words, images, and animation. 
		Words are mainly conveyed by audio and a limited amount of text (captions, 
		directions, dates, or on-demand textual copy of the audio clip). </p>
	  <p> Whyre can work in two main "modes". In <i>Web mode</i> , the information 
		base can be accessed as any standard Web site; e.g., by a visitor quietly 
		sitting down somewhere on-site, using the conventional Web navigation 
		paradigm. In the <i>context aware mode,</i> the device can detect the 
		approximate user position and field-of-view in the physical space. In 
		this mode, the application can be dynamically customized to present the 
		multimedia content and interaction capabilities which are more appropriate 
		to the current user position.</p>
	  <p> Context-aware customization is triggered by orientation- and location-dependent 
		events which are identified by properly fused data originating from many 
		on-board sensors, including a GPS, a digital compass, gyroscopes, accelerometers, 
		a camera and a WLAN based tracker. Context-aware customization supports 
		s<i>erendipity</i> : it makes the visit full of surprises, stimulates 
		resource discovery, stirs up questions, and provides answers at incremental 
		depth levels. In addition, context-awareness supports the adoption of 
		the "virtual guide metaphor": it enables the application to guide the 
		user along site tours designed by the site curators, keeping track of 
		where the users are in the tour, warning them in case of deviation, and 
		suggesting how to return to the tour path. </p>
	  <h4 class="SubHeaderSmaller">The On-Site Stationary Channel </h4>
	  <p> The content on Whyre is enhanced by the <i>on-site stationary channel</i> 
		, a stationary high performance graphic station connected to a large high-resolution 
		display located at specific points of a cultural site. The graphic station 
		is radio-controlled by the same device used in the mobile channel, and 
		the connection to the graphic station is automatically established when 
		the user approaches the station's large display.</p>
	  <p> The high performance of this channel and its screen size make this channel 
		appropriate for the delivery of cultural content where space rendering, 
		high quality interactive multimedia, and multiple simultaneous visual 
		presentations are key factors. </p>
	  <p> The user can access the on-site stationary channel in any place where 
		the high-resolution display is located, and can view on the large screen 
		channel multimedia contents that are related to that place: high quality 
		images, 3D reconstructions and simultaneous rendering of multiple synchronised 
		3D models (comparing, for example, the virtual reconstruction of a building 
		in its "original reality" and the model of its present shape). Users can 
		interact with multimedia elements by using the Whyre control elements 
		or by simply rolling and pitching the hand-held device: this may be appropriate, 
		for example, to move within the 3D space and explore the virtual reconstructions. 
		This channel supports an immersive and exciting cultural experience, and 
		takes the visitor to an easy and engaging learning experience (Bocchi 
		1999, Guidazzoli 2000, Strohotte 1998). In addition, by switching from 
		the on-site mobile channel to the on-site stationary channel, visitors 
		can turn their individual activityinto a potential "group experience".</p>
	  <h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">The Memories Channel </h4>
	  <p> The memories channel is a multimedia CD-ROM which users can fill in 
		during the visit and bring back home. During the on-site visit, the users 
		can select ("mark") any cultural material presented by the on-site mobile 
		device or by the on-site stationary device, and they can take digital 
		pictures using Whyre to recall the emotions of the visit. As these contents 
		are selected or created, they are sequentially stored in a Memory Album 
		and interlinked. The result is a very simple hypertext which provides 
		a preview of all selected elements, a direct bi-directional link from 
		the preview to each element and from each to the next and to the previous 
		one. At any time, either during or at the end of the visit, the users 
		can preview the album, add comments, delete some items, modify their order. 
		The final album can be saved on the CD, which represents the "memory" 
		of the on-site visit. </p>
	  <p class=normal> So far, the work of the MUSE project has focused on the 
		three channels depicted in figure 2, since they are the most innovative 
		and technically challenging. The conventional Web channel will be included 
		in the framework in the future.</p>
	  <p align=center> <img src="garzotto_Garzotto.fig2.JPG" width="389" height="286"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 2: Current MUSE Channels</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Muse Application Design Framework</h1>
	  <p class=normal> The goal of the MUSE application design framework is to 
		define a generalized conceptual model which captures the most relevant 
		features of MC applications for cultural tourism and can be reused for 
		designing, in principle, any specific MC application in this domain with 
		a minimum amount of refinement and specialization.</p>
	  <p class=normal> The work which led to the framework definition started 
		from the analysis of the application requirements of the three MUSE case 
		studies: Pompei, Certosa di San Martino, and "Museo di Storia della Scienza 
		di Firenze". Each individual case has some specificity but shares a large 
		set of user needs. These require a common set of design solutions which 
		have been "captured" by the MUSE application framework. To refine and 
		empower the framework, we extended it with a number of features which 
		we abstracted from the analysis of a large number of existing Web applications 
		for cultural tourism. </p>
	  <p class=normal> The MUSE design framework is described using the concepts 
		and notations of the W2000 conceptual design model. W2000, developed within 
		the EU funded project IST - 2000 - 25131 "UWA" (<u>U</u>biquitous <u>Web 
		A</u>pplications), provides the modeling primitives to specify, in an 
		implementation independent way, the various aspects of a multichannel 
		Web application. W2000 distinguishes among the following design tasks 
		(Garzotto et al, 1993, Garzotto et al. 1995, Baresi et al., 2000, Baresi 
		et al. 2001):</p>
	  <ul>
		<li> <i>Information design</i> : it describes the content delivered by 
		  the application. The result of information design is a set of <i>information 
		  design schemas. </i></li>
		<li> <i>Navigation design: </i> it defines how contents are structured 
		  for the purpose of navigation. The result of navigation design is a 
		  set <i>navigation design schemas. </i></li>
		<li><i>Interaction design</i> : it defines the user interaction options 
		  and the dynamic behavior of the application at run time, in response 
		  to the user actions</li>
		<li> <i>Presentation design</i> : it defines how navigation structures 
		  and interaction elements are presented from the delivery device. The 
		  result of presentation design is a set of <i>presentation design schemas 
		  </i> and <i>screen templates. </i></li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class=normal> The notation adopted in W2000 to specify the various schemas 
		is an extension to the Unified Modeling Language UML (Booch 1998, Conallen 
		1999).UML is a software engineering de-facto standard that provides an 
		extendible kit of graphical elements to model, in an object oriented fashion, 
		data structures and behavioral properties of any software application.</p>
	  <p class=normal> A design activity which is orthogonal to the above-mentioned 
		tasks is <i>customization design</i> . During customization design, the 
		designer defines which application features &#151; content, navigation, 
		interaction, presentation &#151; need to be specialized to the context. 
		The term "context", in W2000, comprises all aspects concerning the situation 
		of use: device characteristics, user profile, physical and geographical 
		position, etc. W2000 also distinguishes between <i>customization at design 
		time </i> and <i>customization at run time</i> . Design time customization 
		means that the designer specifies different design schemas to address 
		the needs of different contexts. Run time customization means that a set 
		of adaptation rules define how some detailed design solutions are dynamically 
		adapted to changes of context. </p>
	  <p class=normal> In MC applications for cultural tourism, both design-time 
		customization and run-time customization are needed. Design time customization 
		is needed to specify the content, navigation, and interaction features 
		of the application on each different channel. Context-aware behaviour 
		can be better expressed by using adaptation rules that define which elements 
		must be presented on the current channel in response to user position 
		or orientation changes. </p>
	  <p class=normal> Although MUSE framework provides general patterns for run-time 
		adaptation rules, these are not discussed in this paper for lack of space. 
		In the rest of this section, we will discuss issues related to design-time 
		customization. </p>
	  <p class=normal> The problem of customizing the design to the requirements 
		of a specific channel can be addressed in several ways: </p>
	  <h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">Approach 1: Customization starts during content 
		design. </h4>
	  <p class=normal> Different information design schemas are produced, each 
		one defining the content structures that are specific for each channel. 
		A channel specific navigation schema and presentation schema are defined 
		for each information schema.</p>
	  <h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">Approach 2: Customization is postponed to navigation 
		design. </h4>
	  <p class=normal> The designer specifies a single information schema which 
		defines all possible content structures for all channels. During navigation 
		design, these are filtered and restructured for each specific channel, 
		resulting into a set of channel-specific navigation schemas coupled with 
		the corresponding presentation schema. In data base language, we can say 
		that these navigation schemas define <i>channel specific views </i> on 
		the common pool of information defined by the information schema. </p>
	  <h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">Approach 3: Customization is postponed to presentation 
		design. </h4>
	  <p class=normal> In this case, the designers produces a single information 
		schema, a single navigation schema, and multiple presentation schemas. 
		The specification of channel specific contents and links is described 
		in the presentation structures. </p>
	  <p class=normal> Each approach has different advantages and disadvantages. 
		Approaches 2 and 3 are more effective for authors and implementers. Since 
		the information schema is the "summa" of all information needed for all 
		channels, it can be regarded as an authoring check list, mentioning all 
		content that authors must produce. For implementers, designing the "pool 
		of contents" (i.e., the shared data base upon which the architecture of 
		a multichannel application is built) from a single information schema 
		is easier and less error-prone than designing it from multiple information 
		schemas; for example, the probability of introducing information redundancies 
		and inconsistencies is minimized. The disadvantage of approach 2 is that 
		implementers must look at the navigation schemas in order to identify 
		which content will be delivered to which channels. With approach 3, the 
		implementer must inspect the page structures of each channel-specific 
		presentation schema in order to define the content and link views that 
		are available in each channel.</p>
	  <p class=normal> MUSE has adopted approach 2 (multiple navigation schemas); 
		this seems to be the most effective compromise. In the following sections, 
		we will discuss the general information schema of the MUSE framework, 
		and we will sketch some portions of some channel specific navigation schema. 
		Presentation schemas are omitted for lack of space, and illustrated via 
		some screen examples. Finally, we will discuss some aspects of the interaction 
		design.</p>
	  <h2><i><span class="SubHeader">MUSE</span></i><span class="SubHeader"> Information 
		Design Schema</span></h2>
	  <p class=normal> The MUSE Information Schema includes the main classes of 
		multimedia information elements that satisfy the information requirements 
		of an MC cultural tourism application, abstracting from the requirements 
		of each specific channel. In principle, "any" MC application for cultural 
		tourism can reuse this schema as a design skeleton which can then be filtered 
		and integrated according to the needs of a specific domain. </p>
	  <p class=normal> According to W2000, two main categories of content structures 
		are described in the information schema: <i>hyperbase layer structures 
		</i> and <i>access layer structures</i> . </p>
	  <p class=normal> Hyperbase layer structures define the core content sources 
		of an application. These are described in terms of <i>entity types </i> 
		and <i>semantic association types</i> . Entity types model the main "objects" 
		of the application domain as classes of information structures called 
		"entities". Semantic association types model the relevant relationships 
		among these entities. </p>
	  <p class=normal align="center"> <img src="garzotto_Garzotto.fig3.JPG" width="388" height="466"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 3: The MUSE Hyperbase Information schema - in-the-large 
		view </p>
	  <p class=normal> Figure 3 shows that the relevant classes of information 
		objects deal with Cultural Sites (the tourism places), their Cultural 
		Assets, Buildings, Internal Building Spaces and Open-space areas. In addition, 
		the application may include Maps (more or less sophisticated and rich 
		of multimedia content) and some Help Information. </p>
	  <p class=normal align="left"> Figures 4a and 4b describe the content elements 
		associated to the various entity types (Map Specification is omitted). 
		Content elements within entity types are grouped in sub-structures called 
		Component Types, characterized by a black banner. Except Cultural Place 
		and Map, all entity types share the same content structure. In the object-oriented 
		fashion of UML, this can be specified by defining an <i>Abstract Entity 
		Type - </i> called <i>Object of Interest </i> in our case<i> &#151; </i> and 
		by saying that entity types Building, Cultural Asset, Building Internal 
		Space, Open-Space Area are all sub-classes of Object of Interest (see 
		figure 4b). </p>
	  <p class=normal align="center"><img src="garzotto_Garzotto.fig4a.JPG" width="384" height="340"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption> Figure 4a: The content of Entity Type "Cultural Site"</p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption><img src="garzotto_Garzotto.fig4b.JPG" width="400" height="518"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption> Figure 4b: The content of Entity Type "Cultural Object"</p>
	  <p class=normal> Hyperbase structures define the content "building blocks" 
		of an MC application and classify them according to their intrinsic meaning 
		and nature. Access Layer structure defines groups of hyperbase elements, 
		called <i>Collections, </i> which provide complementary ways of organizing 
		the contents. For example, a collection called "Highlights" is defined 
		to group the most appealing Cultural Objects for a short visit of a cultural 
		site. The goal of access layer structures is to drive the user towards 
		the core application content that is represented by the hyperbase structures: 
		During navigation, access layer structures are traversed before and in 
		order to access the hyperbase. </p>
	  <p class=normal> According to the W2000 design model, a collection is described 
		by its <i>members </i> and by a <i>center</i> . The center is an information 
		element which describes the collection itself, e.g., by listing its members 
		and by providing a short introduction to the collection subject. Collections 
		can group hyperbase elements or other collections. In the latter case 
		they are called <i>nested collections. </i></p>
	  <p class=normal> In the MUSE application framework, the access layer structure 
		includes the following collections: </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>A collection for each entity type, which groups all entities of a 
		  given type ("Buildings", "Cultural Assets", Open Spaces", "Internal 
		  Spaces") . The center of these "By-type" collections includes a list 
		  of member descriptors (e.g. titles and miniaturized picture).</li>
		<li> A collection for each relevant theme, which groups the main entities 
		  relevant for a given topic. The center of a thematic collection includes 
		  a list of member descriptors (e.g. titles and miniaturized picture), 
		  and a short introduction to the collection theme.</li>
		<li>The collection "Highlights", which provides a selection of the most 
		  important elements for a short visit. Its center includes a short introduction 
		  to the visit, and the list of member descriptors which can be eventually 
		  visualized on a map showing where the various elements can be found 
		  on the cultural site.</li>
		<li> The collections "Geographic Tour", which groups "Cultural Objects" 
		  according to spatial criteria (e.g., in a large archeological site like 
		  Pompei, all monuments and assets "around the forum")</li>
		<li> The Collection "Album", which is created by the user while he or 
		  she is using the application as discussed in the memories channel.</li>
		<li>The nested collection "Index of Themes", which groups all the thematic 
		  collections</li>
		<li> The nested collection "Index of Geographic Tours", which groups all 
		  the collections' "Geographic tours" </li>
		<li>The nested collection "Index of Topics", which groups all the "By-Type" 
		  collections </li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">MUSE Navigation Design</h2>
	  <p class=normal> The MUSE Information Schema only describe <i>which contents 
		and groupings </i> are relevant for all possible channels of an MC cultural 
		application. It does not provide any specification of which contents are 
		navigated during the use of the application in a specific channel, nor 
		how they are navigated. These aspects are described by the MUSE Navigation 
		Schemas.</p>
	  <p class=normal> Each channel-specific navigation schema specifies a set 
		of <i>node types </i> and <i>link types</i> . A node is an atomic unit 
		of navigation and presentation in a specific channel. This means that 
		navigation links connect nodes (and not node portions), and the effect 
		of navigation is to activate an entire node: all content items in this 
		node are loaded and made available on the page together (possibly together 
		with other nodes).</p>
	  <p class=normal> During navigation design, the designer should </p>
	  <ol>
		<li>select the information elements in the information schema that are 
		  made available in each specific channel;</li>
		<li><span
class=msoIns><ins datetime="2003-03-01T15:43"></ins></span> group them into nodes;</li>
		<li><span
class=msoIns><ins datetime="2003-03-01T15:43"></ins></span>define the links among 
		  nodes that allow the user to exploit the semantic associations and the 
		  collections defined in the information schema. </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p class=normal> The following diagrams show some portions of the MUSE framework 
		navigation schemas for the different MUSE channels. Fat black arrows identify 
		the entry to some sets of nodes and links; checkmarks identify "landmark" 
		nodes, which can be reached from any node in the hyperspace. </p>
	  <p class=normal> These diagrams shows that the two on-site channels focus 
		on multimedia content which has a more direct, emotional impact on the 
		user and is a more appealing complement to what the user can experience 
		on site. When the user employs these devices, multimedia contents are 
		the first ones to be presented - audio-visual content for the mobile channel, 
		and high resolution, interactive 3D content for the on-site stationary 
		channel. Further (mainly based on static media) deepening can be retrieved 
		on demand. In contrast, the navigation flow on the conventional Web channel 
		starts from text and pictures, and proceeds to multimedia if the user 
		wants further deepening. </p>

	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Muse Interaction Design</h2>
	  <p>Interaction design defines how the users interact with the MC application 
		in each different channel, and how the application behaves in response 
		to user actions. </p>
	  <h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">Interaction in the conventional Web channel </h4>
	  The interaction mode is <i>free browsing</i> , i.e., standard hypertextual 
	  navigation: user can activate any link defined in the navigation model, 
	  and the effect of link execution is to load and display the link destination 
	  node. 
	  <p class="SubHeaderSmall">Interaction on the on-site mobile channel </p>
	  <p class="normal"> MUSE supports three interaction modes: <i>free browsing</i>, 
		<i>context-aware navigation, </i> and <i>memories-building. </i> Context 
		aware navigation is the default, but the user can change interaction mode 
		at any point during a session of use. </p>
	  <h4><i class="SubHeaderSmall">Free browsing </i></h4>
	  <p> This is standard hypertextual navigation as defined for the conventional 
		Web channel. The only difference is that the on-site mobile channel provides 
		different content and navigation structures, as defined by the corresponding 
		navigation schema. In free browsing, context-awareness capabilities of 
		the device are off. What is presented on the device is totally under the 
		user control and is not affected by his/her current position in the physical 
		space. </p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Context-aware navigation </h3>
	  <p> This interaction mode exploits the device capability of detecting the 
		current geographical position of the user and of delivering context-dependent 
		content. MUSE provides different forms of context-aware navigation which 
		offer different levels of visibility of the content and different levels 
		of control by the user:</p>
	  <h4 class="SubHeaderSmall">Pure context-aware navigation </h4>
	  <p> In this interaction mode, the application has the complete control. 
		When the user reaches a place or an object in the tourist site associated 
		to some audio-visual content, the device automatically delivers this information 
		on the mobile device. It plays until its end, or until the user reaches 
		a different position which is associated to a different content. The users 
		are largely passive. They can only control the state of multimedia elements 
		(e.g., suspending or resuming or stopping the audio-visual presentation) 
		or switch to a different interaction mode.</p>
	  <h4><i class="SubHeaderSmall">Guided context-aware navigation </i></h4>
	  <p> <span class="normal">This interaction mode enhances pure context aware 
		navigation with the notion of guided navigation. The application guides 
		the users along a path on the site they are visiting, pinpointing the 
		relevant objects there. These objects correspond to those grouped by the 
		collections "Highlights", "Thematic Tours", "Geographical Tours". At any 
		point of time, what is presented to the user is calculated by the application 
		on the basis of both the user current position in the physical space and 
		the currently active guided tour. The interaction metaphor is the vehicle 
		satellite navigator: after the users have selected a tour of interest, 
		the application highlights the path on an active map and shows the users' 
		current positions. If the users reach a place or an object, either inside 
		or outside the current path, which is associated to some audio-visual 
		content, the device automatically loads and (dis)plays it. The application 
		can detect any user deviation from the current tour path; wandering causes 
		a sound warning and the display on the map of the shortest path to reach 
		the currently active tour. In guided context-aware mode, the users are 
		slightly less passive than in pure context-aware navigation. Beside controlling 
		the state of multimedia elements (e.g., suspending or resuming or stopping 
		the audio-visual presentation) and changing interaction mode, the users 
		can ask for the map display, can change tour by returning to the tour 
		selection menu, or can continue the exploration on a different tour. The 
		latter possibility is available only when the users reach a place at the 
		intersection of different tours. These tours are shown on the map and 
		the users can choose any of them (the selection becomes the currently 
		active tour).</span> </p>
	  <h4><i class="SubHeader">Integrated context-aware navigation. </i></h4>
	  <p> It merges the capabilities of free navigation and context aware navigation. 
		After the application displays some content in response to a change of 
		user position or orientation, the users are allowed to explore related 
		content and to browse as they can do in free navigation mode. Since the 
		context-aware capability remains on, any physical movement of the users 
		may cause a position-dependent replacement of the content which is currently 
		active on the device. </p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmaller">Memories-building mode </h3>
	  <p class="normal"> The memories-building mode provides the users with the 
		operations needed to manipulate the content for the CD memories channel. 
		At any point during the use of the mobile device, the users can execute 
		any of the following operations:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal">mark the currently displayed screen or take 
		  a picture of what they are looking at (using a digital camera incorporated 
		  in Whyere). The effect of these operation is to update the memory album 
		  </span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> view and navigate the memories album</span></li>
		<li class="normal"> <span class="normal"> modify the memory album by deleting some selected 
		  items, re-ordering them, or including comments and annotations</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <p> Any of the above operations activates the memories-building mode and 
		suspends the current interaction mode, which can be resumed after the 
		completion of the operations.</p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmaller">On-site stationary channel </h3>
	  <p> In any place where the on-site stationary channel (a large screen controlled 
		by a powerful graphic station) is available, users can switch to this 
		channel and interact with it. What appears on the large screen is not 
		a zoomed display of what is presented on the mobile device, but complementary 
		high-resolution, interactive multimedia content which is related to the 
		place where the stationary channel is located. Using the on-site mobile 
		device as a control and pointing device, users can operate on the state 
		of multimedia elements, explore the 3D space, and traverse navigational 
		links. The content space available for navigation is a view of the whole 
		content designed for the on-line stationary channel, filtered according 
		to the position of the stationary device. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Muse Presentation Design</h2>
	  <p> The goal of presentation design is to define how contents and interaction 
		elements are displayed on the different delivery channels. This activity 
		comprises two sub-tasks: defining, for each channel, the <i>conceptual 
		presentation</i> and the <i>concrete presentation</i> . Conceptual presentation 
		defines <i>which </i> content and interaction elements are displayed simultaneously 
		on the screen. Concrete presentation defines their lay-out graphical properties 
		- space allocation, colors, typographical properties, images frames, etc.. 
	  </p>
	  <p> The MUSE presentation framework mainly addresses conceptual presentation 
		which can be reasonably shared and reused by a large number of applications 
		in the tourism domain. Concrete presentation is largely "application specific" 
		and may take into account the general visual communication strategy of 
		the client institution. </p>
	  <p> The MUSE conceptual presentation framework comprises a presentation 
		schema for each different channel. Each presentation schema defines a 
		set of <i>conceptual page templates </i> which specify the types of nodes 
		and links that must appear on the screen of a specific channel (Strothotte 
		1998). For lack of space, in this section we will focus on the presentation 
		design for the on-site mobile channel only. </p>
	  <p> Given the limited size of the mobile device screen Whyre (6.4 inches), 
		each page template includes a single node type and a placeholder for all 
		link types outgoing from that node type in the navigation schema of the 
		on-site mobile channel. Another constraining aspects of the on-site mobile 
		channel which has an impact on presentation design is the lack of any 
		pointing device, like a mouse, a trackball or a hand touch, to allow users 
		to directly select any point on the screen. To interact with the system 
		(e.g., to activate a link), the users must rely upon <i>physical buttons</i> 
		available on the screen plastic frame. This factor introduces some intriguing 
		requirements for concrete presentation: it forces the presentation designer 
		to have a limited number of interaction elements on the screen and to 
		place them in a position which allows users to "select" them using physical 
		buttons only. </p>
	  <p> The Whyre "keyboard" includes four hardwired buttons and six "multimodal" 
		buttons. The hardwired keys support the following functions: <i>undo, 
		SOS (help), orientation, take a picture</i> .</p>
	  <p> The multimodal buttons are symmetrically located on both sides of the 
		device. In this way, they are easily reachable by the users. As shown 
		in the following pictures, each interaction element is placed on the screen 
		close to a multimodal button which can be used to select that interaction 
		element. Pressing the button executes the closest interaction element. 
		The semantics of a multimodal button (which is the reason for this name) 
		depends on the semantics of the closest interaction element. </p>
	  <p> The first screen displayed in figure 7 is the entry point ("home") of 
		the Pompei application on the on-site mobile channel. The following interaction 
		choices are available:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li> Get an introductory presentation on the site</li>
		<li>Show the site map</li>
		<li> Select a navigation mode (one key for each mode)</li>
		<li>Get help on the current screen</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p> By pressing the closest button to the "Site map label" (see left image 
		&#151; last button on the right side), the map of the archeological site, organized 
		in different "insulas", is displayed (see right image). </p>

	  <p align=center class="MsoCaption"> Figure 7: From the virtual entrance 
		of Pompei to the site map</p>
	  <p> In Figure 8 we see the effects of pressing a different button (the mid 
		right button in the left image). We suppose that the users are in the 
		integrated context aware mode. When they enter <i>La Casa del Centenario</i> 
		in Pompei, their position is detected by the application: an image showing 
		the house atrium automatically appears (see left side image), and a sound 
		comment starts. The users can choose a deeper description by pressing 
		the mid left button, and can virtually enter the <i>atrium</i> as it was 
		before the 79 A.C. Vesuvius eruption, according to the reconstruction 
		validated by the archaeologists (see the right side image) (Scagliarini, 
		2001).</p>

	  <p> Figure 9 provides an example of the multimodal behaviour of buttons 
		and of guided context aware navigation. After the orientation hardwired 
		button is pressed, the application displays the site map showing the visitors' 
		position and orientation, as well as the list of the reachable places 
		belonging to the current guided tour (left side image). If a desired place 
		is selected by pressing the mid right button (see left image) the application 
		displays a zoomed map (see right image), showing the area included between 
		the visitors' current location and the selected section, and the recommended 
		connecting path. </p>

	  <h1 class="SubHeaderSmall">The Muse Interface Implementation Framework </h1>
	  <p>The Muse interface implementation framework is called <i>MuseXP</i>. 
		It consists of a pair of interface definition tools (an editor and a compiler) 
		coupled to an interface-independent execution engine (called <i>MuseXP 
		Runner</i>). With <i>MuseXP</i>, MC systems interface design is approached 
		at a higher level of abstraction with respect to standard Web applications. 
		<i>MuseXP</i> targets are channel-specific interfaces in the cultural 
		heritage domain. The framework is designed to be reconfigurable in order 
		to be reused in other domains, should the opportunity arise.</p>
	  <p>Within <i>MuseXP</i> each channel-specific navigation and interaction 
		design is mapped on to an XML file called <i>ch_interface.xml</i>. This 
		file is a centralized interface control point easily handled by its creator 
		and easily interpreted by the interface independent execution engine. 
		XML (standing for <i>eXtensible Markup Language</i>) was chosen for its 
		extensibility: XML syntax was programmed with a number of tags finalized 
		to the MuseMC system semantics. Interface presentation design is implemented 
		filling in device-dependent HTML pages with the screen layouts and the 
		graphic objects.</p>
	  <h4 class="SubHeader">MuseXP Interface design workflow</h4>
	  <p>Given the conceptual design of a specific interface within a <i>MCMuse</i> 
		system, how is the operational design carried out? How is the interface 
		implemented on the target device? </p>
	  <p>In terms of the <i>MuseXP</i> architecture, these questions need to be 
		read as follows: how are the <i>ch_interface.xml</i> file and the screen 
		graphic layouts created? How are they processed on the target device by 
		the <i>MuseXPRunner</i>?</p>
	  <p>Fig. 10 is a block diagram of the <i>MuseXP</i> system currently under 
		development within the MUSE project.</p>
	  <p align="center"><img src="garzotto_Garzotto.fig10.JPG" width="397" height="445"></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption"> Figure 10: Overview of MuseXP workflow</p>
	  <p>Within the envisaged framework, the interface operational design is split 
		into three steps:</p>
	  <ol>
		<li>Navigation and interaction specification</li>
		<li>HTML containers generation</li>
		<li>Interface graphic design </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>The first activity is expected to be carried out using a MUSE specific 
		visual tool called <i>MuseXP editor</i> currently under development. <i> 
		Muse XP editor</i> maps the interface navigation and interaction designs 
		into the text file <i>ch_interface.xml. </i>Since the editor is not yet 
		available, <i>ch_interface.xml</i> has to be generated using an uncommitted 
		text editor.</p>
	  <p>The second step is carried out automatically by an off-line tool called 
		<i>MuseXP Compiler.</i></p>
	  <p> The<i> compiler</i> generates a tree of all HTML pages required to implement 
		the interface. These pages are called "<i>HTML containers</i> " because 
		at this stage they only include the qualified structure-definition objects 
		(i.e. the references to the required viewers and their attributes), but 
		they do not include any graphic and metric layout information for the 
		page presentation. The "HTML containers" pool is the set of all presentation 
		instances, hierarchically arranged as declared in <i>ch_interface.xml</i> 
		. There are no hypertextual links among these "Web pages". Navigation 
		within the pool will be performed by the execution engine according to 
		<i>ch_interface.xml</i> specifications. Each page is externally controlled 
		according to the DHTML extension <i>DOM</i> (<i>Document Object Model)</i>. 
		In this way the contents to be delivered may be specified at run time. 
	  </p>
	  <p> The third step consists of the actual presentation implementation. During 
		this step the graphic objects used throughout the interface are created 
		and the <i>HTML containers</i> are filled up with the missing presentation 
		items.</p>
	  <p> This activity can be carried out by Web interface designers or persons 
		with similar skills, using standard graphics tools as well as HTML visual 
		editors. </p>
	  <p> Once the HTML containers are graphically filled, they are saved on the 
		target device with the <i>ch_interface.xml:</i> <i> </i> together, they 
		specify the run-time rules-of-behaviour to <i>MuseXPRunner, </i> the execution 
		engine<i> </i> that implements the designed interface.</p>
	  <p>The proposed framework has many advantages with respect to interface 
		specific implementations: </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>run time specification of both contents and page layout make a channel-specific 
		  interface reusable in many applications of the same domain </li>
		<li>an interface independent execution engine cancels programming from 
		  the list of design and implementation activities</li>
		<li>Separating structure from graphics is an additional answer to the 
		  complexity handling problem: it reduces the skills required for the 
		  most time-consuming tasks and it makes for easier design management 
		  (graphic layout, for example, can be modified without having to recompile 
		  the interface structure)<b> </b></li>
	  </ul>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusions </h1>
	  <p>State-of-the-art Web technologies offer the opportunity to deliver interactive 
		multimedia content on-demand. Similarly, hardware technologies offer a 
		wider and wider variety of devices, providing ergonomy and interaction 
		modes much better customized to the users' context and location than a 
		standard PC. These devices range from wireless connected mobile terminals 
		exhibiting small and bright screens to large plasma display providing 
		nearly immersive fruition in dedicated areas. The combination of these 
		technologies within the same system offers the potential to provide ubiquitous 
		services originating from the same information base and properly optimized 
		to the fruition conditions. The user interfaces in such multichannel systems 
		are different from standard Web clients. Web technology may be used, but 
		the application design should be approached at a higher level of abstraction. 
		Within the project MUSE this multichannel paradigm is currently under 
		investigation. A framework supporting the design and implementation of 
		heterogeneous interfaces in multichannel environments was developed, and 
		its use in cultural tourism applications has been described in this paper. 
		The framework was used to implement mobile and stationary on-site and 
		off-site channels for three MC systems addressing three cultural tourism 
		"case studies": the <i>insula del Centenario</i> in the archaeological 
		area of Pompei, the <i>History of Science Museum</i> in Florence, and 
		a section of la <i>Certosa di San Martin,o</i> the outstanding historical 
		Museum of the city of Napoli. The MUSE system will be demonstrated at 
		these locations later this year, as soon as Whyre, the interactive multimedia 
		terminal specially designed for on-site fruition in cultural heritage 
		establishments, is ready. </p>
