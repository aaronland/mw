	  <p class=PaperTitle>Practicing What We Teach: How Learning Theory Can Guide 
		Development of Online Educational Activities</p>
	  <p class=Author>David T. Schaller and Steven Allison-Bunnell, Educational 
		Web Adventures (Eduweb), USA</p>
	  <p class=AbstractTitle>&nbsp;Abstract</p>
	  <p class=AbstractText>Since the World Wide Web became in 1994 the first 
		new mass medium since television, online learning design has evolved at 
		Internet speed, taking in less than a decade what it took exhibit design 
		over a century to develop in sophistication. Although virtual exhibits 
		consisting of pictures and text are still common, educational Web designers 
		increasingly employ techniques borrowed from interactive exhibit developers, 
		video game producers, and museum educators to create compelling activities 
		that fully exploit the strengths of the new medium. Constructivist learning 
		theory often informs these new approaches. However, transplanting learning 
		theory from the classroom or museum environment to the Web poses unique 
		challenges. In this paper, we review several theories of learning and 
		explore ways that we have tried to incorporate them into our development 
		and design process for interactive Web sites.</p>
	  <p class=AbstractText>Constructivism underlies much educational practice 
		in museums and is the basis for all of the learning theories we survey 
		in this paper. Each of these, however, clarifies, expands upon, or revises 
		the notion of constructivism in ways that can help Web designers better 
		conceptualize and execute their projects. For example, Kolb's model of 
		learning styles highlights the structure of the learning process. This 
		model offers insight into how to make Web media go beyond the convergent/logical 
		learning that comes easiest to computer-based learning, and to teach divergent, 
		practical, and social learners. Similarly, Gardner's checklist of multiple 
		entry points offers a valuable perspective on diversity in learning, prompting 
		us to look for ways to engage various intelligences in one package. Most 
		dramatically, Egan's notion of developmental "kinds of understanding" 
		frees us from the strict constructivist demand to account for the concrete 
		prior knowledge of our mostly anonymous online audiences. Instead of attempting 
		that impossible feat, or ignoring the issue entirely, we can engage children's 
		and adults' imaginative capacities with stories about profound abstractions, 
		the limits of reality and experience, and our place in the world.</p>

	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
	  <p class=normal>For the purposes of this paper, we wish to offer a fairly 
		demanding definition of "interactivity" as applied to online learning 
		materials. Given the present pervasiveness of random-access devices, from 
		audio CD-players to even the most rudimentary Web sites, merely being 
		able to choose what to see or read is no longer very challenging to conceptualize 
		or produce. Reaching higher, we see the paragon of interactivity involving 
		at least some of the following, non-mutually-exclusive elements:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li span class=normal> <span calss=normal> Enabling two-way communication 
		  between real people, whether in real time or not. Failing that, simulating 
		  the richness of two-way person-to-person communication with the computer 
		  via narrative devices, visual and interface design, and the underlying 
		  information architecture is a common way to automate what is otherwise 
		  time and resource-intensive.</span></li>
		<li span class=normal> <span calss=normal> Offering the user "productive 
		  decision-making opportunities" (Strohkorb 2002). This means going beyond 
		  offering menus of choices to select from, and involves providing an 
		  infrastructure for helping the users to construct their own chain of 
		  inference and meaning. Giving the users the ability to experience the 
		  consequences of their choices is at the heart of state-of-the-art interactivity 
		  and game-based learning theory (Prensky 2001, Schank 1992).</span></li>
		<li span class=normal> <span calss=normal> Giving the users something 
		  to <i>do</i> rather than something to <i>see</i>. Manipulation of objects 
		  and ideas that produce a new construct is crucial to a strong form of 
		  interactivity (see discussion of "Creative Production" activities below). 
		  Merely manipulating an interface widget is not in and of itself interactive 
		  in a meaningful way.</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Defining what makes a Web site "educational" 
		  is just about as slippery as nailing down what counts as interactive. 
		  Again, we favor a strong definition that includes these basic characteristics:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li span class=normal> <span calss=normal> Learning goals or outcomes 
		  that can be explicitly articulated by the designers (if only after the 
		  fact)</span></li>
		<li span class=normal> <span calss=normal> A clearly focused subject domain</span></li>
		<li span class=normal> <span calss=normal> Scaffolding to help the users 
		  develop a skill or increase knowledge under the structured guidance 
		  of the program. Thus, a database, by itself, may be a tremendous research 
		  tool, but it may not actively help the users develop expertise in using 
		  it or understanding the subject domain (Jonassen <i>et al</i>, 1999).</span></li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class=normal>The learning theory most commonly known as constructivism 
		holds that learning "is not a simple addition of items into some sort 
		of mental data bank but a transformation of schemas in which the learner 
		plays an active role and which involves making sense out of a range of 
		phenomena" (Hein 1998). Designing learning experiences that facilitate 
		such active meaning making while engaging a generation raised on a steady 
		diet of video games and fast-paced television is the ongoing challenge 
		facing formal and informal educators alike. Computers add to the challenge, 
		since it is all too easy to design computer programs that substitute sophisticated 
		but passive representations for the healthy (and fun) cognitive work of 
		learning. How can we, as practitioners of educational Web design, apply 
		current theories of learning to our development process and final products?</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">One Size Fits None</h1>
	  <p class=normal>While the theoretical and descriptive frameworks of learning 
		theory vary widely, there is consensus that people perceive and process 
		information in many ways. Some of these theories apply general personality 
		theory to learning while others derive from studies of the learning process 
		itself. Each seems coherent enough on its own. But can they all be right? 
		Should we try to accommodate them all in our development philosophy and 
		process? Guild and Garger (1998) suggest that we are in a pre-paradigmatic 
		phase of learning style research. The blind researchers have each described 
		a different part of the elephant, but have not yet synthesized their findings 
		into a picture of the whole beast.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Of the many theories about learning styles, we have found 
		David Kolb's experiential learning theory (ELT), first developed in the 
		1970s, to offer us valuable insights. Kolb emphasizes the importance of 
		experience in the learning process and draws on research by Dewey and 
		Piaget, among others, to identify two major dimensions of learning: perception 
		and processing. Each dimension has two extremes: perception ranges from 
		concrete experience to abstract conceptualization, and processing ranges 
		from reflective observation to active experimentation. These two dimensions 
		form a four-quadrant model (Figure 1).</p>

	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 1. Kolb's model of learning styles. Adapted from 
		Kolb et al. 1999.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Kolb's model of learning styles reveals another challenge: 
		how to engage these various ways of learning via a flat computer screen. 
		The Web as an "information superhighway" is ideal for Assimilating Learners 
		who prefer reading and reflective analysis. But what about Accommodating 
		Learners who prefer social environments, or Divergent Learners who need 
		to brainstorm and obtain personal feedback? Can online activities effectively 
		engage them? We are currently planning a research study to investigate 
		these questions further, but we have already made some attempts to put 
		Kolb's theory into practice. <i>The Artist's Toolkit </i>(<a
href="http://www.artsconnected.org/toolkit"><b>http://www.artsconnected.org/toolkit</b></a>), 
		developed with The Minneapolis Institute of Art and the Walker Arts Center, 
		offers four ways to explore a series of art elements and principles (Table

	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Connecting Learning Styles and Activity Types</h1>
	  <p class=MsoBodyText>By examining differences in mental processing preferences, 
		Kolb's model also suggests ways that online activities can engage different 
		<span class="normal">types</span> of learners. We have hypothesized plausible 
		links between Kolb's styles and our own typology of online activities 
		(Schaller <i>et al</i>., 2002) as follows:</p>
	  <p class=normal><i>Role-Play </i>activities allow users to adopt a persona 
		different from their own, giving them the ability to do things they cannot 
		ordinarily do (e.g. break natural or societal laws, experience people 
		and places normally out of reach). They can also interact with other characters, 
		whose behavior either may be scripted or controlled by other players. 
		(True social interaction on the Web, i.e. direct communication with other 
		people, is one of its key strengths, but it also poses many challenges 
		with a school-age audience, from privacy concerns to risks of inappropriate 
		communication. This means that many activities that could in principle 
		take advantage of the technology to connect real people with one another 
		must substitute interaction with the program.) We hypothesized that the 
		Role-Play activity type may appeal to those with a strong Accommodating 
		learning style.</p>
	  <p class=normal><i>Simulation</i> employs a model of the real world that 
		users can manipulate to explore a system. It involves direct engagement 
		with representations of data with some degree of generalization or abstraction. 
		While many activities may have an underlying simulation or model that 
		generates the activity decision tree, "simulation" as used here is explicitly 
		framed as such in its presentation to the user, and is used to develop 
		conceptual understanding of a complex system. We hypothesized that this 
		activity type may appeal more strongly to people with either an Assimilating 
		or Converging learning style.</p>
	  <p class=normal><i>Puzzle/Mystery</i> involves analysis and deductive or 
		inductive reasoning to reach a logical solution. The user relies on evidence 
		from people, nature, or reference material provided by the activity to 
		solve the problem. We hypothesized that this activity type may be more 
		appealing to people with either an Assimilating or Converging learning

	  <p class=normal><i>Creative Production </i>emphasizes both open-ended self-expression 
		and the application of subject knowledge and concepts to building some 
		kind of product such as a story, a picture, a movie, etc. We hypothesized 
		that this activity type may appeal more often than the other types to 
		the Divergent learning style.</p>
	  <p class=normal>With these associations in mind, we sought to offer a variety 
		of learning experiences in a suite of educational Web activities, <i>Shedd 
		Educational Adventures (SEA)</i> (<a href="http://www.sheddaquarium.org/sea" target="_blank">www.sheddaquarium.org/sea</a>), 
		developed in partnership with the John. G. Shedd Aquarium. We should emphasize 
		that we do not see each activity type appealing solely to a single learning 
		style. Rather, different learners will utilize each type of activity differently. 
		As developers, recognizing the strengths of each activity type and the 
		learners it appeals to most strongly helps us avoid building activities 
		that appeal merely to our <i>own</i> learning styles.</p>
	  <p class=normal><i>Squish the Fish </i>(Figure 6) is an interactive role-play 
		story for primary-grade children (grades K-2). Although users do not explicitly 
		assume the role of Squish, they guide him through a dangerous journey 
		across a coral reef. Squish has the ability to shape-shift and color-shift 
		to avoid predators, and users can vicariously go along for the ride. While 
		experiencing no social interaction with other people in real time, users 
		do meet a variety of talking fish and other undersea creatures that personify 
		the various adaptations that Squish uses to stay alive, thus attempting 
		to engage Accommodating learners.</p>

	  <p class=normal><i>Build-a-Fish</i> (Figure 7) is a simulation with a touch 
		of creative production, intended for upper primary students (grades 3-5). 
		Players design a fish and then navigate it around a detailed coral reef, 
		trying to eat other fish and avoid being eaten in turn. This pragmatic 
		challenge engages Convergent Learners, while Assimilating Learners can 
		review didactic content to inform their hypotheses of which fish designs 
		will be most successful.</p>

	  <p class=normal><i>Mysteries of Apo Island</i> (Figure 8) is designed for 
		middle school students (grades 6-8), and offers clues that the user must 
		analyze and synthesize to solve a series of mysteries. While exploring 
		a map of Apo Island in the Philippines, users encounter stories and personal 
		observations of strange animal behavior. Each of these can be collected 
		in the users' notebooks, where they can then compare the clues and sort 
		them into groups by species. In this way the activity is an "open-ended 
		mystery." While the clues do match up to correct solutions, users are 
		not funneled toward solutions, as they would be in a branching story structure. 
		Instead, users must use logical deduction to hypothesize solutions and 
		then ask a local biologist to check their conclusions.</p>

	  <p class=normal>We initially planned to develop a simulation for the high 
		school audience (grades 9-10). But due to conceptual issues (detailed 
		below) and budgetary constraints, we turned instead to an interactive 
		reference module. In <i>Conservation Investigation: Seahorses</i> (Figure 
		9), students can explore a conservation issue through primary and secondary 
		sources and write a newspaper editorial based on their research. The students 
		assume the role of investigative reporters and are offered a range of 
		materials about seahorse conservation grouped according to how journalists 
		might research the story: field observations, interviews, and library 
		materials. In writing the final product, the students are guided by a 
		template that encourages logical organization and solid evidence to supporttheir 
		opinion. This combines role-play and creative production elements, but 
		in a less fanciful, more serious fashion for this more mature age group.</p>

	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Integrating Learning Styles into One Activity</h1>
	  <p class=normal>One of the challenges of using Kolb's framework is that 
		while it is clear how to match a particular learning style with a particular 
		activity type, Kolb offers less guidance in creating a single activity 
		that can meet the needs of learners with multiple learning styles. Howard 
		Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences has earned wide acclaim and 
		regard from both formal and informal educators. By examining many cognitive 
		modalities, his theory inspires us to stretch the Web's capabilities to 
		engage many different kinds of learners. Table 2 shows how Gardner's Entry 
		Point Approach outlines ways to provide multiple entry points to a single 
		learning experience "to accommodate the different lenses through which 
		learners see" (Davis and Gardner, 1993).</p>

	  <p class=normal><b><i>Build-a-Fish</i></b><i>. </i>Younger students (3<sup>rd</sup>

		designs without logically considering the causes and effects of each choice. 
		Middle school students, however, usually did prefer the Logical entry 
		point and were often quite methodical in testing each combination of fish 
		design options. Aesthetic engagement was seen in requests for a larger 
		variety of fish body parts and colors to choose from. Further evaluation 
		is required to determine whether the game was simply too challenging for 
		third graders to use more logical approaches without teacher guidance 
		or whether children favor different learning styles at different developmental 
		stages.</p>
	  <p class=normal><b><i>Mysteries of Apo Island</i></b><i>. </i>Middle school 
		students responded well to the Narrative entry point, sometimes making 
		up their own scenarios about why a shark might behave in a way consistent 
		with the clues. As is discussed below, younger middle school students 
		had trouble with the Logical aspects of the activity, and frequently were 
		unable to develop the chain of inference that would let them solve the 
		mystery.</p>
	  <p class=normal><b><i>Conservation Investigation: Seahorses</i></b><i>. 
		</i>Teachers evaluating this activity felt that the Logical guidance offered 
		in structuring the research and writing exercise would be helpful and 
		appropriate for this age level.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Kinds of Understanding</h1>
	  <p class=normal>As noted above, current learning theory holds that learning 
		involves a transformation of mental schemas, from flawed and incomplete 
		to truer and more complete (Bransford <i>et al.</i> 2000). To facilitate 
		such transformations most effectively, educators must understand their 
		students' prior knowledge, experiences, and most critically, their misconceptions 
		about the subject. Only by tackling such misconceptions directly can educators 
		effectively help learners to overcome them and achieve a truer (more accurate) 
		understanding of the world (Borun 1990, Hein 1998). Much of our knowledge 
		of such misconceptions derives from Piaget's research. Indeed, much of 
		contemporary learning theory is based on his work, which mainly investigated 
		children's learning about the physical world and mathematics (Egan 1998). 
		In such domains, hands-on experimentation is invaluable as a way to bring 
		"students' earlier models or misconceptions into sharp focus [through] 
		an experience that directly challenges the viability of the model they 
		have been favoring" (Gardner 1991). Exploring a parallel phenomenon in 
		the humanities, Gardner discusses the persistence of stereotypes, scripts 
		and simplifications such as "the 'bad man' theory" of history, even among 
		well-educated college students (<i>Ibid.</i>). To transform such misconceptions, 
		a strict constructivist approach would start with familiar and concrete 
		objects and places before moving to the distant and abstract.</p>
	  <p class=normal>A teacher can discover her students' misconceptions and 
		stereotypes from a class discussion at the start of a lesson. Similarly, 
		museums conduct front-end research studies to ascertain their audiences' 
		pre-existing knowledge and misconceptions and stereotypes (also called 
		preconceptions and naïve notions) about a program or exhibit topic. This 
		task is challenging enough when exhibits attract visitors of many ages 
		and experiences. On the Web, which attracts learners of all ages in varying 
		settings from around the globe, trying to determine pre-existing knowledge 
		and misconceptions is even more daunting. When learning theory calls for 
		an emphasis on what is familiar to learners, the challenge becomes difficult 
		indeed.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Educational theorist Kieran Egan offers a way out of this 
		dilemma by<span class="normal"> </span>re-imagining what <i>kinds </i>of 
		knowledge come naturally to learners at each stage of development (Egan 
		1988, 1992, 1998). He argues that our powerful imaginative capacities 
		are much more effective (and <i>a</i>ffective) avenues to learning than 
		the prosaic approaches advocated by Piaget's strictest adherents. Even 
		young children have a deep (if difficult to articulate) understanding 
		of certain profound abstract concepts such as good/bad, beauty/ugliness 
		and survival/destruction. Medieval fairy tales and the <i>Star Wars</i> 
		movies would have little hold on children if this were not the case. These 
		abstractions have deep affective meaning for children (and adults) and 
		thus are very powerful ways to present new material.</p>
	  <p class=normal>*While the first three phases occur fairly naturally in 
		human development, the latter two require substantial guidance and support 
		for an individual to achieve.</p>

	  <p class=normal>&nbsp;Each new kind of understanding builds on previous 
		stages. As young children, we begin to organize the world by dividing 
		everything into binary opposites. Only after we have created basic categories 
		can we start to refine our mental organization of the world, typically 
		by exploring the extremes of reality (from the tallest human to a hero 
		who transcends limitations and adversity) to better understand our own 
		place within this order. It is after gaining a sense of the range and 
		variety of experiences that we start thinking about how they all relate 
		to one another. The philosophic level propels the search for causal connections 
		that have birthed theories from Marxism to the second gunman on the grassy 
		knoll. Acquiring the ability to construct such general schema can trigger 
		a period as a "true believer" with tunnel vision, but with some outside 
		support, we can ultimately achieve Ironic understanding, or a deep appreciation 
		that every theory contains some truth but none can claim to be The Truth. 
		This doesn't mean that adults who have reached this phase can't enjoy 
		an occasional <i>Star Wars</i> movie, for the "simplistic" theme of good 
		vs. evil still resonates deep within us, but that we can appreciate it 
		for what it is without then interpreting real international affairs through 
		the same lens.</p>
	  <p class=normal>&nbsp;What Egan's theory offers us as designers of online 
		learning experiences is valuable guidance about the kinds of abstractions 
		people will find innately relevant and meaningful. We were inspired by 
		these ideas during the development of the Shedd Educational Adventures 
		online activities with the Shedd Aquarium. Since this project entailed 
		producing online learning modules for five grade groups: K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 
		9-10, and 11-12, we kept Egan's kinds of understanding in mind during 
		our development process, letting them inform the themes we developed and 
		the stories we told.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Mythic Understanding and Squish the Fish</h2>
	  <p class=normal>The learning goals for elementary grade activities centered 
		on fish adaptations and easily lent themselves to stories of danger and 
		survival. Squish the Fish and Big Tooth Blob, cartoon characters from 
		Shedd's existing education materials, embody the struggle for survival 
		which children so easily grasp. Squish must travel across the reef, looking 
		for friends who have successful shape, color and behavioral adaptations 
		to protect themselves from Big Tooth Blob. Children instinctively understand 
		the binary opposites of safety and danger and this, rather than any reference 
		to the concrete world of our child-audience, is the theme that carries 
		the message.</p>
	  <p class=normal>&nbsp;Amplifying the safety-danger theme meant making Big 
		Tooth Blob a pure predator with no sympathetic traits. However, since 
		his name and appearance are more comical than threatening, he is portrayed 
		as simply hungry, rather than as menacing or malevolent. Thus no one clamored 
		to give Big Tooth's side of the story. With a subject such as history, 
		resistance to binary stereotyping from either the target audience or teachers 
		and subject experts would pose more problems.</p>
	  <p class=normal>&nbsp;The real question is whether the story is mythic <i>enough</i>. 
		Using the term in a similar way, Rounds (2002) describes the tension between 
		mythic and scientific thinking, arguing that museum visitors often interpret 
		science content in mythic terms. The factual content is not what interests 
		them. It is the meaning they can make from the stories that is important, 
		and they judge those stories by their affective authenticity, not by their 
		factual accuracy. The mythical aspect of the safety-danger theme in Squish 
		gives the story some degree of affective authenticity, but our real goal 
		centered on communicating the factual content about various organisms 
		and their adaptations. Squish succeeds because it offers a scientifically 
		credible mythic framework for the more abstract and emotionally neutral 
		concept of adaptation as an evolutionary response to survival and predation. 
		We want to emphasize that deploying a mythic theme that does not naturally 
		stem from the content in an activity such as this will only undermine 
		its educational value for the learner and its credibility with the teacher.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Romantic Understanding and The Mysteries of Apo Island</h2>
	  <p class=normal>The Shedd's learning goal for this activity was shark biodiversity 
		&#8212; showcasing "the many kinds of sharks and their fascinating adaptations 
		and behavior." Exploring this theme through the romantic fascination with 
		the exotic and bizarre ("the limits of reality and extremes of experience," 
		in Egan's terms) was straightforward enough, since there are plenty of 
		odd shark adaptations and behaviors from which to choose. The challenge 
		lay in taking it beyond a "trivia quiz" approach that might prove intriguing 
		but would still consist of informational dead-ends. Our goal was to design 
		an activity that leveraged the romantic fascination with exotica into 
		a larger learning experience that developed synthetic reasoning skills. 
		For that we turned to a mystery format. The trivia were made into clues 
		that, if examined and integrated, provided the solutions to the mystery. 
		Thus we hoped to foster a romantic understanding of shark biodiversity 
		within a deductive reasoning process, thereby suggesting the path ahead 
		to philosophic understanding.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Pilot testing indicated that shark exotica were indeed successful 
		in engaging the students' attention. Some also responded quite enthusiastically 
		to the deductive structure of the activity, while others (especially students 
		at the lower end of the grade 6-8 target range) enjoyed the clues but 
		found the mystery befuddling. That kind of synthesis is more characteristic 
		of philosophic understanding, and so it shouldn't be surprising that some 
		12-year-olds found it too challenging.</p>
	  <p class=normal>In another example of Rounds' mythic-scientific distinction, 
		we also found that students sometimes assumed the solution would focus 
		on an <i>individual</i> shark rather than a shark species as a <i>group</i>. 
		Students would spin their own stories about "a bad shark" that attacked 
		the boat and other sharks, fantasizing many details that were quite out 
		of character for the mystery itself. Of course, the mystery format (as 
		well as most appearances of sharks in popular culture) encourages this 
		interpretation. Our own scientific-mindedness had blinded us to the likelihood 
		of this result. We have since emphasized the idea of species as groups 
		in the activity text, but we await summative evaluation to see whether 
		that makes any difference.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Philosophic and Ironic Understanding and an Ill-fated 
		Simulation</h2>
	  <p class=normal>Inspired by Sherry Turkle's call for "simulations that teach 
		about the nature of simulation itself, that teach enough about how to 
		build [your] own simulation that [you become] a literate 'reader' of the 
		new medium," we decided to tackle just such an effort (Turkle 1997). Building 
		on a coral reef management simulation already produced for Shedd, we imagined 
		letting students "under the hood" of the simulation so they could tinker 
		with its assumptions and parameters. We were motivated by our own awareness 
		that every model has both descriptive power and predictive blind spots. 
		We wanted students to be able explore how the hidden assumptions and underlying 
		logic of a model can dramatically affect the simulation's portrayal of 
		the real world.</p>
	  <p class=normal>However, presenting this concept to high school teachers 
		in focus groups led us to abandon it. The teachers felt that orienting 
		students in this age group to a model of ecosystem management, however 
		simplified, was challenging enough. Layering additional complexity with 
		the reflexive analysis of the model itself was more than students could 
		handle, at least with such an unfamiliar subject. Consequently, we switched 
		to a simpler and more traditional interactive reference format (<i>Conservation 
		Investigation: Seahorses</i>), hoping to return to Turkle's challenge 
		in the future. In retrospect, we should have heeded Egan earlier, since 
		his notions of philosophic and ironic understanding anticipate this quandary. 
		Philosophic understanding, as in looking for systems, schema, and underlying 
		causes, is well suited to explicitly exploring models and simulations 
		as such (rather than concealing the model in a mythic or romantic wrapper). 
		But because philosophic understanding so enthusiastically embraces the 
		search for cause and effect, there is a strong tendency at this stage 
		to take the model at face value. The ability to step back and question 
		the construction of the model itself truly arrives only with Ironic understanding.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Since questioning models is ultimately such an important 
		skill, we still hope in the future to develop a simulation that facilitates 
		this sort of meta-examination. However, it is clear that the simulation 
		should focus on a familiar domain and be targeted at more advanced (perhaps 
		even college-level) students. Our ecosystem management simulation tried 
		to tackle too much and over-ambitiously tried to work on two very different 
		levels: the issues surrounding coral reef management efforts, and the 
		art of modeling a real world system. That is simply too much of an analytical 
		load for high school students to handle.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Offering a simulation as an appropriate means of examining 
		a system's function might also leverage Mythic understanding, capturing 
		the users' interest with a dramatic binary opposition between stereotyped 
		forces of good and evil (perhaps polluters and conservationists), then 
		suggesting that this model does not show what's <i>really</i> going on 
		and inviting them to dig under the surface of the simulation in search 
		of the truth. In this way, users would find some initial comfort in mythic 
		understanding while engaging in their natural philosophic quest for truth 
		and causality. Similar approaches could easily be applied to history and 
		other subjects where mythic stereotypes are common, but where Ironic understanding 
		might lend a valuable level of sophistication.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Where Do We Go From Here?</h1>
	  <p class=normal>The above examples indicate the potential for using learning 
		theory to guide thoughtful and innovative educational design on the Web. 
		When the Web was in its infancy as a medium, trial and error development 
		was appropriate. No one knew what might work, and rapid changes in the 
		technology created a quickly moving target. As the Web has matured, the 
		need for more explicit best practices and metrics for evaluating the quality 
		and success of our projects has become apparent. A face-to-face learning 
		environment allows the effective teacher to respond to subtle cues about 
		student knowledge, interest, and ability. We do not have that luxury online, 
		and instead we must attempt to formalize within the programming of the 
		activity much of the tacit feedback the teacher can draw upon. As we have 
		suggested above, a development process informed by learning theory helps 
		embed the teacher's expertise into an online learning experience that 
		has no two-way communication between real people.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Even as these case studies demonstrate the benefits of explicitly 
		applying learning theory to online activities, they also raise questions. 
		Can rigorous research and evaluation of online learning activities help 
		us refine learning theory as a whole? Can we empirically demonstrate whether 
		these ideas really do improve users' experience, or even their learning 
		(whatever that ultimately is)? Given the present politics of public education 
		in the United States, which emphasizes high stakes testing and demonstrating 
		student mastery of specific standards, we do not serve our clients or 
		their funders well if we continue to offer only impressionistic accounts 
		of the impact of our projects. Such a promise of more objective evaluation 
		might seem hubristic, given how difficult it is to measure the users' 
		experience in the offline world. However, we anticipate that the same 
		technical limitations of online learning that require us to formalize 
		the content and learning methods will also help us to capture and analyze 
		information that will shed light on the user experience.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Furthermore, can we continue to ignore the setting in which 
		online activities are used, or do we have to pay closer attention to where 
		the users are and why they are using the activity? For example, do we 
		need more support for teachers to accompany each activity intended for 
		classroom use? In the case of SEA, Shedd saw teacher support materials 
		as crucial from the outset. We hope to see with further study how support 
		materials affect the effectiveness of the SEA activities. It may be that 
		teachers view electronic activities as by nature self-contained. Given 
		that the Web allows access to all comers, the challenge remains to offer 
		novice users the right entry point without assuming that they can or will 
		use external supporting materials or guidance.</p>
	  <p class=normal>As we have surveyed learning theory, from Kolb to Gardner 
		to Egan, and tried to make sense of our real-world products in their light, 
		it is clear that no one theory can be our single guiding light. It seems 
		more pragmatic to treat the range of learning theory frameworks as a developer's 
		toolbox from which we can pick and choose according to the needs of a 
		particular project. Given the diversity of learners and learning environments, 
		we favor the instrumental view that we should not attempt to impose a 
		single framework on all subject content, learning goals, use context, 
		and institutional missions and cultures. What works for the context and 
		content of one project may be completely unsuitable for another.</p>
	  <p class=normal>At the end of the day, our thumbnail sketch of learning 
		theory does expose limitations in applying general theories to complex, 
		practical problems. As we discussed above, a strong social constructivist 
		approach to pedagogy that puts a high premium on social interaction and 
		assessing and adjusting to student knowledge may find many current online 
		activities lacking. At the same time, we remain optimistic that some types 
		of online learning experiences open doors to understanding that cannot 
		be offered in any classroom (Prensky 2001). This is not a dismissal of 
		the classroom experience, but a recognition of the ways that computer-aided 
		research tools have dramatically transformed the practice of many research 
		fields, from visualization in the sciences to databases in the humanities. 
		Much of our effort is motivated by the desire to bring these tools within 
		reach of non-experts.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Finally, and most ambitiously, can studying online learning 
		actually advance our understanding of learning, or merely confirm or fail 
		to support existing principles developed for other learning arenas? As 
		the methods and instruments for evaluating online learning mature, we 
		expect online learning to offer a lively test bed for the continuing quest 
		for knowing how we know.<b></b></p>
