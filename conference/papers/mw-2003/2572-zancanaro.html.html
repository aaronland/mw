	  <h1 class="SubHeader">1. Introduction</h1>
	  <p class=normal>Many research projects are exploring the new possibilities 
		offered<span class="normal"> </span>by Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) 
		in a museum setting (for example, see Grinter et al, 2002, Cheverst 2000 
		and Not et al., 1998). Usually, these multimedia guides use static images, 
		while others employ pre-recorded short video clips about museum exhibits. 
		In a previous work (Not et al, 1998, 2000), we explored different techniques 
		to automatically build multimedia, location-aware presentations in a museum 
		setting. The advent of more powerful devices has allowed researchers to 
		experiment with new forms of multimedia, in particular time-based media 
		such as animations.</p>
	  <p class=normal>In this paper we introduce the idea of enhancing the audio 
		presentation (dynamically assembled pre-recorded or synthesized speech) 
		of a complex fresco by using the PDA screen to travel throughout the fresco 
		itself and identify details. At presentation time, a sequence of pictures 
		is synchronized with the audio commentary, and the transitions among them 
		are planned according to cinematic techniques. Our hypothesis is that 
		the use of this type of animation to present the description of a painting 
		allows the visitor to better identify the details introduced by the audio 
		counterpart of the presentation. In this manner, both the efficiency and 
		the satisfaction dimensions of the system usability are increased (Nielsen, 
		1994) while also providing an enhanced learning experience for the visitor.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The language of cinematography (Metz, 1974), including shot 
		segmentation, camera movements and transition effects, is employed in 
		order to plan the animation and to synchronize the visual and the verbal 
		parts of the presentation. In building the animations, a set of strategies 
		similar to those used in documentaries was thus employed. Two broad classes 
		of strategies have been identified. The first class encompasses constraints 
		imposed by the grammar of cinematography, while the second deals with 
		conventions normally used in guiding camera movements in the production 
		of documentaries. For instance, a strategy in the first class would discourage 
		a zoom-in immediately followed by a zoom-out, while a different strategy 
		in the second class would recommend the use of sequential scene cuts, 
		rather than a fade-out effect, to visually enumerate different characters 
		in a scene. It is worth noting that in the latter strategy it is often 
		necessary to make reference to the discourse structure of the audio part 
		of the presentation, such as enumeration of properties, background knowledge, 
		and elaboration of related information. In order to formally use discourse 
		structure, we employ the Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thom<span class="normal">pson, 
		1987).</span></p>
	  <p class=normal>At present, we have completed a first prototype of a multimedia 
		guide that employs cinematic techniques in presenting information for 
		a fresco at Torre Aquila in Trento, Italy. A Web-based simulation of the 
		multimedia guide can be seen at <a
href="http://peach.itc.it/preview.html" target="_blank">http://peach.itc.it/preview.html</a><i>.</i></p>
	  <p class=normal>The next section briefly discusses the issues in designing 
		a multimedia museum guide. Section 3 introduces the features of the Torre 
		Aquila prototype. Sections 4 and 5 present the theoretical background, 
		discussing respectively the relevant concepts for the language of cinematography 
		and the Rhetorical Structure Theory to analyze dependency relationships 
		inside a text. Section 6 illustrates the strategies used in our multimedia 
		guide to produce effective and pleasant video clips starting from audio 
		commentaries. Finally, in section 7, the results of a preliminary evaluation 
		are presented and discussed.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">2. The Museum as a Smart Environment</h1>
	  <p class=normal>Museums and cultural heritage institutions recreate an environment 
		conducive to exploring not only the exhibited objects and works of art, 
		but also new ideas and experiences. Visitors are free to move around and 
		learn concepts, inquire and even apply what is leaned to their own worldview. 
		A museum visit is thus a personal experience encompassing both cognitive 
		aspects, such as the elaboration of background and new knowledge, and 
		emotional aspects that may include the satisfaction of interests or the 
		fascination with the exhibit itself. Despite the inherently stimulating 
		environment created by cultural heritage institutions, on their own they 
		often fall short of successfully supporting conceptual learning, inquiry-skill-building, 
		analytic experiences or follow-up activities at home or the school (Semper 
		and Spasojevic, 2002).</p>
	  <p class=normal>The optimal multimedia tourist guide should support strong 
		personalization of all the information provided in a museum in an effort 
		to ensure that each visitor be allowed to accommodate and interpret the 
		visit according to his own pace and interests. Simultaneously, a museum 
		guide should also provide the appropriate amount of impetus to foster 
		learning and self-development so as to create a richer and more meaningful 
		experience.</p>
	  <p class=normal>In order to achieve the above goals it is necessary that 
		the information be presented in a manner that is appropriate to the physical 
		location of the visitor as well as to the location of the works of art 
		within the environment. Smoothly connecting the information found in an 
		exhibit and presenting it to the visitor in a flexible yet coherent manner 
		with respect to his physical location can mazimize the overall experience 
		and absorption of new information for the viewer (Stock and Zancanaro, 
		2002). In other words, if the information is provided in a manner that 
		flows and relates pieces to each other, this process in and of itself 
		can aid in stimulating the visitor's interest and, hence, desire 
		to inquire, analyze and learn. This idea relates to the concept of <i>situation-aware 
		content</i>, where information is most effective if presented in a cohesive 
		way, building on previously delivered information. This may be accomplished 
		by using comparisons and references to space and time, which in turn may 
		aid the visitor in becoming oriented within the museum as well as across 
		the various works of art.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The ideal audio guide should not only guess what the visitors 
		are interested in, but also take into consideration what they have to 
		learn: orienting visitors, providing opportunities for reflection and 
		allowing them to explore related ideas, thereby greatly enhancing the 
		visit's educational value. In essence, the guide should stimulate 
		new interests and suggest new paths for exploring the museum. A system 
		that supports visitors in their visit should take into account their agenda, 
		expectations and interests as well as the peculiarities of a cultural 
		experience in a physical environment.</p>
	  <p class=normal>It is essential to also consider the importance of creating 
		an overall experience that truly addresses the needs of a person visiting 
		a museum. This requires not only providing the visitor with a vast amount 
		of information, even if wonderfully presented, but also allowing the person 
		to spend a pleasurable and entertaining time at the exhibit. The concept 
		of the <i>immersive environment</i> addresses the importance of creating 
		a technology that supports rather then overwhelms the real experience 
		of visiting a museum. A museum guide of this nature must be able to create 
		a balance in terms of attention required from the visitor, also allowing 
		time to be spent enjoying the "romance" of the cultural heritage 
		institution and the works found therein.</p>
	  <p class=normal>These and other challenges come into play when designing 
		a system for the entertainment and edutainment of museum visitors. Creating 
		an electronic tourist guide that transforms the user experience from one 
		of simple consultation (commonly achieved with audio guides, multimedia 
		kiosks, CDROMs or even books) to an immersion into a rich information 
		environment indeed requires a careful examination of all the abovementioned 
		factors, while also considering input from visitors themselves. Difficulties 
		arise when observing that such systems are not intended to help users 
		perform specific work-related tasks, and most of the time they cannot 
		be brought back to clearly stated user requirements. Keeping in mind that 
		the ultimate goal of a guide is to engage the user and to stimulate learning, 
		it becomes clear that the nature of this kind of system imposes a balance 
		between the designer's vision and user needs.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Using animations or video clips enhance the richness of 
		the interaction though these may also distract the user by calling attention 
		to the device rather than to the exhibit itself. Our hypothesis is that, 
		on the contrary, a carefully planned video clip describing the exhibit 
		will actually help the visitor quickly localize the details of the painting 
		as well as aid the flow of the presentation by illustrating the relationship 
		between new and already presented information. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">3. The Prototype at Torre Aquila</h1>
	  <p class=normal>We have applied the idea of using cinematic techniques for 
		presenting details of artworks in a prototype of a multimedia guide for 
		Torre Aquila' a tower at the Buonconsiglio Castle in Trento, where 
		a fresco called "The Cycle of the Months", a masterpiece of 
		the gothic period, is found. This fresco, painted in the Fifteenth Century, 
		illustrates the activities of aristocrats and peasants throughout the 
		year. The fresco is composed of eleven panels, each one representing one 
		month (the month of March was destroyed over time) and occupies the four 
		walls of the tower (see figure 1).</p>
	  <p class=normal align="center"><img src="zancanaro.fig1.jpg" width="477" height="277"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 1: Torre Aquila and the grid of infrared</p>
	  <p class=normal>Our multimedia guide, implemented with Macromedia Flash 
		on a PDA, detects the position of the visitor by means of infrared emitters 
		placed in front of each panel. Interaction with the system is both proposed 
		by the system itself and accepted by the user, thus sharing the responsibility 
		of information access. When the system detects that the visitor is in 
		front of one of the four walls, a picture of that wall is displayed on 
		the PDA and, after a few seconds, if the user has not changed position, 
		that panel is highlighted (see figure 2). At this point, the visitor can 
		click on the panel and receive a multimedia presentation of the panel 
		chosen.</p>
	  <h3 class=normal align="center"><img src="zancanaro.fig2.jpg" width="395" height="279"></h3>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 2: Snapshots of the multimedia guide localizing 
		the user.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The multimedia presentation is composed of an audio commentary 
		accompanied by a sequence of images that appear on the PDA display and 
		help the visitor quickly identify the fresco's details mentioned 
		in the commentary. For instance, when a specific detail of the panel is 
		explained by the audio, the PDA may display or highlight that detail, 
		thus quickly calling the attention of the user to the area in question.</p>
	  <p class=normal>During the presentation, the PDA displays a VCR-style control 
		panel and a slide bar to signal the length of the video clip and its actual 
		position (see figure 3). At any given moment, the user is free to pause, 
		fast forward, rewind and even stop the presentation by tapping on the 
		appropriate control panel button. In this manner, the visitor is able 
		to control the speed as well as the information itself, while also revisiting 
		sections found most interesting.</p>

	  <h1 class="SubHeader">The Language of Cinematography</h1>
	  <p class=normal>According to Metz {1974), cinematic representation is not 
		like a human language that is defined by a set of grammatical rules; it 
		is nevertheless guided by a set of generally accepted conventions. These 
		guidelines may be used for developing multimedia presentations that can 
		be best perceived by the viewer. In the following, we briefly summarize 
		the basic terminology of cinematography. In section 6 we will discuss 
		how these conventions can be expressed both in terms of constraints on 
		camera movements and in terms of strategies related to the discourse structure 
		of the associated audio commentary.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">4.1 Shot and camera movements</h2>
	  <p class=normal>The shot is the basic unit of a video sequence. In the field 
		of cinematography a shot is defined as a continuous view from a single 
		camera without interruption. Since we only deal with still images, we 
		define a shot as a <i>sequence of camera movements applied to the same 
		image</i>.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The basic camera movements are <i>pan</i>, from "panorama", 
		a rotation of the camera along the x-axis, <i>tilt,</i> a rotation along 
		the y-axis, and <i>dolly,</i> a rotation along the z-axis.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">4.2 Transition effects</h2>
	  <p class=normal>Transitions among shots are considered the punctuation symbols 
		of cinematography; they affect the rhythm of the discourse and the message 
		conveyed by the video.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The main transitions used are <i>cut</i>,<i> fade</i>, and<i> 
		cross fade. </i>A cut occurs when the last frame of a shot is immediately 
		replaced by the first frame of the following shot. A fade occurs when 
		one shot gradually replaces another one, either by disappearing (fade 
		out) or by being replaced by the new shot (fade in). A particular case 
		of a fade happens when instead of two shots, there is one shot and a black 
		screen that can be, again, faded in or faded out. Finally, a cross fade 
		(also called dissolve) occurs when two shots are gradually superimposed 
		during the moment when one is faded out while the other is faded in.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">5. Rhetorical Structure Theory</h1>
	  <p class=normal>Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1987) analyses 
		discourse structure in terms of dependency trees, with each node of the 
		tree being a segment of text. Each branch of the tree represents the relationship 
		between two nodes, where one node is called the nucleus and the other 
		is called the satellite. The information in the satellite relates to that 
		found in the nucleus in that it expresses an idea related to what was 
		said in the nucleus. This rhetorical relation specifies the coherence 
		relation that exists between the two portions of text contained in the 
		nodes. For example, a <i>Cause</i> rhetorical relation holds when the 
		satellite describes the event that caused what is contained in the nucleus. 
		Figure 4 shows an example of a rhetorical tree. Here the second paragraph 
		provides background information with respect to the content expressed 
		in the first paragraph. This additional information acts as a sort of 
		reinforcement for what was previously said in the first paragraph and 
		consequently facilitates the absorption of information. In the original 
		formulation by Mann and Thompson, the theory posited twenty different 
		rhetorical relations between a satellite and a nucleus, while other scholars 
		have since added to this theory.</p>
	  <p class=normal align="center"><img src="zancanaro.fig4.jpg" width="395" height="296"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 4: An example of a rhetorical tree (simplified).</p>
	  <p class=normal>RST was originally developed as part of work carried out 
		in the computer-based text generation field. In a previous work (Not and 
		Zancanaro, 2001), we described a set of techniques to dynamically compose 
		adaptive presentations of artworks from a repository of multimedia data 
		annotated with rhetorical relations. These techniques have been exploited 
		in an audio-based, location-aware adaptive audio guide described in Not 
		et al., {2000). The audio commentaries produced by this audio guide are 
		automatically annotated with the rhetorical structure. In the next section 
		we will discuss how this information can be used to create more effective 
		video clips to accompany the commentary.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">6. Video Clips on Still Images</h1>
	  <p class=normal>Video clips are built by first searching for the sequence 
		of details mentioned in the audio commentary, deciding the segmentation 
		in shots, and then planning the camera movements in order to smoothly 
		focus on each detail in synchrony with the verbal part.</p>
	  <p class=normal>In building a video clip, a set of strategies similar to 
		those used in documentaries is employed. Two broad classes of strategies 
		have been identified. The first class encompasses constraints imposed 
		by the grammar of cinematography, while the second deals with conventions 
		normally used in guiding camera movements in the production of documentaries.</p>
	  <p class=normal>While the constraints are just sequence of forbidden camera 
		movements, the conventions are expressed in terms of rhetorical structures 
		found in the audio commentary. In our view, the verbal part of the documentary 
		always drives the visual part.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">6.1 Constraints on Camera Movements</h2>
	  <p class=normal>I<span class="normal">n order to ensure a pleasant presentation, 
		constraints on camera movements have to be imposed. For example, a pan 
		from right to left forbids a subsequent pan from left to right. In general, 
		applying any given movement (pan, tilt and zoom) and then immediately 
		reapplying it on the reverse direction is discouraged because this action 
		renders the video uncomfortable to watch.</span></p>
	  <p class=normal>Given that the audio commentary drives the visual part, 
		it is often the case that such forbidden combinations of camera movements 
		are required. In these cases, two tricks can be applied: either choosing 
		a different way of focusing the detail required by the verbal part; for 
		example a zoom out can often effectively replace a pan, or starting a 
		new shot altogether. In the latter case, the two shots should be linked 
		by a transition effect that suggests continuity, such as a short fade.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Rhetorical Strategies</h2>
	  <p class=normal>Constraints on camera movements alone are sufficient to 
		ensure a pleasant presentation, yet they do not impact the effectiveness 
		of the video clip. In order to have a more engaging presentation, the 
		visual part should not only focus on the right detail at the right time, 
		but also support the presentation of new audio information by illustrating 
		its relation to information that has been already given. In this manner, 
		continuity between the pieces of information is built, and in turn facilitates 
		the viewing of the video clip while stimulating the absorption of new 
		information.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The text in figure 5 can be visually represented with two 
		shots of the same image (that is, the tournament) linked by a long cross 
		fade. Technically, having two shots is not necessary, since the image 
		is the same, but the cross fade helps the user understand that background 
		information is going to be provided. The first image is thus presented 
		while the first paragraph is heard over the audio; then when the audio 
		switches to, in this case, the background information, the image is enlarged 
		to cover the entire panel and finally is refocused on the detail once 
		the audio has stopped.</p>

	  <p class=normal>A rhetorical strategy suggests, on the basis of a rhetorical 
		tree configuration, what shot segmentation and which transition effect 
		should be applied. The strategies employed in the Torre Aquila multimedia 
		guide were elicited by a focus group activity with a documentary director.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">7. Preliminary Evaluation</h1>
	  <p class=normal>A formal evaluation of the prototype will start next March 
		at Torre Aquila. Preliminary studies and pilot tests show encouraging 
		results and interesting effects.</p>
	  <p class=normal>All users became acquainted with the system very quickly. 
		Most of them used the PDA as a "3D mouse", pointing directly 
		to the infrared emitters to speed up the localization. Future investigations 
		will evaluate how users can be more directly involved in the process of 
		localization.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Most of the users complained before actually using the system 
		that a video sequence on a PDA would distract their attention from the 
		real artwork. After a short interaction with the system, however, they 
		appreciated the possibility of quickly localizing small details on the 
		fresco. This demonstrates that use of cinematic techniques in a multimedia 
		guide can be effective, particularly in explaining complex painting. The 
		different effects that the verbal and the visual parts of the presentation 
		have on the user's attention are yet to be investigated.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">8. Conclusion</h1>
	  <p class=normal>This paper discussed how cinematic techniques can be used 
		in a multimedia museum guide to provide more pleasant and effective presentation 
		of information. Video clips are built by first searching for the sequence 
		of details mentioned in the audio commentary, deciding the segmentation 
		in shots, and then planning the camera movements soas to smoothly focus 
		on each detail in synchrony with the verbal counterpart. In our approach, 
		the verbal part always drives the visual part.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The video clips are built accordingly to two broad classes 
		of strategies. The first class encompasses constraints imposed by the 
		grammar of cinematography, while the second deals with conventions normally 
		used in guiding camera movements in the production of documentaries.</p>
	  <p class=normal>While the constraints are just a sequence of forbidden camera 
		movements, the conventions are expressed in terms of rhetorical structures 
		found in the audio commentary. By coupling these cinematic techniques 
		into organized guidelines, the creation of multimedia video clips can 
		vastly help to improve quality as well as the effectiveness of the presentations. 
		A visitor to a museum can thus benefit from an automatic guide that causes 
		minimal interference with the enjoyment and learning experience provided 
		by an exhibit.</p>
	  <p class=normal>As a case study, a multimedia museum guide for Torre Aquila 
		in Trento has been presented and the results of a preliminary evaluation 
		have been discussed</p>
