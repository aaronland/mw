		<p class=AbstractTitle><span>Abstract </span></p>
		<p class=AbstractText>Experiencing artworks in the Web aggravates the 
		  problem of the absence of any historical, cultural and social context, 
		  because the Web is a veritable nowhere. This paper stresses the importance 
		  of a social and narrative access to art, and presents an interactive 
		  group of virtual characters as an alleviation of this problem. The benefits 
		  and overall concepts of this approach are examined. Particularly, the 
		  importance of guiding the virtual characters to establish close emotional 
		  relations with the user for achieving narrative immersion is stressed, 
		  and ways of accomplishing this task are sketched. </p>
		<p class=keywords>Keywords: Virtual Characters, Hybrid Discussion Group, 
		  Interactive Storytelling, Emotional Computing, Social Computing</p>
		<h1 class = "SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
		<p><span>Viewing artworks on the Web is an experience absent of any historical, 
		  cultural, or social context. While this problem is well known to traditional 
		  museums, the Web, as a veritable nowhere, aggravates the situation. 
		  Consider someone looking at a Byzantine icon at a Web museum with a 
		  home monitor. A visitor &#151; henceforth the "user"- not very well 
		  acquainted with the subject is likely to miss much of the meaning of 
		  the artwork, and the art experience will be shallow and uninteresting. 
		  </span></p>
		<p><span>It is certainly helpful to offer some additional written explanation 
		  or even video material, but still, the experience remains intellectual 
		  and solitary, rather than emotional and cultural enrichment. Additionally, 
		  it is not easy to motivate the visitor to study the additional material, 
		  instead of clicking away after some superficial glance. </span></p>
		<p><span>What can be done to provide a more involving and enriching art 
		  experience to the user? According to the European hermeneutical tradition, 
		  understanding of an art work is inherently a social, dialogic and emotional 
		  process (Cf. Gadamer, 1993; Heidegger, 1973). There is no absolute meaning, 
		  but only restricted perspectives that belong to a whole live world. 
		  In order to understand a Byzantine icon, a user must understand the 
		  artists who made it and the worship of the believers, their way of living, 
		  their feelings, and their convictions. This is not simply a matter of 
		  increasing a person's knowledge, but to fuse his own horizon with the 
		  horizons of the people to whom the icon had an essential meaning. This 
		  is not only an intellectual but also an emotional process of feeling 
		  empathy and identifying with particular individual motivations and biographic 
		  experiences. </span></p>
		<p><span>At this point, narration enters the scene as a means of promoting 
		  identification, empathy and understanding. Through stories, it is possible 
		  to boost the fusion of horizons in art experience. Examples of this 
		  process in traditional media are abundant, e.g. historical novels or 
		  films. </span></p>
		<p><span>A new approach is "interactive storytelling". Interactive storytelling 
		  is the discipline that deals with the run time creation and adaptation 
		  of stories, observing emergent constraints like global duration of the 
		  interaction or user choices and interests. It aims at combining the 
		  narrative immersion of traditional story telling with the advantages 
		  of user behaviour adaptation, employing, for example, educational strategies. 
		  </span></p>
		<p><span>In this paper, I will present a narration driven, interactive 
		  group of virtual characters with whom the user can fraternize and discuss 
		  each other's art experience and perspectives. This group allows reconstituting 
		  the contingent meanings of art and regaining the missing emotional and 
		  existential perspectives on it by preserving the narrative horizons. 
		  At the same time, the group involves the user through interaction and 
		  adaptation.</span></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption> <img src="iurgel.fig1.jpg" width="400" height="214"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 1 &#151; Two virtual characters speaking about 
		  a religious icon</p>
		<p><span>This interactive group is being developed in the project Art-E-Fact 
		  (Cf. <a href="http://www.art-e-fact.org/">www.art-e-fact.org</a><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span>). This EU-funded project, a collaboration 
		  of several institutions of four European countries, aims at developing 
		  generic tools for artists to create dialogic, narrative worlds inhabited 
		  by personality-rich virtual characters. The interaction with these worlds 
		  is enhanced by specialized utilities like exploration tools that allow 
		  the user to uncover different painting layers. Though the project does 
		  not aim specifically at Web based use, incorporating an internet version 
		  poses no technical problem. A VRML viewer, together with some small 
		  plug-in and a freely available speech synthesizer, are the only technical 
		  necessities. The initial demonstrator deals exactly with a museum presentation 
		  of the Byzantine icons mentioned above (Cf. <a href="http://www.monastery-artdiagnosis.gr/" target="_blank">www.monastery-artdiagnosis.gr</a> 
		  for a link to one partner). </span></p>
		<p><span>The next section gives an overview of previous work. Then, I 
		  will present the overall architecture of the system. After that, I will 
		  explain the benefits and some ideas behind the project. I will stress 
		  especially the importance of automating the process of creating social 
		  and emotional bonds with the virtual characters to foster the experience 
		  of narrative immersion. </span></p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Related work</h2>
		<p>The importance of narration for the structuring of experiences is also 
		  stressed in psychology, e.g. in the work of <span>Shank and Abelson 
		  (1995) and Graesser and Ottati (1995). </span></p>
		<p><span>Andr&#233; et al. </span>(2000) developed a non-interactive presentation 
		  group without narrative structures. Their emphasis lies in natural language 
		  generation independent of personality traits of the virtual participants. 
		  Mateas and Stern (2000) are developing a very promising system for interactive 
		  storytelling. In contrast to our approach, they do not aim at education 
		  and presentation, which is probably the reason for the different architectonic 
		  and conceptual details, since there is no need to present information 
		  in their system, and therefore a less centrally guided approach is possible.</p>
		<p>Rickel et al. (2002) are engaged in an ambitious project that comprises 
		  natural language interaction, emotional and social simulation, but not 
		  information presentation and narration. A. Paiva, I. Machado and others 
		  have developed various interactive applications with storytelling and/or 
		  tutorial components (cf. Machado et al., 2001, Paiva, 2001), though 
		  none of these systems uses interactive discussion for multifaceted edutainment.</p>
		<p>Another project in which our own group is involved is "Geist" (<span>cf. 
		  <a href="http://www.tourgeist.de/" target="_blank">www.tourgeist.de</a>)</span>, 
		  where interactive storytelling is used, but without any natural language 
		  interaction , and "Virtual Human", which aims at the creation of a narrative 
		  tutoring system with talking virtual characters<span> (cf. <a href="http://www.virtual-human.org/" target="_blank">www.virtual-human.org</a>)</span>.</p>
		<h1 class = "SubHeader">Architecture of the System</h1>
		<p class=MsoCaption><img src="iurgel.fig2.t.png" width="395" height="283"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 2 &#151; The basic architecture</p>
		<p><span>The basic architecture is depicted in figure 2. The information 
		  process is centralised and hierarchic, the flow of control starting 
		  at a story engine and passing through a scene engine to the dialogue 
		  manager or directly to the scene player. The player executes the scripts 
		  delivered either by the scene engine or by the dialogue manager and 
		  controls the partially autonomous virtual characters and objects. The 
		  current architecture separates strictly interactive and non-interactive 
		  episodes. In an interactive episode, the user can talk to the virtual 
		  characters using a keyboard, and the dialogue manager is responsible 
		  for the generation and distribution of adequate answers. In the case 
		  of a non-interactive episode, the scene engine controls the virtual 
		  characters directly. Non-interactive episodes are fixed sequences authored 
		  in advance, much like the dialogues in a traditional theatre play.</span></p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Story Engine </h2>
		<p><span>Our basic approach to the automated generation of stories is 
		  to use a central narration component, called "story engine", that combines 
		  and adapts prefabricated minimal story components during run time, according 
		  to rules e.g. of narration or pedagogy, and to the interaction results. 
		  Those rules are stored as story models. The minimal story components 
		  are called "scenes". For details of this process, compare Braun (2002), 
		  Spierling et al. (2002). The scene engine plays the scenes that were 
		  chosen and adapted by the story engine controlling the subordinate modules.</span></p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall"><span>Dialogue Manager</span></h2>
		<p><span>The dialogue manager is granted control by the story engine if 
		  an interactive episode is part of a scene. It is centralized in order 
		  to allow using distributed reactions, where, for example, two virtual 
		  characters mention two different aspects of a problem as an answer to 
		  some question of the user. Its output is a script to the dialogue manager. 
		  The script may consist of a single utterance or of a series of commands 
		  to the subordinate modules. Currently, the dialogue manager relies on 
		  a modified version of the chatbot ALICE<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> 
		  </span>(Cf. <a href="http://www.alicebot.org/" target="_blank">www.alicebot.org</a>) 
		  which makes use of a "natural languagee processing database" (NLP-DB). 
		  The use of ALICE is only a provisory solution until some more powerful 
		  system is developed. </span></p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall"><span>Scene Player</span></h2>
		<p><span><b> </b></span><span>The scene player executes scene scripts. 
		  The scripts control the appearance of the characters and their behaviour 
		  at varying levels of abstraction, and govern the objects in the scene; 
		  for example, the appearance of icons or the starting of films. </span></p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall"><span>Object Manager</span></h2>
		<p><span><b> </b></span><span>The object manager is controlled directly 
		  by the scene engine. It manages the display of the objects of the scene; 
		  for instance, the appearance and disappearance of the artworks under 
		  discussion.</span></p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall"><span>Virtual Characters</span></h2>
		<p><span><b> </b></span><span>The virtual characters are responsible for 
		  the generation of consistent behaviour according to their personality 
		  traits and situation appraisal. This behaviour includes turn-taking 
		  signals and conversational feedback as well as emotional reactions and 
		  goal management. The virtual characters are composed of a mind called 
		  agentive person, a simulation of body processes called bodily person, 
		  and a graphics output module called manifest person. The parameters 
		  of these personality aspects work together to create the final visible 
		  personality of the virtual character. The prescriptions may vary in 
		  their level of abstraction, ranging from detailed commands of movements 
		  to mere annotations in the sentences to say, informing the characters 
		  about the pragmatic meaning of the sentences. In the last case, every 
		  detail of the performance is in the charge of the virtual characters. 
		  Thus, their function is analogous to actors in a theatre play, interpreting 
		  with leeway the instructions of a director according to their characters 
		  and situation awareness. For more details, cf. Iurgel 2002. </span></p>
		<p><span>One of the central research goals of the project consists in 
		  understanding how to combine story elements prepared in advance with 
		  less guided, highly interactive episodes. Both aspects are necessary 
		  in interactive storytelling, since only the use of prepared dialogues 
		  and instructions guarantee an interesting and consistent storyline, 
		  and only the introduction of free interaction enables user adaptation 
		  and involvement. </span></p>
		<p><span>As in any story, the main responsibility for success and suspense 
		  lies in the hand of an author. Story creation without an author &#151; 
		  "emergent narrative"&#151; is not likely to provide the intended quality 
		  of emotional experience. For this reason, in the project "art-e-fact", 
		  artists are involved in every step of the development. Thus, suitable 
		  authoring tools for interactive storytelling are vital and one of the 
		  main challenges of the project (Cf. Scheider, 2003).</span>Ways of Fostering 
		  Art Understading. Fostering art understanding through the use of a virtual 
		  conversation group.<span> </span></p>
		<p><span>In this section, I want to elaborate more on some aspects of 
		  using a virtual conversation group to promote the understanding of art 
		  works. In order to concretize the discussion, I introduce two scenarios:</span> 
		</p>
		<p class="SubHeaderSmaller">1. Distant horizon scenario.</p>
		<p> In this scenario, the virtual characters are contemporaries of the 
		  human participant and maintain themselves at a distant perspective from 
		  the art work, though it has an important meaning for their lives. For 
		  example, a scientist who analyses materials and colours, and an historian 
		  who knows about cultural context, might be present. This scenario is 
		  a good starting point for the participant, because it is easy to understand 
		  the virtual characters, and the interest of the characters in the icon 
		  can spread to the user. </p>
		<p class="SubHeaderSmaller">2. Near horizon scenario. </p>
		<p>Here, the virtual characters live in the past and share the religious 
		  fervor that once accompanied the icon. A monk and a mother of a sick 
		  child might be present. This constellation must be introduced more carefully, 
		  but promises a more intense experience, involving more central feelings 
		  like suffering, compassion, hope, and so on.</p>
		<p class=MsoCaption><img src="iurgel.fig3.jpg" width="400" height="186"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 3 &#151; The virtual characters as talking 
		  heads</p>
		<p><span>Keeping these scenarios in mind, I will now mention some advantages 
		  of using a conversation group to present the art work on the Web:</span></p>
		<p class=listwithnumbers><b>1. Perspective. </b>Every character can support 
		  a definite perspective, e.g. a historian and a scientist. This allows 
		  elucidating the theme from different, possibly incommensurable points 
		  of view. Personality trait differences have here the important function 
		  of establishing a link between opinion and emotion. For example, a reserved 
		  and sceptical character is suitable for the role of a scientist, but 
		  probably not for the horizons of a religious person. </p>
		<p class=listwithnumbers><b>2. Dialogic deployment. </b>The use of a group 
		  of characters facilitates the dialogic deployment of thoughts, because 
		  insightful sequences of questions, contributions and answers can be 
		  prepared in advance. Even if the user is included in the deployment, 
		  the presence of a group is technically and conceptually advantageous, 
		  because one virtual character can provide the keyword needed by the 
		  other to continue the dialogic developments. </p>
		<p class=listwithnumbers><b>3. Narration. </b>It would be very difficult 
		  to maintain a narrative structure using only a single virtual character 
		  because of the unpredictability of user behaviour. If, for example, 
		  the author prepares a narrative structure where the character necessarily 
		  has to speak about his early childhood experiences, but the user refuses 
		  to keep at it, the story line is likely to fail. This cannot happen 
		  if there is another character willing to listen in the place of the 
		  user.</p>
		<p class=listwithnumbers><b>4. Natural language understanding. </b>Communicating 
		  with a single virtual character is difficult simply because it very 
		  often won't understand the user. The use of a group alleviates the problem, 
		  because it is quite natural that some contributions do not receive a 
		  proper answer in a discussion group. Shortcomings of natural language 
		  processing do not lead to a breakdown in the conversation. </p>
		<p class=listwithnumbers><b>5. Social processes.</b> Social and group processes 
		  are among the strongest elicitors of emotional arousal. According to 
		  Kemper (1991), there are only two basic dimensions that govern the arousing 
		  of emotions in a social relationship; namely, "status"and "power". Those 
		  dimensions can be exploited to generate emotionally thrilling plots 
		  involving the virtual characters and possibly including the user. For 
		  example, the user might be exposed to a planned power change in the 
		  course of the narration, his influence as a group member increasing 
		  or decreasing depending on his behaviour and on the plot. This can be 
		  achieved by a sequence of scenes in which the characters initially disregard 
		  the suggestions of the user; in the course of the interaction, his contributions 
		  would be "recognized"by the virtual characters as important and increasingly 
		  mandatory. </p>
		<p><span>The nowadays prevalent use of anthropomorphic agents on the Web 
		  considers only the usage of a single character. I argued that this is 
		  a disadvantageous restriction that impedes narration and weakens the 
		  interactive experience. </span>"Interactivity"in interactive storytelling</p>

		  is "Sophie's World" (Gaarder, 1996), where the adventures of a girl 
		  serve as a background for explanations in the history of philosophy. 
		  Here, the figure of Sophie is used to promote identification, gradual 
		  presentation of knowledge, and emotional involvement in the theme. </span></p>
		<p class=listwithnumbers>Certainly, stories in interactive storytelling 
		  currently are at risk of not reaching the narrative quality level of 
		  non-interactive media where every detail can be controlled by the author 
		  or director. Because of this, understanding the role of interactivity 
		  in interactive storytelling remains an essential and still not satisfactorily 
		  accomplished task. What are the benefits of introducing interactivity 
		  into storytelling? Of course, the conflicting goals of the application 
		  provide good reasons, even if it should turn out that the intensity 
		  of narrative immersion is affected. Some examples are:</p>
		<p class=listwithnumbers><b> 1. Navigation. I</b>n an edutainment application, 
		  it is important that the user can navigate; for example, in order to 
		  go back to themes already discussed.</p>
		<p class=listwithnumbers><b>2. Reviewing and testing. </b>Interaction 
		  is necessary for feedback about some educational goal, e.g. the acquired 
		  knowledge could be tested. </p>
		<p class=listwithnumbers><b> 3. Joy of expression.</b>Expressing personal 
		  opinions and observing the virtual character's reactions is a joyful 
		  experience.</p>
		<p class=listwithnumbers><b>4. Exploration. </b>The user can be engaged 
		  in explorative learning strategies, e.g. a virtual character can gradually 
		  guide the user to discover more details of an icon. </p>
		<p><span>However, the starting point of this paper was the social and 
		  emotional nature of art understanding and the importance of narrative 
		  immersion in this context. The question at hand is whether it is possible 
		  to use interactivity to intensify the experience of narrative immersion. 
		  Traditionally, emotional involvement in a story in achieved by identification 
		  with a protagonist. The prospect of placing the user in the protagonist's 
		  position in interactive storytelling might be thrilling, but would be 
		  opposed to the current goal of rendering another person's emotional 
		  and cultural perspective understandable &#151; aside from the technical 
		  constraints. </span></p>
		<p><span>Therefore, I follow the indirect path of creating planned emotional 
		  proximity &#151; henceforth "friendship"&#151; between the user and 
		  a chosen protagonist virtual character. The reason for this is that 
		  friendship is known to boost identification and empathy, and thus, should 
		  increase narrative immersion. </span></p>
		<p><span>An example is a virtual character that is emotionally touched 
		  by discovering, in the course of an adventure, the symbolic meaning 
		  of a religious icon. Because of the establishment of some sort of friendship 
		  with the character, his emotional reaction should also touch the user, 
		  promoting his understanding and appreciation of the icon and of its 
		  religious context. </span></p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Improving Art Understanding Through Friendship 
		  With Your Virtual Companion</h2>
		<p><span><b><i> </i></b></span><span>Previously, I argued that it is possible 
		  to foster the narrative immersion through the establishment of some 
		  sort of friendship between the user and the virtual character, thus 
		  intensifying the identification with the character and his emotions. 
		  In pedagogy, those phenomena of learning facilitation under the influence 
		  of a liked person fall under the broad and well studied heading of "social 
		  learning" (Bandura, 1977, is a classical source). In other words, the 
		  idea presented here is that "social learning"is also useful when the 
		  main channel is a narration. The research issue under way, now, is to 
		  automate the creation of friendship between character and user. In the 
		  present context, the relevant psychological factors that determine friendship 
		  ("attraction") are the following (Cf. Fehr, 1996, for an overview of 
		  those factors):</span></p>
		<p class=listwithnumbers><b>1. Similarity. </b>There is plenty of empirical 
		  evidence that similar character traits and opinions are favourable to 
		  the establishment of close emotional relationships.</p>
		<p class=listwithnumbers><b> 2. Reciprocity.</b>Basically, reciprocity 
		  means that we tend to like someone who like us. This dimension is particularly 
		  sensitive to temporal factors. For example, increasing sympathy over 
		  time is more favourable to the establishment of emotional proximity 
		  than decreasing it, even if the final sympathy level remains the same. 
		</p>
		<p class=listwithnumbers><b>3. Self-Disclosure. </b>Self-disclosure is 
		  an important indicator of friendship. A person who discloses his feelings 
		  to me probably likes me. </p>
		<p class=listwithnumbers><b>4. Maximized gains in social exchange. </b>Praise 
		  is also very favourable for the establishment of friendship. For example, 
		  it is advantageous for me if another person praises my doings, thus 
		  raising my status and my self-esteem. </p>
		<p class=listwithnumbers><b>5. Common enemy. </b>The existence of a common 
		  enemy is also favourable for the establishment of camaraderie as a variety 
		  of friendship. </p>
		<p><span>Every one of those factors can be incorporated into a story-telling 
		  system. For example, the virtual character chosen for identification 
		  can be made to mimic similarity ("You do not like this icon? Nor do 
		  I!"); reciprocity ("That's fine that you are enjoying our conversation! 
		  I am also learning very much from your contributions!"); or self-disclosure 
		  ("I am full of anguish when I think that my answers might not match 
		  your questions.") This can already be achieved by integrating an appropriate 
		  plot with fairly simple extensions of ALICE, which allow the story engine 
		  to guide this chatbot. More powerful methods for interactive episodes, 
		  based on the state-update-theory of dialogue moves, are under investigation. 
		  </span></p>
		<p><span>The details and distinctions are tricky and the object of current 
		  research. Therefore, the next section will elucidate more the process 
		  of automated creation of friendship in interactive storytelling by presenting 
		  an example. </span>Example</p>
		<p><span>In this example, it is assumed that an appropriate story is generated 
		  and envelops the scenes under discussion. An abstract initial scheme 
		  for the automated establishment of friendship is depicted in figure 
		  4. It is assumed that "discovering similarities", "taking sides", "self-disclosure", 
		  and "conflict resolution"are scenes controlled by the story engine according 
		  to friendship establishment models. </span></p>

		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 4 &#151; Possible steps of automated friendship 
		  forming</p>
		<p><span>The creation of this model is a process that involves computer 
		  science, psychology, artistic intuition and narrative skills. The scene 
		  "taking sides"is included because it allows the virtual character to 
		  show how his emotional well-being depends on the behaviour of the user, 
		  thus expressing the close friendship he presumes to have with the user. 
		  At the same time, the scene "taking sides"creates a common enemy. Short 
		  interaction examples follow, in which the system tries to establish 
		  friendship between Virtual Character 1 and the user: </span></p>

		<h1 class = "SubHeader">Conclusion</h1>
		<p><span>I presented the project Art-E-Fact and the use of a narrative, 
		  interactive discussion group to deepen and contextualize art presented 
		  on the Web. I referred to art theories which state that art understanding 
		  is an inherently social, emotional and cultural process, and that therefore 
		  narration and dialogue are appropriate means of fostering art experience. 
		  I presented an overall initial view of the system and argued that creating 
		  friendship with the virtual companions is likely to improve the process 
		  of identification and narrative immersion, and sketched the automated 
		  processes that establish the desired emotional proximity. </span></p>
		<p><span>The ongoing issue might be regarded as a first attempt to virtually 
		  populate spaces that were until now wasteland like the Web, providing 
		  moments of automated suspense, immersion, and joyful learning to the 
		  interested user.</span></p>
