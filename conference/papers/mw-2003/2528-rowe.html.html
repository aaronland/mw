	  <p class=PaperTitle>A Prototype Digital Library For 3D Collections: Tools 
		To Capture, Model, Analyze, and Query Complex 3D Data</p>
	  <p class=Author>Jeremy Rowe and Anshuman Razdan, Arizona State University, 
		USA</p>
	  <div class=Section2> 
		<p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>
		<p class=AbstractText>The Partnership for Research in Spatial Modeling 
		  (PRISM) project at Arizona State University (ASU) developed modeling 
		  and analytic tools to respond to the limitations of two-dimensional 
		  (2D) data representations perceived by affiliated discipline scientists, 
		  and to take advantage of the enhanced capabilities of 3D data that raise 
		  the level of abstraction and add semantic value to 3D data. Three-dimensional 
		  data is complex, and application of modeling and analytic techniques 
		  significantly enhances the capacity for researchers to extract meaning 
		  from 3D information. The tool prototypes simplify analysis of surface 
		  and volume using curvature and topology to help researchers understand 
		  and interact with 3D data. The tools automatically extract information 
		  about features and regions of interest to researchers, calculate quantifiable, 
		  replicable metric data, and generate metadata about the object being 
		  studied. To make this information useful to researchers, the project 
		  developed prototype interactive, sketch-based interfaces that permit 
		  researchers to remotely search, identify and interact with the detailed, 
		  highly accurate 3D models of the objects. The results support comparative 
		  analysis of contextual and spatial information, and extend research 
		  about asymmetric man-made and natural objects that can significantly 
		  extend the interactive capabilities of museums for exhibitions, education, 
		  and outreach.</p>
		<p class=keywords>Key Words: modeling, archiving, query, retrieval, three-dimensional 
		  (3D) object</p>

		<h1 class="SubHeader">Background</h1>
		<p class=normal>Describing, cataloguing, analyzing and organizing 3-dimensional 
		  (3D) objects have been significant and long-standing challenges to the 
		  museum community. Sketches and scientific illustrations were augmented 
		  by photography in the mid 1840s. Beginning in the 1970s, computers began 
		  to provide powerful capabilities to automate and link catalogues, to 
		  manage research data, and to combine images and text to create educational 
		  materials and programs.</p>
		<p class=normal>Today digital museum collections and digital libraries 
		  include text, graphics, images, and increasingly, video, sound, animation, 
		  and sophisticated visual displays. Some now display three-dimensional 
		  objects and permit the user to rotate and view an image of the original 
		  object in their browser window using QuickTime, plug-ins, or custom 
		  applications. Examples range from presentation of objects for research 
		  or public access to time-lapse movies of exhibit construction and panoramas 
		  of exhibitions.</p>
		<p class=normal>Multiple photographs and QuickTime have begun to capture 
		  representations of 3D objects, providing "rotatable" images 
		  of complex objects and environments. These photographic representations 
		  of shape can be powerful tools for interaction and education; however, 
		  the underlying images are still two-dimensional and provide insufficient 
		  information for true 3D analysis.</p>
		<p class=normal>Though still significantly more complex and expensive 
		  than traditional photography, 3D data is becoming less costly to acquire. 
		  In addition, the number of sources of 3D data continues to increase. 
		  Medical imaging techniques such as CAT scans and MRI yield 3D data, 
		  as can Confocal microscopes, stereophotogrammetry, satellite and remote 
		  sensors, and laser scanners. Whether extracting information from existing 
		  data or creating data for additional analysis, the availability of digital 
		  3D representations is increasing and will continue to increase.</p>
		<p class=normal>Once in digital form, files can be modeled and analyzed. 
		  The Partnership for Research in Spatial Modeling (PRISM) project at 
		  Arizona State University (ASU) has worked with discipline scientists 
		  in anthropology, forensics, and cellular biology to develop prototype 
		  modeling and analytic tools that enhance research by raising the level 
		  of abstraction and adding semantic value to 3D data about the natural 
		  objects being studied.</p>
		<p class=normal>As objects become more complex in terms of variety of 
		  shape and changes in curvature, it becomes more difficult to quantify 
		  and analyze. Developing mathematical techniques to represent shape and 
		  curvature allows accurate models of the surface of 3D objects such as 
		  ceramic vessels, bones, or lithics to be created. These surface models 
		  and sophisticated mathematical tools present the ability to analyze, 
		  identify, and compare the objects that they represent. The accuracy 
		  of the measurements derived from the 3D models created equal or exceed 
		  those possible using traditional 2D tools such as calipers and rulers. 
		  In addition, measurements such as height, width, maximum height or width, 
		  surface area, or volume can be easily, consistently and accurately calculated, 
		  even for asymmetric natural objects.</p>
		<p class=normal align=center><img src="rowefig2.jpg" width="370" height="300"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 2. Examples of spatial analysis of ceramic 
		  vessel.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class=normal>Use of 3D data also makes possible new measures based 
		  on topology and global or local changes in curvature that define the 
		  shape of the original object. The project built an interdisciplinary 
		  team of discipline and computer scientists and technologists to guide 
		  an interactive development processes. Research questions were initially 
		  posed by the discipline scientists; then tools and spatial modeling 
		  techniques to address them were developed by the computer scientists. 
		  With the use of mathematical models and surface and volume information, 
		  many new and powerful analytic tools become available to spatially analyze 
		  objects. For example, boundaries between surfaces can be objectively 
		  identified, small local areas of changes in curvature identified and 
		  compared, and accurate, replicable measurements calculated automatically.</p>
		<p class=normal>Once the domain scientists link meaning to the changes 
		  in topology, shape, or curvature, a "feature" is defined. 
		  The modeling process provides an objective method to calculate physical 
		  measurements, and to consistently identify boundaries and changes that 
		  are associated with the feature, defining local areas that are of interest 
		  to researchers. Once a feature is identified, it can be described by 
		  its size, position, shape or curvature. Examples of features that can 
		  be extracted from the model data include the maximum diameter or height 
		  of a ceramic vessel.</p>
		<p class=normal align=center><img src="rowefig3.jpg" width="323" height="300"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 3. Components of interest for Ceramic Vessel</p>
		<p class=normal>Features can also be mathematically abstract components 
		  of interest to the researcher, such as the base or neck of a vessel, 
		  keel of a ship, boundaries of the joint surfaces on a bone or spindles 
		  that form in the nucleus of a cell during meiosis. Often the tools developed 
		  to identify features and regions also provide additional capabilities 
		  that raise new research questions within the disciplines. Developing 
		  the tools needed to address these questions becomes a new design challenge 
		  for the computer scientists, fostering a new cycle of development. For 
		  example, ceramic analysts have found tools that identify mathematically 
		  defined features found on the vertical profile curve of a vessel; such 
		  as end points, points of vertical tangency, inflection points and corner 
		  points, as features extremely helpful in analyzing vessel shape and 
		  style. These same tools have been useful in identifying condyle surfaces 
		  of trapezia for anthropologists and forensic scientists. The tools developed 
		  to join regions of interest in the trapezia have found application to 
		  lithic tool analysis.</p>
		<p class=normal>In addition to the tangible research benefit the tools 
		  and techniques provide, a significant result of this process has been 
		  the "cross-pollination" that has occurred as graduate students 
		  and faculty from different disciplines gravitate to a given project 
		  and explore application of tools and techniques to other discipline 
		  research.</p>
		<p class=normal>A summary of data acquisition and analysis processes begins 
		  with laser scanning to acquire the 3D data that represents the object. 
		  Mathematical modeling is then applied to identify features and regions 
		  of interest to the domain scientists. Software tools developed by the 
		  project team generate analytic data about the original object, automatically 
		  assign metadata about spatial characteristics, and populate the database.</p>
		<p class=normal>A visual query interface was developed to permit researchers 
		  to interact with the data using both contextual (text and numeric descriptive 
		  data) and spatial (shape and topological attribute) data. A sketch-based 
		  interface was developed to permit users to input both context and sketches 
		  to visually describe the object to initiate the search. Several text 
		  and spatial matching algorithms are used to identify and rank order 
		  objects within the database that match the search criteria.</p>
		<p class=normal>Initial development of the digital collections focused 
		  on Classic Period (A. D. 1250 &#8211; 1450) pre-Columbian Hohokam ceramic 
		  vessels from central Arizona housed at the Archeological Research Institute 
		  at ASU. These vessels have simple, undecorated surfaces, and their analysis 
		  focuses on shape and symmetry. The level of symmetry has been a research 
		  focus as it relates to the skill of the potter and may be related to 
		  the level of time devoted to craft as a community develops and evolves 
		  over time. Since even the best hand-made pots are asymmetric, the traditional 
		  measure of symmetry, the profile curve, can vary dramatically depending 
		  on the orientation of the vessel. Multiple photographs used to create 
		  a QuickTime view of the vessel would assist researchers in visual analysis, 
		  but not in more detailed measurement. By scanning and creating a 3D 
		  model of the vessel, researchers can perform detailed, objective analysis 
		  of the shape and symmetry using tools to compare local and overall curvature, 
		  inflection points (changes in curvature from convex to concave), corner 
		  points, and calculated measures such as surface area.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Methods</h1>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Metadata Schema and Organizational Structure</h2>
		<p class=normal>One of the greatest challenges in an interdisciplinary 
		  research effort is coordinating expectations among team members, and 
		  developing communication processes that bridge conceptual, strategic, 
		  and linguistic differences across the disciplines. An iterative process 
		  was developed to share research questions, tools and intellectual approaches 
		  across disciplines at project meetings. The results were a gradual bonding 
		  of researchers, development of a shared vocabulary, and substantial 
		  interaction about potential research issues and approaches. These efforts 
		  provided a foundation for the initial modeling and analysis, and for 
		  developing the metadata structure needed to organize data for storage, 
		  analysis, and query.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class=normal>A conceptual goal of the metadata component of the project 
		  was to develop an extensible schema structure that could accommodate 
		  adding new types of objects as the project continued to evolve. An object 
		  class was defined as the master class document type definition (DTD) 
		  for each item in the digital library database. For the 3DK digital library 
		  project, all of the additional descriptive data about each object was 
		  defined and organized as contextual or spatial classes.</p>
		<p class=normal align=center><img src="roweschema.t.png" width="395" height="317"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 4. Example of metadata structure.</p>
		<p class=normal>Contextual types define text and metric information about 
		  the object. This context class includes subclasses for metadata associated 
		  with objects as they are acquired, processed, and archived; such as 
		  type, item name, catalogue number, collection, provenance, etc. At this 
		  phase of the project, these fields were primarily determined by existing 
		  descriptive data elements, though efforts were made to design a schema 
		  structure that would accommodate adding new object types as necessary. 
		  To date, several iterations to refine the schema model to function effectively 
		  across object types have been completed.</p>
		<p class=normal>Spatial data types define the 3D attributes of the object, 
		  including raw data, thumbnails, models, and calculated or derived data 
		  about the topology, shape, and composition of the object. Use of common 
		  descriptive components and geometric elements as new object types are 
		  added will permit shared use of the modeling and analysis tools across 
		  classes of objects. The project goal is to develop standards for description 
		  and organization that permit automated cataloguing and population of 
		  data as objects are scanned and processed for entry into the database.<b></b></p>
		<p class=normal>Due to familiarity and availability of resources, an SQL 
		  database was used to store the contextual and spatial data. Fields were 
		  assigned to each data element, and large spatial data files were stored 
		  as hyperlinks. Generally accepted data formats such as binary, PLY, 
		  HTML, and XML have been used to make data accessible and simplify migration 
		  and access to the data over time.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">Scanning to Acquire 3D Data</h2>
		<p class=normal>The PRISM Digital Library project uses two Cyberware scanners, 
		  the M15 and 3030, to scan and capture 3D data describing ceramic vessels, 
		  bones, and other objects up to roughly a 30Œ maximum dimension. Each 
		  object is scanned by a laser which captures spatial data (x, y, z) values 
		  for each point. The scanners capture line-of-site data, so each object 
		  must be scanned, then rotated, and scanned again to capture additional 
		  data. This process is repeated until sufficient scans are obtained to 
		  combine to create a point cloud model to document the surface.</p>
		<p class=normal align=center><img src="rowescanner.jpg" width="389" height="300"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 5. Laser scanning ship model</p>
		<p class=normal>The Model 15 laser digitizer captures surface data points 
		  less than 300 microns (0.3mm) apart, producing high-density triangular 
		  meshes with an average resolution of over 1000 points per cm2. The digitized 
		  data generated by the scanner is composed of thousands of (x, y, z) 
		  coordinates that describe a point cloud that represents the surface 
		  of the object scanned. Further analysis requires generating a surface 
		  model from the point cloud.</p>
		<p class=normal align=center><img src="rowefig3.jpg" width="323" height="300"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 6. Representation of scanning of ceramic vessel</p>

		<p class=MsoCaption align=center><b><i>Figure 7. Point cloud of ceramic 
		  vessel combined from multiple scans</i></b>.</p>
		<p class=normal>Modeling techniques are used to create an actual measurable 
		  surface that represents the original object. In addition to the triangle 
		  meshes, PRISM software can represent these surfaces as Non-Uniform Rational 
		  B-spline (NURB) or subdivision surfaces (Bernadini et al., 98; Razdan 
		  et al., 98; Farin, 01, Farin, 02). NURB representation provides the 
		  capability to assess curvature distribution in complex objects; such 
		  as identification of the joint surfaces from scanned data of a bone.</p>
		<p class=normal><span class="normal">The accurate model of the object 
		  that results from this process provides the data and conceptual framework 
		  needed for objective, replicable analysis of surface and volume attributes 
		  of the objects under study.</span>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">Extracting Features and Identifying Regions of Interest 
		  </h2>
		<p class=normal>Once the geometric structure has been obtained, the next 
		  step is to identify features and regions of interest to the discipline 
		  researchers. Ceramicists look for shape, symmetry, and curvature, cellular 
		  biologists look for structure of bio-molecular machines inside a cell, 
		  forensic anthropologists look at shape, and surface comparisons. A number 
		  of 3D modeling and analytic algorithms have been combined, and new techniques 
		  developed to segment the geometric structure into regions, and to identify 
		  meaningful features<i>&nbsp;</i></p>
		<p class=normal>The nontrivial challenge has been to translate the features 
		  of interest to the discipline scientists into mathematically definable 
		  terms. For example, the transition between the neck and body of a vessel 
		  can be described mathematically as an inflection point and the maximum 
		  width of a vessel by its greatest diameter. Crosswalks of definitions 
		  to help translate terms and permit mapping mathematical concepts on 
		  to features meaningful to the discipline scientists have been developed 
		  by the project team. The 3D data permits accurate maximum and minimum 
		  measurements to be identified, as well as allowing calculation of complex 
		  metric and descriptive data that are extremely difficult to obtain using 
		  2D representations, linear measurements, and traditional measuring tools, 
		  particularly for naturally asymmetric or man-made objects such as ceramics.</p>
		<p class=normal align=center><img src="rowefig5.jpg" width="384" height="279"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 8. Region editor applied to trapezium data 
		  model.</p>
		<p class=normal>The second program developed is Region Editor that calculates 
		  more complex information about the object and its component features 
		  such as total object volume, absolute object symmetry, the area of surfaces 
		  identified, and the average angle at which surfaces intersect. Several 
		  of these measures are extremely difficult to determine accurately using 
		  traditional techniques, such as tape and caliper, particularly for asymmetrical 
		  objects. The Region Editor also permits researchers to add contextual 
		  information such as technical data about the scan, image processing 
		  that has been used, provenance, or collection to the 3D data. The final

		<h2 class="SubHeader">Interacting with the Data: the User Interface</h2>
		<p class=normal>A primary design problem was how to accept input to support 
		  searches for both contextual and spatial variables. An interdisciplinary 
		  "visual query interface" team guided research into interface 
		  design, identified desired capabilities, developed the interface, and 
		  coordinates ongoing revision based on evaluation data.</p>
		<p class=normal>The PRISM team chose to design separate contextual and 
		  spatial input areas in the interface screen. Textual data is input or 
		  selected from pull-down menus to query existing descriptive catalogues 
		  or databases. Search criteria can include metadata such as name, type 
		  or number of the item, collection, or other catalogue information about 
		  the object. This input area also permits the user to limit search by 
		  provenance by limiting the search to a specific collection, or by measurements 
		  such as height, width, or maximum or minimum diameter.</p>
		<p class=normal align=center><img src="rowefig7.jpg" width="395" height="281"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 10. Prototype profile-based visual query interface 
		  for searching ceramic vessels</p>
		<p class=normal>The most interesting interface design challenge was to 
		  accommodate the input to query spatial data and to identify matching 
		  3D shapes (Sakurai and Gossard, 88; Osada et al 2001, 2002; Razdan et 
		  al. 2001). To simplify the initial development of the prototype, and 
		  to mirror the 2D shape profiles of the ceramic vessels familiar to anthropologists, 
		  the interface model uses an interactive vessel profile graphic representation 
		  to define the spatial search component. A gridded area is used to present 
		  a sample of a profile curve selected from the menu, or permit the researcher 
		  to draw a profile to be searched. Using the mouse and tool palette, 
		  the user can interactively create or manipulate the shape until it represents 
		  the desired vessel. Initially developed as a Netscape plug-in, the 
		  sketch interface has been converted into a Java applet to support multiple 
		  browsers and platforms.</p>
		<p class=normal>After descriptive information about context and shape 
		  has been entered, the query is submitted. The descriptive and spatial 
		  information are separated, and the multiple database queries are coordinated 
		  by project software. The contextual component of the query is handled 
		  as a conventional text and numeric database search. The spatial search 
		  uses a variety of size, shape, and curve matching algorithms developed 
		  by the project team to identify and locate similarities within the databases. 
		  </p>
		<p class=normal>During search and analysis of potential matches, intelligent 
		  filtering techniques are used to limit the search pool. Initially simple 
		  text, metric, or gross spatial classification criteria are used to identify 
		  possible matches from the database and reduce the search domain The 
		  search progressively applies increasingly more complex algorithms to 
		  the shrinking pool of potential matches. This process minimizes computational 
		  load and search time while accurately identifying all objects that match 
		  the search criteria.</p>
		<p class=normal align=center><img src="rowevq2.jpg" width="395" height="306"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 11. Ranked search results.</p>
		<p class=normal>Another algorithm ranks the query results by descriptive 
		  and spatial similarity to the query image. Query response information 
		  is presented sequentially over several screens, each providing an additional 
		  level of information about the selected objects. The first screen displays 
		  thumbnail images and brief descriptions of the top search results. Also 
		  presented is a large 3D display of the top search result, along with 
		  more detailed descriptive and calculated information. The 3D model can 
		  be displayed as a point cloud, wire frame, or full shaded surface representation 
		  at the discretion of the researcher. Using the mouse, the model can 
		  be rotated and viewed from any angle. Selecting a thumbnail of another 
		  search result from the queue of search results will replace its model 
		  in the 3D display window.</p>
		<p class=normal align=center><img src="rowevq3.jpg" width="395" height="301"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 12. Detailed search results</p>
		<p class=normal>If more detailed descriptive information is desired, a 
		  third window is available to display the 3D model and two additional 
		  analytic tools - a profile curve and curvature plot, and additional 
		  descriptive data about the object. A fourth window can be selected to 
		  provide access to the complete descriptive and calculated data available.</p>
		<p class=normal>Significant effort has been given to adapting the interface 
		  design to accommodate differences in contextual data and analytic tools 
		  across different classes of objects. The object type metadata can be 
		  used to select the customized search template with fields for the contextual 
		  and spatial data appropriate for the object. The visual query interface 
		  team developed training materials to guide new users and evaluation 
		  instruments to obtain formative guidance from users.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">Evaluation</h2>
		<p class=normal align=left>Several techniques were used to evaluate and 
		  guide the development of the project. In addition to general meetings 
		  and team building activities, process mapping and interviews with project 
		  team members provided qualitative and quantitative input to help build 
		  communication among researchers in the team.</p>
		<p class=normal>Initial evaluation input regarding interface components 
		  and design were obtained from the roughly 25 project team members. The 
		  current version of the interface was used and assessed by the entire 
		  group at general and visual query interface team meetings throughout 
		  its development. The designs were critiqued, limitations identified, 
		  additional desired capabilities described, development challenges identified, 
		  and component work delegated to project teams.</p>
		<p class=normal>Several evaluation sessions were held to obtain input 
		  from faculty and student researchers outside of the team. After initial 
		  orientation, research problems were posed to the evaluation groups, 
		  and users used the interface to locate individual target objects by 
		  context, shape or size. Users were encouraged to explore the 150ceramic 
		  vessels in the test database and comment on the clarity, scope, and 
		  ease of use of the interface. A revision cycle followed each evaluation.</p>

		<h2 class="SubHeader">Discussion</h2>
		<p class=normal>One of the pleasant surprises during this project has 
		  been the ease of extending the modeling and analytic tools developed 
		  for one specific discipline to other research domains, as well as the 
		  growth of the tools for surface and volume modeling and analysis. The 
		  improvements that have resulted from the iterative process of identifying 
		  a domain research question, developing an application tool, deployment, 
		  analysis of potential applications across other research domains, and 
		  identification of new research questions have generated significant 
		  progress <a>in </a> developing modeling and analytic tools applicable 
		  to 3D data.</p>
		<p class=normal>As 3D data acquisition tools become more affordable and 
		  readily available, the amount of 3D data that must be described, stored 
		  and displayed will grow dramatically. Accommodating this huge data management 
		  challenge will require development of standards and tools to begin to 
		  analyze and add meaning to the data.</p>
		<p class=normal>The spatial and volume modeling and analytic tools developed 
		  by the project team permit discipline researchers to quantify and accurately 
		  replicate measurements of complex 3D objects. The feature and region 
		  recognition capabilities assist in visualizing complex, abstract concepts 
		  of interests to discipline researchers.</p>
		<p class=normal><span class="normal">The ability to generate and analyze 
		  accurate representations of 3D objects has many potential uses in the 
		  research and museum communities. Scanned and modeled artifacts can permit 
		  second-best access to the original objects where access is restricted, 
		  such as by country of origin, or by delicacy or condition of the object.</span></p>
		<p class=normal>Since the models are scale-independent and can vary in 
		  size or magnification, they permit detailed analysis augmenting visual 
		  tools such as dissecting scopes or microscopes for small objects, and 
		  providing new perspectives for viewing and analyzing large scale objects.</p>
		<p class=normal>In addition to analysis of individual objects, the tools 
		  can be used to compare objects, and one application currently under 
		  development is lithic refitting, though the time and effort currently 
		  involved limit the practicality of this approach.</p>
		<p class=normal>These modeling and analytic techniques appear to have 
		  many other applications for museums and collection management. The representations 
		  are accurate enough to support condition analysis to determine changes 
		  over time by comparing sequential scans. For Native American materials, 
		  another potential application is documenting repatriated objects to 
		  identify artifacts that reappear on the market at some point in the 
		  future.</p>
		<p class=normal>Several efforts are underway or are planned by the PRISM 
		  team to further extend the capabilities of the tools developed and their 
		  application to domain research. In terms of infrastructure, the move 
		  from custom plug-ins to Java will simplify deployment.</p>
		<p class=normal>We are exploring alternatives to the currently used SQL 
		  database, such as object-oriented databases. Another effort to improve 
		  searching is a pilot XML search protocol developed by the National Science 
		  Foundation Biological Databases and Informatics project at Arizona State 
		  University (BDI) research project, in conjunction with the ASU Long 
		  Term Ecological Research (LTER) Metadata Committee and the Knowledge 
		  Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) Project at the National Center for Environmental 
		  Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). The "Xanthoria" metadata 
		  query system developed by this project team uses SOAP (Simple Object 
		  Access Protocol) to send XML query requests and responses, and supports 
		  simultaneous Web-based querying of distributed, structurally different 
		  metadata repositories.</p>
		<p class=normal>The spatial analytic tools continue to develop as improvements 
		  are made in the feature extraction and region editing applications and 
		  more powerful techniques are developed to compare curvature, identify 
		  matches and rank search results. Key to these efforts are the expanding 
		  partnerships with other research areas with their own unique modeling 
		  and visualization needs. Included to date are more complex anatomical 
		  data from CAT scanners and MRI, cloud formation pattern recognition, 
		  geological erosion, and identification of targets within complex, noisy 
		  environmental data.</p>
		<p class=normal>Interface design continues to evolve. The project is evaluating 
		  models developed for 3D query and display by other projects including:</p>

		  <div class=MsoNormal> National Center for Biotechnology Information 
			(NCBI) Cn3D Genetic viewer </div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class=normal><span class="normal">The goal is to develop realistic 3D 
		interface models that permit the researcher to sculpt the query in 3D 
		space. Additional analytic tools are also being developed, such as planar 
		overlays to visualize and objectively compare joint surfaces of bones. 
		Techniques to bookmark searches to permit replication and simplify comparison 
		of objects within the databases are a significant challenge for dynamic 
		data sets in a client-server environment and are also being explored. 
		A complex variation of bookmarks involves providing a replicable trail 
		for researchers using the region editor and additional analytic tools 
		such as the planar overlay to interact with the data and create their 
		own interpretive models. Creating storage techniques for these derived, 
		researcher defined or modeled data, and managing "version control" 
		to permit replication and deconstruction of the analysis, is another challenge.</span></p>
	  <p class=normal><span class="normal">User evaluation of the current interface 
		layout, color palette and design continues, using both surface and volume 
		model data. In addition to initially developing specific bone or ceramic 
		vessel interfaces for the different research domains, the project is working 
		to identify commonalities and conventions to develop a unified interface 
		model. This common design appears to be possible in initial query interface 
		screens, with differentiation of interface display occurring as objects 
		are identified, search results are returned, and researchers drill down 
		into object data that may vary across disciplines.</span></p>
