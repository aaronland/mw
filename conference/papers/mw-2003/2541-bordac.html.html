	  <h2 class="AbstractTitle">Abstract</h2>
	  <p class="AbstractText">This paper outlines the development of a web-based 
		Teachers' Guide for the Museum of Tolerance from the initial team building 
		to the launching of the web site and overseeing its maintenance and evaluation. 
		Over an 18-month period, the Museum engaged in consultations and focus 
		group testing, to determine content and create standards-aligned lessons. 
		The development process became a case study in creative collaboration 
		and innovation as the project evolved from its first concept as a straightforward 
		guide for teachers planning a trip to the Museum, into an organic and 
		ever-expanding educational resource for educators everywhere. The priority 
		at all times was to meet the needs of educators using online technology 
		while ensuring that the Museum's core values were reflected in all aspects 
		of project development and implementation. Early indications of active 
		participation on the site are encouraging that it will serve as a springboard 
		for teaching tolerance and Holocaust history, as well as create a networking 
		tool for teachers to share experiences and challenges with each other 
		in the Los Angeles area and beyond. </p>

	  </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Introducing the MOT</h1>
	  <p class=normal>The Museum of Tolerance (MOT) was founded in 1993 in Los 
		Angeles, California, as the educational arm of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, 
		an internationally renowned human rights organization dedicated to preserving 
		the memory of the Holocaust and to fostering tolerance through community 
		involvement, educational outreach and social action. The Museum is an 
		innovative educational institution that encompasses a diversity of exhibits, 
		youth programs, professional training workshops, and community events 
		that inspire visitors to explore the meaning of tolerance and the consequences 
		of intolerance, both in the past and present. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Our visitors are a diverse audience. Over 110,000 students 
		visit the Museum each year as part of our school tour program, which consists 
		of a three-hour facilitated tour of exhibits that focus on issues of tolerance, 
		Human Rights and Holocaust history. In addition, over 12,000 educators 
		and law enforcement officers in California participate in the Tools for 
		Tolerance&reg; for Professionals programs, which use the Museum's unique 
		educational exhibits to explore issues of diversity and tolerance in the 
		workplace. Our National Institutes Against Hate Crimes and Terrorism bring 
		in participants from across the nation. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Unlike the traditional museum, most of our exhibitions are 
		not built around a collection of objects or archival materials. Exhibit 
		components utilize cutting-edge technology, grounded in learner-centered 
		pedagogy, that challenges visitors to confront bias and bigotry in the 
		world today. Interactive exhibits, touch screens, 'enviroramas', and documentary 
		films stimulate dialogue that creates an intensely personal experience, 
		which then moves one to think about the core values of tolerance, including 
		respect for human dignity, social justice, civil rights and community 
		building. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Combining an exploration of the past with a social action 
		mission for the future is the paramount pedagogical challenge of the Museum. 
		The primary approach to learning in the Museum is process-centered, meaning 
		<i>engagement</i><span style='font-style:normal'> in questioning, interpreting 
		and analyzing information. Visitors are encouraged to construct their 
		own understandings of complex issues to deepen the learning experience 
		while practicing one of the essential skills this institution promotes: 
		critical thinking. </span></p>
	  <p class=normal>Several key assumptions grounded in the Museum's core values 
		directed the development of the Teachers' Guide project: </p>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal">Greater self-awareness, including understanding our 
		  reactions to others, helps us to interact more respectfully </li>
		<li class="normal">Ordinary people are responsible to stop the spread 
		  of intolerance and hatred </li>
		<li class="normal">Since we are all connected individually and globally, 
		  we will achieve success through partnerships and collaborative projects</li>
		<li>Pursuing tolerance and forms of equity is a life-long process and 
		  the process <i>is</i><span class="normal"> the solution </span></li>
		<li class="normal">We are all leaders capable of individual and organizational 
		  transformation </li>
		<li class="normal">Every participant brings knowledge and experience that 
		  is the foundation of the inclusive process upon which participatory 
		  decision making is based</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Defining the Teachers' Guide</h1>
	  <p class=normal>The Teachers' Guide project originated as a challenge typical 
		of many institutions: MOT material became outdated as significant, new 
		exhibits were added. Previously, teachers who made tour reservations received 
		a short, printed guide of pre- and post-visit questions to help prepare 
		students for their Museum visit and to reinforce their experience. Our 
		staff felt that this guide no longer served the needs of teachers adequately 
		and also did not articulate the Museum's vision clearly. After an initial 
		focus group meeting with educators familiar with the Museum, we decided 
		to create an entirely new printed guide that would be accompanied by an 
		online version. The initial purpose of the combined print and web packet 
		was to provide teachers planning a visit to the Museum with materials 
		that would present an overview of the Museum experience, help them prepare 
		for the content in the Museum, and provide tools to help them sustain 
		the learning process back in the classroom.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Six years of working with teachers as part of the Tools 
		for Tolerance&reg; program provided invaluable insights into the challenges 
		faced by educators to encourage social responsibility in their students 
		and to teach lessons of tolerance. We entered into this project sensitive 
		to the fact that the issues discussed in our exhibits posed a special 
		dilemma for both teachers and students. In the classroom, teachers often 
		avoid issues that can be difficult and uncomfortable (genocide, hate crimes, 
		stereotyping, and cultural differences, for example). Teachers expressed 
		the need for materials to help them address topics with sensitivity and 
		which could be accessed quickly and fit easily into their curriculum. 
		More importantly, we sensed an opportunity to foster a living, dynamic 
		partnership with teachers through our Teachers' Guide web site. While 
		the project began with serving the needs of California educators, we soon 
		realized that it could be adapted to educational professionals across 
		the country and perhaps even world-wide. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The desire to expand to the web evolved naturally from the 
		Museum's long-term commitment to technology as a means of engaging visitors. 
		Developing web-based components for information and communication has 
		been integral to our national programs since 1996. The MOT had launched 
		"GlobalHate.com," an interactive touch-screen exhibit, and the CD-ROM 
		"Digital Hate" (produced annually) as a way to foster dialogue concerning 
		hate propaganda online and to provide a framework for critical thinking 
		about the complex messages transmitted through the web. A family of web 
		sites also linked the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Museum of Tolerance 
		and the Library &amp; Archives, connecting our own organizational resources. 
		Additionally, we had already reached outside of institutional space via 
		distance learning and video-conferencing technology. The Museum recognized 
		the need to develop a web resource targeted to the specific needs of educators 
		&#151; one that would extend far beyond providing content and would support 
		the growth of an organic network of teachers promoting tolerance in their 
		classrooms. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Building an Inclusive Team</h1>
	  <p class=normal>The Museum of Tolerance is the educational department of 
		a larger institution, the Simon Wiesenthal Center. All divisions within 
		the Museum actively contribute to the educational mandate. A cluster of 
		seven Museum staff members from various programs comprised the core team 
		for the Teachers' Guide. The core project team shaped the project under 
		the leadership of the Museum Director and the management of a contracted 
		project coordinator. This representative team was critical at the beginning 
		of the project. Smaller teams drawn from throughout the Museum focused 
		on individual content areas once the project was underway, thereby maximizing 
		efficiency and productivity. Small group reviews at each step facilitated 
		the larger cluster group when it came time for milestone reviews. </p>
	  <p class=normal>This approach ensured that the project teams modeled the 
		values of the Museum &#151; mutual respect, inclusion, and appreciation 
		for multiple perspectives. This basic criteria framed the initial project 
		meetings and assured that every idea was considered valuable and that 
		creativity would be critical for success. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Beyond the staff, a number of professionals were brought 
		in from outside the Museum to assist with this project. They included 
		the project coordinator, the design firm, the curriculum specialist, the 
		educators who participated in the project focus groups, and the grantors 
		who made the project possible. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The dedicated project coordinator brought a background in 
		educational technology, project management and web production. While Museum 
		staff participated enthusiastically in the project, it was necessary to 
		bring in a project leader who could focus exclusively on this project 
		while galvanizing the support and coordinated efforts of staff educators 
		towards meeting the project goals in a timely manner. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The design company selected for this project, DZN The Design 
		Group, offered a full array of web design and programming skills plus 
		significant print expertise. Because this project consisted of both web 
		and print materials, it made sense to use one vendor for both. They provided 
		creative inspiration to the content development process as well as to 
		the project vision. They understood our need to connect the face-to-face 
		experience with the print materials and reflect this experience and design 
		interface on the web in order to engage with educators around the country 
		and around the world. </p>
	  <p class=normal>A Diversity Consultant from the Division of Curriculum and 
		Instructional Services in the Los Angeles Office of Education (LACOE) 
		was brought in to manage the development of standards-aligned lessons 
		for the project. As an expert in both the California State Content Standards 
		and bias, prejudice and discrimination issues, her background and expertise 
		rounded out the team. The curriculum specialist worked with the Museum's 
		senior educator in developing the accompanying lesson plans, which merge 
		constructivist and experiential learning practices already incorporated 
		in the Museum experience with the academic standards educators are held 
		accountable to.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The project would not have been possible without an innovative 
		Capacity Building initiative of the California Community Foundation and 
		its ongoing, technical assistance. Recognizing the potential of the project, 
		the State of California and the Bank of America Foundation significantly 
		assisted further implementation. The grants received for this project 
		allowed for the comprehensive review and revision of the Museum's existing 
		educator materials and the development of an entirely new resource &#151; 
		the Teachers' Guide web site.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The strategic decision to hire a special project coordinator, 
		as well as engage the services of consultants, was necessary and proved 
		to be effective. We found it is important to choose collaborators who 
		support the Museum values and who bring talents that complement the skill 
		set of the Museum staff. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader" >Educators as Partners: Identifying Our Audience</h2>
	  <p class=normal>We knew that teachers who would use this guide were primarily 
		working with Grades 7-12, although there may be some Grade 5 and 6 educators 
		as well as college level users. Although the majority of student visitors 
		are from public and private schools in the Los Angeles area, there are 
		also student groups who visit from throughout the state and country. Additionally, 
		the Museum offers programs via video conferencing to students outside 
		of the Los Angeles area. The number of people with the potential to access 
		the Museum without ever walking through the Museum doors is growing. The 
		web site had to provide a sense of community for the various audiences.</p>
	  <p class=normal>In order to develop an accessible web resource that would 
		provide teachers with the content they had requested, we had to define 
		the average user in terms of computer experience and computer use habits. 
		By looking at the range of possible user experiences we hoped to build 
		a site that appealed to a spectrum of needs and skills. </p>
	  <p class=normal>As identified by educators, many factors contribute to different 
		levels of computer use in schools, including:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li style='normal'>Funding availability in schools</li>
		<li style='normal'>School district and regional wealth</li>
		<li style='normal'>Computer availability in students' homes</li>
		<li style='normal'>Access to school computers before and after school</li>
		<li style='normal'>Teacher comfort level with computers</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class=normal>We assumed that most teachers had access to the web through 
		computers at school or at home. Because the education sector uses Macs 
		in greater proportion than the general population of computer users, we 
		had to design the site with both Mac and PC platforms in mind. We also 
		had to consider that many teachers would have older computers in their 
		classrooms, although we did not over-simplify the web site to accommodate 
		older technology. We set the browser minimum at Netscape 4.7 and Internet 
		Explorer 4.0 and assumed a screen resolution of at least 800 x 600 pixels. 
		For connectivity, we had to be sure the web site was functional on a minimum 
		connection of a 56K modem.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The composite user was compiled from informal (Q&amp;A during 
		Museum visits) and formal (focus groups) conversations with teachers regarding 
		computer availability in classrooms and the ways in which they use computers 
		and the Internet. While there were exceptions, the profile below was the 
		one we returned to at each milestone to make sure we were designing a 
		product people could and would use. </p>

	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Developing the Prototype </h1>
	  <p class=normal>A key assumption from the onset of the project was that 
		in order to provide teachers with a valuable resource we had to develop 
		a prototype for use in gathering the most productive feedback from teachers. 
		We began with an evaluation of existing materials and programs. We looked 
		toward standards-aligned lessons, the development of web resources, and 
		the potential relationship all materials produced by the Museum might 
		have with educators in southern California and beyond. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Content</h2>
	  <p class=normal>The content development posed the most challenging aspect 
		of the entire project. The process forced the Museum to evaluate all materials 
		currently in use and to ensure it was appropriate and current for the 
		educators who would use this site. It became clear that the Museum needed 
		to create a basic toolkit for teachers which would assist teachers in 
		presenting content related to tolerance education and Holocaust history 
		and responding to student needs in relation to this content. </p>
	  <p class=normal>We knew generally what content we wanted to include, but 
		the details took months to define. The content for this site had to be 
		thorough without being encyclopedic, and focused without being over-simplified. 
		It also needed to be presented in a way that reflected our values, particularly 
		participatory decision making, while maintaining our role as experts in 
		the content. </p>
	  <p class=normal>In developing the prototype, we made assumptions about what 
		teachers would need: a Museum overview, Museum expectations of student 
		groups visiting the Museum, reminders for their visit, essential vocabulary 
		and definitions and suggestions for teaching the Holocaust, facilitating 
		dialogue, and debriefing their visit. We designed individual lessons with 
		the end user in mind, asking ourselves what would be helpful to know going 
		into an experience and what would extend the learning afterwards. </p>
	  <h2  class = "SubHeaderSmall">Standards-Aligned Lessons</h2>
	  <p class=normal>One of the realities addressed by the project was the varying 
		levels of preparation students had before coming to the Museum. Some teachers 
		are comfortable with designing curriculum around the Museum's content 
		and go to great lengths to prepare their students. Most, however, spend 
		limited time on the subject in preparation for their visit. We knew that 
		including easy to use materials to aid in this preparation was vital to 
		its success as a usable product.</p>
	  <p class=normal>From the onset, providing California standards-aligned lessons 
		was an integral part of the project. Because educators told us they are 
		increasingly being asked to justify their lessons and activities in terms 
		of state curriculum standards, the Museum aligned content and teaching 
		materials with state academic frameworks. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The process of alignment began with an analysis of the primary 
		themes of the Museum tour. While there are many, we focused on four core 
		subject areas: The Power of Words and Images, The Dynamics of Discrimination, 
		the Pursuit of Democracy and Diversity, and Personal Responsibility. Each 
		of these themes was aligned to standards, and then lessons were developed 
		that support one or more of these themes. The standards alignment is available 
		on the web site.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Under the guidance of our curriculum consultant from LACOE 
		and the senior educator on staff at the Museum, ten lessons were developed 
		that support the California Reading-Language Arts and History-Social Science 
		Frameworks and are aligned to the California content standards for English-Language 
		Arts and History-Social Science for grades 7-12. The Museum of Tolerance 
		was the first museum in Los Angeles to align its content and related lessons 
		to the California curriculum frameworks. The standards-alignment for each 
		lesson is included on the lesson plan. We provided appropriate primary 
		sources wherever possible.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Graphic and Technology Design</h2>
	  <p class=normal>Our design partner was a catalyst for extending the project 
		beyond initial expectations and for providing a level of material sophistication 
		that reflected the needs and design aesthetic appealing to the educators 
		we sought to serve. They brought a selection of very different design 
		concepts to the initial meeting with the Museum team &#151; each design 
		reflected the project requirement that the concept work for both the Teachers' 
		Guide print materials and the web site. The design team's ability to transform 
		the Museum's themes and values into impressive and varied designs heightened 
		the creativity within the Museum's project team. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The technology design began as a wish list of features and 
		functionality. After the focus group testing of the materials, we concentrated 
		on developing the technology. Importantly, the web site had to be not 
		only easy to use, but easy to maintain, with web-based administration 
		tools to manage the database content and areas that update regularly. 
		Other parts of the site that will be updated more infrequently could be 
		managed directly with HTML coding.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The design team was enthusiastically involved in the project 
		throughout the production process. However, there were key points where 
		their efforts were mostly focused: initial design concepts, prototype 
		design, final design and production. It was important for them to be involved 
		throughout, even if just through brief status conversations. Keeping them 
		up to date with our thoughts and progress allowed them to respond quickly 
		to our requests and help them keep us within the original project scope. 
		The Museum project coordinator managed the relationship with the design 
		team; centralizing project responsibility, managing deliverables, and 
		ensuring clear communication between the teams.</p>
	  <p class=SubHeader>Conducting Focus Groups</p>
	  <p class=normal>With the prototype complete, we revisited our original goals 
		and identified questions we wanted answered by our intended audience of 
		educators. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Our original project goals were to:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal">Assist teachers in preparing their students for a visit 
		  to the Museum of Tolerance</li>
		<li class="normal">Provide lessons that align with state standards for 
		  use in the classroom to prepare and debrief student visits to the Museum</li>
		<li class="normal">Provide educational materials that enhance Museum content</li>
		<li class="normal">Provide educational materials that are not dependent 
		  on Museum content</li>
		<li class="normal">Provide a global audience with access to related educational 
		  materials</li>
		<li class="normal">Address expectations regarding a visit to the Museum</li>
		<li class="normal">Support teachers by providing facilitation techniques, 
		  sharing guidelines for teaching the Holocaust, and creating a safe environment 
		  for their students</li>
		<li class="normal">Support educators' interest in teaching the Museum's 
		  themes by providing a forum for teachers to communicate with one another</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class=normal>We recognized that:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li><span class = "normal">Some teachers will spend 15 seconds reviewing 
		  logistics about a field trip, others may spend days preparing their 
		  students with vocabulary reviews, related lessons and activities, and 
		  classroom discussion</span></li>
		<li><span class = "normal">Not all teachers will have access to or be 
		  able to use the web site</span></li>
		<li><span class = "normal">We need to make it easy for teachers to find 
		  information and implement lessons in the classroom</span></li>
		<li>At a minimum, we need to provide vocabulary to teachers. Vocabulary 
		  is the one type of information that we hope will help to prepare students 
		  who have little exposure to the concepts before their visit</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class=normal>With this in mind we designed a questionnaire that would 
		allow us to gather comments from teachers qualitatively. The questionnaire 
		was designed around three main areas of inquiry: design, content and usability. 
		In order to properly measure responses to questions, the questions were 
		designed to be answered on a five-point scale.</p>
	  <p class=footnote>In order to hear the perspectives of a range of teachers, 
		we identified four distinct groups of educators who reflect the audience 
		for the product:</p>
	  <ol>
		<li><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Participants in the March 2001 focus 
		  groups. These educators have a history with the Museum's Teachers' Guide. 
		  Their input shaped our initial assumptions for this product.</span></li>
		<li><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Teachers scheduled to bring students 
		  through the Museum in March 2002. This group helped us understand the 
		  strengths and weaknesses of the product for the full cycle of the Museum 
		  experience. We interviewed the teachers before their visit and followed 
		  up with them after their visit.</span></li>
		<li><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Teachers who had visted the Museum 
		  with students in the recent months, and who represented some of the 
		  most and least successful groups. The purpose of this group was to determine 
		  if the Teachers' Guide would have been beneficial to recent visitors, 
		  whose experience was fresh in their minds. Additionally, we hoped to 
		  learn how the groups were prepared and to better understand the barriers 
		  to successful preparation. </span></li>
		<li><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Educators who had demonstrated commitment 
		  to the educational mission of the Museum. These participants were educators 
		  from whom we already have support.</span></li>
	  </ol>
	  <p class=normal>We invited participants to the Museum in small groups of 
		three to five educators each for late afternoon interviews and discussion 
		about the Teachers' Guide. All sessions consisted of questions and answers 
		about teachers' practices (in general and related to lessons of tolerance) 
		and about the design and content of the prototypes. The web site testing 
		was conducted with both web-savvy and Internet-novice educators. Testing 
		consisted of providing each teacher with a computer and allowing them 
		to explore the web site, followed by the questionnaire and a brief interview. 
		Each session was videotaped and later transcribed. The sessions emphasized 
		content needs and organization, with additional discussions about design 
		and web functionality. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The feedback from these sessions provided essential validation 
		of assumptions as well as valuable comments we had not foreseen. Educators 
		were consistently and emphatically excited that the Teachers' Guide was 
		standards-aligned. They identified important content elements that were 
		buried too deep in the web site. They provided comments on design, screen 
		colors, text legibility, content flow and site structure. The functionality 
		features of the site, including the message board, sharing student produced 
		work, and feedback forms, were well received, although they were not tested 
		during the prototype focus group testing sessions.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Selected comments from focus group participants:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>As a teacher, when you want to do something you want to prepare your 
		  kids for it first. You are thinking of ways for them to create a context 
		  for them to learn, sum it up in some sort of way. I like how it was 
		  structured like that. <br>
		  <br>
		  Language Arts and History Teacher, Grade 7, Hill Middle School<br>
		  <br>
		</li>
		<li><span >[The alignment to California content standards] gives the teacher 
		  the vocabulary to respond when an administrator asks "why you are doing 
		  this." The language is very powerful.<br>
		  <br>
		  </span><span
     style='font-size:10.0pt'>World History, AP European History, AP US Government 
		  Teacher, Upland High School<br>
		  <br>
		  </span></li>
		<li>It ties into the standards, which we are held so accountable for now. 
		  What we are teaching and why. Rather than having to do all this interpretation 
		  on our own, it is clearly here. <br>
		  <br>
		  English Teacher, Grade 10, Porterville High School<br>
		  <br>
		</li>
		<li>I like the way that you do have the main idea but the ideas on each 
		  individual lesson are the kind of things that the class could really 
		  get into - get involved, good conversation stuff, and I think that smaller 
		  topics help paint the big picture. Each day you can cover smaller, important 
		  issues, but they are still related to the big picture. <br>
		  <br>
		  Math and Science Teacher, Grade 6, Hill Middle School<br>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class=normal>The prototype testing period for this project took two months. 
		This included conducting the focus groups, transcribing the videotaped 
		sessions, analyzing the completed questionnaires, and interpreting the 
		data. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Finalizing the Web Site</h1>
	  <p class=normal>With our final recommendations in hand, we proceeded with 
		development of the final product. This included making organizational 
		changes, honing existing content, developing additional content and finalizing 
		design and functionality. Some of the content changes came as a result 
		of educator comments during the focus groups. Other changes came from 
		Museum staff who benefited from observations of the focus groups, the 
		availability of new materials that resulted from the production process, 
		and an increasing focus on the potential content depth and use of media 
		on the web site. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall" >Content Before Technology</h2>
	  <p class=normal>Content and user profiles drove decisions on our technology 
		choices. We set out to support the existing community of educators who 
		work with the Museum and bring their students each year, but we also wanted 
		to make the Museum's educational materials available to as many educators 
		as possible. The web could allow us to achieve that goal in a way that 
		was innovative yet consistent with the Museum's values. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Technology can be very exciting, but it has to be leveraged 
		by pedagogical values. In the process of creating the web-based Teachers 
		Guide, content drove technology for one central reason, we work in a field 
		that understands human relations as a delicate dance &#151; tolerance 
		and multicultural education is fraught with politics and personal sensitivities. 
		An extension of the Museum's values, this project involved the development 
		of a living, breathing educational tool that was adaptable to the changing 
		needs of its users and the unpredictable world around them. </p>
	  <p class=normal>All aspects of Museum education and outreach are designed 
		to enable the independent process of discovery. Museum facilitators are 
		trained to foster an environment in which questions are central and dialogue 
		is driven by the group. Therefore, it is our role as an educational institution 
		to create an environment within which participants make their own decisions 
		about what to do and how to do it. The web site had to reflect and serve 
		these values. There are three primary ways to see how these values and 
		associated content drove the process:</p>
	  <span class="SubHeaderSmall">1. Partnerships and Collaboration </span> 
	  <p class=normal>We recognized that teachers were critical partners in making 
		strides toward our goals. After all, it is the teachers who know their 
		classrooms and communities best. In line with our assumptions about adult 
		learning and participatory change, we have to leverage their knowledge 
		and experience to optimize learning and commitment. Therefore, the web 
		site had to be a fluid entity within which users could easily leave their 
		own mark and contribute to the site's utility and relevance. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Partnerships encourage new ideas and shared responsibility. 
		An effective working site that addresses building relationships and community 
		requires buy-in from users. That meant that we had to build in areas of 
		the site that allow teachers to correct, update, and even redirect the 
		content at times. The "For Teachers" section, which includes areas for 
		discussion, reviews, posting of lesson plans and students' work, became 
		a unique feature of the web site that was quite distinct from the printed 
		guide.</p>
	  <span class="SubHeaderSmall">2. Accessibility of Information</span> 
	  <p class=normal>It is our job to make complex information accessible to 
		the educators, students, and public who make up our community. In our 
		field, we delve into human dynamics of conflict and peace-making for which 
		there are no easy solutions. If we are to succeed in our Museum's overall 
		goals we need to translate these complex human problems that are often 
		historically-based and deeply engrained into manageable topic areas. While 
		it is easy to load encyclopedic information about the issues on a web 
		site, we know that it is not necessarily helpful. We needed to establish 
		a logical system with a non-cumbersome taxonomy of categories that would 
		not intimidate the user. The content therefore had to be written clearly 
		and presented in such a way as to offer nuggets of information that stand 
		on their own. More importantly, we needed technology that also allowed 
		for information that could easily be integrated into other areas of knowledge, 
		as well as open into additional layers of depth. It is our goal to help 
		people navigate these complex issues psychologically, theoretically and 
		practically.</p>
	  <span class="SubHeaderSmall">3. Facilitating Dialogue</span> 
	  <p class=normal>The role of the facilitator in the Museum of Tolerance is 
		to guide the group dialogue process in order to ease learning and enable 
		discovery of self, as well as gain insight into the experiences of others. 
		People are often intimidated by issues of diversity and prejudice, and 
		therefore, facilitation techniques are an important part of advancing 
		learning in a non-threatening way. We brought the same insight to the 
		design of a 'safe' environment on the web as well. The content had to 
		be user-friendly and presented in a respectful, democratic tone. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The site is presented in such a way as to invite users to 
		explore at their own pace, fully enabled to make their own decisions of 
		priority and relevance. In this way, the web site <i>is</i><span
     style='font-size:10.0pt'> the facilitator of personal learning and the dialogue 
		it engenders. As the site evolves, we hope that the role of the web site 
		as facilitator will grow as well. Through continuous updates of relevant 
		and timely information, we hope to provide teachers with information that 
		helps them address issues related to tolerance and intolerance in their 
		classrooms and to provide a supportive environment that includes a forum 
		to share best practices, ask questions, and benefit from the experiences 
		of others.</span></p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall" >Functionality</h2>
	  <p class=normal>The functionality needs of the site became clear as we defined 
		the content. We recognized that it was not necessary for the entire site 
		to be dynamically-driven, since much of the content would be static except 
		for periodic updates and additions. Under the direction of our web development 
		partner, the site was designed with HTML, Active Server Pages, style sheets, 
		and a database backend for managing the "For Teachers" section of the 
		Teachers' Guide site, which includes our registered users, bibliography, 
		uploaded content, and FAQs.</p>
	  <p class=normal>We knew not only that the backend functionality had to be 
		transparent to the site users, but also it had to be robust yet easy for 
		Museum staff to use for site maintenance. It was essential that a human 
		presence from the Museum be visible as a foundational step in building 
		an online community. In order to do this, we realized it was important 
		to have more than one person with administrative rights to moderate the 
		message boards and to manage different sections of the web site. The site 
		management tool is web-based and allows different levels of administrative 
		access to be assigned to staff members with different maintenance responsibilities. 
	  </p>
	  <p class=normal>The final development process included step-by-step user 
		simulations. As with the other phases in development, it was essential 
		to keep the user in mind as we made decisions about functionality and 
		content structure. Evaluation is an ongoing effort.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Maintaining the Web Site</h1>
	  <p class=normal>Immediately after launching the web site, we found ourselves 
		with a list of additions, changes, and questions. What is the process 
		for maintaining this site? Who is responsible for what? How often will 
		we update the site? What are the editorial standards for the site? </p>
	  <p class=normal>The process and schedule for web site updates has since 
		been established. The cluster group that developed the site is still involved, 
		although the activity is more independent than during the development. 
		The project coordinator has daily responsibility for collecting new content 
		and updating the web site. The Museum's senior educator reviews the site 
		and recommends new lesson plan submissions. Other staff members review 
		the message boards and make recommendations for additions to the bibliography 
		and to other content areas.</p>
	  <p class=normal>In the few months since launching the Teachers' Guide, we 
		have identified opportunities to use the web site as a springboard to 
		expand programs, develop new projects and enhance community building. 
		Plans to enhance existing content on the web site, include:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Develop additional standards-aligned lesson plans. The Tools for Tolerance<sup>&reg;</sup> 
		  for Educators program has begun to introduce the Teachers' materials 
		  during training sessions and has conducted two 2-day workshops with 
		  over 150 teachers to develop additional content for the Teachers' Guide</li>
		<li>Develop lessons for curriculum areas other than English-Language Arts 
		  and History-Social Science </li>
		<li>Assess the need for addressing curriculum standards for states other 
		  than California and for international academic frameworks</li>
		<li>Provide downloadable resource materials (e.g. primary documents and 
		  user-friendly articles) that enhance the vocabulary section and lesson 
		  planning activities </li>
		<li>Simplify the uploading process for submitting student work and expand 
		  the message board capabilities </li>
		<li>Continue to distribute content in languages other than English</li>
		<li>Digitize video materials, especially primary source materials and 
		  oral histories</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Measuring Progress</h1>
	  <p class=normal>The development of the Teachers' Guide web site extends 
		the commitment of the Museum to provide web-based materials, a community 
		of peer-to-peer support relating to tolerance education, and follow-up 
		connections for educators who participate in Museum training programs. 
		We will continue testing and refining the project over time as we gather 
		feedback from educators and staff who use the site through mailed questionnaires, 
		interviews, and focus groups. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Since the site was launched (without any promotion), users 
		have registered from across the country and around the world. People are 
		not just visiting the site, they are taking the time to register for the 
		"For Teachers" section. </p>
	  <p class=normal>In the year ahead, we intend to continue evaluating our 
		progress and focusing on promotion of the Teachers' Guide web site. In 
		order to learn more about the educators coming to the site we will review 
		our server and database reports to measure registered users and visitor 
		sessions, review where they are from, track how long are they staying, 
		and evaluate the level of their participation. Additionally, we need to 
		assess our responsiveness to questions, the quality of MOT facilitation 
		on the message boards, and the timeliness of content updates. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader" >Lessons Learned</h2>
	  <p class=normal>While there were many lessons we learned in the course of 
		developing the Museum of Tolerance Teachers' Guide, the following are 
		some that stand out as particularly significant: </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>A creative project is best realized by a combination of clear project 
		  leadership and a collaborative team that includes multiple talents and 
		  perspectives</li>
		<li>Aligning the materials (lessons and themes) to the state curriculum 
		  standards is immensely helpful to teachers. Teachers are increasingly 
		  required to justify the content they teach in the classroom and the 
		  field trips they take with respect to the state standards. This is the 
		  case in California and is the trend nation-wide. </li>
		<li>Educators use technology to prepare lessons for their students and 
		  to prepare themselves for the content they teach. Therefore, a web-based 
		  component to educational materials is an essential element. However, 
		  the challenge to a web-based component lies in its appeal &#151; the 
		  content must be maintained and updated in order to remain fresh and 
		  relevant to users.</li>
		<li>Educators at different levels of experience will use Museum-provided 
		  materials differently. Experienced teachers are more likely to adapt 
		  lessons and to supplement them than are teachers with less experience. 
		</li>
		<li>Focus groups offer helpful information. While the prototype reflected 
		  significant effort on the part of the development team, it was the feedback 
		  and guidance from the experts, the teachers who represent the target 
		  users of the materials, that helped shape and define the final product. 
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class=normal>This project has set a high standard for current and future 
		Museum projects. During the development of this project, its impact on 
		other projects was already evident. The content produced for the Teachers' 
		Guide has already made its way into other projects and publications. The 
		design elements of the Teachers' Guide web site and companion printed 
		packet are part of an effort to consolidate branding across programs, 
		media, and distribution purpose.</p>
	  <p class=normal>We have achieved most of our goals, but the effectiveness 
		of meeting our objectives will be determined over time by the teachers 
		using the site. </p>
