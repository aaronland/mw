		<p class=AbstractText>The 16-member Hopkins team is made up of faculty, 
		  staff, and students drawn from several divisions of the university,

		  Laboratory, the Department of Computer Science, and the Sheridan Libraries.</p>
		<p class=keywords><b>Keywords</b>: 3D cuneiform, cuneiform encoding, digital 
		  museum, virtual cuneiform tablets, 3D surface scanning, Unicode</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
		<p class="normal">Cuneiform is the world's oldest known writing system. 
		  The earliest texts appear in Mesopotamia around 3200 BC and the last 
		  native cuneiform texts were written around 75 AD.€ The ancient scribes 
		  pressed the ends of their styluses into damp clay in order to write 
		  the approximately 800 different logographic, syllabic, or alphabetic 
		  signs. The clay tablets were sun-dried or oven-baked and were thus preserved 
		  in the sands of the Near East for millennia. </p>
		<p class="normal">Since the decipherment of Babylonian cuneiform some 
		  150 years ago museums have accumulated perhaps 300,000 tablets written 
		  in most of the major languages of the Ancient Near East - Sumerian, 
		  Akkadian (Babylonian and Assyrian), Eblaite, Hittite, Persian, Hurrian, 
		  Elamite, and Ugaritic. These texts include genres as variegated as mythology 
		  and mathematics, law codes and beer recipes. In most cases these documents 
		  are the earliest exemplars of their genres, and cuneiformists have made 
		  unique and valuable contributions to the study of such moderns disciplines 
		  as history, law, religion, linguistics, mathematics, and science. </p>
		<p class="normal">In spite of continued great interest in mankind's earliest 
		  documents it has been estimated that only about 1/10 of the extant cuneiform 
		  texts have been read even once in modern times. There are various reasons 
		  for this: the complex Sumero/Akkadian script system is inherently difficult 
		  to learn; there is, as yet, no standard computer encoding for cuneiform; 
		  there are only a few hundred qualified cuneiformists in the world; the 
		  pedagogical tools are, in many cases, non-optimal; and access to the 
		  widely distributed tablets is expensive, time-consuming, and, due to 
		  the vagaries of politics, becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
		<p><span class="normal">The Digital Hammurabi Project, originating at 
		  the Johns Hopkins University, is a multi-disciplinary effort aimed at 
		  addressing the two major technological obstacles to greater productivity 
		  in cuneiform research - namely, the lack of a standard computer encoding 
		  for cuneiform text and the current inadequate state of the graphic representation 
		  of cuneiform tablets. </span> </p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Computer Encoding of Cuneiform</h1>
		<p class="normal">Cuneiform research is hampered by the lack of a standard 
		  computer encoding for cuneiform text, there being no ASCII equivalent 
		  for cuneiform. Instead we have multiple, competing, and proprietary 
		  encodings. This is a strong disincentive for producing the kinds of 
		  sophisticated and complicated text analysis software and fonts needed 
		  for greater productivity in cuneiform philology. </p>
		<p class="normal">Continuing the work of the Initiative for Cuneiform 
		  Encoding, an international group of cuneiformists, Unicode experts, 
		  software engineers, linguists, and font architects (&lt;http://www.jhu.edu/ice&gt;), 
		  we are facilitating an encoding proposal to the Unicode Consortium for 
		  Sumero/Akkadian cuneiform, to include characters from the Sumerian, 
		  Akkadian, Eblaite, Hittite, Elamite, and Hurrian languages, but not 
		  Old Persian. (A loosely related proposal for alphabetic Ugaritic cuneiform 
		  has already been accepted for Unicode consideration.)</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Graphic Representation of Cuneiform</h2>
		<p class="normal">Cuneiform, as written by ancient scribes, is by its 
		  very nature a three dimensional writing system:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li>most of the media are three dimensional - rounded clay tablets;</li>
		<li>the characters themselves are three dimensional - stylus tracings 
		  and wedge impressions in wet clay;</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> the writing streams are three dimensional 
			- sentences often run over the edges and onto the backs of tablets.</div>
		</li>
	
	  </ul><a name="fig1"></a>
	  <div align="center"><a href="watkins.fig.1.html"><img src="watkins.fig1.jpg" width="400" height="827" border="0"></a></div>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 1: 3D Scan of the Obverse and Right Side of 
		  a &quot;Micro-tablet&quot; in the Johns Hopkins Archeological Collection.</p>
		<p class="normal">Notice the rounded shape of the tablet, the three dimensional 
		  impressions of the wedges in the clay, and the writing streams extending 
		  onto the side of the tablet.]</p>
		<p class="normal">Heretofore cuneiformists have used two main techniques 
		  to represent cuneiform documents graphically - 2D photography and hand-drawn 
		  copies (autographs).</p>
		<p class="normal">Photographs have the advantage of conveying an accurate 
		  2D visual representation of a tablet with its text. But due to the multi-tiered 
		  three dimensionality of cuneiform documents (wedge impressions, round 
		  tablets, and over-the-edge writing), scores of photographs are required, 
		  taken at different angles, with different lighting, and at different 
		  magnifications, in order to convey enough useful 2D information to enable 
		  the collation of a single tablet. This is an onerous burden for research 
		  and publication. And even then, those scores of photographs will not 
		  contain the amount of information in a single, high resolution 3D image.</p>
		<p class="normal">The primary advantage of an autograph is also its primary 
		  disadvantage - it provides a representation of an author's interpretation 
		  of what signs are on a tablet. Manually drawing autographs is a laborious, 
		  time consuming, error-prone, and highly subjective process requiring 
		  direct access to the tablets. Cuneiformists must apply for travel grants 
		  to visit the tablet collections in London, Philadelphia, Aleppo, etc. 
		  And, though the resulting autographs have the advantage of recording 
		  a scholar's interpretation of difficult to read signs, both the quality 
		  of the interpretation and the quality of the drawing vary widely, and 
		  disputed readings are common. And in order to verify disputed readings, 
		  cuneiformists must apply for additional travel grants to inspect the 
		  tablets once again. The entire process is obviously slow, delicate, 
		  expensive, tedious, and, in the end, unproductive.€ Moreover, unlike 
		  photographs, autographs, by definition, are useless for collation, and 
		  are practically useless for paleography. </p>
		<p class="normal">In order to compensate for the deficiencies inherent 
		  in both techniques, lately we are seeing more and more cuneiform publications 
		  using both 2D photographs and autographs. But the combination is still 
		  inadequate for tablet collation. It is no wonder then that we are also 
		  seeing a spate of recent forays into 3D surface scanning of cuneiform 
		  tablets.</p>

		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 2: Photograph and Autograph of an Old Babylonian 
		  Text. </p>
		<p class="normal">The signs highlighted in yellow on the hand copy run 
		  off the right edge of the tablet and are not visible in the 2D photograph.

		<h2 class="SubHeader">State of the Art in Cuneiform 3D Surface Scanning</h2>
		<p class="normal">We mention here only a sample of the more interesting, 
		  from our point of view, 3D technologies currently being applied to cuneiform 
		  research.</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Image-based Re-lighting</h3>
		<h3 class="small">&lt;<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/news/2000/oct-dec/3dimaging.html" target="_blank">http://www.hpl.hp.com/news/2000/oct-dec/3dimaging.html</a>&gt;</h3>
		<p class="normal">Tom Malzbender, of Hewlett-Packard, in cooperation with 
		  Bruce Zuckerman of the University of Southern California and Walter 
		  Bodine of Yale University, has developed a novel approach to digitizing 
		  cuneiform tablets. His image-based re-lighting technology yields beautiful 
		  images, available for some interesting digital manipulations. But with 
		  this technique no tablet geometry is captured , and therefore no 3D 
		  manipulation of the tablets can be done. This technique may however 
		  prove to be useful when combined with 3D scanning.</p>
		<h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Cuneiform Visualization </h3>
		<h3 class="small">&lt;<a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/cuneiform/" target="_blank">http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/cuneiform/</a>&gt;</h3>
		<p class="normal">Marc Levoy and Sean Anderson of Stanford University 
		  have developed a technique for &quot;unwrapping&quot; 3D cuneiform tablet 
		  scans and rendering them in two dimensions. This has great potential 
		  for cuneiform print publication. They use 3D data acquired by the NRC 
		  technology described next.</p>
		<p class="normal"><a name="fig3"></a></p>
		<p class="normal" align="center"><a href="watkins.fig.3.html"><img src="watkins.fig3.jpg" width="400" height="320" border="0"></a></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 3: Unwrapping a Cuneiform Tablet</p>

		<h3 class="small">&lt;<a href="http://www.vit.iit.nrc.ca/VIT.html" target="_blank">http://www.vit.iit.nrc.ca/VIT.html</a>&gt;</h3>
		<p class="normal">Marc Rioux and the team at the Visual Information Technology 
		  Group of the National Research Council of Canada hold several patents 
		  on tri-color (red, green, and blue) laser triangulation surface scanning. 
		  This ingenious method simultaneously captures, at 50 micrometer resolution, 
		  both 3D geometry and colorimetric information. We believe this technology 
		  is the candidate of choice for further development for our application.</p>
		<p class="normal">After reviewing 3D technologies for the past 2 years, 
		  it is our assessment, and that of others, that all current 3D technologies 
		  are inadequate for tablet collation; they are too slow, too expensive, 
		  and, most significantly, achieve too low of a resolution. </p>

		<p class="MsoCaption" align="center">Figure 5: This enlargement from the 
		  highlighted area of the tablet gives some indication of the current 
		  resolutions attainable with laser triangulation - ca. 50 micrometers,

		<p class="normal"> We currently estimate our resolution requirement to 
		  be approximately 25 micrometers, or about 1000 dpi.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Digital Hammurabi Project</h1>
		<p class="normal">The mission of the Digital Hammurabi team is to make 
		  available to every researcher's computer very high resolution, three 
		  dimensional models of cuneiform tablets along with the computer encoding 
		  needed to type those texts in. </p>
		<p class="normal">Building on an initial 3-year, $1.6 million grant from 
		  the U.S. National Science Foundation, we are addressing all issues related 
		  to achieving that mission. The specific goals of the project are to:</p>
		<p class="normal">1) design and produce a portable, non-contact, user-friendly, 
		  very high resolution 3D surface scanner that can scan all facets of 
		  an average cuneiform tablet in minutes while implementing scan-time 
		  adaptive resolution down to 25 micrometers, i.e., 40 dots per millimeter 
		  (or 1000 dpi);</p>
		<p class="normal">2) develop new computer algorithms for stitching gigabytes 
		  of raw 3D data together into coherent, virtual tablets for real-time 
		  manipulation and rendering over the Internet; </p>
		<p class="normal">3) coordinate a formal proposal to the Unicode Consortium 
		  for a standard Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform computer encoding.</p>
		<p class="normal">4) collaborate in the development of international XML 
		  standards for 3D data, cuneiform bibliography, and cuneiform text markup, 
		  aimed at feature comprehensiveness, data longevity, and data integrity; 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">5) establish a petabyte-scale digital library and museum 
		  of virtual 3D cuneiform tablets targeted for rapid, real-time Internet2 
		  dissemination;</p>
		<p class="normal">6) invent a completely new technology - automated 3D 
		  character recognition of cuneiform writing.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Why Digitize?</h1>
		<p class="normal">There are manifold benefits to digitizing cuneiform 
		  tablets to create high resolution, high accuracy 3D models as "digital 
		  replicas" of the actual objects: </p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> High quality digital replicas of tablets 
			can serve to archive these unique cultural artifacts.</div>
		</li>
		<li>Virtual tablets can help with repatriation issues, particularly in 
		  serving as high quality substitutes for the originals.</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> Distributed, archival storage of digital 
			replicas provides an increased level of disaster-proofing.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> The ready availability of digital surrogates 
			lessens the need for researchers to handle original artifacts, thus 
			improving the chances for preservation.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> Digitization allows for accurate and inexpensive 
			3D reproduction of the originals in various materials, including plastic, 
			paper, stone, metal. (3D printing, &lt;http://www.cfoeurope.com/ecfo0701d.html&gt;, 
			or rapid prototyping, &lt;http://home.att.net/~castleisland/web_lks.htm&gt;)</div>
		</li>
		<li>Students will have vastly superior tools for study.</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> Researchers will be less dependent upon 
			expensive travel.</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> 3D models will enable geometrically-accurate 
			2D representations of the objects that can be measured or otherwise 
			quantitatively characterized. </div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> Virtual tablets, once digitized, are not

		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> Researchers will be able to programmatically 
			search for patterns in digitized 3D data. For example, they can perform 
			3D optical character recognition on digitized tablets.</div>
		</li>
		<li>Digitization opens up broader access to items typically stored out 
		  of sight.</li>
		<li>Digital publication will increase interest in the originals.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class="normal">Many of these advantages also would accrue to digital 
		  replicas of other kinds of 3D artifacts, such as pottery, jewelry, or 
		  bones.</p>
		<p class="normal">The greatest drawback to digitized information, and 
		  one we will have to address, is its vulnerability to fraud. Verification 
		  of authenticity is one of the most serious issues facing purveyors of 
		  digital information. Data longevity is also a serious concern, but one 
		  that can mostly be mitigated by adhering to XML-based standards for 
		  data representation. Such standards, however, whether pertaining to 
		  image data per se, or 3D file formats, or to various types of metadata 
		  (bibliographic, structural, technical, administrative), effectively 
		  do not exist at present, which is an emerging focus of attention among 
		  the 3D digital library community.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Current Status of the Project</h1>
		<p class="normal">At the end of the first four months of our three year 
		  NSF grant, we can report significant developments in the project.</p>
		<p class="normal">Culminating a two-year process of 3D technology review, 
		  the Digital Hammurabi team has provisionally settled on the tri-color 
		  laser range-finding technology invented at the National Research Council 
		  of Canada as the technology of choice for further development in 3D 
		  surface scanning of cuneiform tablets. In order to meet our requirements 
		  we foresee the need to advance the state of the art in the following 
		  ways:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> higher resolution</div>
		</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> faster data capture</div>
		</li>
		<li> smaller apparatus size</li>
		<li>vibration control or cancellation</li>
		<li> 
		  <div class=listwithbullets> automated acquisition of next-best-views</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class="normal">After viewing surface scans of cuneiform tablets on 
		  3D displays and looking at the NRC 3D datasets for some of the tablets 
		  they scanned for us, we have relaxed our initial requirement of 10 micrometer 
		  resolution to 25 micrometer resolution. We feel that 3D displays increase 
		  the information content of the data two- or three-fold in our application. 
		  And 3D display technology is poised for rapid expansion into the consumer 
		  market space over the next two or three years. (&lt;<a href="http://www.3dcgi.com/index.htm" target="_blank">http://www.3dcgi.com/index.htm</a>&gt;)</p>

		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 7: Enlargement of One Cuneiform Sign. This 
		  size of this sign is typical for a large number of cuneiform texts. 
		  And the 50 micrometer/500dpi resolution is almost good enough for tablet 
		  collation. We are planning to double the resolution to 25 micrometer/1000dpi.</p>
		<p class="normal">As of this writing we are in active discussions with 
		  the Visual Information Technology Group of the National Research Council 
		  of Canada about forming a research collaboration centered around enhancing 
		  their tri-color laser range-finding technology. Both parties are anxious 
		  to make this collaboration happen, but it is too soon to announce anything.</p>
		<p class="normal">Dr. Rykle Borger<b> </b>has graciously made available 
		  to us materials from the forthcoming 3rd edition of his discipline-standard, 
		  cuneiform sign list, <u>Mesopotamische Zeichenliste</u>. We are using 
		  his materials as a point of departure for discussions on what to include 
		  in the Unicode proposal. This database of cuneiform signs is on the 
		  web at &lt;<a href="http://www.jhu.edu/ice/signs/" target="_blank">http://www.jhu.edu/ice/signs/</a>&gt;.</p>
		<p class="normal">We are sponsoring and hosting the second Initiative 
		  for Cuneiform Encoding conference at Johns Hopkins University in the 
		  Spring of 2003. (&lt;<a href="http://www.jhu.edu/ice/" target="_blank">http://www.jhu.edu/ice/</a>)&gt;</p>
		<p class="normal">In November 2003, we are hosting the annual Unicode 
		  Technical Committee and L2 meeting at Hopkins, at which time we intend 
		  to formally present our proposal for cuneiform encoding. (&lt;<a href="http://unicode.org/consortium/utc.html" target="_blank">http://unicode.org/consortium/utc.html</a>&gt;

		<p class="normal">Soon we will be able to send plain text cuneiform email 
		  to one another!</p>

		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 8: The World's First Cuneiform Email. </p>
		<p class="normal">Using a prototype Unicode font and input method in Mac 
		  OS X, Apple System Software Engineer John Jenkins sent the world's first 
		  cuneiform email to other members of the Initiative for Cuneiform Encoding 
		  working group on March 30, 2001.</p>
		<p class="normal">We continue to collaborate with the Cuneiform Digital 
		  Library Initiative at UCLA (&lt;<a href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">http://cdli.ucla.edu/</a>&gt;), 
		  as we work towards enabling the interlinking of our digital assets. 
		  We were actively involved in the editing of their copyright agreement 
		  used with curatorial staff of museums in preparation for their Internet 
		  distribution.</p>
