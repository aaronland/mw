	  <p class=PaperTitle>Village Voice: An Information-based Architecture for 
		Community-centered Exhibits </p>
	  <p class=Author>Ramesh Srinivasan, Doctoral Candidate, Graduate School of 
		Design, Harvard University, USA </p>
	  <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract </p>
	  <p class=AbstractText>In this paper, I propose an architecture that can 
		enable a museum to represent&nbsp;the material it collects in its interactions 
		with communities. This architecture is discussed in the context of Village 
		Voice, an interactive video browser developed as part of my M.S. research 
		at the MIT Media Laboratory. Village Voice has shown potential as a system 
		that can archive content generated by community members through its departure 
		from traditional methods of using the Web to represent museum exhibits. 
		Instead of basing content and their interrelations around ad-hoc indices, 
		Village Voice allows the user to interact with material based on how the 
		community itself articulates the relationships within its different pieces. 
		I refer to this information architecture as ontology. Village Voice's 
		interface is based around a dynamic collage which is able to reveal the 
		complexity of the artifacts of a community because it can adapt to a user's 
		browsing history and the intricate relationships within the different 
		materials in the exhibit. I will discuss the means by which the system, 
		interface, and ontology were developed, and its deployment in a Somali 
		refugee community within the Boston metropolitan area, as well as efforts 
		being undertaken in a North Indian village in the Faridabad, Haryana district. 
		After presenting the architecture and project, I discuss the potential 
		of this technology to archive and faithfully represent the experiences 
		of communities through a simple evaluation. </p>
	  <p class=keywords>Keywords: story, interactive, ontology, architecture, 
		dynamic, collage </p>
	  <p class=normal>Alan Shaw points to the potential of communication technology 
		to enhance community life:</p>
	  <blockquote> 
		<p>If we focus our attention only on how this technology can connect us 
		  to people who are physically distant from us, then we are robbing ourselves 
		  of the potential for using these tools to address some of the most profound 
		  experiences that we will face in our lives. This is why epistemology 
		  is mightier than technology. Without adequate forethought, our technological 
		  advances can become disconnected and even contrary to some of our deepest 
		  collective assets and endeavors.Ô <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(Shaw, 
		  1995, p.17) </span></p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p class=normal>As the museums of the future begin to close the gaps between 
		themselves and the communities they wish to exhibit and share with the 
		larger world, I believe their ability to access, understand, and help 
		engage groups with which they work will become paramount. </p>
	  <p class=normal>There is a purpose behind my naming this project Village 
		Voice. A village is a set of people who have a shared history, co-dependence, 
		and present-day connections with those who are living in proximity to 
		them. These links are not merely passive ties, but allow the villager 
		to actively occupy a role within the larger community. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Village Voice is based around the decentralized navigation 
		of narrative. In such systems, narrative unfolds based upon both what 
		the viewer is watching and an overarching model of story.</p>
	  <p class=normal>My hypothesis is that a knowledge model, or ontology, created 
		by community members is more than a static structure with which to represent 
		community knowledge: When continuously populated with their stories, the 
		ontology becomes a dynamic structure that is used by members to model 
		the evolution of their community. Thus, ontology becomes a mechanism by 
		which the stories and artifacts of a community can be represented and 
		exhibited in the setting of a museum. It allows for the access and understanding 
		of community-centered exhibits to occur through the community's own semantics. 
		Values, discourse, and dreams are all framed in an architecture that allows 
		for the museum to faithfully represent the evolution and experiences of 
		communities worldwide. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Village Voice has been deployed in a community of Somali 
		refugees based in Jamaica Plain, MA. This community has dramatically expanded 
		over the last five years due to the civil war in Somalia. According to 
		community members with whom I have spoken, there is a desire to archive 
		their experiences as they face new challenges in the United States. They 
		wish to find a means to tell stories to their community, as well as to 
		incoming refugees and others outside of the community. Traditionally, 
		story has been orally transmitted in Somali culture, so the use of a medium 
		that records and retells story is new to them. In this paper, I will first 
		share some thoughts on the role of story and the relevance of focusing 
		on this when desiring to create a community-centered exhibit. I will discuss 
		the methodology by which Village Voice was introduced to the Somali community 
		and share some comments of how in general community-centered projects 
		can be initiated. This is followed by a discussion of the ontology design 
		process. Finally, I describe the storytelling system that was implemented 
		and present an evaluation of the Village Voice in regard to its ability 
		to disseminate story in the community. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Stories and Dreams </h1>
	  <p class=normal>Village Voice is built upon the premise that story is fundamental 
		to the sharing of experience. In cultures throughout the world, story 
		exists to serve a range of purposes from teaching a moral, contemplating 
		divinity, or preserving history. Stories are clearly one of the many ways 
		in which we, as humans, present who we are to others (Campbell, 1988). 
	  </p>
	  <p class=BlockQuote>Human beings are storytellers by nature. In many guises 
		as folktale legend, myth, epic, history, motion picture and television 
		program, the story appears in every known human culture. The story is 
		a natural package for organizing many different kinds of information. 
		Storytelling appears to be a fundamental way of expressing ourselves and 
		our world to others <span class="BlockQuoteAuthor">(McAdams, 1993, p.27)</span>. 
	  </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeaderSmall">Oral traditions and the role of communication 
		technologies </h1>
	  <p class=normal>Alfred Lord, whose work on oral storytelling focused on 
		the singing bards who narrated stories to their respective cultures, explains 
		that the oral tradition has persevered because "the picture that emerges 
		is not really one of conflict between preserver of tradition and the creative 
		artist; it is rather one of the preservation of tradition by the constant 
		re-creation of it."(1960, p.29). The oral tradition has persevered through 
		its adaptation to the change that is inevitable to all cultures. </p>
	  <p class=normal>In the Somali tradition, the oral process of storytelling 
		is embraced. Historically, the esteemed storytelling bards of each clan 
		transmitted this culture through poetry. Do computer networking and digital 
		storytelling have a role in such a tradition, particularly related to 
		the process of preserving and sharing an exhibit in a museum? I posit 
		that while recording stories and sharing them using a computer system 
		is a breach of Somali cultural history, it may be a productive step given 
		the community's displacement to the United States. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The possibilities computation offers change the dynamic. 
		Hypermedia is a paradigm that allows content to be related using pre-defined 
		links. The interaction is discontinuous, however, because the user has 
		to click on one of a set of choices to allow the story to continue. However, 
		stories could take advantage of computer systems to empower the user the 
		power to grasp linkages within the content in a more personal way. This 
		can enable the museum to preserve and share the exhibit in a way that 
		allows the visitor to take his or her own journey through the material 
		that is presented. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Methodology </h1>
	  <p class=normal>Originally, Village Voice was designed for the village of 
		Tikavali, as part of the Media Lab Asia Initiative. Tikavali was chosen 
		because of the long relationship it has had with the Jiva Institute, a 
		NGO partner of the Media Lab Asia. The role of story in this region is 
		undeniable. Derived from local and religious traditions, villagers in 
		Haryana have used story to articulate their experiences, beliefs, and 
		desires for years. </p>
	  <p class=normal>I wanted to test whether I could use a technology to mediate 
		the common thread of story in Tikavali. For one month (Sept and Oct '01), 
		Jiva trained villagers to use video to create stories. We collected these 
		stories with the goal of incorporating them into a system that could represent 
		them relative to community issues and experiences. </p>
	  <div align="center"><img src="srinivasan_mw2-really1.jpg"> </div>
	  <p class=MsoCaption><b><i>Figure 1: Villagers in Tikavali watching each 
		other's stories</i></b> </p>
	  <p class=normal>We collected 30 stories in this first incarnation of Village 
		Voice, a project that is still ongoing. From the collection of these stories 
		we found a number of common issues around which Village Voice could structure 
		its content. In this first and ongoing attempt, I found great value in 
		the process of engaging villagers in creating their own stories. It was 
		clear that building a representation in community terms for these stories 
		could be the key to building a system that could share narratives across 
		the community. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Ontology </h1>
	  <p class=normal>Ontology was found to be the missing representation, the 
		architecture that could organize and interrelate the stories of a community 
		in a way that was responsive and faithful to the existing social fabric. 
	  </p>
	  <p class=normal>I use Uschold's definition of ontology as an explicit representation 
		or structure of knowledge (Uschold et al., 1995). Ontologies can be used 
		to describe physical processes, educational fields, or in the case of 
		Village Voice, the discourse of a community. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Ontology can also be seen as a conceptual map where the 
		links between individual pieces of knowledge are delineated. An assumption 
		researchers in this field make is that knowledge is without meaning unless 
		it is contextualized. The specific nodes in the structure need to be understood 
		along with the links that tie them together. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Roger Schank explains that through ontology, we make sense 
		of the world. Information that we encounter is understood through our 
		own internal "data structures", which he calls scripts. Scripts, to Schank, 
		are our own implicit organizations of knowledge retrieved from the world 
		we inhabit (Schank, 1999). </p>
	  <p class=normal>Joseph Novak and Albert Ca&ntilde;as have been responsible 
		for some of the advances in the field of learner-created knowledge models. 
		Their projects focus on Concept Maps (CMAP). Concept Maps are based on 
		the idea that true learning involves the learner to construct relationships 
		between the new information he or she acquires and that which is already 
		possessed. The focus is to instruct the subject to explicitly map out 
		the relationships within a certain process or object that is being studied. 
	  </p>

	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 2: A concept map representation of plant (Ca&ntilde;as

	  <p class=normal><span class="normal">Subjects were found to have a deeper 
		understanding of the concept of "plant" after following these steps, particularly 
		when subjects were involved in critiquing each other's work. The experimenters 
		argue that there are two </span>reasons why Concept Maps augment knowledge: 
		first, because learning is structurally organized, and second, because 
		a general understanding of epistemology is realized by the subjects (<b>Ca&ntilde;as</b> 
		et al., 1999). </p>
	  <p class=normal>It is this process that I have used in the development of 
		an architecture that can represent the stories of a community. The next 
		section of this paper reveals how. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Methodology </h1>
	  <p class=normal>I needed a more immediate solution than the Tikavali project 
		could provide in terms of distance, communicability, and community cooperation. 
		The creation of the ontology would be the output of a significant amount 
		of fieldwork, rapport building, and patience in my introduction of the 
		project. I would need to work with a local community that I could visit 
		repeatedly, teach a number of video story classes with, and work iteratively 
		to elicit an evolving ontology. With this in mind, I sought out the Somali 
		Development Center (SDC) in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. In the next 
		two sections, I briefly introduce Somalis and their ancestral culture, 
		and the community in Jamaica Plain. In the meantime, the project in India 
		proceeds, but to really establish this ontology-based architecture, I 
		focused on this local community. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The Somali refugee community in the Boston area is concentrated 
		amongst a few pockets in Jamaica Plain, Roxbury, Revere, and Charlestown. 
		The population of this group has expanded over the last five years from 
		about 3000 to 5000 (Yussuf, 2001). Refugees span a variety of ages; however, 
		because of the mercurial nature of some of the programs that brought Somalis 
		to Boston, a number of families have been broken up in the process. Refugees 
		today are victims of a civil war that has torn apart these families and 
		decimated a once thriving culture. </p>
	  <p class=normal>There are only a few major hubs around which Somalis traditionally 
		gather. Most important seems to be the Somali Development Center (SDC), 
		on 205 Green St. in Jamaica Plain. Since 1996, the SDC has been a hub 
		for educational and social services for the growing Somali community in 
		Boston. SDC was established and funded by a small group of Somali-Americans 
		who originally came to the United States to obtain higher education. </p>
	  <p class=normal>I introduced myself to the community as a graduate student 
		at MIT interested in using video to document the experiences of people 
		in the community with the purpose of creating an exhibit that could serve 
		as a growing archive of their shared issues, challenges, and experiences 
		as recent immigrants to Boston. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The project was well received from the start. There were 
		obvious needs that this project could fill for the SDC. Most important 
		among them was the situation with incoming refugees. One of the priorities 
		of the SDC is to work to integrate these people with the existing Somali 
		community, and ultimately with the basics of living in Boston. A technology 
		that could introduce new members to issues and associated stories of the 
		community would help the process of acclimation. In addition, building 
		a tool that could document the unique culture of Somali-Americans could 
		help future generations be connected to their traditions, and reflect 
		on how they have changed over time. Finally, the SDC was interested in 
		using the different video stories gathered by project to present thematic 
		programs on their weekly cable access television show in the area. While 
		not as interactive as using the technology, this would certainly release 
		the stories of the community based on the themes specified within the 
		ontology. </p>
	  <p class=normal>A variety of SDC members had indicated to me that the Center 
		faced some significant problems. For example, the clan heritage with which 
		many Somalis identify has been a significant stumbling block in the Center's 
		efforts to try to build a unified community that can benefit from the 
		programs it offers. Is it possible to use technology to remind Somalis 
		of this heritage yet still show that these refugees are one clan, together 
		living in Boston? And where does the role of the museum come in here? 
		How can an institution that has a community-centered exhibit help the 
		community yet powerfully represent its stories to the outside world? </p>
	  <p class=normal>I became involved with the community first as a tutor and 
		mentor for teenagers. This involved bi-weekly visits to the Community 
		Center and other Somali institutions, where I would work on different 
		subjects with these kids. After two introductory months, it became clear 
		that I needed to involve members of the community to lead the project. 
		This would allow the project and its purpose to be better communicated 
		to the entire community, while facilitating the search for potential story 
		creators. I began to introduce the project to the kids I was tutoring, 
		to elders in the citizenship classes, at the local high school (English 
		High School) where the Somali teenagers of the area went to school, and 
		via the weekly cable-access television show. </p>
	  <p class=normal>It took a short while, but the efforts paid off. I soon 
		met many prospective story creators. After an introductory workshop on 
		the basics of creating video, I gave very few instructions to participants 
		except to focus their stories on issues that are relevant to them as Somali 
		immigrants in Boston. Over a month, 50 stories were collected from the 
		seven story creators. </p>
	  <p class=normal>I wished to use these stories to stimulate the design of 
		a representation, or ontology, that could illustrate the intersecting 
		issues of the community. My goal was to engage the community in the reflective 
		process of creating an ontology that could articulate the relationships 
		between relevant community issues. As issues in the community would change, 
		the community could redesign this representation through future ontology 
		design meetings. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Here I present the process and result of our initial community 
		ontology design: </p>
	  <h3 class="normal">Date of workshop</h3>
	  <p class=normal>Thursday, April 11, 2002 </p>
	  <h3 class="normal">Background </h3>
	  <p class=normal>50 stories created by community members were collected and 
		uploaded to the Village Voice system in Quicktime 5.0 Format. I converted 
		these stories to a VHS tape for the meeting because the SDC lacks the 
		computer resources to access the Village Voice site. The story creators 
		had created approximately two hours of video footage by this point. </p>
	  <h3 class="normal">Presentation </h3>
	  <p class=normal>We divided the workshop into two sessions, both of which 
		were attended by many of the same participants. The first presentation 
		took place in the morning after the citizenship class, and the second 
		took place during the traditional tutoring sessions, after school for 
		some of the younger participants. The two sessions went from 11 AM &#8211; 
		1 PM and 2:15 &#8211; 5:00 PM. Each session had about 20-30 participants. 
	  </p>
	  <h3 class="normal">Setup </h3>
	  <p class=normal>Approximately 80% of the videos were in Somali, and had 
		only been roughly translated for me. Many of the participants, particularly 
		older members, did not speak any English as well. For these reasons, two 
		leaders of the SDC helped me lead the workshop. They were Abdi Yussuf, 
		current director of the SDC, and Abdul Hussein, the founder of the SDC 
		and owner of Sagal Caf and Enterprises. </p>
	  <h3 class="normal">Goal Explanation</h3>
	  <p class=normal>Abdi and Abdul asked me to give them some examples of ontology 
		so they could explain it to the community. I concluded on an approach 
		of explanation through example. I showed them a variety of different ontology 
		projects. Abdi and Abdul concluded that they would explain the ontology 
		to the participants by asking them to discuss community priorities and 
		the relationship between these.<b> </b></p>
	  <h3 class="normal">Stories, Reflection, and Decision-making </h3>
	  <p class=normal>Each session began with an explanation in Somali to remind 
		participants about the purpose of the project. The movies were then shown 
		on VHS tape, and participants were encouraged to pause, stop, or repeat 
		the video at any time. They were instructed to do this whenever they felt 
		an issue that was relevant for their community was revealed in a story. 
		During the pauses, the community would discuss the videos they were watching 
		and craft a part of the ontology diagram on the white board in the front 
		of the classroom. The question of following tradition versus adaptation 
		to being in America dominated the discussions participants had during 
		the workshop. Elders would express consternation over the direction their 
		kids had taken. One female elder implored, "These kids don't have the 
		respect for authority we did at their age. Look at the language they use. 
		What has happened to what the Koran has taught them?" Some teenagers, 
		on the other hand, while remaining quiet when elders were in the room, 
		would tell me that while they had great pride in their heritage and religion, 
		they felt a need to fit in with their peers at school, and to follow the 
		opportunities being in America has allowed them. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Particularly spirited arguments came up when movies related 
		to women and sexuality or generational issues were viewed. Even the older 
		and deeply religious participants, were very divided on the question of 
		female circumcision, which is performed on approximately 98% of Somali 
		girls. Some participants argued that their move to a more democratic and 
		diverse country should force them to reconsider such practices, which 
		cause health problems and are invasive to women. Others, however, said 
		that rejecting these traditions was insulting to their Somali Islamic 
		heritage. </p>
	  <p class=normal>During these discussions, the community would come to a 
		consensus on whether an issue that had come up should be included in the 
		ontology. For example, one story was set at a Somali youth party. It showed 
		teenage men and women dancing together to hip hop music. The idea of a 
		youth dance party without Somali music was disagreeable to some of the 
		participants because of its disrespect to the Islamic taboo of pre-marital 
		relationships, while most of the youth at the meeting argued that one 
		could have a pre-marital relationship without being disrespectful to Muslim 
		culture. During this discussion, the participants decided that issues 
		of religious tradition, sexuality, and generational differences were relevant 
		to the ontology. These topics were then added to the ontology and linked 
		to each other on the white board. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The process of using these stories to allow the viewers 
		to articulate their opinions ended up being the key to the design of the 
		ontology that emerged. The fact that certain issues raised such discussion 
		brought to light how relevant they were to the overall community, and 
		allowed community members to flag them as relevant to include in the ontology. 
		Over the course of the meeting, we went through several iterations, as 
		different participants offered input and sketched the consensus of issues 
		on the whiteboard. The drawn structure changed multiple times in the process, 
		as the community members reflected further on the issues that united them. 
	  </p>
	  <p class=normal>The structure that emerged from the design meeting is the 
		following: </p>
	  <p class=normal><img src="srinivasan_mw3.jpg" width="648" height="444"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 3: Somali Community Ontology </p>
	  <p class=normal>Every community issue listed in the above diagram is called 
		a "node" in this thesis. The above ontology is a tree-like structure, 
		where all nodes are considered a "part-of" the parent to which they are 
		directly linked. The question I next faced was related to integrating 
		this ontology into the Village Voice. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Before discussing the interface, I explain the process by 
		which stories are associated with the community ontology. </p>
	  <p class=normal>I instructed the story creators with the basics of iMovie. 
		As digital videocassettes were brought to me for submission, the story 
		creators would use the editing software to extract stories from the cassettes 
		and convert them to the Quicktime 4.0 format. The story creators were 
		then instructed to annotate these stories according to the ontology, using 
		the story "upload" page. </p>
	  <p class=normal align="center"><img src="srinivasan_mw4.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption> Figure 4: The Somali community reacting to the video 
		stories </p>
	  <p class=normal>The story creators can decide to annotate their stories 
		with as many of the ontology nodes as they wish. These annotations determine 
		the association between the story and the ontology. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Village Voice has been made publicly available on the Web 
		(<a
href="http://village-voice.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">http://village-voice.media.mit.edu</a>). 
		As stories are submitted from the upload page, they are included in the 
		database. </p>

	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 5: Village Voice Search Page. </p>
	  <p class=normal>This page shows one major branch of the community-created 
		ontology. Village Voice is entered via a "search" page. This page is organized 
		hierarchically, according to the tree-based design of the ontology. The 
		user can select multiple nodes from the tree that he or she is interested 
		in watching stories about. </p>
	  <p class=normal>There are two colors of text on this page: white and yellow. 
		The yellow text (at the bottom of the page) reflects the nodes that the 
		user has selected to browse stories on. Above these are citizenship, refugee 
		flight, and sexuality/relationships. The white text (in the center of 
		the page) reflects the ontology tree, from which the user can select an 
		additional node to browse on by clicking on it. Finally, the user needs 
		to click on the search button to reach the browsing page, which expresses 
		the relevance of stories in the system to the topics chosen by the user.

	  <p class=normal align="center"><img src="srinivasan_mw6.jpg" width="576" height="435"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 6: Browsing collage page </p>
	  <p class=normal>The browsing page is designed to give the user a wide range 
		of information about the different video stories by displaying each story's 
		thumbnails, while conveying their relationships to each other. </p>
	  <p class=normal>As seen in Figure 7 below, the thumbnails are illuminated 
		to varying levels. This is reflective of how closely each thumbnail corresponds 
		to the terms the user decided to search on in the search page. A brighter 
		illumination indicates a closer match with the search query. </p>
	  <p class=ReferencesText align="center"><img src="srinivasan_mw7.jpg" width="566" height="211"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 7: The focus story and its relationship to the 
		collage. The selected story is highlighted in pink, and the other stories 
		in the collage are shownwith different levels of illumination depending 
		on their similarity to the focus story. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The story that best matches the query is known is the focus 
		story, whose thumbnail has a pink-colored border. Once the browser is 
		loaded, a user can change the focus story by clicking on any other thumbnail 
		in the collage. This changes the illumination of all the other thumbnails 
		in the interface based on how closely their annotations match those of 
		the new focus story. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The user is now presented with a number of options. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Thumbnail Options </h2>
	  <p class=normal align="center"><img src="srinivasan_mw8.jpg" width="150" height="126"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 8: Story thumbnail. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The three buttons on this thumbnail (from left to right) 
		allow the user to stream the video story, view all its audio annotations, 
		and upload an audio annotation of his or her own. </p>
	  <p class=normal>The story can be played by selecting the play button, which 
		is the leftmost of the three buttons below the thumbnail. This will stream 
		the video in a frame to the right of the collage. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Users can also record their reactions to any story that 
		they view. These reactions can be uploaded as audio file to Village Voice 
		by selecting the Talk button below the thumbnail. This will open a page, 
		as shown in Figure 9. </p>
	  <p class=normal align="center"><img src="srinivasan_mw9.jpg" width="323" height="201"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 9: Audio upload page. This page appears when 
		the upload audio annotation button is selected</p>
	  <p class=normal>Finally, the user can listen to the audio annotations associated 
		with any story. These can be loaded by clicking on the middle of the three 
		buttons under the thumbnail. </p>
	  <h2 class="MsoCaption">Searching on Ontology Nodes </h2>
	  <p class=normal align="center"><img src="srinivasan_mw10.jpg" width="173" height="104"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 10: Focus story annotations according to the 
		nodes of the ontology. This box is shown to the left of the browsing collage</p>
	  <p class=normal>The user can concentrate the browsing collage to focus on 
		a subset of the nodes of the ontology that the focus story has been annotated 
		with. This is done by selecting any number of nodes from the focus story 
		annotation box, which is found directly to the left of the browsing collage. 
	  </p>
	  <p class=normal>At any time, the user can leave the browsing page to go 
		back to the search page by clicking on the "back to search" button on 
		the bottom-right of the page. </p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Clustering Algorithm </h2>
	  <p class=normal>Village Voice finds stories that "best" match a user's search 
		queries or browsing choices based on its clustering algorithm. The level 
		to which a story matches the browsing choices is revealed in its level 
		of illumination, or alpha value. Alpha values range between 0 and 1, and 
		are directly proportional to the score calculated below. </p>
	  <p class=normal>In this algorithm, I introduce the terms "branch nodes" 
		and "end nodes". A story's end nodes are the ontology nodes with which 
		it is explicitly annotated. A story's branch nodes, however, are not only 
		the nodes with which it is annotated, but all the nodes on that story's 
		branch of the ontology tree. For example, if a story is annotated with 
		the nodes "Nomad vs. Urban" and &quot;9/11", its end nodes would be the 
		two nodes, but its branch nodes would also include their mutual parent, 
		"Cultural Adapation". </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Evaluation </h1>
	  <p class=normal>Now that both the methodology and interface for this community-centered 
		story archive have been discussed, I would like to point to a simple experiment 
		that demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach for the museums of 
		the future. I believe that the effective exhibit must show a greater level 
		of engagement with the community, and thus I wanted to study how strong 
		a representation of the community the village voice approach was. </p>
	  <p class=normal>I designed an experiment to test Village Voice's use of 
		ontology versus a keyword-based representation (Salton, 1968). In the 
		keyword version, I selected the five most frequently spoken words in each 
		story, and annotated each of the stories in the system with these. The 
		keywords were identified by the story-creators, who kept a histogram of 
		the words that were spoken in their stories and gave me a list for each 
		story. This list did not include "noise" words such as "is" or "and", 
		which are without significant meaning. Because most of the stories were 
		in Somali, the community's input was critical in creating the control 
		for this experiment. We also translated Village Voice into Somali so all 
		the conditions would be replicated. </p>
	  <p class=normal>As in Village Voice, in the keyword version, words can be 
		selected as the basis for story search. Browsing is also possible in the 
		same way. The only difference is that this version groups stories based 
		on whether the story is annotated with the same keywords. No clustering 
		is done based on relationships within the ontology, which is the key difference. 
	  </p>
	  <p class=normal>Over one week of testing, 30 subjects were tested, all of 
		whom were Somali immigrants living in the Boston area. I asked each subject 
		to sign an informed consent form, which assured them that the study was 
		anonymous. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Each subject was asked to browse Village Voice and the keyword 
		version for as much time as they wished, with a minimum of three minutes. 
		Before using either version, the subject would log in to the system with 
		an anonymous name so that I could monitor which sequences of stories the 
		subject browsed, how long he or she stayed logged on, and how many stories 
		were played. The audio annotation feature of the system was not completed 
		when testing was conducted, so this was not measured. My results were 
		as follows: </p>
	  <p class=normal>This data shows the mean and standard deviation values (across 
		the 30 subjects) of the number of stories browsed, number of stories played, 
		and time online for the keyword (KW) and Village Voice (VV) versions. 
		The values for time online are expressed in terms of seconds.</p>

	  </table>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Table 1 </p>
	  <p class=MsoNormal>These data show a higher engagement for subjects across-the-board 
		with Village Voice. In general, subjects spent a lot of time studying 
		the interface and not interacting with it heavily, as can be seen by the 
		rather small<span class="normal"> </span>number of clips played or browsed 
		on in either version. Many subjects mentioned to me that they would have 
		browsed in more detail if they were more used to the system and technology, 
		in general. </p>
	  <p class=normal>I present the story of one subject who browsed the system 
		for 10 minutes. This subject was first exposed to the keyword version, 
		where he spent his time selecting words from its search page viewing the 
		browsing collage and then going back to the search page. In the approximately 
		3 minutes that the subject used the keyword version, only once was a clip 
		played, and no browsing was done from the browsing collage itself. The 
		ontology version shows a different behaviour. Seven stories were played, 
		and the data show that the subject clicked on multiple thumbnails on the 
		browsing collage. Overall, the subject was measured as being more engaged 
		over the three data variables of the study. It appears that the ontology 
		version inspires more browsing activity from the browsing collage page, 
		and that the clustering of stories in Village Voice enables subjects to 
		perceive more connections between stories. </p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Concluding Thoughts </h1>
	  <p class=normal>I have observed that ontology can become a dynamic structure 
		that can model a community, and that it can encourage individuals to frame 
		their experiences in terms of relevant community themes. Testing has shown 
		it to be a model that can allow stories to be disseminated more effectively 
		than the traditional index of keywords that are spoken. As the community 
		changes over time, it can use ontology to contemplate where it has been, 
		and where it is heading. This points to the potential of the Village Voice 
		model as a means to dynamically exhibit the experiences of a community. 
		Basing the unfolding of these narratives around the community ontology 
		opens up the possibility for them to be disseminated more effectively 
		than the traditional index of keywords that are spoken. </p>
	  <p class=normal>Significant amounts of research remain to be done to better 
		understand how to maintain dynamic models of communities. However, this 
		approach has allowed a community to take control over the means by which 
		it is exhibited to the public, yet use the exhibition as a means of reflection. 
		I believe that approaches such as this thold promise in future intersections 
		between the museum and community. </p>
