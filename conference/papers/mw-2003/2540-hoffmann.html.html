		<p class=PaperTitle>Designing Collaborative Group Experience for Museums 
		  with Telebuddy</p>
		<p class=Author>Anja Hoffmann and Stefan Goebel, Digital Storytelling, 
		  Germany</p>
		<p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>
		<p class=AbstractText>In this paper we describe the Telebuddy project 
		  that aims to connect a live audience with an Internet community. Telebuddy 
		  is a physical avatar equipped with camera, microphone and speakers and 
		  connected to the Internet. Online users access the Telebuddy system 
		  via an Internet platform and communicate with people at remote places. 
		  With Telebuddy a novel user experience of feeling present at distant 
		  locations &#151; feeling "tele-present" &#151; can be achieved. Within a museum's 
		  environment several application scenarios are possible and will be discussed.</p>
		<p class=keywords>Keywords: Experience Design, Mobile Web Cam, Internet 
		  Chat, Tele-presence, Electronic Toys, Physical Avatars, Wearable Computers</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
		<p class=normal>Nowadays museums are confronted with the demand to bring 
		  their exhibits into the Internet and to maintain online archives about 
		  their exhibition. The challenge here is to find a suitable form of presentation. 
		  The more traditional way is to show the exhibit with the help of photographs 
		  or images enhanced with textual information or to offer video clips 
		  about it. From a rational point of view it seems that all necessary 
		  information could be given that way. But from an emotional point of 
		  view there is a lack of holistic user experience, e.g.: </p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=normal> The user is restricted to the passive role 
			of a spectator.</div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=normal> The user cannot experience the whole exhibit 
			concept and the atmosphere.</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class=normal>Another possibility is to provide live video streams online. 
		  For the users, that could be more exciting and enjoyable because they 
		  get the atmosphere and have the impression of watching a live event. 
		  But there are still unsatisfying aspects concerning the online users' 
		  experience.</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=normal> The users cannot influence the activities 
			on-site.</div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal">The users can watch the event but not participate.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class=normal>To bridge this gap a system has been developed that combines 
		  Internet chat with live video streaming and a physical avatar &#151; the 
		  Telebuddy (see Spierling/Dechau, 2000, Dechau et al. 2000, Dechau et 
		  al. 2001). </p>
		<p class=normal>The Telebuddy project aims to connect a live audience 
		  in a museum's environment with an online community in the Internet. 
		  Telebuddy &#151; a puppet or physical avatar - provides a visible body for 
		  the eyes and the ears of the Internet: The avatar resembles a real person 
		  who has the capability to see (through a camera), to hear (with a microphone) 
		  and to talk (through a speaker). Additionally, the puppet contains an 
		  infrared sensor to specify its position in a building. Like a "buddy", 
		  it can accompany a pedestrian  visit to exhibitions or interesting locations, 
		  and can talk about the shared experience. </p>
		<p class=normal>In cooperation between the Computer Graphics Center (ZGDV 
		  e.V.) and Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Rostock, the Telebuddy 
		  system has been developed as a prototype. </p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Motivation</h1>
		<p class=normal>Meeting and talking with other people is a natural desire 
		  of human beings. Phones enable calls to people all over the world. In 
		  the era of the Internet it is possible to meet at distant places without 
		  taking one step out the door. Chat and Web cams allow people to meet 
		  on the Internet. The desire for telecommunication is satisfied in many 
		  ways. In contrast, the desire of tele-presence is still unaccomplished. 
		  As Dechau et al. (2000) have defined, tele-presence is given when a 
		  person can take an active role at a distant location: the person is 
		  able to define content, influence the situation and other people and 
		  show verbal or nonverbal actions. From the viewpoint of an Internet 
		  user, one must have the impression of immersion, of being at a distant 
		  location. How?</p>
		<p class=normal>The Internet user needs to ...</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=normal> speak</div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal">listen</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=normal> see </div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=normal> move.</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class=normal>The metaphor was to have mouth, ears, eyes, hands and 
		  legs for the Internet. Therefore, the Telebuddy system has been designed 
		  and implemented. </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Related Work          </h2>
		<p class=normal>The work on Telebuddy has been inspired by a number of 
		  existing communication and information systems; e.g. Web cams, Internet 
		  chat or electronic toys. All of these systems have their advantages 
		  and constraints as described in the following paragraphs: </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Web cameras</h2>
		<p class=normal>Web cams provide live video streams of exhibits and events. 
		  The user gets &#151; in comparison to single pictures and text - additional 
		  information about ambient conditions (e.g. soundscape and light,...), 
		  visitors (e.g. number of visitors, behaviour,...) and environment (e.g. 
		  museum's building, interior decoration,...). Nowadays developments in 
		  streaming technology enable good quality visual and audiovisual information. 
		  Live video streams can be stored and archived. With that, a museum's 
		  visitor service is enhanced.</p>
		<p class=normal>Web cam technology opens a wide market - from private 
		  usage up to the area of security applications and appliances. Indeed, 
		  there is also a wide field of misuse that makes users feel suspicious 
		  of the technology. The interaction is limited to start and stop the 
		  movie or change the point of view. Active participation from the Internet 
		  user's site is possible.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Internet Chat Systems</h2>
		<p class=normal>The combination of Internet chat systems and multi-user 
		  applications allows online users &#151; represented by avatars &#151; to meet 
		  and talk in virtual 3D worlds. Examples are Virtual Fairs where people 
		  meet at a trade booth, or job fairs where applicants could get in contact 
		  with companies and employers. Linked with live video streaming via Web 
		  cams, users in the chat room could refer to ongoing activities at the 
		  distant place, but communication with people on-site is not possible. 
		</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Electronic Toys</h2>
		<p class=normal>Computer-based toys have an important role in the entertainment 
		  industry. The well-known Teddy bear has become intelligent and interactive. 
		  Examples are Microsoft Actimates&#153;(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/actimates/">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/actimates/</a>) 
		  or Furby&#153;. Apart from entertainment purposes, E-Toys also step 
		  into other application fields. The Leonie project of Siemens provides 
		  a security system hidden in a puppet or Teddy bear (see http://www.siemens.com). 
		  Pushing a secret button sends an emergency call and the position of 
		  the child will be tracked by GPS (Global Positioning System). These 
		  toys are designed to save children in emergencies because mailbox messages 
		  like "The person you've called is not available" are intolerable in 
		  these situations.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">User Interface And System Achitecture</h1>
		<p class=normal>The innovative character of Telebuddy lies in the successful 
		  combination of the advantages of all three areas mentioned above: Telebuddy 
		  enables remote participation at live events and establishes communication 
		  between online users and people on-site.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Physical Interface</h2>
		<p class=normal>The physical avatar as a link to the virtual world has 
		  to fulfil several intentions. </p>
	  </div>
	  <ol>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=listwithnumbers> it is a high-tech wearable computer equipped 
			with camera, microphone, speakers and robotics. </div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=listwithnumbers> it is the representative of Internet users. 
			Therefore, a concept for its visual appearance was essential. Instead 
			of "looking through a keyhole" (e.g. like an observation cameras) 
			it should be obvious for the people on the spot if there is anybody 
			else who looked at them. In addition, its functionality should be 
			apparent as well. So, the physical avatar has: <i>- ears</i> because 
			he can <i>hear</i> (with a microphone);<i>- eyes</i> because he can 
			<i>see</i> (with a camera); - a <i>mouth</i> because he can <i>speak</i> 
			(through a speaker); and <i>hands</i> because he can lift his hand 
			to get <i>attention</i> (with the help of robotics).</div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal">Nevertheless, the avatar has <i>no legs</i>. To avoid being tied to 
		  a stationary setting, any person can carry the avatar like a backpack. 
		  <p></p>
		  <div class=listwithnumbers> the puppet helps to overcome one'<a href="http://dict.leo.org/?p=iB2QE.&amp;search=s">s</a> 
			inhibitions to "talk" to a technical system. Only a few people would 
			talk to a camera, but a lot would talk to "something" cute and playful. 
			That effect makes it more enjoyable for the users in the Internet, 
			who will have a representative at the distant location.</div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=listwithnumbers> for a museum, company or event organizer 
			it could be considered as a marketing instrument that attracts attention. 
			It could look like the mascot or &#151; concerning a museum or art exhibit 
			&#151; as a well-known artist or artefact. It is enjoyable for the visitors 
			at the museum interacting with the "living puppet", and it makes their 
			visit more interesting.</div>
		</li>
	  </ol>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Web Interface</h2>
		<p class=normal>The Telebuddy Web interface reflects interactions by combining 
		  chat systems with Web cameras and electronic toys. Nevertheless, regarding 
		  the playful character of the physical avatar and the target group (e.g. 
		  museums visitors, children, elderly people), the Internet application 
		  must be intuitive to use. The platform is created for Internet users 
		  with different levels of knowledge about computers and technologies, 
		  such as Internet chat rooms or other community platforms. The user group 
		  consists of both chat experts who expect a certain system behaviour 
		  and users who rarely surf the Internet and have never visited a chat 
		  room before. </p>
		<p class=normal>Internet users access the platform through a Web portal 
		  (<a href="http://www.telebuddy.de/">http://www.telebuddy.de</a>). The 
		  interface is then divided into two main parts: an informational space 
		  and an interaction space. The information space provides an integrated 
		  video window for live video streaming and audio transmission. Additionally, 
		  textual and visual information about the museum, exhibition and exhibits 
		  is available where users can simply browse through. An online archive 
		  of past events may also be included.</p>
		<p class=normal align="center"><img src="Hoffmann_fig1_web.gif" width="400" height="320"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 1 : Telebuddy Web interface </p>
		<p class=normal>Basically, the interaction panel - based on a Java applet 
		  - consists of four  modules: chat room, question stack, spontaneous 
		  messaging system and Telebuddy emotion features. </p>
		<p class=normal>The chat room supports communication from user to chat 
		  group, from user to single user and from user to Telebuddy. In the last 
		  case, the message is transmitted to a text-to-speech converter and forwarded 
		  to the Telebuddy speech output (microphone).</p>
		<p class=normal>To initiate a common ground within the Internet community, 
		  a question stack with voting system was established. Any message generated 
		  by a single user and send to Telebuddy is judged by the other users 
		  to avoid insults and defamations. Contributions with high ratings move 
		  to the top of the stack.</p>
		<p class=normal>For spontaneous messages there is an additional functionality 
		  implemented. The messages are sent directly the Telebuddy.</p>
		<p class=normal>The Telebuddy emotion features allow users to show rudimentary 
		  emotional expressions. With their message they can send emotional annotations 
		  that are presented by Telebuddy's facial expressions, giving feedback 
		  through the avatar.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">System Architecture</h2>
		<p class=normal>The system architecture of the Telebuddy project is built 
		  upon a local server for wireless connection management between the avatar 
		  and the Internet and a main server providing data. The two-server architecture 
		  guarantees communication between the physical avatar as a mobile component 
		  and the client interaction applet on the Internet user's browser. The 
		  avatar is permanently connected to the local server via wireless analogue 
		  radio. With only one base station, a field of 400 meters inside buildings 
		  can be covered because of two analogue channels using the 2.4 GHz and 
		  433 MHz frequency band (see Spierling et al. 2000).</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeaderSmall">Designing User Experience</h1>
		<p class=normal>All possible scenarios provide a unique collaborative 
		  user experience. It gives people the illusion of being present at the 
		  same place and taking an active role in the scenario. To describe the 
		  overall user experience, it is useful to clearly define characteristics 
		  of experience design.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Usability and User Experience Goals</h2>
		<p class=normal> Preece et al. (2002) differentiate between usability 
		  goals and experience goals. The achievement of usability goals is widely 
		  accepted in (computer-based) system design. There is almost a common 
		  understanding that appliances and applications have to be, efficient 
		  and effective to use</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=normal> easy to learn and to remember how to use 
		  </div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=normal> safe to use.</div>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class=normal>Primarily, these goals concern the improvement of efficiency 
		  and productivity (at work). Less clearly defined are criteria regarding 
		  the users' subjective feelings while interacting with systems. Experience 
		  goals  deal with the following question from a user's perspective: Is 
		  the system and interaction with the system, </p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> fun</li>
		<li class="normal">emotionally fulfilling</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=normal> rewarding</div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal">aesthetically pleasing </li>
		<li class="normal">entertaining?</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<h2>Storyte<span class="SubHeader">l</span>ling to Enhance User Experience</h2>
		<p class=normal>Mainly, entertainment and computer games industries contribute 
		  to the work on enjoyment and fun. Braun et al. (2002) found that computer 
		  games primarily get their  entertaining character and dramatic nature 
		  out of the game play and the risk of losing the game. Stories, in opposition 
		  to games, provide dramatic structures, offer activities and plots, and 
		  cause the manipulation of space and time in the users' minds (see Laurel, 
		  1993). Therefore, the telling of stories contributes to the experience 
		  goals. </p>
		<p class=normal>Regarding collaborative aspects, the group experience 
		  lies in generating, narrating and listening conjointly to a story, so-called 
		  Computer Supported Collaborative Storytelling (see Braun et al., 2002): 
		</p>
		<p class=normal>The collaboration could be between person-person or person-virtual 
		  character. Examples are listed in the following points:</p>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=normal> Persons that use stories to narrate information 
			from one to another (e.g. decontextualisation of information)</div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=normal> Persons that use stories to get a common 
			context of information.</div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=normal> Persons that create a story together (e.g. 
			so called Web stories)</div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=normal> Persons narrating a story together.</div>
		</li>

	  <div class=Section1> 
		<p class=normal>For museums both constellations are interesting. The following 
		  paragraph specifies the thinkable scenarios.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Social Presence Aspects</h2>
		<p class=normal>To fulfil humans' desire to meet at distant places in 
		  the era  of telecommunication and the Internet is mainly supported by 
		  videoconferencing and Internet chat systems. As addressed in social 
		  presence theory (Short et al., 1976), the sense of being present at 
		  a distant location depends on verbal and nonverbal cues, body language, 
		  context, facial expression, and appearance that affects emotion intimacy 
		  and immediacy (see Preece 2000 and Rice, 1987, 1993). </p>
		<p class=normal>In comparison to videoconferencing, Telebuddy takes one-step 
		  forward: it is highly visible, tangible and audible. In addition, it 
		  conveys rudimentary facial expressions. For the visitors at the museum, 
		  the Internet users are represented in a highly extraordinary, emotive 
		  way that affects the online community in turn. </p>
		<p class=normal>Tests with the Telebuddy system have demonstrated that 
		  the puppet is recognized as something lively and animated. As soon as 
		  Telebuddy has shown its ability to speak, people feel free to talk to 
		  him. They have an intense interest to find out whether there is a machine 
		  or a person behind it. Again, these efforts are exciting for online 
		  users as well and help to establish vivid communication.</p>
		<p class=normal align="center"><img src="Hoffmann_fig2_web.gif" width="400" height="198"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 2 : First puppet prototypes</p>
		<p class=normal>The visual appearance of the puppet is an important criterion 
		  for people's communication attitude. For instance, a dangerous looking 
		  Telebuddy would cause more reserved communication behaviour than a friendly-looking 
		  puppet.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">Setting The Scene</h2>
		<p class=normal>Initially, the Telebuddy was designed for the International 
		  World Fair EXPO at Hannover/Germany in 2000. The usage scenario was 
		  to establish communication between an online community and EXPO visitors. 
		</p>
		<p class=normal align="center"><img src="Hoffmann_fig3_web.gif" width="400" height="269"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 3 : Telebuddy and visitors at EXPO</p>
		<p class=normal align="center"><img src="Hoffmann_fig4_web.gif" width="400" height="274"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 4 : Telebuddy at an EXPO exhibition booth</p>
		<p class=normal>At the same time, two other research institutes opened 
		  their doors for Telebuddy. All events could have been followed in the 
		  Internet. Anyhow, any events, exhibitions or occasions with highly entertaining 
		  characters are possible application fields for Telebuddy.</p>
		<p class=normal align="center"><img src="Hoffmann_fig5_web.gif" width="400" height="533"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 5 : Telebuddy at a German research institute</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">Story Space in Museums</h2>
		<p class=normal>The degree of freedom of a story ranges from emergent 
		  to predefined. Emergent means that the story is generated while the 
		  system is used and the users are in interaction with each other. In 
		  contrast, a predefined story is narrated exactly how it is written by 
		  an author. The museum where the Telebuddy system is applied can be seen 
		  as an author who defines content, actors, props and story line. </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Content</h2>
		<p class=normal>The purpose of a museum is to entertain, to inspire and 
		  &#151; primarily &#151; to present artefacts. Therefore, the content of a museum 
		  is mostly predefined. Telebuddy can be easily integrated in an existing 
		  exhibition concept.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Narrator, Moderator and Auditors </h2>
		<p class=MsoNormal>Both online and on-site visitors to the museum can 
		  play active roles in the whole scenario.  The person who carries the 
		  Telebuddy takes an important part. He is the one who influences the 
		  whole story with his behav<span class="normal">i</span>our. The user 
		  experience &#151; especially for the online community - depends on his cooperation: 
		  he must turn into an appropriate direction to assure acceptable video 
		  quality. With an integrated display in Telebuddy's hand, he can control 
		  the submitted video image </p>
		<p class=normal align="center"><img src="Hoffmann_fig6_web.gif" width="400" height="354"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 6 : Integrated display</p>
		<p class=normal>Furthermore he controls the flow of the story. By giving 
		  an outlook to the next scene (e.g. the next exhibit or artefact) he 
		  influences suspense and dramatic structure of the story. </p>
		<p class=normal>Especially in Web environments the retention period lasts 
		  only a few seconds if nothing interesting and spectacular happens. A 
		  moderator needs to control and generate communication and story. Additional 
		  tasks of the moderator include facilitating, keeping the group focused, 
		  opening questions and reducing flaming (see Preece 2000). The level 
		  of activity of the moderator depends on the story concept. In an emergent 
		  story, the role of the moderator can be limited to help people with 
		  general needs. The moderator can be part of the online community, on 
		  site at the museum, or the person who carries the puppet. </p>
		<p class=normal>It is important to distinguish the role of a moderator 
		  from that of the narrator because it is not always the same. Mainly, 
		  the narrator is responsible for presenting content and story plot. Any 
		  person in the different settings could step into the role of the narrator: 
		  people online, visitors in the museum or the carrier of Telebuddy himself. 
		  Positions can also change during the ongoing story: online user(s) start 
		  the story and can be displaced by visitors in the exhibition. The role 
		  of Telebuddy also changes: in the first case the puppet is the physical 
		  representative of the Internet community and therefore, it is the narrator. 
		  Telebuddy can be seen as a spectator when he is listening to a story 
		  that is told by the people in the museum.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">Story Plot </h2>
		<p class=normal>As mentioned above, the degree of freedom of the story 
		  ranges from a predefined story plot to an emergent structure. The two 
		  extreme situations are described in the following: </p>
		<p class=SubHeaderSmall><b>1.</b>  <b>Predefined story</b></p>

		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <div class=Section1> 
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Application Scenarios</h1>
		<p class=normal>Telebuddy is interesting for the areas of both art and 
		  science. Concerning museum specific aspects, the following user scenarios 
		  are interesting:</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Artists or experts in the museum</h2>
		<p class=normal>A unique form of art and science presentation is given 
		  with Telebuddy - for instance, when a museum has invited a well-known 
		  artist or expert:</p>
		<p class=normal>Artists present their own artwork from their specific 
		  point of view. They could explain what they intended to express, what 
		  they think about and how they realized the artwork.</p>
		<p class=normal>Experts from the science or art area could hold expert 
		  panels to enhance the exhibition, initiate a lively discussion and answer 
		  certain questions.</p>
		<p class=normal>The sessions will be streamed to the Internet via Telebuddy. 
		  In opposite to Web cam applications, the online users could get into 
		  interaction with the experts on-site. They could ask the artists/experts 
		  directly although they are situated at a distant location, and get an 
		  impression of personal motives and thoughts of the artists/experts. 
		  Visitors either on the museum's site or at far locations have the chance 
		  to participate in his special event.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Artists or experts as part of the online community. 
		</h2>
		<p class=normal>Known artists and experts mostly have a tight schedule 
		  and little time to travel to any places, especially when they come from 
		  all over the world. By using the Telebuddy system they could be in touch 
		  with visitors from distant places as often as they want &#151; without time-consuming 
		  traveling. They will be represented through the physical avatar, though 
		  visitors on-site have a contact "person" to answer their questions and 
		  to establish an interesting discussion. It's interesting for artists 
		  as well to get in touch with visitors and art admirers. They will learn 
		  about the visitors' point of view and opinions. </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Online visitors meet with visitors at the museum</h2>
		<p class=normal>Both users from the Web and people on-site could experience 
		  the exhibition together and share their impressions. The online community 
		  could ask the person who carries the puppet to improve their viewpoint, 
		  e.g. to get closer or to turn around. In return, the Internet community 
		  can provide the visitors on-site with additional information  on the 
		  online platform &#151; a novel form of collaboration.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Future Work</h1>
		<p class=normal>As mentioned above, Telebuddy is a new medium for working 
		  and learning collaboratively. For edutainment purposes, a treasure hunt 
		  scenario called Dino Hunter will be build upon the Telebuddy system 
		  (see Feix et al., 2003 and Goebel/Sauer, 2003). Dino Hunter is a virtual 
		  rally application that connects real and virtual worlds and maintains 
		  collaboration between online users and visitors on-site. The system 
		  is applied to the scientific field of palaeontology. An example scenario 
		  is described below:</p>
		<p class=normal>A group of pupils have to build up a virtual dinosaur 
		  from petrified bones and teeth. Starting from a central so-called  "Base 
		  Camp" &#151; a stationary kiosk system connected to the Internet - the group 
		  receives the instructions for the puzzle. Then they divide into subgroups 
		  with members online and in the museum to start the rally. The online 
		  participants get different information from what the kids at the museums 
		  have; e.g. they get a map and location-based information. The children 
		  at the museum have to accomplish all the operations a real palaeontologist 
		  usually does; e.g. searching for bone-fragments, uncovering, collecting, 
		  preparing and bringing the bones to the Base Camp (collecting point) 
		  and reconstructing the whole skeleton. For finding the bone fragments 
		  and solving small additional tasks, they need the hints of the Internet 
		  community. The interesting point is that the group members have to cooperate 
		  and work for one common goal: the reconstruction of the dinosaur. </p>

		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 9 : Dino Hunter scenario &#151; kids on-site 
		  search dinosaur fragments</p>
		<p class=normal>The Dino Hunter scenario can be applied to many other 
		  areas, like information technology, life sciences or engineering sciences, 
		  and so on. The mentioned subject areas have in common that they are 
		  particularly hard to understand (e.g. How does an engine work? How is 
		  an organic body built?). Complex information must be understood and 
		  learned by the pupils. A possible future gaming and learning scenario 
		  could be to collect parts of a car engine, put them together, and make 
		  them work in the virtual reality environment. </p>
