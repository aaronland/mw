		<p class=keywords><b>Keywords: </b>Real time, Flash Communications Server, 
		 Web lecture, Holocaust Museum, live Web communications </p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
		<p class="normal">It's 10 am on Wednesday, November 6, 2002 and Christopher 
		 Browning, well-known Holocaust scholar, is live and on air. In the 
		 small room with him are a cameraperson, a technician, and other interested 
		 parties. Mr. Browning is seated behind a desk&#151;here as a convenient 
		 prop&#151;and is looking into the camera, lights shining, delivering a ten 
		 minute introduction about the motivations of Holocaust perpetrators. 
		 After ten minutes, the first question is asked, "My question concerns 
		 your feelings when reviewing the testimonies of the perpetrators. Did 
		 you take them at face value or did you question their validity at all?" 
		 Mr. Browning responded, "an historian questions the validity of any 
		 source he uses. Even if I am reading original documents written at 
		 the time I always have to ask For what purpose was this written? Did 
		 this person have a certain agenda " And so it went for 50 minutes with 
		 excellent questions, in-depth answers and great engagement on the part 
		 of the audience and the host.</p>
		<p class="normal">Mr. Browning is not a guest on Larry King Live, nor 
		 is this some news talk show endlessly discussing the latest fad. But 
		 it is certainly no less important to the audience who is attentively 
		 listening. This is the Web, live from the United States Holocaust Memorial 
		 Museum (USHMM). The room in which the shoot is happening is meant for 
		 meetings. One light, bounced off the ceiling, shines on Mr. Browning's 
		 face. The camera is mini-DV format and is hooked up to a laptop computer. 
		 On the other end of the video feed is an audience in nearby George Mason 
		 University viewing the Webcast in a small square "window" of a computer 
		 interface made large by a projector. Speakers attached to the computer 
		 carry the sound somewhat detached from the video because of a time lag. 
		 And the students have to ask their questions via a phone line a la radio 
		 call-in shows. But somehow the conversation carries on for an hour. 
		 After, the participants remark that they feel lucky to have made contact 
		 with the author of a book they were reading for class. The Museum staff 
		 in the room high-five one another because, for all the technical glitches, 
		 this was a success! We used a new technology to facilitate a compelling 
		 seminar. And we would do it again.</p>
		<p class="normal">The technology that made this possible is one of the 
		 new "real time" communications offerings that allow users to cheaply 
		 and effectively interact with other users around the world. These new 
		 technologies open up many new possibilities for museums. Our technology 
		 of choice for this Web cast was the Flash Communications Server.</p>
		<p class="normal">The Merriam Webster online dictionary defines "real 
		 time" as "the actual time during which something takes place the computer 
		 may partly analyze the data in real time (as it comes in)..." Chat 
		 is a popular example of real time. As you type other see your letters 
		 and words. Video conferencing is another example of real time. While 
		 real time communications technology has been around for many years, 
		 a number of events have occurred recently that make it a much more viable 
		 and useful technology for museums. In the past, real time communications 
		 such as web conferencing was generally available only to corporate or 
		 government environments that had large amounts of funding and a primary 
		 purpose that would be greatly enhanced by web conferences. Now, the 
		 tools to deliver real time communications are within the reach of many 
		 more people because it has become more affordable and easier to use 
		 for the participants. In addition, the availability of high speed internet 
		 connections has increased, and the tools that drive the web conference 
		 have been packaged into reusable components, making the development 
		 of customized applications cheaper and faster than before. This also 
		 allows individual institutions to build applications from scratch based 
		 on these components&#151;thus allowing the construction of complex and rich 
		 web conferencing environments in house.</p>
		<p class="normal">Still, there are many challenges in using the technology. 
		 Extended video conferencing is still out of practical reach for users 
		 without a fast internet connection, although audio and text-only real 
		 time communications is feasible without a high bandwidth connection. 
		 Video delivered through the Web is not television but participants often 
		 expect a TV-quality experience from the technology and that still is 
		 not possible given today's limitations. [If you prepare your users 
		 for this beforehand, however, and show them examples of what to expect, 
		 they are much more able to concentrate on the content rather than the 
		 technology.] Another challenge is that our real time communications 
		 technology of choice&#151;the Flash Communications Server&#151;is still largely 
		 unproven in the market.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Flash Communication Server</h1>
		<p class="normal">One of the latest products from Macromedia, the Flash 
		 Communication Server (FlashCom) is server software that allows you to 
		 multicast real time audio, video and text (chat) from your Web site. 
		 To make the product work, all you really need is a Web browser, a camera 
		 with a microphone, and a high-bandwidth connection to the Web.</p>
		<p class="normal">The costs for using the FlashCom server are reasonable 
		 when compared to other ways of achieving the same result. The developer 
		 edition for a 1Mbit/10 user license is $499. The Professional license 
		 for 10Mbit/500 users is $4500. To augment the amount of users or bandwidth, 
		 you'll need to buy a 10/500 Capacity Pack for $4000. These costs compare 
		 favorably to simliar products such as Lotus/IBM's "Sametime" at $5000 
		 plus $20 per seat or TopClass at $5000 and up (source: David Strom, 
		 <a href="http://www.strom.com/places/wc.html" target="_blank">http://www.strom.com/places/wc.html</a>).</p>
		<p class="normal">For our Web lecture, we invested in the $4500 Professional 
		 edition as we envisioned delivering content to more than 10 users at 
		 a time. The USHMM currently has two T1 connections (3Mbit) to the Internet, 
		 so we would max out our bandwidth before using up our user license. 
		 The server software is running on a new but simple Pentium 4-class machine 
		 running Windows XP.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeaderSmall">First Tests</h1>
		<p class="normal">Our first experiments with the FlashCom server led us 
		 to conclude that the most important components in achieving a high quality 
		 production are the amount of bandwidth you have connecting to the Internet, 
		 the amount of bandwidth your users have, the camera quality, and the 
		 audio quality. The first test we did was between the authors. One 
		 was at home on a DSL connection while the other was at work on a T1 
		 so bandwidth was plentiful and not an issue. What was apparent, however, 
		 was that the author at home using his high-quality mini DV camera was 
		 sending a much clearer picture to the server than the other poor author 
		 using his Web camera. To date, using a high quality camera for our 
		 productions has resulted in the most marked improvement.</p>
		<p class="normal">These first tests also included monitoring our Web site 
		 activity for unusual blips. As we added users to the mix (we added 
		 as many as two others) we could only detect a small increase in activity. 
		 The FlashCom server is efficient. An important point to remember is 
		 that as you add users the amount of bandwidth utilized increases exponentially. 
		 Adding a third user means having to send a signals (audio and video) 
		 to two others and receive as many. We were able to affect performance 
		 by adding more users, but making some of the connections one-way or 
		 audio only improves the situation.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeaderSmall">Live for the First and Second Times</h1>
		<p class="normal">The Web lecture that Christopher Browning delivered 
		 used one-way audio and video. Questions were asked via the phone. 
		 Other than making sure the mute button was activated on the phone during 
		 the lecture to prevent feedback, this was seamless.  The video size 
		 for this first Web cast was a 250 pixel square image on a black background 
		 (the site is viewable at <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/gmu_chat/" target="_blank">http://www.ushmm.org/gmu_chat/</a>). 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">For our second Web lecture we choose a location farther 
		 from Washington at James A. Garfield High School in Garrettsville, Ohio. 
		 The topic of this lecture was Victims of the Holocaust and was delivered 
		 live by one of our staff historians, Dr. Will Meineke, to class of students 
		 viewing a projected image of the lecture.</p>
		<p class="normal">To build on the success our first lecture we decided 
		 to improve the quality of the audio by reducing the video size. Less 
		 video information results in more bandwidth for the audio. It worked. 
		 Where we had gaps in the audio during the first lecture, we had none 
		 reported during the second. In addition to reducing the video window's 
		 size we added two-way audio to the equation. This time we asked our 
		 participants to connect a microphone to their computer to ask questions. 
		 After adding speakers to our end to hear the questions, the sound quality 
		 of the participants' questions was better than the phone. Still there 
		 is improvement we hope to make on the quality of audio that we are delivering 
		 to our participants. We plan on achieving this in future lectures by 
		 purchasing a high-quality microphone and by improving the quality of 
		 the sound card in the laptop that is connected to the camera and microphone. 
		</p>
		<p class="normal">Both lectures were unmitigated successes in that the 
		 communication reached its destination and quality of content delivered 
		 was high. That is the bottom line. It has never been this easy to 
		 create advanced multi-user applications.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Other Possibilities for Real Time Communications 
		 in Museums</h1>
		<p class="normal">In addition to delivering regular lectures via the Web 
		 to secondary school and university audiences, we envision using the 
		 real time communications technology in various other ways. </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">A Virtual Tour</h2>
		<p class="normal">We have had some experience recently with adding curator's 
		 comments to the Museum's online exhibitions. The Web pages on which 
		 those comments&#151;in audio or video format&#151;appear are very successful. 
		 They are the stickiest on the site. In the online exhibition The Art 
		 and Politics of Arthur Szyk, the pages with the curator's comments have 
		 an average viewing time of around seven minutes per page according to 
		 out Web analysis software! The pages are simply composed of video interviews 
		 and edited "b-roll" footage of movement on stills. Using real time 
		 communications to deliver live tours of online exhibitions then should 
		 be an attractive gateway to Museum content. The curator's comments 
		 become a sound track to a presentation of Web pages.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Online Help</h2>
		<p class="normal">Another possible scenario is to offer immediate assistance 
		 to users seeking questions about a topic related to the museum. Users 
		 visiting that area of the Web site pose Holocaust-related questions 
		 to an historian that is &quot;on duty&quot; that day. The historian 
		 can chat with the user to answer their question, select an answer from 
		 a "canned" list, or refer them to another area of the site. This would 
		 offer the user immediate feedback and peak interest in other areas of 
		 the site. All comments and questions could be archived and put into 
		 a searchable database. This database would become part of the museum's 
		 knowledge base and integrated in some way into the search on the museum's 
		 site or placed in a special &quot;transcripts&quot; area of the site. 
		 This is much more powerful than asking a question via a simple email. 
		</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Standard Business Applications</h2>
		<p class="normal">There are all kinds of the standard business applications 
		 that apply here such as letting Museum staff communicate between offices. 
		 In a museum environment, one could set up a wireless network at an archival 
		 location and then allow people doing research at a far away site interact 
		 and search for items directly. Using a wireless camera and/or wireless 
		 computer allows you to move around a location. While the person might 
		 be able to talk on the phone with someone, the web conferencing offers 
		 a number of advantages:</p>
	 </div>
	 <ul>
		<li class="normal"> 
		 <div class=normal> A wireless network can reach places a cell 
			phone cannot. You may not be able to use cell phones in that area</div>
		</li>
		<li class="normal">A visual picture of items can be shown to both parties. The party 
		 at the archive site can show the person at the other end exactly what 
		 the item or document looks like and they can then agree that this is 
		 the item or not</li>
		<li class="normal"> 
		  <div class=normal> There is no per minute cost like there would be with 
			a long distance phone call</div>
		</li>
	 </ul>
	 <div class=Section1> 
		<p class="normal">Scholars from like universities could collaborate in 
		 real time on research and have a virtual meeting without the costs associated 
		 with this. Again, you can do this with current commercial web conferencing 
		 systems but they are expensive and cannot be customized to the level 
		 needed by the institutions.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Web Events</h2>
		<p class="normal">Event can be broadcast in real time from your Web site 
		 for a very inexpensive price. For example, if our museum wanted visitors 
		 to promote our tenth anniversary year, we could have an event with appropriate 
		 "stars" only available via the Web (the event could also easily be saved 
		 onto tape for use in a video news release for the press). Users could 
		 ask questions or listen to commentary by the guests or museum's historians 
		 about the event.</p>
		<p class="normal">This same procedure could be used with other video that 
		 is not real time such as films. As an example, a museum could broadcast 
		 part of a film or documentary relevant to the topic. As questions or 
		 comments about the film came up, the historian could answer questions. 
		</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Virtual "Comment Book"</h2>
		<p class="normal">Visitors to the Web site can leave &quot;virtual notes&quot; 
		 about their experiences while visiting your physical or online exhibit, 
		 your web site in general, an event or topic of interest, etc. These 
		 notes can be searched, archived and made part of the exhibit. All the 
		 visitor needs is a Web cam and a connection to leave a video message. 
		 Of course you would need some kind of screening process so you got material 
		 appropriate for the site.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Not Just For Conferencing</h2>
		<p class="normal">Conferencing is just the most visible aspect of real 
		 time communications. The core technology really allows users to communicate 
		 and interact with each other using what is called a "shared space." 
		 Audio and video conferencing are just the most common examples of a 
		 shared space but there are many others. As an example, this technology 
		 can easily be used to build and cheaply host online educational games 
		 that make your site more interactive and fun. For example, for "The 
		 Sport of Life and Death: The Mesoamerican Ballgame," the winner of the 
		 2002 "Best of the Web" award at the Museums and the Web conference these 
		 collaborative technologies could be used to build a multiplayer version 
		 of the game that lets many people play and learn at once. Other ideas 
		 include matching wits with historians on a subject (note that the subject 
		 could be fun and not necessarily directly related to the historian's 
		 topic of expertise) where you could have a trivia or skill game that 
		 would pit people against scholars or experts in an educational game. 
		  You could also have users play against or with each other to solve 
		 problems with an historian available and watching to offer hints and 
		 teach as the users play the game.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Deconstructing Pictures</h2>
		<p class="normal">A museum could use this technology to point out various 
		 aspects of pictures (or paintings, or other forms of art) to users. 
		 The technology would allow art experts to draw on top of the pictures 
		 and talk at the same time thereby providing a sound track. </p>
		<h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Question and Answer Sessions</h2>
		<p class="normal">The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is planning 
		 on facilitating using this new technology question and answer sessions 
		 with survivors. If there is one aspect of this technology that is most 
		 important it may be that it makes human resources more available. Instead 
		 of traveling, survivors can engage with students in classrooms around 
		 the world at the same time. Historians and curators can make themselves

		<p class="normal">The last question comes from a young woman in the Ohio, 
		 high school class. "How did Hitler come up with the ideology for blond 
		 hair and blue eyes?"</p>
		<p class="normal">Dr. Meineke's answer, "ah that goes back to Aryanism,' 
		 if you will. The Nazis weren't the first racist thinkers. There were 
		 other racist thinkers that toyed with the idea of the Nordic European 
		 being the best example of the superior race Hitler considered himself 
		 a South German Aryan."</p>
		<p class="normal">Before signing off the teacher asks one final question. 
		 I will be at the Museum with my class on January 27 and we were hoping 
		 to meet you. </p>
		<p class="normal">"Great," Dr. Meineke responds,  "I'll check my calendar."</p>
