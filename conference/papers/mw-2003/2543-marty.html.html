	  <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>
	  <p class=AbstractText>This paper presents preliminary results from a five 
		year longitudinal study on the efficacy of integrating museum resources 
		into elementary and middle school curricula through educational outreach 
		activities, over the Internet and in the classroom. From 1997 to 2003, 
		museum educators at the University of Illinois' Spurlock Museum have explored 
		how students unable to travel to the museum could make the most effective 
		use of the museum's online resources. Using problem-based learning methodologies, 
		museum educators worked with several local school teachers to develop 
		a series of projects that were closely integrated with the students' classroom 
		activities. This paper evaluates the results of the program and presents 
		the process of developing one of these projects: an analysis of the authenticity 
		of ancient Egyptian cartonnage fragments.</p>

	  <p class=SubHeader>Introduction</p>
	  <p class=normal>This paper discusses the lessons learned from a museum/school 
		educational outreach activity conducted over the past five years at the 
		Spurlock Museum at the University of Illinois. From December 1997 to January 
		2003, over 300 students in ten different classrooms at seven different 
		schools in Central Illinois have been engaged in an exploration of ancient 
		Egyptian history enhanced by the addition of virtual and physical museum 
		resources. Presented with alleged fragments of Egyptian cartonnage (waste 
		papyrus or linen soaked in plaster, often used to create mummy casings), 
		students&#151; working in teams&#151;were asked to assume the roles of 
		museum curators and research the culture, beliefs, and practices of the 
		ancient Egyptians to determine the authenticity of their artifacts. To 
		facilitate the research process, students had access to online resources 
		specifically developed by museum staff members for this project. The availability 
		of these virtual resources, combined with the presence of the physical 
		artifacts, successfully created an enhanced learning experience for the 
		students.</p>
	  <p class=normal>This paper presents the preliminary findings of this study 
		and documents the methods developed by the museum staff to work with the 
		students. It discusses such issues as the relative benefits of<i> </i>sing 
		physical museum artifacts, the importance of visiting the students'<i> 
		</i>classrooms in person, the difficulties of communicating with students 
		through email and online discussion boards, and the significance of developing 
		online databases and electronic resource guides specially geared for the 
		project. It is our hope that the results of this study will shed new light 
		on how museum educators can work with elementary and middle school teachers 
		to integrate museum resources into their curricula in the classroom and 
		over the Internet.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Background and Significance of Project</h1>
	  <p class=normal>In November of 1997, a sixth-grade teacher from a local 
		middle school approached staff members at the Spurlock Museum to see if 
		they would be willing to collaborate on designing a problem-based learning 
		experience (Boud &amp; Feletti, 1991) for her students, who were going 
		to be studying ancient Egypt in December. She wanted her students to assume 
		the roles of museum curators, and then to deal with a real-life problem: 
		the authenticity of one of their Egyptian artifacts is being challenged. 
		Their tasks would be to research the artifact, investigate its authenticity, 
		and determine its provenance, while paying particular attention to repatriation 
		issues (such as the UNESCO 1971 treaty). She wondered if the museum could 
		help her out.</p>
	  <p class=normal>In 1997, the Spurlock Museum had just begun a massive project 
		to inventory, pack, and move its collections of 45,000 artifacts across 
		campus to a new facility (Marty, 2000). As part of this move, the museum 
		was to be closed to the public for over two years, and it was important 
		to the museum staff that they find alternate methods of keeping the museum 
		an active part of the local educational community. A project such as this 
		one seemed like the perfect opportunity to explore the museum's potential 
		role as something more than a field trip destination for area school children. 
		In December 1997, therefore, museum staff worked with this sixth-grade 
		teacher to design a prototype version of what would eventually become 
		known as "Museum Problems in Today's World: Egyptian Mummification."<i> 
		</i>The project was a success, and museum staff members soon worked to 
		revise the program, making it more consistent and less focused on problem-based 
		learning, so that it could be opened to more teachers and more widely 
		distributed among area schools. From December 1997 to January 2003, this 
		program has been run ten times at seven different schools and has reached 
		over 300 elementary and middle school students in central Illinois.</p>
	  <p class=normal>When the program began, it was decided that the most appropriate 
		artifact for the exercise would be a piece of ancient Egyptian cartonnage: 
		waste papyrus or linen, soaked in plaster (similar to papier-m&#226;ch&#233;). 
		Although the museum had several such pieces in its collection, it would 
		have been inappropriate for the museum to send these artifacts to the 
		schools. Each time the "cartonnage project" is run, therefore, reproductions 
		of ancient Egyptian cartonnage fragments&#8212;manufactured by museum 
		staff members&#8212;are delivered to the schools (see Figure 1).</p>
	  <p class=MsoNormal align="center"><img src="marty_fragment.jpg" width="267" height="368"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 1: Sample Cartonnage Fragments</p>
	  <p class=normal>In addition to these physical artifacts, students are provided 
		with access to the museum's online database systems so that they can access 
		database records for similar pieces, a resource guide to ancient Egyptian 
		mummification specifically created by museum staff members for this project 
		(<a href="http://www.spurlock.uiuc.edu/education/resources/mummification" target="_blank">http://www.spurlock.uiuc.edu/education/resources/mummification</a>), 
		and a series of research documents written by the museum's educators designed 
		to provide guidance for the students as they research the cartonnage fragment. 
		The students also have access to materials in their own school and local 
		libraries and on the open Internet. The students generally work in teams 
		of four or five, usually dividing up tasks so that each student could 
		research a different aspect of the artifacts. Depending on the teachers' 
		schedule, the students have (on average) two to three weeks to use these 
		resources to prepare their findings on the artifacts. At the end of this 
		time, the students make a presentation to a panel of museum staff members, 
		where they announce their findings and make their recommendations.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The cartonnage project<i> </i>has been a great success for 
		museum staff, teachers, and students alike. Museum staff members find 
		it an effective way of keeping the Spurlock Museum an active part of the 
		educational community (even when the museum was closed to the public). 
		It provides new opportunities for museum-school interactions, both in 
		the classroom and online. Teachers use the cartonnage project to introduce 
		their units on Ancient Egypt. One of the more popular times to run the 
		program is between Thanksgiving and Winter break, as the highly interactive 
		nature of the project keeps students involved at a time when it is often 
		difficult to keep students interested in school. The students find it 
		an exciting and involving way of exploring ancient Egypt. They feel that 
		they have a personal stake in the project, and some students&#151;months 
		after the completion of the project&#151;have even contacted the museum's 
		educators to ask them whether they have implemented the students' recommendations.</p>
	  <p class=normal>That this project should have been successful is perhaps 
		not surprising. Educational outreach projects connecting museums and schools 
		have received a great deal of attention over the past few years, much 
		of it at the Museums and the Web conference. Faculty from Museum Studies 
		departments as well as museum curators have discussed the pedagogical 
		impact of virtual museums from both educational and museological perspectives 
		(Teather &amp; Wilhelm, 1999; Sumption, 2001). Researchers at the University 
		of Michigan have explored the challenges of coordinating teachers, museum 
		professionals, and information specialists to create online exhibitions 
		(Frost, 1999; Frost, 2001). Researchers at the University of Illinois 
		have explored methods of integrating digital primary source materials 
		from cultural heritage museums into classrooms (Bennet &amp; Trofanenko, 
		2002; Bennet &amp; Sandore, 2001). Museum educators at the Seattle Art 
		Museum have even used the Internet to help sixth-grade students in Seattle 
		better understand the curatorial process (Adams, et al., 2001). What is 
		there that makes the project at the Spurlock Museum unique?</p>
	  <p class=normal>We feel that the cartonnage project is important for two 
		reasons. First, the project has evolved (and is still evolving) over a 
		period of five years. There is a tremendous amount of longitudinal data 
		available that document what we learned during this time about what worked 
		and why. We can use these data to examine how this project changed over 
		time in response to the reactions, interactions, and levels of involvement 
		of students, teachers, and museum personnel. We can discuss how changes 
		to this project over time affected the students' ability to learn, what 
		they learned, and how they worked within the program. This analysis can 
		help us determine what drove the historical evolution of the project and 
		how changes in the relationships between students, teachers, and museum 
		professionals affect the development of educational outreach projects.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Second, preliminary data analysis of this project revealed 
		an extremely interesting fact: of the 300 students involved in this project, 
		approximately 75% reached the conclusion that the artifacts were authentic. 
		Of the other 25%, the majority were undecided; of those students who did 
		believe they were fake, most decided the fragments were 19th century reproductions. 
		Not<i> </i>a single student ever suggested that the museum fabricated 
		these artifacts for the purposes of this project. If the museum staff 
		had been trying to create a perfect, flawless cartonnage fragment reproduction, 
		then these numbers might be understandable; indeed, they would testify 
		to the skill of the museum staff members involved. The museum staff, however, 
		had created artifacts specifically designed to be identified as forgeries; 
		clearly visible are several prominently placed clues to the artifacts' 
		lack of authenticity (see below). Amazingly, the students' tendency to 
		find the artifacts authentic was not because they did not find these clues. 
		On the contrary, the students seemed to have an inherent reluctance to 
		pronounce the artifacts fake; they went to tremendous lengths to ignore 
		and/or explain away these clues when they were discovered. This paper 
		will attempt to determine why this occurred.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Methods and Limitations of Study</h1>
	  <p class=normal>This is a discussion of preliminary research findings drawn 
		from observations made by museum staff members as they worked with students 
		over the past five years. This is not a formal study with rigorous data 
		collection procedures. When this program began, it was not the intention 
		of the museum staff members to conduct a formal research project. Although 
		extensive data were gathered from the students each time the program was 
		run, identical data collection instruments were not used in each instance.</p>
	  <p class=normal>A significant amount of data, however, is available. The 
		majority of the panel presentations were videotaped, as well as many of 
		the regular classroom sessions where the students interacted with the 
		artifacts and researched ancient Egyptian mummification. The creation 
		of the cartonnage fragment reproduction was carefully documented. Extensive 
		notes were taken throughout the project, by museum staff members as well 
		as teachers. The various versions of the online documents, resource guides, 
		and database records are all well documented. One implementation of the 
		project (which took place during Fall 2000) was thoroughly documented 
		and described by a doctoral student from the College of Education at the 
		University of Illinois as part of a research study into museum outreach 
		programs in public elementary schools (Costantino, 2001).</p>
	  <p class=normal>There are, naturally, limitations to these data. The fact 
		that this project has been conducted at different schools, using different 
		approaches, with different students who have different reactions, with 
		non-standard data collection procedures, means that it is not possible 
		to do a comparative study of why a group of students at one school in 
		one year reached different conclusions from a second group of students 
		at a different school in a different year. The available data, however, 
		have allowed us to conduct our present analysis of a) the history of the 
		cartonnage project as the museum staff evolved and adapted the program 
		over time, and b) the interactions between students, teachers, and museum 
		professionals, and the development of those interactions over time. It 
		is our hope that this analysis will be of use to educators and museum 
		professionals interested in educational outreach projects from museums 
		to schools.</p>
	  <p class=normal>We begin our analysis with a discussion of the evolution 
		of this project over the years from 1997 to 2003. This evolution was an 
		organic, natural process whereby the museum's procedures in implementing 
		the cartonnage project changed as we worked with the teachers and students, 
		adapting each implementation to better suit the needs of the educational 
		community the museum <a>serves</a>.</p>
	  <p class=SubHeaderSmall>Historical Evolution (1997 to 2003)</p>
	  <p class=normal>Museum staff members working with the cartonnage project 
		quickly found that they needed to be flexible; they could not present 
		exactly the same project each time the program was run. They had to adapt 
		to new and unpredictable situations, which in turn led to new adaptations 
		and a constantly evolving educational outreach program. This section presents 
		an overview of the primary evolutionary stages of this project, discussing 
		the changes made over time, the rationale behind those changes, and what 
		was learned from making those changes.</p>
	  <p class=normal>As mentioned above, this program has been run ten times 
		at seven different schools since its inception; over 300 students in central 
		Illinois have researched the authenticity of Egyptian cartonnage fragment 
		reproductions. All but one of these programs was run with sixth grade 
		students (the other was implemented with a group of gifted students from 
		grades three through five). Not including the initial prototype version 
		run in December 1997, there have been three distinct versions of this 
		project; the third version is the one that museum staff members are currently 
		implementing in local schools. This section of the paper includes descriptions 
		of each version of the project, and discusses how each version evolved 
		over time in response to the needs of students, teachers, and museum staff 
		members (see Table 1 for a summary of this evolution).</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Prototype Version (1997)</h2>
	  <p class=normal>In December 1997, museum staff members, working with the 
		sixth-grade teacher whose idea began the project, decided that the most 
		appropriate artifact for this exercise would be a piece of ancient Egyptian 
		cartonnage. Since no actual artifact could be taken to the schools, museum 
		staff members decided to provide online access to the museum's database 
		records for a dozen actual pieces of cartonnage in the Spurlock Museum's 
		collections. The teacher, who still wanted a physical artifact, decided 
		to manufacture a fake piece of cartonnage herself. She took a six-inch 
		square piece of linen, soaked it in plaster, painted it with Egyptian 
		hieroglyphics, and -in an attempt to age it&#151;buried it in her back 
		yard (when delivered to the class, it still had a fresh pine needle stuck 
		in it).</p>
	  <p class=normal>With this prototype version, the vast majority of the work 
		was accomplished by the teacher herself. She developed all the documentation 
		necessary to guide her students' research in problem-based learning. She 
		gathered all the resources her students would need to examine the artifact 
		and determine its authenticity. She incorporated all of this into her 
		ongoing unit on ancient Egypt. Museum staff members made themselves available 
		for email questions, and served at the end of the project on a panel so 
		that the sixth grade students could present the findings of their research. 
		Aside from this, however, the museum played no direct role in managing 
		the prototype version of the project.</p>
	  <p class=SubHeaderSmall>&nbsp;Version 1 (1998-1999)</p>
	  <p class=normal>One year later, this same sixth-grade teacher, along with 
		an additional teacher from a different school, approached museum staff 
		members to see if they could do this project again. This time, museum 
		staff members were able to dedicate a significant amount of time to improving 
		the project; the result was the first full-featured version of the cartonnage 
		project. The major changes from the Prototype to Version 1 were an improved 
		version of the cartonnage fragment, an entirely new online interface, 
		and a larger role for the museum in the presentation of the problem.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The museum's Collections Manager and her assistant took 
		on the task of creating a new, improved version of the cartonnage reproduction 
		(cf. Figure 1). It took over twenty hours of work for them to design and 
		create a replica mummy pectoral piece using plaster-soaked linen; the 
		pectoral was painted to resemble an Egyptian artifact. To clearly identify 
		this piece as a forgery, they purposely planted several clues on the artifact: 
		spots of hot pink and hot green paint, several non-Egyptian hieroglyphs, 
		and a Mayan figure in full regalia. Once the artifact was complete, it 
		then took another twenty hours of work to destroy the artifact and age 
		it two thousand years. The artifact was divided into six pieces, and two 
		sets of three pieces each were mounted in glass display frames. By creating 
		two sets of fragments, museum staff members made it possible for the program 
		to be run at two different schools at the same time. They ensured that 
		each set included sufficient clues, including half of the Mayan figure. 
		The small, left-over pieces of cartonnage that broke off during the aging 
		process were placed into plastic bags so that students could analyze these 
		fragments in detail.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The museum staff also made major changes to the online interface. 
		Realizing that simple access to database records was not sufficient information 
		for the students, museum staff members created an elaborate, fictional 
		database access system called the "Spurlock Museum Management System." 
		This "system" was simply a series of password-protected <del cite="mailto:Sheila%20Trant" datetime="2003-02-23T15:11">eb 
		</del>Web pages which gave the illusion of providing access to detailed 
		information about museum operating procedures. The password provided to 
		the students gave them access to two things: a series of documents about 
		museum careers (including job descriptions and required education levels 
		for each job) and a "main project page" for researching the cartonnage 
		fragments. This project page provided links to four types of resources: 
		a set of research notes, a list of database records, a glossary of terms, 
		and a <i>WebBoard</i>. The research notes were a series of lengthy pages 
		about Egyptian mummification practices, linked to multiple pages covering 
		more detailed topics, with a navigation system that challenged students 
		to read the text carefully when searching for answers. The list of database 
		records was an expanded list of relevant Egyptian artifacts from the museum's 
		collections. The <i>WebBoard</i> provided a simple discussion board interface 
		where students could post questions and museum educators could post responses.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Spurlock Museum staff members assumed a new, major role 
		in the presentation of the project to the students, making substantial 
		modifications to how the "problem" was described. In this version, students 
		were told that the museum had received a set of Egyptian cartonnage fragments 
		from the registrar at the Sherman County Historical Society. Since this 
		historical society only collected local heritage materials, the registrar 
		wondered if the Spurlock Museum would be interested in accessioning the 
		artifacts, which had been found in an unmarked box in their storeroom. 
		The students were asked to help the museum staff research the artifacts' 
		provenance and determine their authenticity. This setup was, of course, 
		completely fictitious; there is no "Sherman County Historical Society."<i> 
		</i>Spurlock Museum educators created a letter from the fictitious donor 
		(see Appendix 1) who supposedly gave the artifacts to the historical society 
		and a letter from the Spurlock Museum's director, thanking the students 
		for their help in this research project. Museum staff members also created 
		an accession card for the artifacts, listing the information supposedly 
		recorded by the historical society. The letter from the donor was specifically 
		written to address the UNESCO treaty issue, and provided evidence that 
		the artifacts entered the United States before 1966. Copies of these documents 
		were delivered to the students participating in the program.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Museum staff members also assumed a major role in delivering 
		the artifacts to the students. The cartonnage fragments arrived with a 
		lot of "pomp and circumstance," carried in by the museum's Collections 
		Manager and her assistant wearing white lab coats and using gloves. The 
		museum educators even considered having a security guard accompany the 
		artifacts in full uniform, but decided against it.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Version 2 (2000-2001)</h2>
	  <p class=normal>Early in the year 2000, museum staff members decided that 
		they needed to make additional revisions in the cartonnage project. Although 
		the physical artifacts were a great success, the online resources were 
		being insufficiently used and needed to be improved. Moreover, museum 
		educators were unsatisfied with the presentation of the problem to the 
		students, as the fictitious setup was making it difficult to run the same 
		project for a second year in the same school. Attempts to resolve these 
		issues resulted in Version 2 of the cartonnage project.</p>
	  <p class=normal>For Version 2, the online resources available to the students 
		were completely revised. The fictional "Spurlock Museum Management System" 
		was dismantled and replaced with a simple Web page that linked to three 
		resources. The first link was to a resource guide about Egyptian Mummification 
		(http://www.spurlock.uiuc.edu/education/resources/mummification). The 
		second link was to a series of documents about the research process (http://www.spurlock.uiuc.edu/education/resources). 
		The third link was to the same <i>WebBoard</i> from Version 1 (no changes 
		were made to the <i>WebBoard</i> at this time).</p>
	  <p class=normal>The original version of the resource guide had proved so 
		difficult to navigate that it was unusable by most of the students. The 
		online resource guide for Version 2 was completely reorganized, with a 
		new graphical interface that included illustrations and embedded links 
		for further information about relevant artifacts in the museum's collections. 
		The guide was organized into seven categories: history, rituals, artifacts, 
		sources, materials, chronology, and glossary (see Figure 2 for a sample 
		screen shot). An external graphic designer was hired by the museum to 
		develop the site's look and feel, and construct icons and other images.</p>
	  <p class=MsoNormal align="center"><img src="sample.t.png" width="395" height="346"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 2: Sample Screen from Online Resource Guide</p>
	  <p class=normal>In addition, museum educators wrote a series of documents 
		about the research process (including information on identifying reliable 
		sources and distinguishing fakes from forgeries); these documents were 
		placed online in Adobe Acrobat format. These additional resources were 
		specifically requested by the teachers, who wanted to provide their students 
		with more accurate information about how to conduct research and how to 
		identify fakes and forgeries. In writing these documents, museum educators 
		took advantage of this request to remedy existing problems with the program. 
		One document, for example, helped the students refocus their research 
		efforts (which often strayed from the artifacts) by teaching them how 
		to observe the artifacts more carefully. A second document addressed the 
		common student belief that if something looked real, then it was; this 
		document explained how forgers were skilled at making things look real, 
		even if they were not. Finally, to help the students understand the research 
		process even better, museum educators developed a "research packet," which 
		helped the students formulate their research questions, record their findings, 
		and document their sources (see Appendix 2).</p>
	  <p class=normal>With the new online resources available, museum educators 
		attempted to sort out the difficulties behind presenting a fictitious 
		problem to a class of students. What resulted was a mishmash of techniques, 
		where over the next several implementations of the program museum staff 
		presented the problem in slightly different ways. They still claimed that 
		the object was from another museum, but presented it as an educational 
		program specifically designed to allow school children to work with museum 
		professionals on real life projects. Other than the letter from the donor, 
		no additional documents were given to the students. Within the donor letter 
		itself, any references to the name of the artifacts' original owner or 
		the name of the "Sherman County Historical Society"<i> </i>were blacked 
		out. The students were told that the letter was censored to protect the 
		privacy of the donor; in reality, the censoring helped museum educators 
		avoid a growing problem where students kept trying to locate the "Sherman 
		County Historical Society" in real life.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Version 3 (2002-2003)</h2>
	  <p class=normal>By 2002, the museum educators&#151;although still happy 
		with the physical artifacts and online resources&#151;continued to have 
		difficulties with the presentation of the problem to the students. Since 
		this project was now run every year, often at the same school, museum 
		educators wondered if the students would soon stop believing that the 
		museum still needed their help researching the same artifact. To resolve 
		this dilemma, museum staff members decided to return to the original idea 
		of the sixth-grade teacher who initiated the project in 1997.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Version 3, the current version of the project, presents 
		the situation as a problem that happens to curators all the time. Museum 
		staff members tell the students that while the cartonnage fragments were 
		on display in their museum, a stranger claimed that the label copy describing 
		the artifacts was erroneous. The students are then told that this stranger 
		left immediately and that the museum had no way of determining his identity 
		or asking him any follow-up questions. The students are then asked to 
		help the museum staff members confirm the contents of the label copy (see 
		Appendix 3). By presenting the problem in this way, the museum educators 
		have found it much easier to deal with direct questions from the students 
		with much less fabrication. If the students ask the direct question "are 
		you telling us the truth?"<i> </i>the museum educators now reply that 
		the setup (that a stranger commented on these artifacts) is not true, 
		but that these are actual museum artifacts and that this is an actual 
		problem which curators deal with on a regular basis.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Finally, two minor changes were made to the online resources 
		during the transition from Version 2 to Version 3. First, museum staff 
		members decided to get rid of the simple, introductory page linking to 
		the online resources; all online materials are now accessible from the 
		Programs and Events section of the main Spurlock Museum Web site (http://www.spurlock.uiuc.edu/education). 
		Second, museum staff members decided to no longer use the <i>WebBoard</i> 
		for communication with the students. Although this may seem like a major 
		change to the online interface, the <i>WebBoard</i> discussions were quite 
		easily replaced by email (see below for further discussion).</p>
	  <p class=normal>This discussion has therefore summarized the evolution of 
		the different versions of the cartonnage project. One implementation was 
		run using the prototype version. Three implementations were run using 
		Version 1. Four implementations were run using Version 2. Two implementations 
		were run using Version 3. At least two more implementations using this 
		version are scheduled for the spring semester of 2003.</p>

	  <p class=MsoCaption>Table 1: Summary of Evolution of Versions</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Analysis of Student Activities and Interactions</h1>
	  <p class=normal>This section presents an analysis of the students' activities 
		and interactions as they worked with the artifacts, the available resources 
		(both physical and online), their teachers, the museum personnel, and<i> 
		</i>each other. It discusses the overall trends we observed in terms of 
		how the students participated with the museum personnel on the project, 
		what their levels of involvement and understanding of the project were, 
		and how these things changed over time. In doing so, we will attempt to 
		determine what the students learned from participating in this project.</p>
	  <p class=normal>There will be four different types of activities and interactions 
		discussed. First, we will look at how the students interacted with the 
		artifacts. Second, we will explore how the students made use of the information 
		resources, both physical and virtual, at their disposal. Third, we will 
		examine the different approaches to research taken by the students. Finally, 
		we will discuss the students' learning processes, focusing on how their 
		levels of understanding changed over time.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Interactions with Artifacts</h2>
	  <p class=normal>How did the students interact with the artifacts? The artifacts 
		were generally brought to the school and presented to the students fairly 
		early in the project; the students would usually have had some initial 
		introduction to ancient Egypt, have been told about the upcoming project, 
		and have been looking forward to the arrival of the actual artifacts themselves. 
		The artifacts were brought to the school by museum staff members who clearly 
		treated the artifacts with a great deal of respect. The teachers were 
		required to sign an official "loan form,"<i> </i>further impressing upon 
		the students the value of these artifacts. The students were taught proper 
		artifact handling procedures which stressed the importance of handling 
		the artifacts carefully, with gloves, and treating the artifacts with 
		respect at all times. The students were not allowed to handle the main 
		pieces of cartonnage; these were kept intact in a glass display frame. 
		The students were allowed to handle several small pieces of cartonnage, 
		but only with tweezers. The seriousness of these procedures had a big 
		impact on the students. They were very careful to always wear gloves when 
		handling the artifacts; they treated the artifacts with respect, as they 
		had been trained to do. During the panel presentations, if some students 
		forgot to wear gloves, other students would even remind them to do so. 
		The extent of their training in artifact handling likely was a major factor 
		in the students' persistent belief that the artifacts were authentic; 
		if the artifacts were not authentic, some students asked us, why would 
		we be so strict about artifact handling procedures? The students never 
		asked why, however, if the artifacts were authentic, museum staff members 
		would have let them out of the museum.</p>
	  <p class=normal>What did the students do while studying the artifacts? As 
		will be discussed in more detail below, students took a common approach 
		to studying the artifacts, examining the hieroglyphics, colors, gods, 
		and material composition of the pieces. They tried to identify the gods, 
		decipher the hieroglyphics, and determine whether or not the colors on 
		the cartonnage fragments matched known pigments available to the ancient 
		Egyptians. Since students were unable to remove the cartonnage fragments 
		from the display cases, they had to rely on the fragments provided in 
		the plastic bags for material analysis. They typically examined these 
		small fragments carefully to see what they were made of and determine 
		their authenticity and, if possible, the age of the fragments. Only in 
		a few cases did students attempt anything innovative; one group, for example, 
		extrapolated from the fragments they were given a theoretical reproduction 
		of what the entire pectoral piece might have looked like.</p>
	  <p class=normal>How much time did the students spend working directly with 
		the artifacts? In most cases, students did not spend as much time working 
		directly with the artifacts as the museum staff members expected they 
		would. Their typical approach was to spend one day studying the cartonnage 
		fragments at the beginning of the project, and then put the fragments 
		aside and only occasionally look at them before the final panel presentation. 
		The students spent enough time with the objects to answer questions about 
		the appropriateness of the colors and attempt a translation of the hieroglyphics, 
		but the artifacts themselves were rarely the focus of the classes' attention. 
		After their initial study of the artifacts, the students typically turned 
		their attention to the research process, searching the Internet and their 
		school's library for information about cartonnage and the mummification 
		process. Only recently have museum staff members made a point of stressing 
		in class the value of constantly returning to the artifacts during the 
		research process. While having the artifacts in the classroom throughout 
		the project provided a catalyst for the students' research activities, 
		the students did not understand the significance of making the artifacts 
		a part of their research process until they were told to do so.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Use of Information Resources</h2>
	  <p class=normal>How did the students make use of the online resources provided 
		by the museum? Depending on computer availability, students were regular 
		visitors to the museum's Web site and resource guide; almost every student 
		referred to the museum's Web site in their panel presentations. It appears 
		as if the fact that museum staff members provided them with an online 
		resource guide to Egyptian Mummification had a significant impact on the 
		students' approach to the project. The online resource guide helped them 
		start the research process, and they searched the museum's Web site for 
		clues as to the artifact's authenticity. Many students believed that the 
		mere fact that the museum had provided this Web site proved that the artifacts 
		were from ancient Egypt. Why else would we have given them that site? 
		Students stopped asking this question when museum staff members decided 
		to make these online resources available from the museum's public Web 
		site along with resource pages on several other topics. Nevertheless, 
		as the source of both the artifacts and a primary source of data about 
		Egyptian mummification, the students usually accepted the authority of 
		the museum without question.</p>
	  <p class=normal>What other resources did the students use? All students 
		had access to a variety of information resources, including books, articles, 
		and Web sites, accessible from their classroom, their school or public 
		library, or their home. The students were frequent users of the open Internet; 
		in the late 1990s, some students relied almost entirely on the Internet 
		for<i> </i>the data. Every student used at least one Web site (other than 
		the site provided by the museum) while conducting the research. Most often, 
		these were sites on the use of color or hieroglyphics in ancient Egypt. 
		Different classes almost always located completely different Web sites, 
		which were passed from one group of students to another, and on which 
		students often based the foundations of their arguments. In this way, 
		Web sites with erroneous information frequently spread mistakes throughout 
		an entire classroom of students like some kind of knowledge virus. Students 
		also used books (although only infrequently would students use their textbooks) 
		in their research, often looking up translations of hieroglyphics or trying 
		to identify the images on the fragments. Many students also found basic 
		information on ancient Egypt and mummification from books; in one case, 
		a group of students working on this project checked out almost every book 
		on ancient Egypt from their local public library.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Approach to Research</h2>
	  <p class=normal>What research questions did the students ask? On the first 
		day of the project, students were encouraged to develop a list of questions 
		they would like answered. More questions would generally be added to the 
		list later on as they examined the artifacts and spent more time conducting 
		research. The most commonly asked questions were: Who made this? When 
		was it made? What was it made for? What is it made from? What time period 
		is it from? Where is it from? What is shown in the pictures? What do the 
		hieroglyphs say? What is the significance of the colors? Over the course 
		of the project, however, the students usually became more and more focused 
		on the overall question: Is this real?</p>
	  <p class=normal>What research methods did the students use to answer these 
		questions? To ensure that the students started by looking at a source 
		they could count on as reliable, museum staff members initiated the research 
		process by providing the address of the Museum's online resource guide 
		to Egyptian Mummification. Most often, students began the project by spending 
		time either in a computer lab or on one or more computers in the classroom. 
		The more available computers,<i> </i>the more likely students were to 
		focus on online resources. Having fewer available computers quickly directed 
		the students toward their library books. Museum staff members were available 
		for questions over the Internet (via email or on the <i>WebBoard</i>). 
		In addition, at least one museum staff member would visit the students 
		for a question/answer session halfway through the project. To provide 
		the students with a consistent source from the museum, the assistant director 
		of education was established as the students' primary contact at the museum.</p>
	  <p class=normal>What approach did the students use to determine the authenticity 
		of the cartonnage fragments? With few exceptions, students primarily focused 
		on four factors: the hieroglyphics written on the fragments, the colors 
		painted on the fragments, the materials the fragments were made from, 
		and the gods depicted on the fragments. These factors, almost always in 
		this order, comprised the four main arguments put forth by the students 
		in the panel presentations. Based on their findings regarding the hieroglyphics, 
		colors, material types, and the gods, the students would render a verdict 
		of authentic or forgery in front of a panel of museum staff members.</p>
	  <p class=normal>What was the most frequent decision reached by the students 
		researching the fragments? As discussed above, about three out of every 
		four students decided that the artifacts were authentic; of these students, 
		about half reached this conclusion based solely on their analysis of the 
		colors found on the artifacts. Most students were absolutely convinced 
		that these reproductions were real, and this belief was not limited to 
		the reproduction made by the museum staff. When the prototype version 
		was run, one student told us that he believed the museum staff had taken 
		a piece of cartonnage from their collection and ripped a square piece 
		out of it; he even showed us, on the online database, a piece of cartonnage 
		that&#151;by complete coincidence&#151;was missing a piece exactly the 
		right size and shape. The major obstacle the students faced throughout 
		the project was their tendency to look for reasons to prove that these 
		artifacts were real, and not to prove that they were fake. Even when faced 
		with the clues planted by museum staff (such as the spot of hot pink paint), 
		students tended to rationalize these clues away (arguing that perhaps 
		red pigments, when two thousand years old, might look like hot pink).</p>
	  <p class=normal>Did any student ever discover the Mayan figure? From 1997 
		to 2003, the Mayan figure has only been discovered three times, and each 
		time it was discarded and never brought up again. The first time this 
		happened, the student who discovered it pointed out that this looked like 
		a Mayan figure but decided that this was not a problem since it was likely 
		that Egyptian and Mayan cultures were aware of each other; she told us 
		that she reached this conclusion because she had learned about Egyptian 
		and Mayan civilizations from the same book. The second time the figure 
		was discovered, it was identified by a learning disabled student who thought 
		there was something odd about that figure, but could not decide exactly 
		what it was; before he could explore it further, however, he was quickly 
		shut down by his fellow group members. The third and final time the Mayan 
		figure was discovered, a group of students thought the figure looked like 
		an Aztec warrior; they explained away this apparent anomaly, however, 
		by stating that since the Egyptians and the Aztecs both lived in the tropics, 
		it was likely that the Egyptians also portrayed figures with leaves around 
		their wrists and ankles, as the Mayan figure was depicted.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Learning Processes</h2>
	  <p class=normal>How did the students' understanding of museum activities 
		change over time? The students' understanding of what a museum curator 
		does improved dramatically over the evolution of this project. In Version 
		1 of the program, the students had a very hard time understanding the 
		role of the museum curator when working with artifacts. This was, in part, 
		because the museum educators, in an attempt to provide a certain amount 
		of intellectual rigor, originally told the students that museums were 
		expected to possess 100% accurate information, and that museum curators 
		were responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the museum's information. 
		Students were provided a list of "questions curators were supposed to 
		be able to answer," including questions about the physical characteristics 
		of the artifacts, the provenance of the artifacts, whether or not the 
		artifacts complied with the 1971 UNESCO treaty, and the basis for information 
		about the artifacts as provided by the donor. This list was supposed to 
		help the students formulate their own research questions; instead it became 
		a burden, forcing students to worry about treaties instead of the artifacts. 
		To solve this problem, the museum educators adapted their approach in 
		Version 2, asking the students to develop their own questions through 
		small group discussions. Encouraging the students to think like detectives 
		helped them become inspired by the job of the museum curator. The new 
		presentation of the problem developed in Version 3 went even further, 
		providing the students with an even more straightforward problem to solve: 
		who do you think is right? The mysterious stranger? Or the donor? By drawing 
		the students into the inquiry process, these changes helped the students 
		better understand the job of the museum curator.</p>
	  <p class=normal>How did students' understanding of the research process 
		change over time? The students' abilities to conduct research and understand 
		research methods improved dramatically from 1997 to 2003. This was especially 
		true in the case of the students' online searching skills, where they 
		became much more aware of the need to assess the quality of information 
		they found online. In December of 1997, one student actually believed 
		(and stated) that everything she read on the computer had to be true. 
		By the spring of 2002, however, students were comparing the overall reliability 
		of sites from dot-edu or dot-com domains. This change is likely due in 
		part to the efforts of both museum professionals and teachers to explain 
		the importance of good research methods to the students. Throughout the 
		development of this program, for instance, museum staff members have continued 
		to provide more explicit documents about good research habits. Museum 
		educators and teachers alike continued to stress the importance of having 
		and citing a source for every piece of information. These efforts have 
		consistently led to students with higher quality research skills.</p>
	  <p class=normal>How did the students' approach to logical arguments and 
		critical thinking change over time? The students' abilities to think critically 
		and make logical arguments did not change significantly over the course 
		of this study. Students did not want to believe that the museum might 
		bring them artifacts that were not real, and they would go to tremendous 
		lengths to dismiss any evidence that might possibly imply a fake. When 
		arguing that the artifacts were authentic, students twisted their logic 
		in strange, clever, and often unexpected ways; students who thought the 
		artifacts were fake, however, usually did not employ such logical contortions. 
		For instance, when attempting to translate the hieroglyphics on the artifacts, 
		students usually found several hieroglyphs they could not identify: the 
		signs planted by the museum staff as clues that the objects were fake 
		(some of the "Egyptian hieroglyphs" were actually Mayan numbers). Instead 
		of reaching that conclusion, however, students decided that these hieroglyphs 
		must either be signs that had not yet been discovered or signs that were 
		too rare to be listed in the books in their school library ("we're only 
		sixth graders, after all," one group told us). The possibility that these 
		signs might not be Egyptian hieroglyphs at all never occurred to them. 
		For another example, when attempting to use the colors found on the artifacts 
		to determine their authenticity, the students almost always began with 
		a list of colors the ancient Egyptians could produce and then looked to 
		see if those colors were found on the artifacts. They almost never checked 
		the reverse, looking to see if any colors found on the artifacts could 
		not have been made in ancient Egypt. In ways such as these, the students 
		would skew their answers to match their expectations.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Analysis of the Museum/School Relationship</h1>
	  <p class=normal>This section presents an analysis of what we learned about 
		supporting a cooperative relationship between museums and schools when 
		conducting educational outreach programs. It discusses what we learned 
		as we moved from version to version, evolving the program to create a 
		better product. In doing so, we hope to summarize the most important lessons 
		we learned about what makes for a successful relationship between museum 
		educators and school teachers.</p>
	  <p class=normal>We will examine three different areas of this relationship. 
		First, we will look at levels of involvement in the classroom, from the 
		perspectives of both teacher and museum educator. Second, we will examine 
		the issue of availability of online resources and the importance of access 
		to technology. Finally, we will discuss the relevance of this program 
		to the curricular needs of the school and its impact on the success of 
		the project.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Levels of Involvement in Classroom</h2>
	  <p class=normal>How involved were museum staff members in classroom activities? 
		The success of this program was directly related to the amount of time 
		museum staff members were able to dedicate to the classes researching 
		the cartonnage fragments. From the onset of Version 1, Spurlock Museum 
		educators and other staff members remained very involved in the classroom: 
		they made several trips to each class, at the beginning, middle, and end 
		of the project; they were constantly available to answer questions for 
		the students, either by email or using the <i>WebBoard</i>. Any museum 
		educator planning to initiate a project such as this one must be aware 
		of the need to dedicate a great deal of time to helping the students have 
		a successful experience. In addition, when collaborating with teachers 
		who were not so familiar with active learning or problem-based learning 
		techniques, the museum educators found that they had to spend more time 
		in the classroom and play more significant roles in setting up the project 
		and assisting the students.</p>
	  <p class=normal>How involved were the teachers in classroom activities? 
		The success of the program was directly related to the amount of time 
		the teachers were able to spend with their students on this project. The 
		more involved the teachers were, the more confident they were in their 
		research skills, and the greater their knowledge of the content area, 
		the more the students got out of the project&#151;in terms of Egyptian 
		history, museum practices, and research activities. Likewise, the more 
		time the teacher spent researching ancient Egypt ahead of time, finding 
		appropriate resources and checking books out of the library in advance, 
		the greater the impact of the project on the students. Students who were 
		able to spend three weeks on the project generally learned more than students 
		who only had two weeks; this was especially true with schools taking a 
		problem-based learning approach (which took longer to set up). Few schools, 
		however, could afford to dedicate three entire weeks<i> </i>to this project. 
		Nevertheless, even teachers who could spend only one week on this project 
		found it instrumental in changing the perception of the museum from a 
		once-a-year field trip destination to a valuable resource that could be 
		directly integrated into the classroom curriculum. With the students relying 
		heavily on the Internet for their information, however, teachers had to 
		be prepared to vet for inappropriate material all sites discovered by 
		the students.<i> </i></p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Availability of Online Resources</h2>
	  <p class=normal>How did access to the online resources provided by the museum 
		affect the students' successful completion of the project? Students working 
		with the cartonnage fragments had access to museum-provided information 
		about Egyptian mummification practices (including information specifically 
		about cartonnage) as well as<i> </i>museum practices and research methods. 
		When students did not have access to this information, as in the prototype 
		version when only an online list of database records was provided, students 
		gathered most of their information from other online sources. As the museum 
		made more information available online, and as artifact database records 
		were integrated into the online resource guide, the students began to 
		rely on the museum-provided Web site as their primary source of information. 
		Students were not particularly interested in the elaborate, fictional 
		"Spurlock Museum Management System" provided in Version 1; they preferred 
		the straightforward access to information about mummification and research 
		activities available in Version 2. Students, however, were much more likely 
		to make use of the resource guide on Egyptian mummification than they 
		were to read the documents written by the museum educators about conducting 
		research and determining the authenticity of an artifact. It is possible 
		that this indicates a preference for information provided in a graphical 
		format over text-only documents. It is also possible that this reflects 
		the students' (or teachers') unfamiliarity with Adobe Acrobat; to account 
		for this possibility, the museum educators have recently begun taking 
		hard copies of the research documents with them on their classroom visits.</p>
	  <p class=MsoNormal>How did access to the necessary technology affect the 
		program? Although successful completion <span class="normal">o</span>f 
		the project assumed that the students would have access to the Internet 
		in order to read the online resources provided by the museum, this was 
		not explicitly a requirement of the program. Several schools had to cope 
		with technological failures that resulted in students having little or 
		no time in the computer lab. Students who were unable to access the museum's 
		online resources had to rely on their school libraries for information. 
		When the museum was working with students who had access to the Internet 
		in their classroom, the museum staff found that the students were more 
		likely to have a thorough understanding of what the museum wanted them 
		to do (especially when working computers were available throughout the 
		project). These students, however, were also more likely to have found 
		less reliable sources of information by concentrating their search on 
		the open Internet.</p>
	  <p class=normal>What was the impact of using the <i>WebBoard</i> for communication 
		between students and museum educators? With the implementation of Version 
		1, museum staff members had very high hopes for the museum-school interactions 
		made possible by the <i>WebBoard</i>. At the end of Version 2, however, 
		the museum staff decided no longer to use the <i>WebBoard</i> technology. 
		This was for several reasons. First, Spurlock staff members were not running 
		the <i>WebBoard</i> from their own server, and therefore were paying expensive 
		licensing fees each time the program was run. Second, the <i>WebBoard</i> 
		discussions often turned out to be unhelpful and sometimes harmful to 
		the project. Students wasted a great deal of time making off topic or 
		inappropriate posts. They would usually ask the same questions over and 
		over, wasting the museum educators' time. They would post useless requests 
		such as, "Please tell us whether this is authentic. Thank you." Some students 
		would even post threats, demanding that museum staff members tell them 
		the answers "or else."<i> </i>In the end, it was simply easier for the 
		museum to drop the <i>WebBoard</i> component and rely solely on email 
		for asynchronous interactions between students and museum employees. To 
		reduce the number of inappropriate or repetitious questions, the teacher 
		now collects the students' questions, are now collected by the teacher, 
		who edits them, and sends a moderated list to the museum educators. This 
		illustrates the advantage of having greater teacher involvement in online 
		communication between schools and museums.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeaderSmall">Relevance to Curriculum</h2>
	  <p class=normal>How did this lesson relate to classroom projects as part 
		of a course on ancient Egypt? One of the biggest factors behind the success 
		of this project was that it is most often used to introduce a unit on 
		ancient Egypt. Providing the students with a hands-on, active learning 
		experience made the concept of studying Egypt more exciting. Having a 
		practical introduction such as the cartonnage project made the students 
		look forward to learning more about Egypt in the traditional classroom 
		setting.</p>
	  <p class=normal>What was the value of the panel presentations to the project? 
		The fact that the students were required to do group presentations to 
		a panel of museum staff members at the end of each project had a serious 
		impact on the students' behavior. Knowing that the museum staff would 
		be "evaluating their work" made them take the project very seriously. 
		In addition, the panel discussion format let the students know that the 
		museum took their work seriously as well. The museum educators explained 
		to the students that no one expected them to provide all the answers to 
		every question. Nevertheless, the fact that the museum employees actually 
		listened to the students and took their advice to heart clearly impressed 
		the students and made them feel that their work was truly important.</p>
	  <p class=normal>Is this project beyond the capabilities of elementary or 
		middle school students? Over the years, the museum staff has adjusted 
		and adapted the program to reduce the number of potential pitfalls that 
		could trip up the students. Most recently, museum educators dropped the 
		discussion of UNESCO treaty issues simply because it was too hard for 
		most sixth grade students to understand. The one time that the museum 
		tried running this project with elementary school students (gifted students 
		from grades three to five), the students had trouble understanding the 
		purpose of research; they were also plagued by technological problems 
		which limited their time on the computers. Even at that young age, however, 
		and despite challenges of time and technology, the project successfully 
		motivated the students and piqued their interest in both ancient Egypt 
		and research methods. For middle school students, the program, at least 
		in its current form, seems to be at an appropriate level for an introductory 
		project to ancient Egypt, the museum profession, and the practice of conducting 
		research.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusions</h1>
	  <p class=normal>The evolution of the cartonnage project from the prototype 
		version in 1997 to the current version in 2003 was extremely time-consuming 
		for the staff of the Spurlock Museum, requiring a great deal of analysis 
		and revision. They worked toward a program that would be easy for teachers 
		to manage and not too hard for students to understand. They worked to 
		help students avoid pitfalls and come to the right conclusions. Their 
		most difficult challenge, however, was getting the students to accept 
		the project on their own terms and at face value.</p>
	  <p class=normal>It was only recently that students were willing to accept 
		the project as a simulation, to approach it as a learning experience. 
		In doing so, the students were freed to understand the true goal of the 
		exercise: to appreciate the purpose of research. They were no longer looking 
		for the right answer to fill in a blank on a test; rather they were coming 
		to their own conclusions. They understood that there was no trick question, 
		that the right answer was the answer they uncovered as researchers, that 
		they themselves were the source of the answers. Moreover, they understood 
		that the answer itself is not as important as the process of inquiry: 
		asking questions, conducting research, and supporting their findings with 
		sources.</p>
	  <p class=normal>The amount of time required to reach this goal demonstrates 
		the difficulty of creating a program such as this; museum staff members 
		needed to keep evolving, improving, and constantly working to meet the 
		needs of students and teachers. Museum educators had to wrestle with difficult 
		questions. In using fictitious documents, did they risk their own credibility 
		while emphasizing the importance of credible and reliable sources? Did 
		they have an obligation to let the students know eventually that these 
		artifacts were in fact reproductions? One group of students did track 
		the museum educators down, months after the end of their project, demanding 
		to know the answer...and they were told. But those students were the only 
		ones that ever reacted in that way, the only group that was overly bothered 
		by the fact that museum educators were perhaps not telling them the whole 
		story. And this, for the museum staff, best illustrates the success of 
		the cartonnage project. When students see that they themselves are the 
		source of the answers, that there is no right or wrong, that there is 
		only a process of discovery, students learn the only real truth.</p>
