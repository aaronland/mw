	  <p class=Author>Jim Devine, Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, University 
		of Glasgow, Scotland and Carl C. Hansen, Smithsonian Institution, National 
		Museum of Natural History, USA</p>
	  <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>
	  <p class=AbstractText>Since first sharing a platform at Museums and The 
		Web in Los Angeles in 1997, The Smithsonian Institution and The Hunterian 
		Museum and Art Gallery, on their respective sides of the Atlantic, have 
		worked collaboratively to establish leading edge practices in the field 
		of digital imaging for the scientific and cultural heritage sector.  This 
		collaborative project has developed examples of best practice in skills-sharing 
		between the Education and Digital Media Service at the Hunterian Museum 
		and Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, <a
href="http://www.hunterian.gla.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.hunterian.gla.ac.uk</a> 
		and the Center for Scientific Imaging and Photography at the National 
		Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian. <a href="http://www.nmnh.si.edu/" target="_blank">http://www.nmnh.si.edu</a>

	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
	  <p class="normal">SHADE has built on existing informal skills-sharing activities 
		between staff at SI and HMAG to further develop the potential of emergent 
		technologies for the presentation of museum collections through digital 
		media.  The primary stages of this project have proved very successful, 
		with SI staff providing expert advice, a stimulating two-way exchange 
		of ideas, and peer review for a number of educational initiatives incorporating 
		interactive technologies such as QuickTime Virtual Reality.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The initial focus for digital experimentation in SHADE 
		has been chosen from a range of our respective collection strengths to 
		provide a digital educational resource for school/college classrooms in 
		the UK and the USA.  Topics have been chosen where one partner has significantly 
		more collections material than the other, thus augmenting the digital 
		collections of both and providing an even greater wealth of educational 
		resources to our respective academic end-users.  The time is now appropriate 
		to look back:
		 
		<ul>
		<li>to evaluate what we have achieved thus far,</li>
		<li> to assess, with input from our target audiences, how successful we have been in our 
		aims, and</li>
		<li>to map a future course, which may serve as a model for our sector. </li>
		</ul>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Early Days (Digitally Speaking)</h1>
	  <p class="normal">How do you facilitate access to a museum's treasured objects 
		and at the same time protect them?  That was the question facing many 
		museums in the middle 1990's.  The Smithsonian Institution, a complex 
		of 17 museum and research facilities, has untold millions of objects in 
		its varied collections.  The scientific collections there are primarily 
		for research purposes, but objects are routinely pulled for inclusion 
		in museum exhibits or for loan to affiliated museums.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Smithsonian curators estimate that 70 percent of the wear 
		and tear on individual objects results from resident and visiting researchers 
		sorting through collections hoping to identify objects for further study.  
		The larger the objects, the more difficult they are to handle, and the 
		more damage incurred.  We were looking for a method to allow researchers 
		to search the collections without actually handling objects until they 
		were certain they had found what they needed.  Digital images that could 
		be shown on a computer or sent across networks seemed to be the answer, 
		but flat two-dimensional pictures don't always show the details necessary 
		to identify and judge an object.</p>
	  <p class="normal">At that same time the first professional digital cameras 
		were coming on the market, and Apple Computer had introduced some software 
		that allowed us to stitch together numerous digital images of the same 
		object into a virtual 3D representation of the object.  Carl Hansen started 
		experimenting with this new technology and found it quite intriguing.  
		The software was free and as a consequence, quite buggy and difficult 
		to use, but eventually he mastered it, at least to the point that he could 
		achieve satisfactory results.</p>

	  <p class="MsoCaption"><b><i>Fig 1. Australopithecine Cast QTVR</i></b></p>
	  <p class="normal">This Australopithecine cast <a
href="http://photo3d.si.edu/COMNET/Anna/Anna2/QTVR/Ausweb.mov" target="_blank">http://photo3d.si.edu/COMNET/Anna/Anna2/QTVR/Ausweb.mov</a> 
		(330k file) <a href="http://photo3d.si.edu/COMNET/Anna/Anna2/QTVR/Aus.mov">http://photo3d.si.edu/COMNET/Anna/Anna2/QTVR/Aus.mov</a> 
		(2mb file) was Carl's first attempt at making a QTVR object.  It was created 
		using a light stand as a turntable, the first Kodak professional digital 
		camera   the DCS-100, and Apple's freeware Object Maker software.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Carl was excited at the potential this new technique offered, 
		and the curators and research scientists loved it.   It proved that they 
		could view an object without handling it and in some instances view it 
		better than they ever had before.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The DCS 100 camera is extremely primitive by today's digital 
		camera standards.  It weighs in at about 20 pounds, thus requiring the 
		backpack and cables for the hard drive.  It cost $25,000, not counting 
		the Nikon F3 camera and lenses required to make it a real camera.  Today's 
		consumer grade digital cameras in the $300-$500 range produce better digital 
		pictures and fit into a shirt pocket.  But it was the only one available 
		at the time.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">A Meeting Of Minds Over Malt!</h1>
	  <p class="normal">In 1995, Carl teamed up with Dr. Charles Calvo from Mississippi 
		State University and experimented with the QTVR technology to produce 
		the first Stereo 3D objects.  It was an exciting breakthrough, and they 
		took their show on the road.</p>
	  <p class="normal">That year Carl and Charles were presenters at the first 
		ever Museums and the Web Conference in Los Angeles, California.  A fellow 
		presenter at the conference was a Scotsman named Jim Devine from the Hunterian 
		Museum at the University of Glasgow.  Jim was presenting the potentials 
		of virtual tours on the Web through panoramic QTVR, was intrigued with 
		the Smithsonian's object QTVR presentation, and could foresee where the 
		technology could be used in the area of cultural heritage presentation 
		through distance education, his specialty.  Carl and Charles in turn were 
		impressed with what Jim and the Hunterian were doing with the World Wide 
		Web as a medium for reaching a wider audience.  Over a bottle of Johnny 
		Walker single malt smuggled into the hotel bar, a plan evolved.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Within a couple of months, Carl and Charles were in Glasgow 
		demonstrating their QTVR techniques and giving a workshop at the University 
		of Glasgow's Department of Computing Science.  In exchange, Jim arranged 
		access to a life-sized hominid skull cast and a modeled recreation of 
		its facial features.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Not satisfied with the usual QTVR object movies, the three 
		of them brainstormed and came up with a new technique for using the QTVR 
		software to produce controllable morphs.  </p>
	  <p class=normal align="center"><img src="devinefig2.gif" width="400" height="146"></p>
	  <p class=MsoCaption>Fig. 2 Image extracted from Homo habilis morphing sequence</p>
	  <p class="normal">At that point SHADE was in its embryonic state. The following 
		year, Jim Devine went to the Smithsonian to tour their digital labs, and 
		that is when the decision was made to formalize the project.  The plan 
		was to meld the digital expertise of Carl's center at the Smithsonian 
		with the Hunterian's educational outreach expertise.  It was felt that 
		interactive digital technologies would provide cultural heritage organizations 
		with opportunities to utilize emergent computer technologies to present 
		their cultural resources for educational users in new and increasingly 
		innovative ways.  This ability to present information electronically can 
		be used to bring the user together with museum artefacts and the sites 
		and monuments from which they originally came, thus digitally placing 
		the objects in their archaeological contexts.  </p>
	  <p class="normal">The first attempts at what Jim Devine, with tongue firmly 
		in cheek, called "virtual repatriation" involved the Smithsonian digitally 
		taking Henry the elephant in the Natural History Museum's rotunda out 
		of his museum context and placing him back on the African savannah. <a
href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/museum/VirtualTour/Tour/First/Elephant/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.mnh.si.edu/museum/VirtualTour/Tour/First/Elephant/index.html</a> 
	  </p>
	  <p class="normal">Jim and his computing science students upped the ante 
		by morphing the Egyptian mummy at the Hunterian back to the tomb and allowing 
		users to "open" the sarcophagus and then "remove" the mummy's bandages 
		to reveal x-rays of its skeleton. <a
href="http://www.hunterian.gla.ac.uk/museum/egypt/qtvr.html" target="_blank"><u>http://www.hunterian.gla.ac.uk/museum/egypt/qtvr.html</u></a> 
	  </p>
	  <p class="normal">With the increasingly sophisticated software applications 
		being developed, the opportunity now exists to allow a gallery visitor, 
		whether "virtual" or physical, to "peel back" the layers of an object 
		to examine the internal structure.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The first stage of SHADE has been to establish common 
		digital image capture standards based upon the tried and proven high-quality 
		PhaseOne Hasselblad solution.</p>
	  <p class="normal">This system allows automation of the QTVR object capture 
		process.  It can simultaneously produce two QTVR object movies at different 
		resolutions.  The larger would be for research or CD-ROM purposes, the 
		smaller for use on the WWW.  For research purposes we would make the largest 
		object movie full resolution (18 mb per image) and one image every 10 
		degrees or 36 frames per movie.  This produces a very large file.  The 
		Web version would usually be reduced to 18 frames at a much lower resolution 
		  usually a maximum of 320 pixels on the longest side.</p>
	  <p class="normal">SHADE has grown out of existing informal skills-sharing 
		activities between staff at the Smithsonian and the Hunterian, and the 
		goal is to further develop the potential of emergent technologies for 
		presentation of museum collections through digital media.  The first stages 
		of this project have proved very successful, with Smithsonian staff providing 
		expert advice and peer review for the Hunterian's Hominid Evolution CD-ROM 
		project, incorporating digitally captured skull specimens in QTVR of all 
		known hominids.  This collaboration continues to produce a stimulating 
		two-way exchange of ideas.</p>
	  <p class="normal">As a recognized "international" project with the combined 
		cache of the Hunterian and Smithsonian names, the partners have been able 
		to negotiate substantial savings on very expensive equipment and at times 
		donations of equipment they couldn't afford to purchase.  They can frequently 
		arrange trial loans of new equipment to test before purchasing.  Commonality 
		of equipment helps ensure that these high standards of image quality are 
		maintained and that digital experiments being conducted at each partner 
		location can be replicated accurately at remote locations.  This also 
		provides opportunities to test the reliability of the partner's broadband 
		networks when transferring large image files across the Atlantic.  The 
		Hunterian's close collaboration with the Computing Science Department 
		of the University of Glasgow gives the project access to another necessary 
		commodity, highly skilled and motivated student interns.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">From The Lab To The Field</h1>
	  <p class="normal">Much of the work at the Hunterian has involved teams of 
		students from the Department of Computing Science who have experimented 
		with a wide range of multi-media presentation techniques. The students 
		have benefited greatly from dealing with real clients seeking solutions 
		to real challenges.  In each project set for academic assessment, there 
		have been interesting technical challenges in using existing software 
		and also major design issues, but these have to be balanced against the 
		Museum's desire to capture large quantities of data.  The compromise often 
		reached is to regard the student projects as providing a framework for 
		the final product which can then be expanded by Museum staff as time permits, 
		or by paying somebody to carry out the data capture required to fill in 
		all the details.  This has led to the creation of Hunterian Scholarships 
		whereby the best students can apply for funded internships over the vacation 
		periods to take projects to completion.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The majority of projects involving student participation 
		have been conducted locally at the Hunterian, with remote input and peer 
		review from the Smithsonian.  However, as part of their SHADE input, the 
		Hunterian had been keen for some time to undertake a major QTVR fieldwork 
		project at a distant location from their lab facilities. The virtual tour 
		projects in QTVR which had been undertaken by the Hunterian up to that 
		point had been fairly small-scale indoor tours of Hunterian galleries 
		<a
href="http://www.hunterian.gla.ac.uk/mackintosh/mackintosh_index.html" target="_blank">http://www.hunterian.gla.ac.uk/mackintosh/mackintosh_index.html</a> 
		and limited outdoor tours of small sections of archaeological sites such 
		as the Antonine Wall <a
href="http://www.hunterian.gla.ac.uk/museum/romans/ANTONINE.HTM" target="_blank">http://www.hunterian.gla.ac.uk/museum/romans/ANTONINE.HTM</a> 
		constructed by the Romans in Scotland.  </p>
	  <p class="normal">These were easily reached from the Hunterian, and were 
		in relatively close proximity to the development facilities in the Museum 
		and the Computing Science labs at the University of Glasgow.  The challenge 
		of an archaeological expedition would test their capacity to put a team 
		into the field to create a virtual tour of a large scale archaeological 
		site, and be able to test all the digital imagery for QTVR operability 
		whilst still on-site, without recourse to the home lab facilities.  This 
		would allow them to determine the logistics involved in providing all 
		the mobile technical equipment and back-up necessary to support such a 
		team in the field.  After some discussion and negotiation with the British 
		School of Archaeology at Athens and the Hellenic Ministry of Culture, 
		it was agreed that an ideal site for this type of virtual tour treatment 
		was the palace complex of the legendary King Minos, at Knossos in Crete. 
		<a href="http://www.bsa.gla.ac.uk/knossos/vrtour/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.bsa.gla.ac.uk/knossos/vrtour/index.html</a> 
	  </p>
	  <p class="normal">The great volume of visitors to Knossos presents critical 
		conservation issues for the Greek Archaeological Service.  In many cases 
		the pressure placed on the structural remains has led to large areas of 
		the archaeological site being closed to the public. The creation of a 
		virtual tour of the site including these closed areas was aimed at providing 
		the on-line as well as the on-site visitor with an interactive multi-node 
		tour of this world heritage site, incorporating those areas that they 
		would otherwise be unable to see. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The resulting digital imagery can also serve as a conservation 
		tool for the Greek Archaeological Service.  The material has been made 
		available on-line to form a valuable educational resource for scholars 
		at all levels, from school pupils and their teachers to academic researchers 
		in the fields of archaeology, art history, and cultural heritage management.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Important lessons were learned by the expedition team 
		in coping with the vagaries of climate, dust, absence of electricity, 
		and over-abundance of tourists and <i>raki </i>(the local aperitif):  
		all of this whilst trying to coax the maximum output from somewhat delicate 
		photographic and computer equipment.  That the entire Minoan Palace plus 
		some nearby associated sites were digitally captured, and around one hundred 
		panoramic nodes processed, including many retakes, on-site, and within 
		the agreed timescale of six days, was a major achievement.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">User Evaluation</h1>
	  <p class="normal">Throughout all of SHADE s activities, the partners have 
		sought the input of a broad range of end-users of their digital resources. 
		 Museums have a responsibility to provide educational resources to all 
		levels of scholars, from elementary school students to post-doctoral researchers.  
		The Smithsonian and the Hunterian partners have sought to engage the widest 
		possible audiences in developing their digital educational resources.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The Smithsonian's Natural History Museum has the largest 
		single collection of academic researchers in any one building in the world.  
		They have constantly provided excellent feedback and encouragement.  Scholars 
		have frequently commented on how the provision of a high-resolution digital 
		image of an artefact, captured under expertly lit conditions, has allowed 
		them to identify artefact features which are not obvious even when the 
		actual artefact is examined by hand.  Carl and his team are in heavy demand, 
		supporting Smithsonian staff engaged in leading-edge research around the 
		world.  He is currently engaged in the highly controversial "Kennewick 
		Man" study. <a

	  <p class="normal">From the outset of its pioneering work in the provision 
		of distance learning resources via the Web, the Hunterian has developedits 
		materials in consultation with a wide range of user groups.  In addition 
		to the university academic community, the institution has taken on board 
		teachers and students from junior and senior schools in Scotland and the 
		US.  These include schools in remote areas like the Outer Hebridean island 
		of Barra, in the Western Isles of Scotland, and those in major urban conurbations 
		such as Glasgow, and Alexandria, Virginia, on the outskirts of Washington 
		DC.  All of the participating schools have provided excellent feedback 
		on the various projects undertaken by the SHADE partners.  The Hunterian 
		has been successful in securing grant support from national agencies such 
		as SCRAN (Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network) to develop online 
		and CD ROM based educational resources targeted specifically at school 
		curriculum support.  The Hunterian is currently in discussion with the 
		Scottish Museums Council to develop a major research project in Scotland 
		to assess museum Web resource provision and evaluate audience take-up.</p>

	  <p class="normal">As stated in the introduction, this is a timely opportunity 
		for the SHADE partners to look back over the past six years since that 
		very first contact at Museums and The Web in Los Angeles.  It has been 
		useful to reflect on and evaluate what has been achieved thus far, and 
		to assess, with input from the target audiences, how successful the partners 
		have been in their aims, and where, in the language of their school users' 
		report cards, they "could do better"!   The next stage will be to gather 
		wider input to the evaluation process, collate that feedback, and disseminate 
		the results to the museum community.  SHADE does not have, and probably 
		never will have, all the answers to developing digital resources that 
		meet the aspirations of the varied museum audiences.  But the partnership 
		has made some very useful steps in the right direction.  This hopefully 
		can help map a course ahead that may serve as a model for our sector.</p>
