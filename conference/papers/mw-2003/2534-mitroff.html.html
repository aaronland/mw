	  <p class="normal">The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (<a
href="http://www.sfmoma.org/" target="_blank">http://www.sfmoma.org</a>) has begun 
		a major cross-departmental initiative to bring its collections management 
		database online and integrate the contents of the collections database 
		within a new search engine. From media-rich, Flash-based multimedia content 
		to public programs information stored in a SQL database, the new site-wide 
		search engine will integrate data and interpretive content from several 
		disparate sources into a seamless, web-based engine for the Museum's varied 
		audiences.</p>
	  <p class="normal">In this paper, we will discuss how this project evolved 
		and grew in scope, our commitment to user-centered design, and what we 
		discovered in the development process.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Background</h1>
	  <p class="normal">The project, informally called Collections Access Online, 
		grew out of a National Endowment for the Humanities Challenge Grant and 
		is a cross-departmental collaboration between the Web group in the Publications 
		&amp; Graphic Design Department, the Interactive Educational Technologies 
		group in the Education Department, and the Collections Information and 
		Access Department. The three authors are from the three respective departments, 
		and their diverse perspectives inform the paper.</p>
	  <p class="normal">SFMOMA received an NEH Challenge Grant of $1 million to 
		provide essential endowment resources for expanded use of new technologies 
		to increase public access to SFMOMA's rapidly growing permanent collection. 
		NEH support represents a crucial step in leveraging our collections' value 
		as an interdisciplinary educational resource for the general public, students, 
		teachers, and scholars. Subsequently we also received a $500,000 grant 
		from the Institute for Museum and Library Services to further refine our 
		use of multimedia and improve our ability to communicate with visitors 
		and our school audience in galleries and online.</p>
	  <p class="normal">While SFMOMA received both the NEH and the IMLS grants 
		based on its significant educational multimedia resources developed over 
		the past seven years, we do not have searchable, object-specific data 
		on the Web site. The Collections section of the site contains static HTML 
		pages featuring only 45 selected works, and there is currently no way 
		for a user to search any part of our collections database (<a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/collections/" target="_blank">http://www.sfmoma.org/collections/</a>).</p>
	  <p class="normal">This lack of publicly accessible, digital collections 
		information on the SFMOMA site was seen as a critical gap in our institutional 
		offerings, and informed one of the key objectives of the NEH grant: to 
		offer greater public and scholarly access to SFMOMA's Collections database 
		through online accessibility of images and basic wall label information 
		for the artwork that is most frequently utilized in exhibition, publication, 
		and education programs via SFMOMA's Web site. The IMLS grant promises 
		to go even further by streamlining and refining access to our collections 
		database and educational materials.</p>
	  <p class="normal">When we first received the NEH grant, our goal was to 
		put images and basic wall label information online by using EmbARK Web 
		Kiosk, the Web component of our collections management software, EmbARK. 
		We planned to modify the interface of EmbARK Web Kiosk so that it matched 
		the look and feel of our existing site, and link to it from the Collections 
		section of our Web site.  However, we did not intend to integrate the 
		collections data with our site-wide search engine. This meant that, in 
		order for a user to search the SFMOMA collections, he/she would have to 
		click through to the Collections section of the site. Simply typing in 
		an artist's name or title of an artwork into the search box would yield 
		no results. </p>
	  <p class="normal">As we began developing the functional specifications for 
		this project, we quickly realized that merely putting EmbARK Web Kiosk 
		online inside the Collections section of our site would not best serve 
		our Web visitors. To us, it may be obvious that clicking on Collections 
		in the navigation bar would lead one to the collections-specific portion 
		of the site (where, presumably, one could then search the collections), 
		but this puts the burden on the user to discover this. Burying the SFMOMA 
		Collections information inside the Collections section of the site also 
		assumes that all users are familiar with the basic concept of a museum 
		<i>collection</i>. Furthermore, even if a user <i>does </i>finally<i> 
		</i>click through to the Collections section of our site, he/she might 
		never discover all of the rich, interpretive content about our collections 
		in the Education section of our site. </p>
	  <p class="normal">From object-level information to interpretive multimedia 
		content, the right solution would be to provide a simple, centralized 
		way for users to discover <i>all</i> of the content available on the SFMOMA 
		site. This solution should be a search engine that brings everything together 
		in a simple, easy-to-use interface.</p>
	  <p class="normal">At the time of this paper's publication, the SFMOMA Web 
		site uses a basic search engine that came with Microsoft's Internet Information 
		Server. This search engine, a local file indexer, only finds the static 
		HTML pages on our Web server. A local file indexer "finds" files by following 
		the directory structure on the hard drive, usually starting with the Web 
		server root directory. Local file indexers scan files based on their location 
		in the directory structure, as opposed to following Web links, and they 
		can't "see" dynamic data. The SFMOMA site has nearly 4,000 HTML pages, 
		but we also have a significant amount of content that is stored in other 
		formats, such as content stored in a SQL database and content stored in 
		Flash files. The entire Calendar (<a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/calendar/" target="_blank">http://www.sfmoma.org/calendar/</a>), 
		Exhibitions (<a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/exhibitions/" target="_blank">http://www.sfmoma.org/exhibitions/</a>), 
		and Press Room (<a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/press/" target="_blank">http://www.sfmoma.org/press/</a>) 
		sections of our site are database-driven. In addition, all of our rich, 
		interactive educational content, such as <i>Making Sense of Modern Art</i> 
		(<a
href="http://www.sfmoma.org/msoma/" target="_blank">http://www.sfmoma.org/msoma/</a>), 
		is Flash-based.  And finally, the collections data stored in EmbARK Web 
		Kiosk's database is not accessible by a local file indexer. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The scope of this project quickly grew beyond offering 
		straightforward access to collections data; it became a larger project 
		about user experience and search engine technology. These technical and 
		user interface design challenges represented a unique opportunity for 
		three departments to work together. As a team, the three departments could 
		see the challenges and implications from several points of view, and keep 
		the details as well as the big picture in focus. The Collections Information 
		and Access Department (CIA) is responsible for the management and maintenance 
		of the EmbARK system and the EmbARK Web Kiosk.  The Interactive Educational 
		Technologies group is responsible for the production of our rich, educational 
		multimedia and represents the needs of our diverse audiences through the 
		interpretation of our Collections for the public. And, finally, the Web 
		group is responsible for bringing it all together on the museum's institutional 
		Web site and representing SFMOMA's online institutional presence in a 
		well-designed, user-centered manner. Also informing the project's perspective 
		is the San Francisco-based Web design firm, Perimetre-Flux Design, the 
		developers and designers of SFMOMA's Web site and our ongoing partners 
		in other projects.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Data Preparation and Delivery</h1>
	  <p class="normal">SFMOMA has been working with Gallery System's EmbARK software 
		since its development phase in 1992. We began actively using EmbARK as 
		our collection management system when we moved into our new building in 
		1995. More than 80 staff members at SFMOMA need desktop access to EmbARK, 
		but the institution only has a 20-seat user license. Staff members in 
		Education, Communications, Development, the Library, the Museum Store 
		and other departments who don't have access are able to review collections 
		information only through printed reports obtained from staff with EmbARK 
		access.</p>
	  <p class="normal">With the release of Gallery Systems' customizable web 
		component, EmbARK Web Kiosk, we decided to install the product on our 
		intranet and make it available for staff. (Fig. 1: EmbARK Web Kiosk on 
		SFMOMA intranet) This allowed us to decrease the number of desktop users 
		of the EmbARK database, reduce the need for training and supporting these 
		users, free up our user licenses, and test the ways in which people use 
		online collections information. This was a baby step towards our larger 
		goal of providing collections information on our Web site.</p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><img src="mitroff.figure1.jpg" width="397" height="351"></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption" align="center">Figure 1</p>
	  <p class="normal">The staff of the Collections Information and Access Department 
		(CIA) was excited about moving towards online, public access to collections 
		information, but, like many museums, we were protective of our data. Concerns 
		about misappropriation of images and text, publishing potentially incorrect 
		information, and the public's potential disincentive for visiting the 
		museum were among the issues. However, several years prior to the release 
		of EmbARK Web Kiosk, members of the CIA staff were instrumental in the 
		Museum's decision to join the Art Museum Image Consortium, or AMICO (http://<a
href="http://www.amico.org/" target="_blank">www.amico.org</a>), as a founding 
		member.</p>
	  <p class="normal">The AMICO submission requirement of 500 images per year 
		served as a catalyst to help us get our digital images, rights, and object 
		data ready for online publication. As part of our participation in AMICO, 
		we produced digital images, researched copyrights, and formalized in-house 
		approval procedures for publishing information electronically. CIA hired 
		an imaging specialist to create professional quality files and an intellectual 
		property specialist with experience in electronic rights. Other CIA staff 
		checked records, did basic research and got curatorial input. Conservation 
		and Registration contributed physical object information and Education 
		contributed didactic material from our interactive educational programs. 
		Ultimately we streamlined the process and focused on three groups of objects 
		(new accessions, exhibitions, and loans). This approach helped us capitalize 
		on the attention these objects were already getting in the normal course 
		of our work.</p>
	  <p class="normal">After we published these records through AMICO, our next 
		step was to make them available to staff&#151;and then the public&#151;through 
		EmbARK Web Kiosk. Our curators and senior staff approved the use of all 
		permanent collection records for use on our public Web site, provided 
		that certain caveats&#151;such as "we are continually updating our information&quot;&#151;were 
		published on our site.  As we tested the EmbARK Web Kiosk in-house, we 
		determined that it would have to be refined and modified for the public 
		through a user-centered design process.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Research and Usability</h1>
	  <p class="normal">From the start of the project, the team has been committed 
		to focusing on user-centered design and usability. We thought this project 
		would present us with a great opportunity to apply user interface design 
		principles from the for-profit Web world to a museum site. Our research 
		started with a report published by the Nielsen Norman Group, "E-commerce 
		User Experience: Design Guidelines for Search.&quot; (Nielsen, et al, 
		2000) The members of Nielsen Norman Group are leaders in the field of 
		user-centered design and usability, and although a few of the design guidelines 
		in their report are specific to searching for products on e-commerce sites, 
		<strong>most of the guidelines apply to all forms of Web searches</strong> 
		and contain many valuable lessons for museums and cultural institutions. 
	  </p>
	  <p class="normal">The report can be ordered online through the NNG site, 
		and we will not attempt to summarize the full report here. We will discuss 
		three basic guidelines that we applied to our functionality design specifications 
		for the project.</p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Make search visible</h3>
	  <p class="normal">The design of the SFMOMA site at the time of this paper's 
		publication requires users to click on the SFMOMA logo in order to reveal 
		the search box. The only hint users have is the word "search" next to 
		the logo (Fig. 2: Detail of SFMOMA navigation).</p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><img src="mitroff.figure2.jpg" width="508" height="105"></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption" align="center">Figure 2</p>
	  <p class="normal">In addition, the current design does not feature a search 
		button as on most sites; the user must hit the Enter key to submit a search. 
		Although this design may look sexy and win us design awards, the project 
		team agreed that when it comes to functionality as basic as search, we 
		simply cannot afford to present an obtuse user interface. As searching 
		is one of the most basic functions on a Web site, we redesigned the interface 
		for the search box so that search is clearly visible and easy to use. 
		(Fig. 3: Detail of redesigned SFMOMA navigation).</p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><img src="mitroff.figure3.jpg" width="386" height="147"></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption" align="center">Figure 3</p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Make the default search simple to use</h3>
	  <p class="normal">We debated whether or not our new site search should have 
		scoping parameters such as "Search Collections," "Search Calendar," and 
		"Search Entire Site," but we determined that simpler was better. Just 
		because our back-end databases for our collections and our calendar of 
		events are separate systems, the user should not have to worry about this. 
		Many users do not understand the difference between these options and 
		will end up failing in their searches. Our feeling is that narrowing a 
		search should be a user's decision, not a requirement of the search interface.</p>
	  <h3 class="SubHeaderSmall">Provide information about alternative ways of 
		locating content.</h3>
	  <p class="normal">This principle reminds us that users should be able to 
		find more than that for which they were searching. Search results should 
		be relevant and clear, but results pages should also contain what we call 
		"value-added" content. Because we have so much rich content buried on 
		the SFMOMA site, we know that users may not find everything we have to 
		offer   even after we have improved our user interface design and re-engineered 
		our search engine. Therefore, as part of the design, we will surface our 
		multimedia content on the search pages. This will allow users to "stumble 
		upon" relevant content when searching, just as they would when exploring 
		the stacks in a library.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Functionality Design</h2>
	  <p class="normal">Our functionality design document has been an evolving 
		outline of the project's requirements and scope. It maps out all new and 
		existing screens. The functionality design process is important because 
		it pushes the team to define all scenarios. Each scenario yields a set 
		of screens and all the elements those screens will contain. After incorporating 
		the guidelines of the NNG report into our functionality design document, 
		we contacted one of the NNG user experience specialists who was kind enough 
		to give us a full-day of pro-bono consulting services under the aegis 
		of her own consulting firm. In this intensive one-day workshop, we reviewed 
		search engines on commercial and museum sites, developed profiles of our 
		users, mapped our goals to our users' needs, and further refined our functionality 
		design documents.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Using data from our Web logs and emails to the webmaster, 
		we were able to break our users into three distinct groups: people who 
		want artist/artwork-specific information or thematic art-related information; 
		people planning to visit the Museum who want logistical information; and, 
		lastly, people seeking administrative-type information or wanting to interact 
		with the institution. We then analyzed what the needs of these users are 
		("find out if SFMOMA has any works by Picasso," "get the Museum hours," 
		"view job listings," etc.) and mapped our goals to our users' needs. Our 
		most basic goal was to provide information these users can't currently 
		get from our site (namely, collections information), but an equally important 
		goal was to provide better access and more gateways to the wealth of information 
		we do have.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Content Design </h2>
	  <p class="normal">Our focus in content design is to surface otherwise-buried 
		multimedia materials and provide users with multiple paths of exploration. 
		 Some of this content already exists outside of the Collections section 
		on our site and is not searchable with our current search engine; other 
		content  is being developed or modified in the first phase of this project. 
		Some of the ways in which we are surfacing content include creating object-specific 
		links to <i>Making Sense of Modern Art</i> (<a
href="http://www.sfmoma.org/msoma/" target="_blank"><b>http://www.sfmoma.org/msoma/</b></a>) 
		that will be searchable through EmbARK, designing thematic pages highlighting 
		popular categories in our collections (&quot;abstract paintings,&quot; 
		&quot;Pop Art,&quot; etc.), and adding links to multimedia offerings on 
		search and Collections pages.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Our decisions about content development came from our 
		desire to surface existing materials, but they are also grounded in the 
		user patterns we discovered in our Web server logs.  An analysis of our 
		logs revealed that the number one search performed on our site was for 
		specific artists or artworks in the SFMOMA collection. One user in particular, 
		tried several times to locate information about Diego Rivera's <i>The 
		Flower Carrier</i> with no results. It was obvious from the specificity 
		of the query and the repeated attempts made that this person knew that 
		we have this work in our collections and that it is almost always on view. 
		Not only was this committed searcher unable to find an image or basic 
		label information, he/she never found the 35 screens of rich content (including 
		archival film footage of Rivera working on murals in the 1930s and video 
		commentary by art historians) we have in our educational feature, <i>Making 
		Sense of Modern Art</i>. Given that these rich interpretive materials 
		live on our Web site, it is critical to make those connections accessible 
		through the search function.</p>
	  <p class="normal"><i>Making Sense of Modern Art</i> is our on-going multimedia 
		exploration of artworks in the permanent collection. It is designed to 
		allow users to explore questions that surround works of art. All of its 
		screens are designed in Flash to allow for maximum interactivity. The 
		downside is that Flash is difficult to search and we have not yet invested 
		in the action scripting work to make it easily searched. The <i>Making 
		Sense </i>interface is organized by artworks, with each work having its 
		own artwork screen (Fig. 4: Diego Rivera Artwork Screen, http://www.sfmoma.org/msoma/) 
		from which a user can explore questions or zoom into the work.</p>
	  <p class="normal" align="center"><img src="mitroff.figure4.jpg" width="400" height="275"></p>
	  <p class="MsoCaption" align="center">Figure 4</p>
	  <p class="normal">One of our most basic goals is to ensure that artwork-specific 
		screens from <i>Making Sense</i> <i>of Modern Art</i> will be searchable. 
		Currently there is only one entry point for <i>Making Sense</i> and a 
		user needs to navigate through the interface to reach individual artwork 
		screen. We have modified the programming architecture so that each artwork 
		screen has its own direct URL. These URLs can now be entered into EmbARK 
		as basic links. This means that a user doing a search for Diego Rivera 
		would find the Rivera data screen in EmbARK with a link directly to the 
		Diego Rivera content in <i>Making Sense of Modern Art</i>. Paper prototyping 
		verified that users are very interested in these links to multimedia content.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Our server logs showed us that 11% of our users perform 
		what we call "thematic searches." That is, in addition to doing straightforward 
		searches for specific artists or artworks, users are searching across 
		larger themes in art, such as &quot;abstract painters,&quot; &quot;women 
		artists,&quot; and  &quot;color field painting.&quot; We are currently 
		reviewing data from our logs and data from similar institutions' logs 
		to establish what might be the top 25 thematic queries on art museum Web 
		sites. We plan to create new pages, grouping together the content we already 
		have to address users' interest in those themes. We can thus showcase 
		thematic multimedia content that has already been developed and may be 
		of interest to browsing Web users.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Finally, another focus of our content development has 
		been on what we are calling &quot;value-added&quot; content. This is a 
		way to present compelling multimedia features for which users have not 
		specifically searched. We can add links to this content at various steps 
		along the way of a user's search process (on search results, advanced 
		search, and Collections pages, for example) to intrigue those users who 
		are open to browsing. During paper prototype testing one user noted that 
		he expects "the museum to give me its best stuff." Users count on us to 
		present our most relevant and compelling content. Presenting rich, deep 
		content in conjunction with our search engine is one new way for us to 
		do just that.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Our ultimate goal may be a complete restructuring of our 
		Web site, and our current steps are heading us in the right direction. 
		With these new ways of presenting content in place with the new search 
		engine, we should be able to study our user logs and investigate visitor 
		behavior to learn more.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Paper Prototyping</h2>
	  <p class="normal">When our functionality design document contained enough 
		details for us to create screen mock-ups, we were ready to do some paper 
		prototyping with users. In consultation with the usability specialist 
		from Nielsen Norman Group, we developed a user testing script and some 
		paper "computer screens." </p>
	  <p class="normal">We recruited five users from our galleries and compensated 
		each user with a catalogue, a poster, and free passes to the Museum in 
		exchange for 30 minutes of their time. One of us acted as the facilitator 
		while two of us observed and took notes. We gave each tester a pencil 
		and told them to point at the screen with the pencil to "click" and to 
		write on the screens with the pencil to "type." </p>
	  <p class="normal">We found our paper prototype testing to be extremely useful 
		in examining our concepts and terminology. For example, almost every user 
		had a different understanding of the terms "multimedia" and "interactive." 
		We realized that we will need to do further terminology testing to chose 
		the best terms in the appropriate places in our navigation.</p>
	  <p class="normal">Although our computer "screens" were print-outs of a Word 
		document, we found the paper  testing to also be useful in analyzing our 
		page layouts. Many users didn't see links that we thought were very obvious, 
		and noticed other links that we didn't think were very important in the 
		information hierarchy. We plan to do several paper prototypes and tests 
		with real HTML screens throughout the project.</p>
	  <h2 class="SubHeader">Technical Approach </h2>
	  <p class="normal">Now that our collections data is ready for the public 
		and we have defined our interface and design goals, we are ready to identify 
		a search engine solution. One option is to customize Internet Information 
		Server's index server so it can search our SQL database and the EmbARK 
		Web Kiosk. This solution, presented to us by a contractor, would be a 
		fully custom solution requiring the development of search algorithms. 
		Although the programming work for this is affordable, the long-term maintenance 
		implications are too risky. This solution is also unnecessarily complex, 
		requiring real-time querying of our SQL database. </p>
	  <p class="normal">The mission of the Museum is not to develop proprietary 
		software and at this point we feel we will be better served by choosing 
		an existing product. We have also determined that a spider indexer would 
		better serve our needs than local file indexer solution. Spider indexers 
		locate files by following links, indexing the linked pages, and then following 
		each link from those pages until they have crawled through every page 
		on the site. As long as long there are links to our database-driven content, 
		it will be searchable by a spider.</p>
	  <p class="normal">We are currently examining two possible scenarios: purchasing 
		a search software product that can be installed and configured to run 
		on our Web server, or licensing a hosted search solution that will run 
		on a third party server. Although a hosted solution requires a monthly 
		maintenance fee, it will not require in-house maintenance and expertise. 
		We do not have any web engineers on staff, and this is one of the reasons 
		we are leaning towards a hosted solution at this point. In either case, 
		our first choice for either scenario at this point is Google, as we feel 
		that the Google engine is the most sophisticated engine available.</p>
	  <h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusion</h1>
	  <p class="normal">While the data and content development strategies are 
		in place, the bulk of the implementation work is still ahead. Our next 
		steps include completing all components of the interface design, and selecting 
		and customizing the search engine&#151;with iterative user testing throughout 
		the process. </p>
	  <p class="normal">With the completion of this project, we will have a new 
		set of tools to better serve our users, and a renewed commitment to do 
		so.</p>
