		<p class=PaperTitle>Data In, Data Out: Content Management for the Web</p>
		<p class=Author>Christine Sonnabend Vitto, United States Holocaust Memorial 
		  Museum, USA</p>
		<p class=URL><a href="http://www.ushmm.org/" target="_blank">http://www.ushmm.org</a></p>
		<p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>
		<p class=AbstractText>How do you create quality web sites from your database 
		  content? How can you utilize all of the information that your organization 
		  collects and generates? The Education Division of the United States 
		  Holocaust Memorial Museum, partnering with our technology experts and 
		  other divisions in the Museum, have created an integrated database system 
		  (HEDDA) that marries legacy databases with new front-end design, held 
		  together by middleware. This system has been designed with the web in 
		  mind, and is being used in many creative ways. </p>
		<p class=AbstractText>This paper will explore various web projects and 
		  the database creation process from a project manager's point of view. 
		  I will be using examples from our system, such as: 1) a database that 
		  was in a flat file format, then was converted to our integrated system 
		  and posted on our web site; 2) a database that allows the people whose 
		  information is stored in the database itself to edit and update their 
		  own records through the web; 3) a database containing data on Holocaust 
		  education in the United States that will be posted on our web site in 
		  a graphic, interactive format; and, 4) a database that tracks who gets 
		  the Museum's educational publications. Visitors to our web site can 
		  order materials through a simple web form, and our staff can send that 
		  record with one click into the database. </p>
		<p class=AbstractText>With these examples, I will be able to show how 
		  the back-end databases and web sites work together to solve problems 
		  for managers and eliminate duplicate efforts across our institution.</p>
		<p class=keywords>Keywords: databases, content management, integrated 
		  database system, HEDDA, middleware</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Introduction</h1>
		<p class=MsoNormal>When I started working in the Education division two 
		  and a half years ago, the staff kept track of only off-site programs, 
		  and they used paper index cards. Upon returning from a program, the 
		  staff member was supposed to fill out a card and leave it with the Deputy 
		  Director. Then when reports were given either monthly, quarterly, ad 
		  hoc or all of the above, someone would have to go through these cards 
		  and analyze the data for the reports. Other tracking mechanisms being 
		  used by the Division included paper records of how many visitors came 
		  to our Education Resource Center and got educational packets, plus an 
		  old Access database where names and addresses of people getting packets 
		  were stored.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>When the Director of Education and I realized this, 
		  after receiving a request from Museum management to make reports of 
		  all educational programs, and to put state profiles data from our Access 
		  database onto the Museum's Web site, we decided that we could not continue 
		  with the paper-based system and different Access databases, and ever 
		  expect to get things done. The Director turned to me and gave me a new 
		  project: find a way to do get reports of our programs and place materials 
		  on our Web site. And that's how the concept of HEDDA (our integrated 
		  database system) was born.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">HEDDA</h1>
		<p class=MsoNormal>HEDDA stands for Holocaust EDucation DAtabases. As 
		  I was looking at Education's content and needs, I realized that I could 
		  build separate systems and just deal with the immediate problems: 1) 
		  how to get accurate reports in a timely manner on Education's activities 
		  to Museum management; and 2) place the data from the State Profiles 
		  database (the state of Holocaust Education in the United States) onto 
		  the Museum's Web site; or I could do something that had short- and long-term 
		  benefits for the division's content management, and create a way link 
		  up all of the division's databases and share content with others in 
		  the division and across the Museum. I chose to go with the long-term 
		  solution, rather than fixing these problems piecemeal.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>I am the Education Division's project/content manager, 
		  working directly with a database programmer, who was the technical project 
		  manager. These roles evolved over time, and while I stayed the overall 
		  HEDDA project manager, each database has a database manager who is the 
		  content expert. On the technical side, the head of Database Development 
		  took over the project management role from the programmer. My job was 
		  somewhat like middleware too: I was expected to meet with the content 
		  experts, help them decide what they wanted, write up technical specifications 
		  and drawings that both sides could read, and then bring the documents 
		  to the programmer. He would go through the documentation, ask questions 
		  or request more information, and I would get it from the content side. 
		  We chose to use this method of working because we had found that in 
		  the past, when the content people spoke to the technical people, we 
		  ended up with a lot of frustrated and angry people, and a product that 
		  did not meet our needs.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>We created the ÔProgram TrackingÔ database first, and 
		  gave the Education staff access so that they could record their programs 
		  and activities themselves. Then we created reports for internal and 
		  external use. We decided to do this database in Lotus Notes, since the 
		  Museum had recently purchased this software for our email system, and 
		  we were anxious to try out some of the other functionality. </p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>Another way we decided to use the Lotus Notes databases 
		  was to create the access point through the Workspace area of Lotus Notes.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal align="center"><img src="vitto.fig1.jpg" width="395" height="229"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 1: Screen shot of the Workspace icons in Lotus 
		  Notes.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>Once the icon ÔHEDDA on Dev1Ô is selected, then the 
		  menu opens, and depending on an individual's rights within the database, 
		  they would see the choices and make a selection.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal align="center"><img src="vitto.fig2.jpg" width="395" height="200"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 2: Screen shot of the HEDDA menu in Lotus Notes.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>Not everyone can see the ÔDocumentationÔ and ÔIntegrated 
		  TestsÔ menu items, since these are for the programmer and myself to 
		  put our documents and to test functionality. Also, for the International 
		  Programs database, the database manager decided she would like to access 
		  her database through the Internet, as she had done in the past. She 
		  rarely uses the Lotus Notes entry point, although I insisted that we 
		  needed to have it. The colors and font of the menu were chosen specifically 
		  because we have a staff member who has vision impairment and he could 
		  not see anything in our old menu design.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">Integrating the Web into HEDDA</h2>
		<p class=BlockQuote>Once we talked to the MuseumÔs web and technology 
		  staff, we realized that we would not be able to use our legacy databases 
		  (mostly in Microsoft Access) on the Museum Web site. We would have to 
		  either convert these legacy databases or create an interface to connect 
		  the databases to the Web site. That is when we developed the concept 
		  and reality of ÔmiddlewareÔ or the Ômiddle tier.Ô A definition of the 
		  middle tier is (see <a
href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-03-1999/jw-03-middleware.html#sidebar1">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-03-1999/jw-03-middleware.html#sidebar1</a>)

			middle tier separates the technological dependencies from the client

			of our issues, such as access to legacy systems and multiple database 
			connectivity, can be initiated by the server and the client web page 
			does not need to worry about such dependencies.&nbsp; The middle tier 
			can more efficiently manage server resources by connection pooling

		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 3: Diagram of the HEDDA middleware architecture.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>One of the exciting things that HEDDA does is integrate 
		  database frameworks with each other to save on resources. We did this 
		  by assigning the authority to certain pick lists within the HEDDA framework. 
		  For example, if a database contains a field for the US states, then 
		  it references the original list of US states, and the authority resides 
		  in the State Profiles database. If any changes are made to this list, 
		  and this can only be done by authorized individuals, the changes are 
		  filtered down to the other databases that share the lists. All of the 
		  databases in the HEDDA system share the one list of US states, for example, 
		  and the users do not even know that this is happening.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>Another example is the list of International States. 
		  The authority for this list resides with the Educational Programming 
		  database manager. She may decide to add, delete, or edit names of these 
		  states, and then the changes would show up in the other databases. No 
		  one makes any of these changes in a vacuum; however, because they would 
		  need to communicate with the other databases managers to make sure that 
		  no one's data would be adversely affected. </p>
		<p class=MsoNormal align="center"><img src="vitto.fig4.jpg" width="395" height="245"></p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>Figure 4: UML Diagram of the database structure for 
		  the International Programs database.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>Another thing we did that made this system attractive 
		  to so many people in the Museum was allow for individualization in the 
		  look and feel of each database. For example, purple is the favorite 
		  color of the content manager of Educational Resources. It was a simple 
		  thing to create a purple background for her online resources section, 
		  so we did it. It may sound like a trivial matter, and please understand 
		  that functionality always came first, but if we could give desired functionality, 
		  plus choice of style, colors, and a fonts, then it was a sweeter deal, 
		  and more people were interested.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">Visitor Services and Educational Resources Materials 
		  Tracking</h1>
		<p class=MsoNormal>The Education Division produces many educational publications 
		  and brochures, and we hand them out for free to the public. We also 
		  have created PDFs for most of the documents and any visitor to our Web 
		  site can download and print free of charge. While the Education Division 
		  responds to email, snail mail, phone and fax request, materials are 
		  also given out on-site at the Museum's Information Desk by Visitor Services 
		  staff, which is in a completely different division of the Museum. (We 
		  closed the Museum's Education Resource Center one year ago.) When I 
		  investigated further, it turned out that Education and Visitor Services 
		  tracked eight of the same publications, from the same warehouse, even 
		  though Education was responsible for printing. For example, Visitor 
		  Services may receive a new publication from Exhibitions to give out 
		  at the Information Desk, and Education would not necessarily need to 
		  know about it. Education may develop a new publication and ask that 
		  Visitor Services give it out at the Information Desk, and both divisions 
		  would need to track their usage. Without a shared system, each division 
		  would track their use separately, and then hopefully communicate with 
		  each other to make sure the numbers agree. But communication is not 
		  guaranteed, and errors can be made with two separate systems. Since 
		  we need to track how many materials we are using, both to be able to 
		  report on what we're doing and to be able to replace materials in a 
		  timely fashion, and Visitor Services needs to track the materials that 
		  it gives out (many of which are the same), I proposed to Visitor Services 
		  and Education staff that we share a tracking system in HEDDA. Both sides 
		  agreed.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>Visitor Services already had a tracking system in Excel. 
		  While this worked well for them as an off-the-shelf product, they were 
		  excited about being able to use a more sophisticated database to retrieve 
		  data and create reports. We also designed a utility for both that would 
		  email the Operations staff in the Museum when it was time to order materials 
		  from the warehouse. straight from the database.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>Education did not have a formal tracking system for 
		  educational materials, but a combination of paper and an Access database. 
		  When both sides were asked to come up with required fields, we found 
		  that they were very similar, and some were the same. One of the advantages 
		  of using a system like HEDDA, too, is that we could customize the look 
		  and functionality for Education and Visitor Services, and still connect 
		  the content in the back-end. So, what would look to an outsider like 
		  two completely different databases really was one set of data.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal align="center"><img src="vitto.fig5.jpg" width="395" height="270"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 5: Screen shot of the Education Materials Tracking 
		  database.</p>
		<p class=MsoCaption><img src="vitto.fig6.jpg" width="395" height="274"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 6: Screen shot of the Visitor Services Materials 
		  Tracking database.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>Another way that these two areas share data is when 
		  a new publication is added. We created a shared form, which is the same 
		  on both database systems, that requires each party to check with the 
		  other before proceeding. The fields are filled out then the form is 
		  routed to either or both databases, based on the answers to the questions: 
		  ÔIs this material shared between Visitor Services and Ed Resources? 
		  (Please make sure to contact the other party before adding materials.)Ô 
		  and ÔIf no, is this data for Visitor Services or for Ed Resources?Ô 
		  We use check boxes to answer the questions, and if it is a shared resource, 
		  then the data can be viewed in both databases. If the material is not 
		  shared, then whichever box is checked -- Visitor Services or Ed Resources 
		  -- is where the data on the material can be viewed.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal align="center"><img src="vitto.fig7.jpg" width="396" height="302"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 7: Screen shot of the Add Materials form.</p>
		<h1 class="SubHeader">International Programs Database</h1>
		<p class=MsoNormal>This particular database contains a list of Holocaust 
		  organizations nationally and internationally, and the content is posted 
		  on the Museum's web site. There are over 1,000 records stored in the 
		  database. The data is reliant on data entry of several individuals, 
		  some at the Holocaust Museum and some from the organizations themselves. 
		  The original database was designed as a flat file, and did not include 
		  pick lists or any form of standardization. Consequently, it was possible 
		  to have twenty different spellings of a word, and it was not possible 
		  to search the data. A different area of the Museum than Education owns 
		  the database, but it has a rich amount of content. When we started looking 
		  at the content, we wanted to be able to use their list to show Holocaust 
		  organizations in the 50 states. Why should we duplicate their efforts? 
		  Once we proposed this idea, we found out that the data could not be 
		  shared while it was in the current system, and it would have to be converted 
		  then updated. There was also considerable interest in other areas of 
		  the Museum to make sure that the content was accurate and ensuring that 
		  other areas of the Museum could benefit from it. Since, HEDDA was created 
		  and in progress, we decided it made sense to use the HEDDA model for 
		  this project as well.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal align="center"><img src="vitto.fig8.jpg" width="396" height="285"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 8: Screen shot of back-end International Programs 
		  database data entry form.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>The data is organized in a specific way in both the 
		  back-end and the front-end view of the database. You can search by state, 
		  country, or organization. Because both the International Programs data 
		  and the States Profiles data are connected by HEDDA, it has become much 
		  easier to standardize and to share data. Now, from the State Profiles 
		  database, we will be able to show one seamless list of Holocaust organizations 
		  by state when queried.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">Mandel Fellowship Database</h2>
		<p class=MsoNormal>The Mandel Fellowship is a grant program run by the 
		  Education Division, which selects about fifteen teachers per year to 
		  come to the Museum and study, and then create a Holocaust project for 
		  their school or their community. These teachers must have generally 
		  taught the Holocaust for a number of years and be leaders in their communities. 
		  Originally, this program did not have a separate database or tracking 
		  system. When we decided to create HEDDA, we developed a database for 
		  this content in SQL, since we knew there was going to be a web component 
		  from the beginning. Since there are over 150 fellows, and the amount 
		  grows each year, and only one coordinator, we decided it would be easier 
		  to have each fellow update his or her entries themselves. So, after 
		  we designed the database itself, we designed a web form that would be 
		  available to all fellows with an Internet Explorer browser. It is password 
		  protected, and when a fellow selects his or her name from the list, 
		  then he/she inputs the password, and then only their content is drawn 
		  from the database to the web site. The fellow can then add new data 
		  or edit existing data, save the work, and then it will download into 
		  the database. The changes and additions are posted in real-time, so 
		  we can view the results of the data entry instantly.</p>

		<p class=MsoNormal>We have just started another project involving the 
		  data from the Mandel Fellowship database and the Museum's Web site. 
		  Right now, if you go to the Museum's Web site and view the Mandel Fellowship 
		  Web site, there is a list of who the fellows are for each year, their 
		  schools, and the titles of their projects. Since many of the fellows 
		  do have either Web sites, or some parts of their projects in electronic 
		  format, we are going to provide this information -- either a link or 
		  the actual content -- on the Museum's Web site. And it will be more 
		  than that because we are going to use the data in HEDDA: the fellow 
		  name, school address, school email, Fellowship Year, URL of Web site, 
		  Project Title, and a two-to-three sentence description of the project, 
		  written by the fellows themselves. All of this content can be entered 
		  or edited through the Web form we created for the database, by the fellows.

		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 11: This is a diagram of how the Web site will 
		  pull data from the HEDDA database, and which fields will be pulled.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">States Profiles Database</h2>
		<p class=MsoNormal>The States<b> </b>Profiles database contains information 
		  pertaining to Holocaust Education from each state in the United States. 
		  This data is in an older Access database that was created many years 
		  ago from a publication on Holocaust Education in the United States. 
		  We are trying to make our content accessible to the public as much as 
		  possible, and we have data from all 50 states in this database. Some 
		  examples of the data collected is: Holocaust organizations, Department 
		  of Education contacts for each state, Holocaust-related curricula, Holocaust 
		  education-related research, and legislation from each state relating 
		  to Holocaust education.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>We knew that we could not place the Access database 
		  onto our Web site, but we did not wish to re-do all the previous work 
		  that had been done. If we had, the project would have taken much longer 
		  to complete, and would have added a lot of complexity as well. In hindsight, 
		  we probably should have just converted it to SQL, but the whole point 
		  of having HEDDA and the middleware was to avoid time-consuming and difficult 
		  database conversions, and to enable all of our legacy databases to talk 
		  to one another. So, we kept the Access database, and built middleware 
		  for the front and back-end to talk, and so that the data could go up 
		  onto the Museum's Web site.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>The data is accessed in the back-end through a United 
		  States map, which I created in-house for internal use. Once we had the 
		  graphic, then I created an image map for the states, and gave it to 
		  the programmer, who connected it into the database. We also use a list 
		  of states in alphabetical order (including Washington, D.C.) on the 
		  left side of the screen.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal align="center"><img src="vitto.fig12.jpg" width="396" height="391"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 12: Screen shot of United States map for States 
		  Profiles database.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>Each section of data is on a tab. One of the tabs, 
		  called USHMM Programs is much like a report, and shows the functionality 
		  of the HEDDA integrated database system. This page pulls data from other 
		  HEDDA databases to show a report on the screen for each state. It pulls 
		  Mandel Fellowship data, such as the number and names of the fellows 
		  from each state; the number of entries from each state from the May 
		  Family National Art &amp; Writing Contest by year (from Educational 
		  Resources database); the number of teacher packets sent to each state 
		  by year (from Educational Resources database); the number of school 
		  groups from each state by year (planned future integration into HEDDA); 
		  number of teachers attending the Arthur and Rochelle Belfer Conferences 
		  from each state by year (planned future integration into HEDDA), and 
		  much more.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>For the Web site for States Profiles, we are going 
		  to create a new United States map, and allow users to access States' 
		  data directly through the map, or through a pick-list, much like the 
		  back-end. We are thinking of these data sets in terms of queries, so 
		  that when a user comes to the Web site, they may wish to see all of 
		  the Holocaust organizations in the state of North Carolina, plus the 
		  contact information for the North Carolina state Department of Education. 
		  The user will be able to select the data sets and then have the data 
		  displayed and formatted for printing, if desired. One thing we have 
		  not decided, however, is whether or not to make the changes to the back-end 
		  visible on the Web site in real-time, or have the front-end updated 
		  each evening at 1:00 am, for example.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">Educational Resources Database</h2>
		<p class=MsoNormal>The Educational Resources database tracks information 
		  on programs and projects run by our National Outreach staff. They have 
		  a mailing list of every person who has received our free teacher packets, 
		  data and statistics for the May Family Art &amp; Writing Contest, data 
		  on bulk orders of teaching materials, data on reference requests, and 
		  a section on materials tracking, to inventory all of our educational 
		  publications. The first section of the database, the mailing list, is 
		  our largest, and the most difficult to work with. It is an Access database, 
		  with approximately 40,000 records, but with many errors and duplicate 
		  entries. Also, before HEDDA, there were no pick lists and so standard 
		  data like a state name was entered many different ways. When we placed 
		  this database into the HEDDA framework, we had to do something about 
		  the state problem. We ended up creating a new field for state, so that 
		  there were two fields for state " old without a pick list and new with 
		  a pick list. We have someone who does our data entry, and she needs 
		  to go through record-by-record and transfer the data from the old to 
		  the new. Once this is complete, we will delete the old field.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>We have created a way to avoid double data entry when 
		  we receive forms requesting educational materials. In the old system, 
		  when someone wished to order an educational packet online, he/she filled 
		  out the on-line form and submitted it. It then had to be printed out, 
		  and data entered into the Access database. Another programmer before 
		  HEDDA created a utility to move the forms into the database, but it 
		  was complicated with many steps, and the users were not happy with it. 
		  With HEDDA, we asked that there be a simplified process to get the forms 
		  from the web to the database, without any extra data entry or complicated 
		  steps.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>We decided that the database manager needed to view 
		  the forms before they went into the database to weed out the joke forms 
		  or duplicates. It also was not a good idea, for security reasons, to 
		  connect the database directly to the web site. We created a new web 
		  page for the on-line form in JSP, which allowed us to send the data 
		  from the form to a new container within the HEDDA database framework. 
		  The container is called "Online Request Forms", and was created so that 
		  the database manager could view the data and approve forms to go directly 
		  into the Resource Request section of the Educational Resources database.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal align="center"><img src="vitto.fig13.jpg" width="396" height="247"></p>
		<p class=MsoCaption>Figure 13: Screen shot of the Online Request Forms 
		  container from the Educational Resources database.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>As you can see, the design allows the database manager 
		  to quickly check names, but she can click on any to see the rest of 
		  the details if she needs to do so. She can approve the names one by 
		  one, or approve a whole batch at a time. Best of all, it requires one 
		  click of the mouse, and no typing.</p>

		<h1 class="SubHeader">Conclusions</h1>
		<p class=MsoNormal>As you can see from the examples above, our efforts 
		  to integrate some of our duplicate functions have saved staff considerable 
		  time and frustration. Also, by implementing common-sense database architecture, 
		  we have enabled content from our databases to reach our Web site, and 
		  for this to be done in a smart, efficient manner. It also makes sense 
		  to work with other parts of the Museum, especially when we are using 
		  the same data, and both sides can benefit from working together. Another 
		  by-product of this project has been to forge powerful and lasting partnerships 
		  with other staff and areas of the Museum, and hopefully these relationships 
		  will continue to benefit everyone in forthcoming projects.</p>
		<h2 class="SubHeader">What We Learned: A Reality Check</h2>
		<p class=MsoNormal>It was hoped that by using middleware technology we 
		  could eliminate the need to migrate legacy databases, thereby saving 
		  us time and money by allowing us to continue using the legacy systems. 
		  For a while, this looked like it would happen, and we were making plans 
		  to place other databases into the HEDDA framework, but then we hit a 
		  brick wall, literally and figuratively. The programmer that worked on 
		  this project suddenly left the institution, and there is no one here 
		  currently who can continue the work. After much debate and discussion 
		  with our technology personnel, it was decided that the current staff 
		  and the new hire behind our programmer would not be able to support 
		  the system the way it had been built. Consequently, we have had to make 
		  a decision to migrate all legacy databases to SQL, hire a staff member 
		  who knows SQL, plus other languages, and database programming, and re-do 
		  much of the work that has already been done.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>I still think that our original concept of linking 
		  our databases and that of others within the Museum through an integrated 
		  database system is a sound conceptual ideal, and could be a reality. 
		  I have been told that the new programmer and existing staff will be 
		  working with me and the database managers to convert our legacy systems 
		  and try and get them up and running in the integrated system as planned. 
		  While I am very pleased to have this commitment from our staff, I also 
		  realize that we will have to go backwards and start over in many cases. 
		  It will be frustrating for the database managers who have already been 
		  through this and would like to see their systems working the same as 
		  before.</p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>What have we learned from our mistakes, and why did 
		  this first attempt fail? I think that our biggest problem was not having 
		  institutional database and programming standards. Now I know to insist 
		  on creating and using such standards, in any other project of this magnitude. 
		  We also did not have a very good system of knowledge management, which 
		  means that in our case when someone left, there was no one else who 
		  could pick up the project and continue it.<span>" </span></p>
		<p class=MsoNormal>I have learned a lot from this project. I have been 
		  able to learn valuable skills in database management and how to write 
		  and describe technical documentation. The documents I create today and 
		  worlds better than the first ones I did a year and a half ago, for example. 
		  I also know about some standards and criteria that Education itself 
		  needs to have to make a complete database system, such as separating 
		  out first and last name fields. I know that the next steps will be slower 
		  than before, but excellence cannot be rushed, and I am determined that 
		  we will have an integrated database system in the Education Division.</p>
