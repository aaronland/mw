Using digitized primary source materials involves fundamental shifts in the philosophies, service methods, and pedagogies of museum curators, librarians, and teachers, specific to particular audiences and intents. We are introducing a broad group of teachers to digital cultural heritage materials by partnering with several outreach programs in the University of Illinois College of Education, such as curriculum and instruction courses to secondary social studies student teachers, the Moveable Feast program, which provides technology training for K-12 teachers, and concept-based training for teachers, curators and librarians in the use of visual materials.  Museums and libraries assist teachers by placing digital objects in their historical context by utilizing innovative technologies to present this information and by identifying and helping teachers locate and utilize other digital resources that are freely accessible in electronic form. Similarly, the teachers provide the museums and libraries with specific requests for cultural heritage objects for their curriculum planning, development and implementation.  



The Teaching with Digital Content project presents numerous pedagogical issues for the teachers, curators, and librarians. This project requires a continuous collaboration between the individuals and groups, and through on-line discussions, requests, and in-service events, reiterative revisions prompt the ongoing site and curricular development. This collaboration brings the groups together to discuss utilizing digital cultural objects, what knowledge is available about the object from the institutions, as well as how the exchange of knowledge will extend student learning framed within state-based standards.

      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Digital technologies bring museums, libraries, and 

        archives together to enhance learning by providing access to digitized 

        primary and secondary cultural resources along with the more traditional 

        bibliographic materials. At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 

        the University Library and the College of Education are developing a collaborative 

        program that integrates digital primary source materials into K-12 curriculum 

        and the educational programs of museums and libraries. <i>Teaching with 

        Digital Content&#151;Describing, Finding and Using Digital Cultural Heritage 

        Materials</i> (<a

href="../http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/tdc" target="_blank">http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/tdc</a>) 

        is a two-year project funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. 

        Through this project, we are introducing a broad group of K-12 teachers, 

        museum curators, educators, and librarians to digital cultural heritage 

        materials. Our goal is to provide them with training and professional 

        development activities to enable use of primary source materials in the 

        classroom and in museum and library education programs. In this paper, 

        we will describe the collaborative <i>Teaching with Digital Content</i> 

        project and show how the educators are using on-line materials in their 

        learning environments.</p>

      <h1>Background</h1>

      <p>The <i>Teaching with Digital Content</i> project (TDC) project, which 

        started in 2001, built upon previous work undertaken with another project, 

        the Digital Cultural Heritage Community (DCHC) (<a

href="../http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/dchc" target="_blank">http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/dchc</a>). 

        The DCHC enabled the digitization of materials from East Central Illinois 

        area museums, archives and libraries for 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> 

        and 5<sup>th</sup> grade social science curricula (Bennett &amp; Jones, 

        2001). This project built upon the concept of a digital community where 

        institutions would contribute content to a database that contained images, 

        text, descriptive information and other multimedia objects to address 

        common themes (Bennett &amp; Sandore, 2001). </p>

      <p>The DCHC project aimed to increase the ease with which teachers would 

        utilize these online resources, enabling them to incorporate the new resources 

        in their classroom activities in ways that would be educationally meaningful 

        for their students. We established a framework for the creation of a test 

        database of historical information from area museums, libraries, and archives 

        and tested its viability to meet the curriculum needs of teachers in upper 

        elementary school classrooms in Central Illinois. During the DCHC project, 

        we also sought to develop, document, and disseminate both the processes 

        and products of a model program of cooperation between museums, libraries, 

        and archives. </p>

      <p>Several key recommendations resulted from the DCHC project participants 

        (Bennett, Sandore &amp; Pianfetti, 2002). The teachers judged the linking 

        of digitized content to curriculum units and statewide learning standards 

        to be very valuable. The project provided them with an opportunity to 

        match the mandated state learning standards with several classroom activities. 

        The developed database was robust enough to enable very different participant 

        institutions deposit metadata records conforming to the Dublin Core format. 

      </p>

      <p>The teachers argued that the quality as opposed to the quantity of resources 

        was important. Educators assigned a high value to the availability of 

        &#147;trustworthy&#148; primary sources via the Web. The time line of 

        the project had not allowed for adequate use and evaluation of digital 

        resources in the classroom. As with many similar projects, the length 

        of time it took to choose artifacts for digitization and the actual digitization 

        took a lot longer than initially anticipated. Finally, the need to increase 

        the ease by which teachers used the images and metadata online in the 

        classroom and for assignments became a significant issue. <b><u></u></b></p>

      <p>To further the DCHC project, and to address specifically the resulting 

        benefits and limitations, we proposed and received new funding from the 

        IMLS to bring together ten Illinois and Connecticut museums and libraries 

        and their digital content with K-12 teachers from four school districts 

        in Illinois. This project, administered by the Digital Imaging and Media 

        Technology Initiative of the University of Illinois Library, would also 

        allow us to work more closely with a larger group of museums, libraries 

        and educators.</p>

      <h1>Museum, Library and Teacher Partnerships</h1>

      <p>In the new <i>Teaching with Digital Content</i> project, K-12 teachers 

        from four Illinois school districts (Bloomington Public School District 

        #87; Champaign School District #4; Springfield Public School District 

        #186; and Urbana School District #116) are working together with ten museum 

        and library partners:</p>

      </ul>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Using an on-line Webboard as the primary means of discussion 

        and communication, the teachers are sharing curricular development and 

        implementation with the museum curators and librarians. Working in conjunction 

        with the College of Education, the teachers have been given guidance on 

        how to develop and engage digital technologies into their knowledge about 

        teaching, teaching about the past and &#147;history,&#148; and are learning 

        how to develop and implement these through their lesson plans. These are 

        traditional &#147;lesson plans,&#148; in that each includes introductory 

        information about the topic of the lesson, the grade level and the curriculum 

        content area such as social studies, economics or language arts. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Within their lesson plans, the teachers have also identified 

        which of the mandated Illinois K-12 Learning Standards they seek to address 

        with their lesson plans. A recent study of the Education Network of Australia 

        emphasized that &#147;good pedagogy approaches&#148; were necessary to 

        shape the use of digital resources and that children&#146;s use of digital 

        technology needed to be guided by its relationship to specific learning 

        goals and integration into specific learning environments (Downes et al, 

        2000). The Learning Standards are mandated by the Illinois State Board 

        of Education, and Illinois teachers must ensure that lesson plans correspond 

        appropriately. State Goal 16, for example, ensures that students will 

        &#147;understand events, trends, individuals and movements shaping the 

        history of Illinois, the United States and other nations&#148;. Within 

        that Goal, there are more detailed categories. The teachers then outline 

        in their lesson plans the activities that meet the Standards and the procedures 

        that the students follow during the lesson. The TDC project differs from 

        the widespread posting of lesson plans on various Web sites, in that those 

        teachers participating in the TDC project suggest specific ways in which 

        the TDC online database might be used in the development of the lesson. 

      </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>One 4<sup>th</sup> Grade teacher developed a lesson 

        plan on &#147;Choosing the Lincoln Statue&#148;, a competition to design 

        a new statue of Abraham Lincoln for outside the Champaign County Courthouse. 

        During that lesson, students would discuss the chronology of events in 

        the life of Abraham Lincoln, use the TDC database to research the years 

        when Lincoln practiced law in Urbana, Champaign County, search the TDC 

        database for images of Lincoln during the targeted years, and finally, 

        create their own designs for the new statue.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Lesson plans cover a wide range of topics; such as 

        African folk tales, the Civil War, the History of Money, and Settling 

        the Midwest. They also cover a wide span of student ages, 3<sup>rd</sup> 

        grade through 12<sup>th</sup> grade. Using the Webboard to share the lesson 

        plans with museum curators and librarians, the teachers also provide the 

        museums and libraries with specific requests for cultural heritage objects 

        for their curriculum planning, development and implementation. Similarly, 

        the museum curators and librarians suggest primary source material from 

        their collections that can be digitized for the teachers&#146; lesson 

        plans. Once artifacts are chosen for digitization, the museum and library 

        participants are developing new metadata which include reference to the 

        Illinois Learning Standards. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText><b>Online Database</b></p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>As discussions develop about the artifacts that would 

        be suitable for the teachers&#146; lesson plans, the ten participating 

        museums and libraries are simultaneously contributing digitized primary 

        source materials and accompanying metadata in Dublin Core format (<a href="../http://www.dublincore.org/" target="_blank">http://www.dublincore.org</a>) 

        to an on-line database and search engine. We have made some simple changes 

        to the Dublin Core (DC) field name format used in the database. In particular, 

        we have included fields such as Interpretation, mapped to the DC Description 

        field. (Other fields and their corresponding DC mapping are described 

        in Bennett et al, 2000.) This was due to requests from the teachers for 

        easier identification of field names in the metadata and from discussions 

        among museum and library personnel about how they would like to use the 

        DC for their collections.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>As well as the teachers&#146; lesson plans, the Illinois 

        State Board of Education Learning Standards guided and directed the identification 

        and selection of primary source materials for museum curators, archivists 

        and librarians to include in a digital repository . Discussions among 

        the schoolteachers, museum curators, and librarians identified artifacts 

        to be digitized. Although a teacher might have specifically requested 

        artifacts relating to Abraham Lincoln, the museums and libraries, taking 

        into account State Goal 16, might have images of other &#147;individuals 

        and movements shaping the history of Illinois&#148; and suggest those 

        as being usable in the Lincoln lesson plan. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Curators and librarians developed the metadata to correspond 

        to each artifact that would be digitized. The metadata was subsequently 

        formatted in Dublin Core. These artifact images and metadata were then 

        added to the on-line database (<a

href="../http://images.library.uiuc.edu:8081/cgi-bin/htmlclient.exe" target="_blank">http://images.library.uiuc.edu:8081/cgi-bin/htmlclient.exe</a>). 

        The metadata for each artifact image was developed to take into account 

        the different lesson plans and different themes where the image might 

        be used, the different age levels of students and the different requirements 

        of the teachers. For example, one elementary teacher and one high school 

        teacher submitted lesson plans on the two completely different themes 

        of World War II and Women in War (<a

href="../http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/tdc/LessonPlans/index.html" target="_blank">http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/tdc/LessonPlans/index.html</a>). 

        The Illinois State Library has a large collection of World War II posters. 

        The participating librarians investigated their poster collection to find 

        some that would fulfill the needs of both teachers and have started digitizing 

        over 100 posters that would help with both lesson plans. In the instance 

        of the &#147;I&#146;ll carry mine too!&#148; poster, the library personnel 

        submitted the image and descriptive metadata to the database following 

        several conversations on the Webboard with both teachers. Figure 1a shows 

        the image of a World War II poster held by the Illinois State Library, 

        and Figure 1b is the metadata corresponding to the poster. </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="bennettfig1a.jpg" width="450" height="366"><br>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Similarly, museum and library partners are digitizing 

        parts of their collections to correspond to other lesson plans. Museums 

        and libraries are assisting teachers by placing the digital objects in 

        their historical contexts. They also identify and help teachers locate 

        and utilize other freely available Web based resources that might be helpful 

        with particular lesson plans. Our experience with the DCHC project was 

        that teachers wanted a trusted source for on-line material to use in the 

        classroom. They do not have the time to research Web resources that would 

        be useful in their lesson plans, but they would be happy to use such resources. 

        Having a trusted group of librarians and museum curators recommend such 

        resources removes that barrier, and the teachers can use other resources 

        in the classroom, or also recommend extra resources to their students. 

        However, the teachers still require much guidance on how to use such resources 

        in the classroom.</p>

      <h1>Educating the Educators</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Besieged by increasing demands for &#147;technological 

        literacy&#148;, teachers are invariably being positioned in an environment 

        where it is essential to appear to be utilizing various technologies. 

        One of the most significant aspects in the contemporary calls for integration 

        of a range of digital technologies into school classrooms points to the 

        &#147;wonders&#148; of computer-mediated learning. New technologies tend 

        to be used in classrooms in ways that are consistent with traditional 

        practices, focusing on goals pertaining to the empirical assessment of 

        student achievement in relation to state learning standards. While teachers 

        in Illinois cannot ignore these standards, the teachers involved in the 

        TDC project are developing lesson plans and activities that are also pedagogically 

        sound and l support student learning rather than being entirely standard 

        directed and driven. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>A productive relationship between teachers and museum/library 

        personnel allows teachers to expand their own knowledge base and skills 

        as well as that of their students&#146;</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The nature of teaching, the use of digital primary 

        source material, the purposes of the project, and the benefits &#150; 

        and the limits &#150; of technologies in the classroom are all concerns 

        that arise in the various professional development workshops and interactions 

        among and between the teachers, the museum and library individuals, and 

        the project personnel. In presenting practical strategies for effectively 

        engaging with issues about teaching about the past and culture through 

        the use of digital objects, several professional development activities 

        have been planned, instituted, and evaluated, primarily through workshops, 

        summer institutes, and working sessions. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Over the two-year project, the teachers, museum and 

        library participants were introduced to topics specific to teaching with 

        digital content in four workshops. In the first workshop, the teachers 

        were introduced to current research about history education and the tension 

        between knowing what is considered &#147;history&#148; and the past. That 

        the teacher&#146;s own historical understanding will influence the students 

        knowing about history, the past, and the tension between the two directed 

        this initial workshop. Teachers were also introduced to the notion of 

        primary sources and the analysis of primary source material (<a

href="../http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/tdc/August2001Workshop.htm" target="_blank">http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/tdc/August2001Workshop.htm</a>). 

      </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The second workshop brought together individuals from 

        the cultural heritage institutes and the teachers to discuss how the meanings 

        of objects change through digitized imaging, and the interpretive and 

        educational roles the teachers, museum and library personnel have in student 

        understanding. The teachers discussed the role of the object as a medium 

        for learning in the classroom (<a

href="../http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/tdc/January2002Workshop_files/" target="_blank">http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/tdc/January2002Workshop_files/</a>). 

        The third and fourth workshops, which will be held at mid-point through 

        the final year of the project, will bring the teachers together again 

        with the museum curators and educators and librarians to further develop 

        learning activities and to engage with issues concerning digital content, 

        notably how differences in the media of primary sources (i.e. photograph, 

        artifact, written text) influence how students learn about the past and 

        how teachers teach about the past. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Assistance is also provided to the teachers to enable 

        them to integrate the digital cultural heritage materials into their curricula. 

        It is not enough for teachers to hear about the theory; they must also 

        be given hands-on assistance to enable them to use the technology in their 

        classroom. Each teacher participant also partakes in <i>The Moveable Feast</i> 

        program, a one-week summer institute held at several locations throughout 

        Illinois, which is tailored to the needs of utilizing technology in teaching. 

        This project-based technology institute emphasizes ways to integrate technology 

        in conjunction with lesson plans and the Illinois Learning Standards. 

        As well as the teachers, museum educators and librarians can partake in 

        the Moveable Feast program. Participants receive hands-on training in 

        up-to-date software products and productivity tools that they can use 

        in the classroom. Participants also share ideas for curriculum and Illinois 

        Learning Standards integration. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Since the focus of the project is on understanding, 

        developing, and advancing the social context, or &#147;communities of 

        practice&#148; necessary to engage in educational reform (Lave &amp; Wenger, 

        1991), the aim is not to participate in producing teachers who have already 

        managed to succeed in traditional ways of teaching history and who now 

        wish to succeed in understanding and addressing the new knowledge and 

        issues associated with the educational intent of digital environments. 

        The aim is to identify and describe the collaborative environments conducive 

        to developing technological and educational competence in the teachers, 

        museum and library personnel, all with an aim of improving the educational 

        experiences of Illinois students. By taking a collaborative approach that 

        focuses on the sociocultural aspects each participating institution brings 

        to education, we hope this project may contribute to a better understanding 

        of collective and interactive attainments, rather than limited individual 

        successes. </p>

      <h1>Collaboration</h1>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The success of the <i>Teaching with Digital Content</i> 

        project depends on developing and maintaining a collaborative association 

        among the institutions, the teachers, and the project personnel. Therefore, 

        this project presents numerous pedagogical issues for these individuals. 

        Success depends upon how the pedagogical issues &#150; the differences 

        in the culture of universities, museums and libraries, and schools; the 

        traditional association between museums, libraries, and teachers; and 

        the challenges of educational reform by teachers and museum and library 

        personnel &#150; both bridge the expectations and involvement each individual 

        brings to the project, and promote changes that contribute to student 

        learning. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The purpose of the collaboration is a project that 

        can grow into a learning community (Myers, 1996). While digital technologies 

        figure prominently in this project, social interaction among the participants 

        includes on-line discussions, requests, and in-service events. Reiterative 

        revisions prompt ongoing Web site and curricular development. The term 

        <i>collaboration</i> includes two different meanings: to work jointly 

        and to cooperate. For this project, to work jointly requires that the 

        teachers, the museum and library participants, and the project personnel 

        understand each others&#146; expectations, contributions, and knowledge, 

        and work together to ensure that individual and collective intents and 

        expectations are realized. The relationships between teachers and museums 

        and libraries have traditionally been linear, where the teachers accept 

        without question what the museum and library have to offer. In this project, 

        each individual is considered a full and equal partner. On-line and face-to-face 

        discussions bring forward issues and questions about utilizing digital 

        cultural objects, what knowledge is available about the object from the 

        institutions, as well as how the exchange of knowledge between the teachers 

        and students (vis-à-vis lesson plans as a base element) will extend student 

        learning framed within state-based standards. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The tensions between the ideological and pragmatic 

        purposes of digital technologies that influence the project&#146;s development, 

        use, and results, which are brought to the project by each individual, 

        prompted the development of a knowledge building community approach (Scardamalia 

        &amp; Bereiter, 1993). To foster communication and collaboration, we needed 

        to move beyond cyberspace to ensure continuous opportunities for face-to-face 

        meetings to address such issues as whether artifacts from museums can 

        be digitized without lesson plans from teachers or whether lesson plans 

        can completely direct the digitization of artifacts and metadata development. 

      </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>This project speaks directly to educational reform, 

        of re-tooling and changing the ways teachers are engaged in alternative 

        forms of education. Such educational reform requires self-direction and 

        interest on the part of teachers. This self-interest in making an impact 

        on how museums and libraries are used, and how the information obtained 

        from each is then translated into the classroom, is by far the dominant 

        pattern of collaboration among the participants. The image of one&#146;s 

        ability to change how students learn, the learning expectations held by 

        the teacher or school community, the museum or library&#146;s plans, and 

        the educational system in which each site is embedded, are significant 

        dimensions at both the individual and collective levels. Acknowledging 

        a consistent and on-going commitment to change may result from engaging 

        in the reform process. Those teachers involved in the project need to 

        understand how their involvement changes the teacher&#146;s role in educational 

        reform. How successful the implementation and evaluation of the project 

        is involves reconsidering the teacher-curator relationship to provide 

        a working environment where museum and library staff achieve a greater 

        degree of involvement in planning educational experiences and higher levels 

        of expertise in working with digital content. As well, we seek to provide 

        opportunities for the development of technological skills, both for the 

        teachers and the museum and library staff.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>To cultivate a collaborative relationship between both 

        groups includes ongoing attempts to implement practices and opportunities 

        for participation by members. The challenge for this project is to work 

        with teachers who must acquire new skills and develop new teaching approaches 

        when working with digital materials. Similarly, museum and library staff 

        must develop innovative ways of presenting access to digitized primary 

        source materials. Both groups are faced with changing expectations and 

        involvement in the project. The teachers become cognizant and critical 

        of digitized artifacts, while museum curators and librarians release the 

        historical hold on interpretation to the teacher for the purpose of student 

        engagement and learning. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Using digitized primary source materials involves fundamental 

        shifts in the philosophies, service methods, and pedagogies of museum 

        curators, librarians, and teachers, specific to particular audiences and 

        intents. Throughout the TDC project, we are seeking to test the effectiveness 

        of introducing several critical components in the process of integrating 

        primary source material into K-12 classroom teaching, including 1) the 

        use of innovative visual literacy teaching methods in the classroom, 2) 

        a concentrated technology component linking the use of digital technologies 

        with the creation of electronic curriculum materials based on state Learning 

        Standards, 3) easy access to a database containing digitized primary source 

        materials and their descriptive metadata aggregated from a number of diverse 

        museums and libraries, and finally, 4) support (both technical and human) 

        for consistent communication between schools and the cultural heritage 

        associations.</p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>This project binds learning in a context of responsibility 

        and makes each person a contributor to the development of the project. 

        . Thus, the human context surrounding the learning process is at the forefront. 

        For each participant, the learning environment makes possible individual 

        responsibility for learning development, with support from project participants 

        and awareness of being part of a process leading to greater knowledge 

        about utilizing digital content. Cooperation between the participants 

        is key. The scope and complexity of the individual participant&#146;s 

        learning curve encourages this cooperation, but it is equally necessary 

        to come up with opportunity and techniques that introduce and reinforce 

        knowledge exchange. It is understood that &quot;to be a partner&quot; 

        means to be in a position to intervene with competence in project development, 

        implementation, and evaluation. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>The more each participant is aware of the move towards 

        a collaboration, of the necessity to explore changing relationships between 

        museums and libraries, and changing teacher interaction with each, the 

        more effort each individual may be willing to invest.. From this, the 

        teachers and museum and library personnel can move to uncover the possibilities 

        for their own learning and teaching. This rests on their knowledge about 

        educational reform, which requires new considerations in the management 

        of museum and library artifacts in student learning. Conceptions of history 

        through technology involve the teachers and museum/library staffs&#146; 

        understanding of, knowledge about, and skill development in relation to 

        technologies in their respective field, and their own personal interests 

        and perceived opportunities to develop these interests in relation to 

        TDC project. </p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Far more critical to the success of the Teaching with 

        Digital Content project appears to be the recognition that social relations 

        frame learning, rather than being derived from it. Each individual will 

        collaborate to refine possibilities for learning. This learning is not 

        limited to either the teachers or the museum and library staff; rather, 

        the learning results when the groups come together to discuss common elements 

        from which to expand. </p>
