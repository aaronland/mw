      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>This paper argues that museums do 

        not have a natural role in the distribution of net art, that the conservation 

        tradition and expertise of museums do not make them suited for creating 

        historical collections of net art without undergoing major upgrading, 

        and that older art institutions have shown a superficial understanding 

        of net art. Other relevant institutions already have established themselves 

        on the Internet. </p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Although net art does not need museums, 

        one can still see how museums of contemporary art need net art. Public 

        museums of contemporary art are meant to cover the whole field of contemporary 

        art, and therefore they must necessarily also cover net art. If museums 

        have to take net art seriously, they have to start with the already established 

        competencies and viable forums outside the museums. Museums that wish 

        to cover net art should join these forums. For the sake of the reputation 

        of museums in the net art environment, it is essential that they do not 

        appear to be parasites or &#147;lusers&#148; - mere users of net art who 

        just download the resulting works of art without contributing to their 

        structural strengthening and the more process-oriented development.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>During the last three years, CultureNet Denmark 

        (<a href="../http://www.kulturnet.dk/">www.kulturnet.dk</a>) along with the established 

        cultural institutions in Denmark, has been actively working with projects 

        digitizing and communicating cultural legacy to a broad net audience. 

        In concert with colleagues in Sweden, Norway, Iceland and Finland, CultureNet 

        Denmark has also created a platform for Nordic net art, n2art, hence working 

        closely together with net artists and curators of net art.  As an institution 

        we have learned significantly from working concurrently in the areas of 

        institutional establishment and more anarchistic playgrounds. As individuals 

        we have benefited greatly from counting administrators of traditional 

        organizations as well as unconventional avant-gardes and techno nodes 

        among our colleagues and inspirational partners.</p>

      <p>This paper will present the model 

        behind the joint Nordic project of creating a platform for Nordic net 

        art (http://n2art.nu), and continue to focus the cultural political questions 

        of the relationship between net art and the &#145;art institution&#146;, 

        which is particularly relevant to the discussion of net art &#150; are 

        net art and the museum incompatible operating system? The questions revolves 

        around a central problem at a time when archiving and communicating our 

        digital cultural heritage is under general debate, and at a time when 

        several works of net art have already been lost for posterity. Net art 

        not only involves practical or technical aspects, but to a large extent 

        also what could be called ideological aspects, which considerably complicates 

        the discussion on communicating net art.</p>

      <p>New media represents a constantly shifting 

        frontier for experimentation and exploration. While new media are understood 

        in terms of course of the older media that precede them, they are nonetheless 

        freed, at least to some extent, from traditional limitations. Having to 

        figure out how new tools work, calls for innovation and encourages a kind 

        of beginner&#146;s mind. New media attract innovators, trendsetters and 

        risk takers. As a result some of the hottest creative minds spend their 

        time hacking around with new technologies that we barely understand. We 

        need to connect and interact with these designers of the future. </p>

      <p>Because of their newness, new media are slightly 

        beyond the effective reach of established institutions and our bureaucracy. 

        Net art is a case in point. While museums started to catch on to the Internet 

        as an art medium in the last years of the nineties and began to collect, 

        commission and exhibit net-based artworks, most artists who interest them 

        actually made their names <i>outside</i> the gallery-museum matrix. This 

        reluctance of establishment and the freedom of the net art come at a cost. 

        Galleries and museums serve a very important interpretive function. Museums 

        have the qualifying ability to focus the attention of critics and audiences, 

        to situate the artwork in a historical context, to allocate time and space 

        for us to experience the work itself, and &#150; not least &#150; to preserve 

        and protect what will be the cultural heritage of tomorrow. </p>

      <p>Even so we are also faced with the paradox, 

        that the Internet is the perfect tool to bring down all hierarchy and 

        bring art and culture directly to the audience. Neither the artist nor the art institutions or the viewer have the limited 

        roles of the past any more. What role are we to play, then, as institutions, 

        as artists, as audience? Art &#150; and in a general sense culture 

        &#150; has always been bound up with new technology, and artists have 

        always been among the first to adopt new technologies as they emerge. 

        Still, it sometimes seems, that the technological frontiers of art making 

        and communication of culture is a frontier the <i>institutions</i> of 

        arts and culture fear to tread. </p>

      <h1>The paradox of net art</h1>

      <p>In this paper, net art is understood 

        as art, which is made for, by use of, on and/or with the Internet as the 

        decisive technical or conceptual prerequisite. Net art is a largely anarchic 

        artistic genre, which defines itself in opposition to the hierarchical 

        art institution, which apparently 'dictates' what art is. Net art can 

        be expressed in many different ways, and is broadly defined as network 

        art in which communication is the central focal point, which means it 

        is not necessarily bound to the Internet. In this regard, the focus is 

        on works of Internet art in which the Internet is crucial for the work 

        of art, hence raising particular questions of dissemination and presentation. 

        </p>

      <p>It is paradoxical that net art 

        &#150; by virtue of its criticism of the art institution &#150; will always 

        remain a part of this same institution, because &#150; in one way or another 

        &#150; it is this positioning which makes it possible for us to discuss 

        Internet art as an art form at all. And the very first idea of creating 

        a joint Nordic platform for net art rested on this understanding. </p>

      <p>The challenge posed by net art 

        to the hierarchical structure of the art institution has a precursor in 

        avant-garde art, which attempted to eliminate the distinction between 

        art and non-art by challenging the art institution. The elimination of 

        this distinction can only be of importance inside the institutional framework, 

        because the framework makes the act that is taking place visible, of which 

        Marcel Duchamp's Fountain (1917) is a classic example.</p>

      <h1>n2art &#150; a platform for Nordic net art </h1>

      <p>During 2000 the five Nordic CultureNets 

        initiated, developed and implemented a Nordic platform for net art: <a href="../http://n2art.nu/">http://n2art.nu</a>. 

        </p>

      <p>What are the limits of an artwork 

        that is part of an overall discourse on the impact of the Internet on 

        cultural and societal developments? The concept of what is art becomes 

        difficult to establish, because it is clear that net art seldom can be 

        viewed as fully autonomous art objects.</p>

      <p>n2art as a process and a project 

        was not intended to formulate a solution to this problem, but to point 

        out some of the paradoxes involved in net art and the institutionalisation 

        of net art; The five Nordic CultureNets each act on behalf of the five 

        Nordic ministries of culture, hence representing a highly bureaucratic 

        and administrative structure. On the other hand all five CultureNets thrive 

        on the notion and concept of network; working in a decentralised zone 

        of national culture. In a sense the concept of CultureNet is in itself 

        a paradox between centre and periphery of cultural establishment.</p>

      <p>n2art is a platform for net art, an exhibition of new art forms, but 

        it is of course also a political construction, a prototype for Nordic 

        co-operation, an experimental funding structure for net art. And n2art 

        is a cultural statement. n2art is the first common Nordic project within 

        the national CultureNets. The purpose of n2art is to establish a curated 

        exhibition venue for net art in the Nordic region. The National CultureNets 

        operate under the Ministry of Culture in the different Nordic Countries.  

        But above all n2art is an experiment, an &#147;Observatory of Premonition&#148; 

        &#150; to borrow an expression from the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard.</p>

      <h1>Background &amp; Scope</h1>

      <p>n2art began as a digression, as 

        a restless idea in the hearts and minds of the directors of the Scandinavian 

        CultureNets. The CultureNet directors from Sweden, Norway and Denmark 

        had long shared a common dream of inventing and implementing a joint Nordic 

        project that would not only pave the way for Nordic co-operation in general 

        &#150; perhaps even pave the way for a Nordic CultureNet &#150; but also 

        be an expression of Nordic culture on the Internet. From the beginning 

        it was very important to us to define a project that would in a way transcend 

        national boundaries and stereotypes of national culture, as well as make 

        use of the fact, that all Nordic CultureNets are situated in the magic 

        and very intense field between culture and IT, between art and new technology. 

        </p>

      <p>So we chose net art; artworks designed to an only accessible on the Internet 

        &#150; the media of no nationality. And we were very grateful when Menningarnet 

        (CultureNet Iceland) and Kuultturisampoo (CultureNet Finland), embraced 

        the idea and joined the project - extending it from a Scandinavian project 

        to a full-hearted Nordic project - as was the intention.  This made n2art 

        a shared project between the CultureNets in Sweden, Finland, Iceland, 

        Norway and Denmark. </p>

      <p>The purpose of n2art was to create 

        an exhibition venue where the works of art are placed in a context, in 

        which they are presented and annotated. The works of art have been selected 

        by a group of 5 Nordic curators. As an experiment, it is the hope that 

        a project like n2art will make a difference also in a political sense; 

        that is by, increasing the recognition of this form of art and the necessity 

        for supporting it: n2art was the first publicly funded net art site in 

        the Nordic region. But above all n2art is important as a continued commitment 

        on an institutional level to this form of art and discourse. So it was 

        with great satisfaction, that we made it possible for n2art to live on 

        &#150; beyond our commitment &#150; and develop within NIFCA, Nordic Institute 

        for Contemporary Art founded and supported by Nordic Council of Ministers.</p>

      <h1>Organisation</h1>

      <p>From the very beginning it was 

        decided to establish a parallel structure of the project dividing the 

        focus of administration and funding from the focus of content. And this 

        was done by establishing a Directors Board and a Curators Board, the latter 

        consisting of one handpicked curator from each of the five participating 

        nations.</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Over all project management and responsibility was assigned to CultureNet 

          Denmark.</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Server management and development was assigned to ArtNet Norway being 

          a sector net of CultureNet Norway. </span></li>

      </ul>

      <p>The main purpose of this parallel 

        structure was to secure the quality of the content and doing so by headhunting 

        very competent curators and granting them the means and space for focusing 

        only on which artworks to present. Curators Board was then given the exclusive 

        responsibility of the content of n2art. Whereas Directors Board took care 

        of management, administration and economy. This structure proved very 

        efficient and productive. The sole project management and curatorial development 

        is now conducted by NIFCA. </p>

      <p>As a joint project n2art was not only founded on political and administrative 

        consensus between 5 national CultureNet directors, but is also based on 

        the artistic agreement by the 5 specially chosen curators, one from each 

        country. All in all  n2art is the result of the strong desire to co-operate 

        - not only among the CultureNets and the directors, but also among the 

        curators. One of the pioneers of net art, Roy Ascott, has rightly emphasized 

        that &#145;networking&#146; has been a symbol of the culture during the 

        last decade of the 20th Century, and will continue to be one in the 21st 

        Century. The project administration of n2art has the rare honour of participating 

        in the realization of Ascott&#146;s prophesy</p>

      <h1>Impact &amp; Experiences</h1>

      <p>Working with and managing the n2art 

        project has offered CultureNet Denmark a unique experience in planning 

        and conducting pan national joint projects. But mostly n2art has offered 

        CultureNet Denmark familiarity with the field of net art, and we wished 

        to place this experience and competence at the disposal of the Danish 

        Ministry of Culture, the establishment of Danish Cultural institutions, 

        the net art communities as well as the general public.</p>

      <p>The questions faced working with 

        n2art was mainly questions of:</p>

      <ul>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal"> Funding structures</span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Copy right </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">&#146;Preservation&#146; </span></li>

        <li class="normal"><span class="normal">Dealing with net art as the cultural heritage of the future</span></li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Funding structures</h2>

      <p>In order to print a book, one needs 

        a printing house. In comparison to the cost of establishing a printing 

        house, the cost of printing a greater number of books is minimal. When 

        one has established a printing house, one might as well print a thousand 

        books. In order to operate a network server to host a work of net art 

        of average complexity, one needs a computer, software, a good Internet 

        connection that is always accessible, and a full-time technician. When 

        this is established, one might as well host a thousand works of net art 

        at an insignificantly higher cost.</p>

      <p>If we at first wish to offer the 

        most important net artists good opportunities, the price of offering good 

        services to a broad selection of artists will merely be slightly higher. 

        Therefore funding collective solutions - for example through supporting 

        service providers, can to a great extent carry out public stimulation 

        of net art. Hence we chose to establish a server environment for n2art, 

        hosted by Artnet Norway.</p>

      <p>The lesson learned is that support 

        of net art and &#150;artists can be conducted rather easy, cheap and effective, 

        by providing server facilities. It can even be conducted by larger museums 

        &#133; </p>

      <h2>Copy right</h2>

      <p>Since net artists are not sufficiently economically supported through 

        the consumption of their work, net artists are not that concerned with 

        copyright. The basis for netart is an economy of <i>exchange</i>. Pecuniary 

        economy has been introduced during the last two years but still exchange 

        remains the most important. This exchange is interlinked with the free 

        software community &#150; net artists tend to use free software and net 

        artists that develop software tend to share this with the netart community. 

        Often source code is distributed in extensive friendship/colleague networks 

        or even publicly for download. Software developed by the free software 

        community is often protected by anti commercial licenses, for example 

        by the common GNU, General Public Use license. (<a href="../http://biomatic.org/text.php?id=55"><b>http://biomatic.org/text.php?id=55</b></a>). 

        Net artists dealing with this exchange are concerned about copyright only 

        in the sense that the work stays free/part of the exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>&#145;Preservation&#146; of net art &#150; mission impossible?</h2>

      <p>One important purpose of museums 

        and libraries is the conservation of artefacts. While libraries conserve 

        serially produced artefacts, art museums often work with unique artefacts 

        and artefacts that have very few copies. In order to conserve unique artefacts, 

        a tradition of selection is used, as well as an ideology that defends 

        singling out some artefacts as more important than others. We cannot collect 

        everything - if only for practical and economic reasons. Institutions 

        that collect serially produced artefacts can afford a greater breadth 

        and a less exclusive ideology. </p>

      <p>The number of duplicates is seldom 

        relevant in net art. Firstly, a duplicate can be distributed to its entire 

        audience through the Internet. Secondly, duplicates can really be produced, 

        and 'copies' can replace 'originals'. Technically it is possible to conserve 

        all net art - depending on which conservation methods one chooses to use. 

        However, the collection of digital information does not require less conservation 

        technical expertise than the collection of artefacts. Still, this is presumably 

        not sufficient to defend an exclusive conservation ideology similar to 

        the one to which art museums traditionally adhere. </p>

      <p>The tradition of conserving a selection 

        of artefacts requires that we during our own time can see what is important 

        in our time - and especially what will be important for the future. This 

        is a quite arrogant idea. Perhaps future historians will focus on different 

        tendencies in our time, depending on their own ideological framework. 

        We know precious little about the ideology and culture of the future. 

        Presumably, we will do our descendants a favour by trying to document 

        our own time as broadly as possible.</p>

      <p>As a starting point, the collection 

        of net art should be modelled on literature rather than the visual arts. 

        In Denmark for example, the National Library would perhaps be a more relevant 

        collector of Net art than the National Gallery. However, one has to bear 

        in mind that the National Gallery and its relations are active in the 

        artistic discourse in a completely different way from the National Library. 

        Do we perhaps need the National Gallery as a guide to net art and as an 

        institution that can pick out quality?</p>

      <h2>Net art and the museums</h2>

      <p>In a number of different ways, 

        net art can be understood through an art institutional discourse, yet 

        this does not mean that one can or should unproblematically and uncritically 

        integrate net art into the institution. Net art is first and foremost 

        a part of the context of the Internet. Therefore it is problematic when 

        net art is exhibited in a museum, gallery, or on a museum's website, without 

        the individual institution specifically relating to the artistic idioms 

        of the Internet and drawing upon the discourse on the Internet/technology 

        as part of the context of the artwork. Most often a museum&#146;s approach 

        to net art is to view net art merely as the cultural heritage of tomorrow. 

        Which of course is true! Yet net art cannot be fixed in time.</p>

      <p>Although net art to a certain degree 

        is dependent on an institutional framework, it is at the same time clear 

        that the established art institution so far has not been capable of fulfilling 

        this function. Works of net art cannot be institutionalised as autonomous 

        art objects isolated from the context of the Internet, because they relate 

        to the artistic idioms and discourse of the Internet. It is dynamic art, 

        the significance of which arises out of the encounter between the artwork, 

        the audience, and the context.</p>

      <p>If one adds the institutional criticism by net art to the sluggishness 

        of art institutions, it is not surprising that net art has developed its 

        own institutions. In this context, one can point to private 'net art institutions' 

        such as Rhizome in USA (<a href="../http://rhizome.org/fresh/">http://rhizome.org/fresh/</a>), 

        ArtNet in Norway (<a href="../http://kunst.kulturnett.no/artikkel.php?navn=artnet">http://kunst.kulturnett.no/artikkel.php?navn=artnet</a>), 

        and Artnode (<a href="../http://www.artnode.dk/">http://www.artnode.dk/</a>) 

        in Denmark, as well as mailing lists such as nettime, which has grown 

        on the Internet, as important disseminators of net art, because they support 

        dialogue with and about net art and the Internet. Unlike the established 

        art institution, these independent institutions are all a product of the 

        Internet focused on net art and the impact of the Internet on cultural 

        and societal development.</p>

      <p>Virtual institutions such as Rhizome, 

        ArtNet Norway, and Artnode Denmark purposefully incorporate the Internet 

        in their cultural dissemination, because they are able to create an environment 

        around the net art in which interested people can contribute to the discussion 

        and exchange knowledge, and in this way participate in building and developing 

        a network. Unlike the isolating framework of the art institution, the 

        framework of the virtual institution can be characterized as the network 

        that arise around net art. In other words, the Internet is not just an 

        empty distribution and dissemination channel for net art. Instead, the 

        Internet is of crucial importance for the art experience that is being 

        disseminated, because the Internet is the context and reference point 

        of both the virtual institutions and the works of art.</p>

      <p>The task of museums is to conserve and disseminate works of art, but 

        this task implies taking artworks out of their original context and isolating 

        them as testimonies of times past, which is a problem for Internet art, 

        in which the context is such an integral part of the artworks. In this regard, net art's own institutions contribute 

        with a framework that is founded on the discourse on net art and the Internet. 

        What is lacking then is the systematic collection and preserving for future 

        dissemination and documentation, even if organizations such as ArtNet 

        Norway, Artnode Denmark and Rhizome are striving at archiving the works, 

        they present.</p>

      <p>By focusing on the role of the 

        established art institution in relation to net art, a project like n2art 

        was bringing an essential discussion into the public debate. This is a 

        discussion that not only has a practical aspect, but also an ideological 

        aspect, which forces us to take a critical view of the art institution.</p>

      <h2>The institutions of net art</h2>

      <p>While painters and writers often are dependent on galleries and publishers 

        to distribute their work, net art is independent of these institutions. 

        One can distribute art on the entire Internet without recognition from 

        a single living soul. Almost. And net artists use increasingly advanced 

        computers to produce and distribute their work.  Net art is a relatively 

        new field, but specialized institutions for dissemination and discussion 

        have already appeared.</p>

      <h3>Socially-based link selections</h3>

      <p>Many selections of links to net art are based on a relation to a particular 

        social environment. Typically, the project overviews located at media 

        labs that are operated by artists are produced by their own users. While 

        these link selections emphasize the community of the social environment 

        from which they originate, they also contribute to obscuring the artists 

        who are not connected to the media centre. These link selections are not 

        an expression of an evaluation of what is interesting and what is less 

        interesting. Therefore one cannot criticize them from an artistic point 

        of view, and they have a passive function in the art discourse. Example: 

        Atelier Nord (<a href="../http://anart.no/index.html">http://anart.no/index.html</a>)</p>

      <h3>Personal link selections</h3>

      <p>Most Internet sites, independent of their genre, feature a selection 

        of links. Most lists of links of this kind are based on personal preferences 

        and have been more or less haphazardly put together. These link selections 

        often do not distinguish between what is art and what is not art, and 

        contribute to maintaining the unity of net art with other types of Internet 

        culture. These kinds of selections are seldom put into a critical context 

        and remain difficult, if not impossible, to criticize. All criticism can 

        be repudiated with reference to personal preferences. Example: John Hopkin&#146;s 

        site (<a href="../http://neoscenes.net/">http://neoscenes.net/</a>)</p>

      <h3>Liberally moderated link selections/guides</h3>

      <p class=MsoBodyText>Unmoderated link selections are related to guides such 

        as Yahoo and Alta Vista. They contain a large selection of links with 

        a minimum amount of descriptive or contextualizing text. Such sites have 

        as their purpose to map the field of net art in the way it sees itself, 

        but do not attempt actual evaluation of quality. Such unmoderated collections 

        contribute to describing the field and thereby establish important distinctions 

        between 'us' and 'them'. They can be criticized on a fundamental and not 

        particularly interesting level. Examples: VeryBusy (<a href="../http://verybusy.org/">http://verybusy.org</a>) 

        and Netartmuseum (<a href="../http://netartmuseum.org/">http://netartmuseum.org</a>)</p>

      <h3>Moderated electronic discussion forums</h3>

      <p>Electronic discussion forums are comparable to critical journals, as 

        for example the journal NU on visual arts. These forums are the most authoritative 

        in the field of net art. Whatever they discuss and focus on is of great 

        importance for a broad environment, and typically they have an influence 

        on the net art environment. A text describing a work of art that is written 

        by a critic has a greater chance of being distributed than a single announcement 

        by the artist. Hence, we see that critics are active in the distribution 

        as an external institution on which the artist becomes dependent. These 

        forums are based on voluntary contributions by subscribers. We can thus 

        hardly criticize those who operate these forums for not dealing with a 

        particular project or field. Their focus is the sum of whatever their 

        contributors are focusing on. The responsibility for maintaining an overview 

        of the discourse has been destroyed. We revert to a situation based on 

        the personal evaluation by individual contributors. Examples: Rhizome 

        (<a href="../http://rhizome.org/">http://rhizome.org</a>), Nettime (<a href="../http://nettime.org/">http://nettime.org</a>), 

        Recode (<a

href="../http://systemx.autonomous.org/recode/">http://systemx.autonomous.org/recode/</a>).</p>

      <h3>Unmoderated mailing lists and open networks</h3>

      <p>Unmoderated mailing lists and open networks are the most typical representatives 

        of something both radically different and specific to the Internet. Through 

        the use of such forums, a contributor can freely distribute materials 

        to several thousand recipients. These kinds of forums are invaluable as 

        the blood veins of net art. For someone who is not entirely familiar with 

        the Internet and net art, this undergrowth of networks can be difficult 

        to navigate through. It requires a great deal of time and some previous 

        knowledge to gain full use of them. Examples: mailings lists: Rhizome_Raw 

        and 7-11 (<a href="../http://7-11.org/">http://7-11.org</a>), as well as Syndicate 

        (<a href="../http://colossus.v2.nl/syndicate/">http://colossus.v2.nl/syndicate/</a>)and 

        Nice (<a href="../http://nice.x-i.nu/">http://nice.x-i.nu/</a>)</p>

      <h3>Collections curated in the net art environment</h3>

      <p>Net artists have for years chosen to display a selection of links to 

        their audiences, and the word 'curate' has been used about this process. 

        This curating has played an important role in the development of the self 

        awareness of the net art environment. Curators are obliged to make professional 

        choices. Such selections can therefore be criticized, and the criticism 

        cannot be repudiated on the grounds that the selection is based on a social 

        environment or personal preferences. Such selections are a part of the 

        discourse, and are probably often used as reference points, but do not 

        have greater influence on net art than the flood of information on mailing 

        lists and open networks. Example: n2art (<a href="../http://n2art.nu/">http://n2art.nu</a>)</p>

      <h3>Collections curated by offline art institutions</h3>

      <p>Paradoxically, institutions lacking in competence often have the greatest 

        authority among the general public when it comes to identifying interesting 

        net art. The reference of a museum to net art can be based on, and be 

        criticized for, well-established models of art. However, the problem is 

        that the employees of the institution view net art based on these established 

        models, while net artists often use completely different points of reference. 

        The museum makes the framework for net art, not just practically, but 

        also conceptually. It is not uncommon for museums to ask curators working 

        with traditional art to put together an exhibition of net art. The curators 

        choose traditional artists who have created a net artwork, or ask them 

        to create a net artwork for the first time. In this way, presentations 

        are made that may be 'innovative' in traditional art, but which are not 

        seen as relevant on the Internet. Hence, we have a situation in which 

        an audience is presented with net art that is not seen as representative 

        among net artists themselves. Example: Whitney Museum of American Art 

        (<a href="../http://www.whitney.org/exhibition/2kb/internet.html">http://www.whitney.org/exhibition/2kb/internet.html</a>)</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p>In this paper, I have argued that 

        museums do not have a natural role in the distribution of net art, that 

        the conservation tradition and expertise of museums do not make them suited 

        for creating historical collections of net art without undergoing major 

        upgrading, and that older art institutions have shown a superficial understanding 

        of net art. Another point is that relevant institutions already have established 

        themselves on the Internet. Adaptations of net art to the traditions of 

        museums would be inappropriately conservational - we would risk that the 

        special experience enjoyed by net art would be lost. </p>

      <p>Although net art does not need 

        museums, one can still see how museums of contemporary art need net art. 

        Public museums of contemporary art are meant to cover the whole field 

        of contemporary art, and therefore they must necessarily also cover net 

        art. If museums have to take net art seriously, they have to start with 

        the already established competencies and viable forums outside the museums. 

        Museums that wish to cover net art should join these forums. For the sake 

        of the reputation of museums in the net art environment, it is essential 

        that they do not appear to be parasites or lusers (a term used in hacker 

        environments about people who merely use - and do not contribute to - 

        the development of open programs) eg. mere users of net art who just download 

        the resulting works of art without contributing to their structural strengthening 

        and the more process-oriented development.</p>

      <p>The popular understanding of new media identifies 

        it with the use of a computer for circulation and exhibition, rather than 

        production. If we are to understand the effects of computerization on 

        culture as a whole, this understanding is almost certainly too limiting. 

        It would be logical to expect cultural forms and forms of dissemination 

        of cultural heritage on the internet to eventually adopt the conventions 

        and experience of net art. There is no reason to privilege the computer 

        as a machine for the exhibition and distribution of media over the computer 

        as a tool for media production or as a media storage device. All have 

        the same potential to change existing cultural languages. And all have 

        the same potential to leave culture as it is. Even if the latter is highly 

        unlikely!</p>
