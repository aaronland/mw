      <p class=AbstractTitle>Abstract</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>The Canadian Museum of Civilization and the National 

        Research Council of Canada collaborated on the production of Inuit 3D, 

        one of six inaugural Virtual Museum of Canada exhibitions launched in 

        April 2001. Inuit 3D is an interactive exhibition in which visitors navigate 

        through three exhibition halls and interactively examine twelve 3D models 

        of objects from the Museum&#146;s collection.  Introductory videos are 

        presented at the entrance to each room. Pop-up text panels provide information 

        on the objects, as well as on Inuit artists and the Canadian North.  To 

        produce Inuit 3D, three technologies developed for Web applications - 

        VRML, 3D Scanning and QuickTime - were used.  While these technologies 

        enable museums to produce interactive Web exhibitions, a number of significant 

        technical and Web design issues must be considered.  The objective of 

        this paper is to present an overview of Inuit 3D and to discuss technical 

        and Web issues encountered.</p>

      <p class=AbstractText>Keywords: Web exhibition, virtual museum, 3D digital

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>In April 2001, the Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN) launched 

        the new Virtual Museum of Canada (VMC) (<a

href="../http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/" target="_blank">http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/</a>) 

        with six inaugural exhibitions.  Inuit 3D was one of the exhibitions and 

        was produced by the Canadian Museum of Civilization (CMC) (<a href="../http://www.civilization.ca/" target="_blank">http://www.civilization.ca/</a>) 

        in collaboration with the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) (<a

href="../http://www.vit.iit.nrc.ca/" target="_blank">http://www.vit.iit.nrc.ca/</a>).  

        While NRC coordinated the technological aspects, CMC provided the content<span class=MsoCommentReference>.</span></p>

      <p>During the planning stages for the VMC, CHIN conducted a survey of focus 

        groups with an interest in museums and culture across Canada (Nadeau, 

        2000). One of the results noted in the report was:</p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>In each session, a portion of the participants had clear 

        expectations of a three-dimensional tour of one or many museums. Some 

        of these participants clearly explained how the Web site user would be 

        able to control their path through a museum, allowing them to pivot and 

        view any section of the museum and objects in the museum in 3-D.</p>

      <p>Inuit 3D is an interactive exhibition which seeks to accomplish this 

        objective. Visitors can navigate through three exhibition rooms - Palaeo-Eskimo, 

        Inuit History and Inuit Art &#150; in the virtual museum and interactively 

        examine twelve 3D digital models of objects from the Museum&#146;s collection 

        (Figure 1). Introductory videos are presented at the entrance to each 

        room. Pop-up text panels provide layers of information on the objects, 

        as well as on Inuit artists and the Canadian North.  Also included are 

        historic photographs of the Arctic from the 1913-16 Canadian Arctic Expedition, 

        as well as information and contemporary photographs on prints and the 

        print making process. </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 1: (a) View of the Inuit 3D Virtual Exhibition 

        Hall showing the entrance and the three exhibition rooms. Entering on 

        the left, visitors encounter the Palaeo-Eskimos, move to the historic 

        post-contact Inuit History period (center) and conclude with the Inuit 

        today (right). The 3D object models are mounted on pedestals and historic 

        photographs of the Arctic and contemporary prints are mounted on the walls. 

        The entrance/exit hall is shown in (b) including the navigation location 

        indicator in the lower left corner.</p>

      <p>To complement traditional exhibitions, interactive 3D Web exhibitions 

        offer museums the opportunity of presenting rich virtual exhibitions which 

        contain accurate or <i>high fidelity</i> three-dimensional digital models 

        of objects together with layers of information and related 2D video and 

        photographic content.  Virtual exhibitions also have the potential of 

        reaching much larger audiences and of lasting longer than traditional 

        exhibitions.  They can be easily updated and, once the primary exhibition 

        closes, form part of a widely available archival record.</p>

      <p>However, an interactive virtual Web exhibition requires a careful selection 

        and integration of 2D, 3D and audio-visual Web application tools and related 

        plug-ins. Constraints such as bandwidth, browser differences, file sizes, 

        plug-in requirements and 3D model compression lurk half-submerged like 

        alligators in a swamp, ready to take a bite out of plans to create virtual 

        exhibitions that are only a few bricks short of looking like the real 

        thing.  One must consider trade-offs between image quality and download 

        time, the &#147;download tolerance&#148; of viewers and whether the goal 

        of the exhibition is to provide entertainment, edutainment or an educational 

        experience.</p>

      <p>In addressing these issues, we encountered a number of technological 

        and end-user factors which, in instances, dictated imperfect solutions.  

        Despite these factors, Inuit 3D allows Web visitors to be able to control 

        their path through a museum, allowing them to pivot and view any section 

        of the museum and objects in the museum in 3-D. The purpose of this paper 

        is to present an overview of the production of Inuit 3D and to discuss 

        the technical and Web issues encountered.</p>

      <h1>Inuit 3D Exhibition Theme and Background</h1>

      <p>The theme for Inuit 3D evolved from a nine-minute 3D Virtualized Reality 

        theatre production on Inuit art CMC presented during the exhibition <i>Iqqaipaa: 

        Celebrating Inuit Art, 1948-1970</i> in 1999.  This program was presented 

        in CMC&#146;s 25-seat 3D VR Theatre (MacDonald et al, 1999).  It featured 

        high-resolution 3D images of a selection of Inuit sculpture from the Palaeo-Eskimo 

        (700 BC) period up to the 1970&#146;s projected in stereo on a 10&#146; 

        x 15&#146; screen.  It also included background Arctic visuals and narration 

        on Inuit art and Arctic history.</p>

      <p>The VMC exhibition presented the opportunity of re-purposing and adapting 

        the 3D VR Theatre production content to a Web medium, which offered the 

        potential of reaching a much wider audience. In addition, more layers 

        of information on the objects, Inuit history and the Arctic could be included 

        than was possible in the Theatre production.</p>

      <h1>Technical Platform</h1>

      <p>A requirement for VMC exhibitions is that they are fully functional in 

        Canada&#146;s official languages (French and English) using current versions 

        of common browsers such as Netscape and Internet Explorer and that they 

        run on both PC and Mac systems. Plug-ins must be platform independent 

        and supported by the above browsers. Consistent with professional level 

        Web productions, several standard technical requirements including credit 

        and copyright information, Web accessibility requirements for people with 

        disabilities and specifications on multimedia formats are also required 

        (<a

href="../http://www.chin.gc.ca/Vmc/e_update.html" target="_blank">http://www.chin.gc.ca/Vmc/e_update.html</a>). 

      </p>

      <p>In selecting the platform, we initially considered using several proprietary 

        software packages. Some provided good pop-up window graphics for interactive 

        object display and examination but did not allow an immersive museum. 

        With others, the opposite was true.   </p>

      <p>Consequently, for Inuit 3D, we used VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language)<b> 

        </b>as the language platform. VRML is an ISO Standard (14772-1:1997) open 

        language and is versatile, fully programmable and widely used for <b>&quot;</b>Web 

        3D&quot; applications (<span class=MsoHyperlink><a href="../http://www.web3d.org/" target="_blank">http://www.web3d.org</a></span>). 

        It allows users to navigate through a scene or &quot;virtual world,&quot; 

        such as a museum, and to interactively examine 3D objects.  </p>

      <p>After testing several common VRML browsers, Cosmo Player was found to 

        provide the best viewing of the exhibition and is recommended as the VRML 

        plug-in viewer (<span class=MsoHyperlink><a href="../http://computerassociates.com/cosmo/html/player.htm" target="_blank">http://computerassociates.com/cosmo/html/player.htm</a></span>).  

        QuickTime is required to view the video segments (<span class=MsoHyperlink><a href="../http://www.apple.com/quicktime/" target="_blank">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/</a></span>). 

        Instructions for downloading and installing both plug-ins are included 

        on the site.</p>

      <p>In order for viewers to experience all the interactive features in the 

        exhibition, for PC users a Pentium with 32 MB of RAM, a 3D hardware-accelerated 

        graphics card with 8 MB of memory and a sound card was recommended as 

        the minimum system. For Mac users, a G3 system  running OS8, with 48MB 

        of memory allocated to Netscape<b> </b>(the only browser which supports 

        Cosmo Player on the Mac) was recommended as the minimum system. In addition, 

        it was recommended that the Internet connection should have at least a 

        56 Kbaud dial-up phone connection. For best viewing, a screen resolution 

        of 1024 x 768 pixels was recommended.</p>

      <h1>Content Creation and Web Integration</h1>

      <p>To create the content for Inuit 3D, it was necessary to build a <i>Virtual 

        Exhibition Hall,</i>  to reformat the 3D models and audio-visual content 

        from the 3D VR theatre production into VRML models and QuickTime movies 

        suitable for Web presentation, and to fuse them into a seamless exhibition.  

        As discussed above, we had to make trade-offs among the visual quality 

        of rendered models, file size and download times.  An important factor, 

        we felt, was the <i>fidelity</i> to the original objects of the 3D models 

        in the exhibition.  In this regard, at the expense of longer download 

        times, we chose to use larger file size 3D models.  To compensate, we 

        used a smaller model than planned for the Virtual Exhibition Hall.  We 

        also tested various QuickTime movie file sizes to determine which file 

        and window size would present appropriate audio/visual fidelity. </p>

      <h1>Virtual Exhibition Hall </h1>

      <p>For the exhibition, we wanted to create a virtual space that evoked the 

        feeling of being in a museum or art gallery. That meant high ceilings, 

        neutral walls, lots of circulation space for visitors and a sense that 

        one could contemplate or reflect here. After all, that is what one does 

        in museums - one muses.</p>

      <p>During a team discussion on the design of the virtual space for Inuit 

        3D, where some talked about a virtual museum and others about a virtual 

        gallery space, the idea of a hybrid combination emerged.  Generally, in 

        galleries, objects stand largely on their own merits. The labels are minimal, 

        the artworks are exhibited with lots of space between them, and there 

        is minimal use of colour and texture in the architectural surround. </p>

      <p>Museums, however, tend to a polar opposite. Artifacts are enveloped in 

        colour, texture and, sometimes, acres of text. Orientation spaces, historical 

        photographs, drawings, models, as well as A/V displays are often included. 

        Our idea was to try to get the best of both worlds, to place the objects 

        in a virtual setting reminiscent of a contemplative gallery situation 

        while, at the same time, providing the wealth of contextualization and 

        information-provision associated with a museum.  Thus the idea of the 

        creation of a hybrid museum/gallery <i>Virtual Exhibition Hall</i> emerged.</p>

      <p>For the Virtual Exhibition Hall a simple or &#147;light&#148; 500 KB 

        3D model was created.  As an architectural space, it consists of three 

        thematically linked exhibition rooms (Figure 1) arranged in a circular 

        chronological layout that has the look and feel of gallery space. Neutral 

        walls, high ceilings, overhead lighting, floor texture, minimal signage, 

        display plinths are suggestive visual cues to facilitate navigation.  

        The doors were made larger in scale than normal doors to present a wider-angle 

        view of what lies ahead in the next room</p>

      <p>The model consists of only a few dozen primitive shapes and a few small 

        textures which are repeated to create the floor, walls, display cases, 

        doors and ceiling. In addition, images of photographs and prints were 

        included to decorate the walls (Figure 2).  To assist navigation, invisible 

        &#147;bumpers&#148; were added around doors, corners and display cases 

        to help point users in the right direction. The model was created directly 

        in a text editor using the easily programmable and well-documented VRML 

        language.</p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 2:  (a) View of the Palaeo-Eskimo hall. The model 

        was kept simple using a few primitive shapes and small textures to create. 

        &#147;Bilboard&#148; images of the small objects were placed in individual 

        display cases and images of arctic photographs and prints were added to 

        the walls. Clicking on an object in a display case (b) opens two new pop-up 

        windows (c). The left pop-up window contains the 3D VRML model of the 

        object, which can be interactively examined.  The right pop-up window 

        contains information on the object as well as links to related information 

        on other sites. </p>

      <p>Visitors can use one of three methods to navigate through the exhibition.  

        For complete interactive navigation, a mouse or the directional arrow 

        signs on their keyboard can be used.  In addition, a dropdown viewpoint 

        list can be used to guide visitors to a series of fixed viewpoints.  A 

        navigation location indicator is always visible in the lower left corner 

        to remind visitors of their location. </p>

      <p>One design feature, which led to considerable discussion, concerned the 

        small size of the objects. The Palaeo-Eskimo objects, such as the 2 x 

        3.5 cm Tayara Maskette, are quite small and, in relation to the size of 

        the Hall, were difficult to see from a distance. </p>

      <p>Although it was technically feasible to graphically enlarge them, we 

        felt it essential to present them in their true scale. To address this, 

        similar to a traditional museum exhibition, display case pedestals were 

        used to showcase the objects and draw the visitors&#146; attention to 

        them. Two-dimensional VRML format &#147;billboard&#148; images of the 

        objects are mounted on the pedestals. These images rotate about their 

        vertical axis to face the viewer and ensure they are always visible.</p>

      <p>The object images contain a hypertext link to the 3D model file. Clicking 

        on an image downloads two pop-up windows; one contains the interactive 

        3D VRML image while the other contains a 2D image and information on the 

        object (Figure 2b and 2c). Similarly, clicking on the images of Arctic 

        historic photographs and contemporary prints mounted on the walls opens 

        pop-up windows which contain information on the images. This linkage of 

        actions occurring in the three-dimensional space with effects in the encapsulating 

        browser serves to integrate the two technologies, exploiting the advantages 

        of each in support of specific tasks. (The total file size of the Virtual 

        Exhibition Hall complete with wall images is 500 KB). </p>

      <h1>3D Model Creation</h1>

      <p>Within the constraints of a Web exhibition, one primary objective was 

        to display 3D models of the objects which represented the shape, subtle 

        color variations, material characteristics (ivory, bone, stone, metal) 

        and features such as tool mark details as closely as possible to the actual 

        object. In short, the <i>fidelity</i> of the 3D models to the actual objects 

        was a priority.</p>

      <p>The 12 Palaeo-Eskimo and Inuit objects in the exhibition had previously 

        been scanned along with a lager suite of objects at CMC in 1997 using 

        a High Resolution Color Laser Scanner (Figure 3) developed by NRC and 

        manufactured by Hymarc Ltd. </p>

      <p align="center"><img src="Corcoran_Fig3.jpg" width="400" height="262"> 

      </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption>Figure 3: The NRC High Resolution Color Laser scanner. 

        This system scans a low power white laser light spot (shown as a line 

        in this photo due to time exposure effect) on an object and records the 

        xyz shape coordinates as well as the rgb color values in high resolution 

        and in perfect registration.  This technology is currently licensed to 

        Airus3D (<a href="../http://www.arius3d.com/" target="_blank">www.arius3d.com</a>). 

      </p>

      <p>A unique feature of this technology is that the scanner digitizes the 

        color and shape details of objects in high-resolution and in perfect registration 

        (Baribeau et al, 1996).  This enables the rendering of very accurate &#147;high 

        fidelity&#148; 3D models for interactive display on high-end information 

        kiosks or in 3D VR Theatres within a museum or at a remote site connected 

        with high-speed communications systems (Livingstone et al, 1997).</p>

      <p>The software (PolyWorks <sup>TM</sup> <a

href="../http://www.innovmetric.com/" target="_blank">www.innovmetric.com</a>) can 

        be used to prepare lower resolution models, which retain excellent object-model 

        fidelity for Web display. In compressing the high-resolution models, the 

        software computes a texture mapped compressed triangular mesh. The algorithm 

        for the automatic generation of the texture map is coupled to the mesh 

        vertex removal compression. When the tessellated texture map is applied 

        to the compressed model, it generates a 3D appearance that approximates 

        the appearance of the full resolution colored model (Figure 3).</p>

      <p><img src="Corcoran_Fig4a.jpg" width="216" height="124"><img src="Corcoran_Fig4c.jpg" width="216" height="124"><img src="Corcoran_Fig4b.jpg" width="216" height="123"><img src="Corcoran_Fig4d.jpg" width="216" height="123"><br>

        <span class="MsoCaption">Figure 4:  The upper and lower images of the 

        Flying Bear illustrate the high-resolution model (top and bottom left) 

        while those on the right illustrate the compressed model used in Inuit 

        3D.  </span></p>

      <p>The high-resolution model contains 443,628 polygons of shape information 

        (lower right) in an 11.8 MB file. This model is the archival quality model 

        used for research applications and for preparing lower resolution models 

        for other applications.  The compressed model contains 1000 polygons of 

        shape detail (lower right) in a 1.2 K file.  When the 512 x 512 texture 

        map is applied to the compressed model, it generates a 3D appearance that 

        approximates the appearance of the full resolution colored model (top 

        left). Thus a close approximation to the fidelity of the high-resolution 

        model is retained in the 3D model used for Web applications.</p>

      <p>To select the appropriate models in terms of fidelity and size for use 

        in Inuit 3D, a range of model sizes were prepared for evaluation. The 

        models ranged in size from 3500 to 1000 polygons of shape information 

        with texture maps of 512x512 pixels to 256x256 pixels.  Significantly, 

        it was decided to use a 1000 polygon model with a 512x512 texture map, 

        instead of the smaller 256x256 texture map to represent the models. Although 

        the higher resolution texture map meant a longer download time for each 

        model, it clearly enabled the display of higher fidelity models in the 

        exhibition.</p>

      <p>Consequently, to prepare the models, each of the original 12 high-resolution 

        files &#150; which typically contained 500,000 &#150; 700,000 polygons 

        of shape information in a 12 - 15 MB file &#150; was compressed to a 1000 

        polygon &#150; 512x512 texture map model and was saved as 1.2K zipped 

        VRML (WRL) file. In total, the file size of all 12 models is 1.65 MB.</p>

      <p>As noted above, the object images in the Exhibition Hall have an embedded 

        hypertext link to their respective VRML 3D model files. Clicking on the 

        object images downloads the VRML 3D object file, which appears in a smaller 

        secondary pop-up window on the top left of the users' screen. Users can 

        interactively rotate the object to view it from all angles &#150; similar 

        to the walk around display case experience one has in a real setting. 

      </p>

      <p>In addition to the window containing the VRML model, a second pop-up 

        window appears on the upper right of the users' screen. This window contains 

        textual information regarding the object's discovery or creation, and 

        further explanatory material including links to additional information 

        on the CMC site. </p>

      <p>Another important factor to note is that due to the archival quality 

        of the original high-resolution files, as faster Internet connections 

        become available in the future, Inuit 3D can be readily upgraded.  Higher 

        resolution models, which have even greater fidelity to the object, can 

        quickly be substituted for the 1000 polygon models used in the launch.</p>

      <h1>QuickTime Videos</h1>

      <p>Consistent with museum tradition, there is an orientation video at the 

        entrance to each room to provide information on Palaeo-Eskimo and Inuit 

        history as well as on the Arctic. </p>

      <p class=MsoCaption><img src="Corcoran_Fig5.jpg" width="288" height="190"><br>

        Figure 5: Introductory QuickTime videos are presented at the entrance 

        to each Exhibition Hall. Clicking on the movie projector symbol downloads 

        the QuickTime video file and opens a pop-up player window in the upper 

        right side of the screen. </p>

      <p>After a review of the various Internet audio/visual players available, 

        we selected QuickTime Player for the videos. QuickTime versions are readily 

        available and easily installed on all Windows and Macintosh operating 

        systems &#150; particularly the older versions that are still widely used. 

        QuickTime Player also enables streaming video presentations (i.e. the 

        users are able to listen and view the video content while the video is 

        being downloaded) from a 56 KBaud or higher dial-up phone connection. 

        In addition, QuickTime editing tools are readily available, easy to use, 

        and allow access to many compression techniques.</p>

      <p>To prepare the videos, three 45-second segments were extracted from the 

        original nine-minute 3D VR Theatre presentation.  As these files were 

        approximately 150 MB in size in uncompressed AVI format, for QuickTime 

        streaming it was necessary to convert them to MOV (QuickTime) format and 

        compress them.  To determine an appropriate file size for compression, 

        a series of smaller files were prepared using Sorenson video compression.  

        After performing tests using modem lines and video stream files and windows 

        of different sizes, we found that a 0.8 MB file size in a 320x240 pixel 

        window offered a satisfactory video in terms of image quality and download 

        time.  Similar to the 3D models, while a smaller file size could have 

        been used with a smaller window &#150; to enable a faster download time 

        &#150; the image quality was not considered satisfactory.  The original 

        audio was compressed using a compression scheme known as QDesign Music 

        2.</p>

      <p>To view the videos, visitors click on the movie projector symbol at the 

        entrance to each exhibition room. This causes the video to download and 

        open in a pop-up window in the upper right of the screen.</p>

      <h1>Photographs and Prints</h1>

      <p>In addition to 3D object models and QuickTime videos, imagery (JPG) evocative 

        of the time period is aesthetically hung on the virtual walls. In the 

        earliest time period we see images of geological formations, snowscapes 

        and archaeological remains. The post-contact period is represented through 

        historic photographs taken during the 1913-16 Canadian Arctic Expedition 

        while the modern era features a quartet of splendid Inuit prints. Clicking 

        on these images downloads and opens pop-up windows that provide information 

        on the image as well as additional background information on Inuit artists, 

        the print making process and the Canadian North.  A bibliography including 

        information on Inuit terminology is also included. </p>

      <h2>Navigation and Plug-in Instructions</h2>

      <p>To assist viewers in installing the required plug-ins and in navigating 

        through the exhibition, detailed instructions on each, including instructional 

        photographs, printable instructions and links to external help files were 

        provided.  These instructions also included information on download times 

        based on a 56 Kbaud modem.</p>

      <h2>Download Time Information</h2>

      <p>During the preparation of the exhibition, we undertook download tests 

        using different systems connected to T1 lines as well as cable network 

        modems and standard to 56 and 28.8 Kbaud modems connected to telephone 

        lines.  From these tests, using a 28.8 K baud line, it typically required 

        15 minutes to download Cosmo Player and approximately 20 minutes for QuickTime 

        (if QuickTime was not previously installed).  For the exhibition itself, 

        it took approximately 2 minutes to download the complete Virtual Exhibition 

        Hall, 2-3 minutes per 3D VRML model and up to 4 minutes to download a 

        QuickTime movie. </p>

      <p>In contrast, home testers with a cable connection reported a download 

        time of less than 25 seconds for the Virtual Exhibition Hall and around 

        10 seconds each for the 3D VRML models and QuickTime videos.  Those fortunate 

        enough to have a T1 connection found that it took about 7 seconds to download 

        the Exhibition Hall, 3 seconds for the 3D VRML models and 4 seconds for 

        the QuickTime videos. These times are comparable to the time required 

        to download other Internet tools such as a new browser version, games 

        or music files. </p>

      <h2>User-Interface Integration</h2>

      <p>As the exhibit seeks to deliver both textual and graphical information 

        to the user, the design of the Inuit3D Web site as a whole takes into 

        consideration the relative strengths of the technologies available for 

        delivering such information. While 3D graphics are appropriate for displaying 

        sculptures, the available screen &quot;real estate&quot; can be used most 

        efficiently if the standard Web browser is used to display text and other 

        2D material.</p>

      <p>Significantly, the linkage of actions occurring in the three-dimensional 

        space with effects in the encapsulating Web browser (and vice-versa) serves 

        to integrate the two technologies into a seamless user experience: The 

        2D map of Canada's Arctic changes to indicate where the selected 3D artifact 

        was discovered or created. The &quot;language&quot; button below the virtual 

        museum itself enables users to select whether actions in the 3D museum 

        will cause information to be displayed in English or French.</p>

      <p>The location of these secondary display and control features is a logical 

        extension of their function. As they pertain to the virtual museum, but 

        are not part of the exhibit itself, their placement outside of the virtual 

        space enables the exhibit to remain visually uncluttered.</p>

      <h2>Viewer Feedback</h2>

      <p>The site contains a Feedback link which enables viewers to send comments 

        back to the VMC. CHIN provided the following summary: </p>

      <p class=BlockQuote>Classy, impressive, excellent and &#147;really cool&#148; 

        represent some of the comments received frequently from visitors to <i>Inuit 

        3D</i>. Although some comments pertained to the exhibit&#146;s advanced 

        technological requirements, links and instructions to access all the required 

        components are provided. The majority of visitors appreciated both the 

        content and the site&#146;s superior quality and professionalism, and 

        many who provided feedback also commented on the value of the resources 

        provided by <i>Inuit 3D</i>.</p>

      <h1>Conclusions</h1>

      <p>As noted in the Introduction, during the VMC planning consultations it 

        was noted that &#147;a portion of the participants had clear expectations 

        of a three-dimensional tour of one or many museums&#148; and that &#147;some 

        of these participants clearly explained how the Web site users would be 

        able to control their path through a museum, allowing them to pivot and 

        view any section of the museum and objects in the museum in 3-D&#148;.  

        In creating, Inuit 3D, we attempted to do just that. </p>

      <p>Despite early predictions, 3D technology has, for a variety of reasons, 

        remained on the fringes of the Web. One of the reasons for this is a lack 

        of compelling content. We hope that museum exhibitions such as Inuit 3D 

        will help address this issue. Another reason relates to the need to install 

        plug-ins and to download times.  Web researchers are currently working 

        on new platform-independent Java-based 3D viewers which promise to cancel  

        the need to install plug-ins. At the same time, faster Internet connection 

        systems are rapidly and widely becoming available.  When these become 

        available, 3D virtual museum exhibitions such as this will become much 

        more viable. </p>

      <p>As noted above, virtual exhibitions offer museums a great way to complement 

        a real exhibition, increasing its scope and impact. With a supplementary 

        virtual exhibition, reserve collections can be accessed (most major museums, 

        CMC included, have the exhibition space to display only 3-5% of their 

        collections). It allows an enriched presentation style such as scaling 

        up the design on a cylinder seal so that it can be truly seen and appreciated 

        and adding layers of information. Moreover, when the traditional exhibition 

        closes and the objects go back in storage, the virtual exhibition remains 

        as an archival record which is widely available and readily updated.</p>

      <p>In the future, virtual exhibitions may also offer museums advantages 

        over those of a &#147;real&#148; exhibition. For example, a curator can 

        develop a dream exhibition, which one could never hope to pull together 

        in the real world. Objects scattered around the globe, some too fragile 

        to travel, some too expensive to borrow, some committed to other exhibitions 

        or loans for research, can be drawn together into a virtual exhibition. 

        There is no need to pay for an accompanying curator, exhibition preparators 

        or insurance premiums. And if you don&#146;t like the exhibition flow, 

        the layout of the galleries, the size or colour of the labels or even 

        the lighting, alternatives lie just a mouse click or two away. It is this 

        ability to create a virtual exhibition, to juxtapose on the screen objects 

        from both sides of the Atlantic, that would make applications such as 

        this of enduring interest to curators.</p>
